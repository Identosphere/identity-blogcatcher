Needless to say, this bot promises to be able to examine hundreds of charts in a nanosecond, as well as detect and execute tradable patterns. It claims to have the best accuracy and success rate, implying that this robot makes winning trades in 90% of its deals.</p>



<p>One of the most crucial aspects is that the brokers available on this platform provide leverage of 1:1000. This means that the transactions completed by this robot are multiplied 1000 times. As a result, a trader who deposits a minimum of $250 can conduct deals worth up to $250,000. Furthermore, keep in mind that larger leverage outcomes might result in big losses.</p>

 Tips for new traders 



 1. Do not invest all of your money. 



<p>If you are a beginner trader, we recommend starting with a $250 deposit and progressively increasing your investment as you gain experience. Once you’ve settled on a method for saving and developing your passive income, your objective should be to thoroughly understand how everything works and maximise the value of your deposit. You may use this approach to increase a trader’s profits if their investment matures. Starting with a little amount gives you more time to study the trading technique before risking huge quantities of money. You should, however, only trade with money that you are willing to lose.</p>



 2. Take your earnings 



<p>You should receive half of the revenues. You will always have enough of cash on hand. Bitcoin Aussie System claims to have developed smart algorithms that allow it to earn from bitcoin trading indefinitely. By using this approach, traders may preserve their cash and lower their chance of incurring a major loss. This technique safeguards your investments while raising earnings.</p>



 3. Determine which currency/crypto combos are lucrative. 



<p>The internet is now awash with information regarding automatic trading robots. Registered users may access Bitcoin Aussie System demo and live trading tools. Traders can examine the market for signs of predicted behaviour. Before engaging in any transactions, traders should become acquainted with the trading strategies that are employed in order to optimise earnings and have a more pleasurable trading experience.</p>



 4. Demo Account 



<p>Before engaging in actual trading, it is a good idea to familiarise yourself with the interface by practising on a demo account. Using a demo account boosts the possibilities of a trader’s success. A great amount of time and effort is being put into building the Bitcoin Aussie System from the ground up in order to fully harness its possibilities. Traders who are confident in putting in a modest deposit and beginning live trading are urged to do so.</p>

 Quantum Trading Pros and Cons 



 Pros 



 
 <p>No fees charged</p> 



 <p>Quantum AI’s developers claim a 90% success rate</p> 



 <p>Trading bot allows you to take short and long positions</p> 
 



 Cons 



 
 <p>No Quantum AI trading app on mobile</p> 



 <p>We could not verify the claims of the providers</p> 
 



 Is Quantum Trading a Scam? 



<p>As is generally known, every investment and trading tool has some level of risk. Quantum Trading is no different. We always urge consumers to perform their own research before investing due to the apparent inherent trading risks. Before you can begin investing in financial markets, you must first understand the market and its characteristics.</p>



<p>During our testing, we discovered no problems or issues with Quantum Trading. In our opinion, the application is credible, efficient, and trustworthy. The account signup procedure is simple and quick. You may also utilise the demo account functionality to evaluate the trading platform and its features before becoming real. To administer trading accounts, the site utilises registered brokers and account managers.</p>



 What Is Quantum Trading? 



<p>The Quantum AI robot is a computerised trading system that assists bitcoin traders in capitalising on market opportunities. The bot proposes leveraging the trading load to optimise your earnings by automating your trades and aiding you in choosing the optimum entry and exit positions.</p>



<p>According to reports, quantum AI was developed by a group of skilled traders and mathematicians who aim to enable as many traders as possible earn from the market. We sought to discover more about the founders for our Quantum AI evaluation but were unable.</p>



<p>Although many crypto firms operate without the public awareness of their owners and developers, the absence of information about the founders might be a warning sign.</p>



<p>Quantum AI’s purpose is to use the trading load and aid you in generating more money. To do this, the bot uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyse the market and hunt for trends. It then finds the optimal entry and exit points in trading and focuses on increasing your profits.</p>



<p>The designers of Quantum AI say that the bot can help traders make lucrative trades 90% of the time. We were unable to confirm this from additional Quantum AI studies, thus we suggest caution while trading. You don’t want to lose money in the unpredictable bitcoin market.</p>

 How Does Quantum Trading Work? 



<p>Quantium AI demonstrates its functionality by supporting you in the trading of contracts for difference (CFDs). CFDs on bitcoin are derivatives that provide you the right to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a certain price and time. They allow you to trade bitcoin long or short and are essential to the Quantum AI robot’s functionality.</p>



<p>You should be warned, however, that CFD trading may be dangerous. The Quantum AI website emphasises that investors must trade these assets with utmost caution since they are exceedingly risky.</p>



<p>To trade successfully, the Quantum AI Bitcoin robot utilises artificial intelligence and machine learning. The bot, according to the bot, uses these two concepts to parse the market in real-time and analyse trends. After that, the robot looks for the optimal entry and exit sites.</p>



<p>Customers, according to the bot, may programme the trading bot to match their own demands. This is advised since it helps you to get control of your position and reduce possible loss.</p>



<p>According to the bot, it works with licenced brokers that handle transaction execution and management. These brokers play an important part in how Quantum AI works since they help the bot ensure your profitability. We couldn’t find much information on them, however the Quantum AI creators claim that they are approved and regulated.</p>



 Key Features of Quantum Trading Trading Platforms 



 Excellent Trading System 



<p>In today’s market, several bitcoin trading algorithms seek to uncover benefits. In the end, even a tiny advantage over a competitor may be sufficient. The self-proclaimed exceptional artificial intelligence-based trading system of Quantum AI is its competitive edge.</p>



<p>Quantum AI, as an automated trading bot, focuses on market analysis and spotting top trends to help you make money. According to its developers, it has a 90% success rate. We were unable to corroborate this, and we recommend that you exercise care while communicating with this bot.</p>



<p>The platform should be used by both novice and experienced traders, and strong trade management procedures are essential to defend against market downturns. The bitcoin market is incredibly unpredictable, and you don’t want your transaction to fall through the cracks.</p>



 Signup and verification are completed quickly. 



<p>Many cryptocurrency services now need anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) checks before you may use them. These procedures are sometimes lengthy and time-consuming. Quantum AI, on the other hand, does not require all of this.</p>



<p>The bot confirms that you may join up and begin using the service in minutes. Simply provide your name, email address, and phone number to get started.</p>

 Support for Multiple Currencies 



<p>We observed that the bot can trade in three currencies during our Quantum AI research: Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</p>



<p>This adaptability enables investors to diversify their portfolios and open many positions. It isn’t the most adaptable bot, but Quantum AI claims to provide adequate versatility.</p>



<p>While investing, keep in mind to protect yourself from market instability. Only open positions if you are certain of your plan.</p>



 Affordably priced trading tool 



<p>Several Quantum AI reviews have emphasised the platform’s cheap cost. They claim that there are no costs associated with the robot and that all you have to pay is 0.01% of your overall revenues. If this is right, the Quantum AI robot will be one of the least expensive crypto trading bots on the market.</p>



 How to Use Quantum Trading – Step-by-Step Guide 



<p>It is simple to open a trading account with Quantum Trading. We went through the process ourselves, and you’ll be relieved to know that enrolling up is completely free. Right now, we’ll go over the steps to establish a trading account with you.</p>

 Step 2: Make a Deposit 



<p>Making a deposit is a straightforward, secure, and quick procedure. Quantum Trading will require a €250 minimum investment before real trading can commence. This small contribution will be your first investing money. All transactions will be conducted over the internet. You don’t have to worry about your information being stolen or used for fraud or theft since the Quantum Trading platform is safeguarded by SSL encryption.</p>



 Step 3: Monitor Trading Bot 



<p>We were pleasantly delighted by the Quantum Trading demo account option. This is an excellent option for beginners since it allows them to trade in practise mode before participating in live sessions. The best aspect is that no actual money is required for demo trading. It’s only a matter of putting forth the effort.</p>



<p>When you’ve spent enough time with the demo account and are familiar with the platform’s various features, you may begin engaging in live trading. We urge that all consumers trade in demo mode before engaging in live sessions after examining the demo account’s capabilities. It is not only excellent practise, but it also provides you with the experience you will need to succeed in trading. Your personal account manager will help you decide on your trading criteria.</p>



 Quantum Trading vs other Trading Robots 



<p>The minimal first investment is $250. (compared to other platforms with higher deposit requirements)</p>



<p>Simple KYC process (compared to other platforms with massive amounts of information required).</p>



 Can you make money with Quantum Trading? 



<p>We extensively evaluate the most popular trading bots, as previously indicated. Our tests revealed that getting started with Quantum Trading is simple and uncomplicated after you’ve figured out how to browse the site. This is fantastic news, especially for rookie traders who are unfamiliar with trading software.</p>



<p>All you need to get started is a laptop or desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone, as well as an internet connection that is safe. Many internet users choose to manage their accounts from their smartphones. This means they can keep an eye on their trading operations from anywhere on the earth. Before any trading can begin, an upfront deposit is necessary. The good news is that the deposit is reasonably priced.</p>



<p>To get started, a new user simply needs €250. This contribution is then used as seed capital. Quantum Trading charges no registration or membership fees. This is all that a new user requires to get started. If there are any problems, the account managers and customer care staff reply quickly.</p>



 Tips for new traders 



<p>We sought to ensure that the Quantum Trading platform will provide you with profitable chances. One of our primary objectives in developing these trading methods is to guarantee that they deliver true value to clients and are not a scam or a fraud. Many users have claimed substantial profits and commended the trading system’s ease of use.</p>



<p>We examined Quantum Trading’s transaction procedures and discovered that they are as efficient as the official website promises. The cryptocurrency market is famously volatile, which should not be underestimated. You should check your account at least 30 minutes every day to stay up to date on any new updates.</p>



 Put in only the minimal necessities. 



<p>To get started, Quantum Trading requires a €250 minimum commitment. We highly encourage you to make your deposit as low as possible. You may always add more money to your account once you start earning a steady income.</p>



 Reinvest your earnings 



<p>It is usually a good idea to reinvest. This way, you’ll have a higher chance of making more money. You do not have to reinvest all of your money right away; it is preferable to begin with a little amount.</p>



 Seek assistance from experienced investors. 



<p>Both Quantum Trading’s brokers and customer service representatives have extensive expertise. If you are unsure, you can seek advice from these experts.</p>



 Conduct your research 



<p>It is typically a good idea to take measured risks. Make sure you’ve done your study and have all of the information you’ll need to make sound trading decisions.</p>

 Has Quantum Trading Been Endorsed by Celebrities? 



 Dragons Den – Peter Jones, Deborah Meaden 



<p>Dragons Den is a well-known British show that matches business tycoon fantasies against a panel of experienced entrepreneurs. The goal is to convince them to invest in your project. Any notion accepted by the panel may quickly become a worldwide phenomenon, demonstrating that Quantum Trading can discover trading opportunities and develop profitable trading indicators for independent traders. We investigated into if there was a connection between Quantum Trading and the programme, but we couldn’t find any evidence to back up this allegation.</p>



 Elon Musk 



<p>Elon Musk is a self-made millionaire who created SpaceX, Tesla Motors, and Solar City. He’s also a powerful celebrity with the ability to have a huge impact on any financial market all across the world with a single statement. For example, if he came out in support of Bitcoin, the headlines would be all over the place: “Elon Supports Quantum Trading!” Even after conducting extensive online searches, our crew was unable to locate any proof or hint that this had occurred, or that he had endorsed the trading tools or trading approach of Quantum Trading in any way!</p>



 Jeremey Clarkson 



<p>Despite rumors that Jeremy Clarkson’s trading careers started as a result of them being consistently successful on Quantum Trading, we could not find any evidence to support the assertion that Jeremy Clarkson had been trading the financial markets through Quantum Trading.</p>



 Holly Marie Willoughby 



<p>Holly Marie Willoughby, one of the UK’s most well-known and popular TV anchors, is said to have devised a campaign for an undisclosed cryptocurrency trading site that would help kickstart trading careers by helping to determine market direction, especially in the futures market. However, there is no evidence to back up this claim.</p>



 Idris Elba 



<p>Idris Elba is an award-winning actor, singer, and businessman who invests in equities primarily, however, his trading style also makes him a prime suspect for being an investor in virtually every market including cryptocurrencies. He’s also the star of a new Netflix series called “Luther,” in which he portrays Detective John Luther; but how does Idris feel about investing? Our staff looked for evidence that this individual had anything to do with Quantum Trading but couldn’t uncover any.</p>



 Ant McPartlin 



<p>According to a recent report, TV personality Ant McPartlin may have invested in Bitcoin via a complete forex trading program. He is said to be an actor as well as the producer/host of one of Britain’s most popular television series, as well as a musician on the side. Is this a real rumour? We don’t know for sure yet, but considering his interests outside of Hollywood, it wouldn’t be surprising if such were the case—he might very well find value in investing early in such revolutionary technologies before any big failures are seen or experienced by those who do invest later down the line.</p>



 Nicole Kidman 



<p>Nicole Kidman, the Oscar-winning actress known for her appearances in films such as Moulin Rouge!, has recently been the subject of speculations around a prospective investment in Quantum Trading. Our staff was unable to locate any proof that she is actively connected with this project, but we are not ruling anything out just yet!</p>



 Trevor Noah 



<p>The Daily Show presenter Trevor Noah is alleged to be affiliated with Quantum Trading. Many people believe he became wealthy due of his engagement with bitcoin and his broader trading approach, but it is really because of his comic experience and work on The Daily Show, for which he was paid far more than other comedians. As far as we know, there is no indication that Trevor made any investments or engaged in speculative trading on Quantum Trading, thus there isn’t much further to say about him utilising Quantum Trading!</p>



 Gordon Ramsey 



<p>Gordon Ramsay, the worldwide culinary and entertainment king, is a big success. For the past decade or so, his work as an author and chef on television series such as Hell’s Kitchen has earned him international acclaim. However, considering his experience in these areas and his own trading journey, there are suspicions that he may be supporting Quantum Trading; however, no substantial evidence of this assertion has been produced, so it remains just that: a rumour.</p>



 Is It Possible to Withdraw Earnings? 



<p>We discovered that an investor’s gains can be withdrawn at any moment. The procedure goes off without a hitch. Simply fill out the withdrawal form, and it will be executed within 24 hours. Responses from other trading platforms may take a week or two.</p>



 What are the fees for Quantum Trading? 



<p>Fees are one of the most crucial considerations while performing the Quantum AI test. We reviewed various platform evaluations and discovered the following cost structure:</p>



<p>As seen in the table above, Quantum AI charges a 0.01% fee on completed transactions. Many other bots charge fees for account inactivity and even transactions, so this is preferable.</p>



<p>The price structure also shows that you pay the bot’s developers only when you generate money. By charging a lower commission than most other trading bots, Quantum AI proves its affordability.</p>



<p>Account Opening Fee: None</p>



<p>Commissions: 0.01%</p>



<p>Inactivity Fee: None</p>



<p>Account Maintenance Fee: None</p>



<p>Transaction Charges: None</p>

 FAQs 



  Is my data safe with Quantum Trading? <p>According to the website, Quantum Trading employs 256-bit SSL encryption. The offered SSL Certification is a tried and verified internet security standard for encrypting private data on any given website.</p>    What is the cost of opening a new account? <p>There is no fee to establish a new Quantum Trading account. It is completely free to use. There are no additional or hidden fees.</p>    Is it legal to withdraw Cryptos from the trading app after making a profit? <p>Unfortunately, this is not possible. The trading programme converts your winnings to local currency and deposits them into the bank account connected with your Quantum Trading account. This procedure assures that your profits are legal and comply with regulatory requirements.</p>    What are some other reliable cryptocurrency trading platforms? <p>There are several cryptocurrency trading sites. Other trustworthy cryptocurrency trading platforms include Bitcoin Code, Bitcoin Revolution, and Bitcoin Era. Aside from this, there are several financial asset investing platforms that now incorporate cryptocurrencies in their portfolios. However, we recommend that you conduct market research before making any expenditures and select a platform that best matches your demands.</p>    Is there a cap on how much money I can make? <p>There appears to be no upper limit to the amount of profit that may be made with Cryptocurrencies. Profit is directly proportional to your investment. We constantly suggest caution while making investments. Because of the market dangers, it is advised to employ just your spare cash. Never invest cash that are required to support your everyday and emergency costs.</p>    Is Quantum Trading a Scam? <p>To the best of our knowledge, Quantum Trading is a reputable trading platform. It is said to be an award-winning bitcoin trading app. User testimonials on the main website and various partner channels support this claim.</p>    How much time will I be able to spend on this project? <p>Although the trading method is totally automated, spending the recommended time monitoring your account provides you with an in-depth understanding of the market and current trends. The time you put in will assist you a lot in reducing risks and becoming a more seasoned investor.</p>    Is it prudent to put all of your money into Quantum Trading? <p>No, as a general guideline, you should never invest money that you need or cannot afford to lose. Making responsible investing is crucial. As a result, you should only invest money that you will not need immediately or in an emergency.<br><br>Because the cryptocurrency market is volatile and time-sensitive, it is a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. Starting small is a smart idea. Any investment has risks, but the stop-loss provision shields potential investors from large losses.<br><br>It is also a good idea to talk about your investing intentions with your personal broker. Their knowledge may assist you in rationalising your investments and getting the most of your available finances.</p>

 Bitcoin (BTC) was able to retain $17k and made a move towards $18k while Ether is finally back above $1,300.  



 The worst performing tokens are GMX (GMX), Stacks (STX), ApeCoin (APE), and&nbsp;Bitcoin SV (BSV). 



 The best performing cryptocurrencies are Toncoin (TON), GMX (GMX),&nbsp;Near Protocol (NEAR), OKB (OKB), and Lido DAO (LIDO). 



 The total crypto market liquidation in the last 24 hours amounts to $97.95 million of which BTC makes up around $43.99 million. 
 



 



<p>The crypto market turned significantly bullish on Wednesday as trading volumes also surged. Interestingly, the accumulation of the leading cryptocurrency, <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/bitcoin-price-prediction/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, is also on the rise as gradually more investors are buying the current dip. However, it is also crucial to note that the regulatory uncertainty could be a reason why a global adoption of cryptocurrencies is not currently being witnessed. </p>



<p>On December 14, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency was able to hold above the $17k price level, which means that the retest of the nearest resistance zone is quite likely. As a result, we saw Bitcoin try to break the $18k price region but was unable to do so due to a not very high buying volumes. Additionally, the crypto coin needs to break above $18k and reclaim $20,000 price region to confirm a bullish breakout towards $24k price levels. </p>



<p>,As of 7:20 am ET Wednesday, the price of 1&nbsp;<a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/bitcoin">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>&nbsp;stands at $17,873, up 2.46% in the last 24 hours while in the last seven days, the price has jumped by around 6.34%. This indicates that a bullish phase might be coming close for BTC as gradually, the year end is coming near and a bullish run like 2021’s “Santa Bull Run” can be imagined as well. </p>



<p>The market dominance of Bitcoin stands at 39.34% while the trading of the cryptocurrency has jumped by 11.08% in the last 24 hours which means that the buying pressure in the market is currently higher than the selling pressure. However, BTC is still significantly low (about 74%) from its all-time high of $69k noted in November 2021.</p>



<p>As per the chart below from&nbsp;<a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/bitcoin">PricePredictions</a>, Bitcoin is gradually rising on the one hour timeframe which suggests that the price of BTC is picking up pace and this means that a short term bullish outbreak is on the table as well. The 1-hour chart indicates that BTC is actually making higher highs today.</p>

<p>Next, the indicators from the website shows that almost every indicator is bullish for Bitcoin on all time frame which means that any trades placed in the last 24 hours, would’ve resulted in profit. However, it is crucial to rightly time the market and not be extremely greedy when implementing a trade. </p>



<p>The major indicators like RSI and MACD are bullish as well while a uptrend can be seen on the shorter time frame with the help of the Bollinger Bands. To summarize, the 5 mintue, 15 minute, 30 minute, one hour, two hour and four hour, and 24 hours time frames are bullish for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC).</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://pricepredictions.com/">PricePredictions</a>



<p>Additionally, as per the publicly available data, the crypto market’s Fear and Greed Index’s value has risen to 30, after resting at 27 as per our&nbsp;<a href="https://bitnation.co/bitcoin-is-back-above-17k-altcoins-turn-green-bnb-crashes/">Crypto Market Performance Report for Dec. 13</a>. However, the market sentiment still reads “fear,” which means that the uncertainity in the crypto space prevails and investors are unsure if $18k will be reclaimed.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the market cap of the&nbsp;<a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/">entire crypto space</a>&nbsp;at the time of publication stands at $872 billion, and this value is up 1.87% in the last 24 hours. Moreover, the number of crypto coins is 22,032, as listed on CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>On the other hand, it is also crucial to note that the biggest rival of Bitcoin, world’s second-biggest cryptocurrency, the Ether (ETH) token has also performed quite well. Vitalik Buterin’s token is up 2.92% in the last 24 hours and is currently priced at $1,328. The trading volume of the crypto coin has surged by 27.26%, while the market dominance rose to 18.61%.</p>



<p>According to the data from&nbsp;Coinglass, the total crypto market liquidation in the last 24 hours amounted to $97.95 million, of which, Bitcoin made up $43.99 million and Ether made up $30.63 million.</p>



<p>Excluding Bitcoin and Ether, the other top 10 cryptocurrencies in the industry are&nbsp;Binance Coin (BNB),&nbsp;Ripple (XRP),&nbsp;<a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/dogecoin-price-prediction/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a>,&nbsp;Cardano (ADA), and&nbsp;Polygon (MATIC).</p>



<p>The other top 10 cryptocurrencies show bullish movements with&nbsp;<a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/bnb-price-prediction/">BNB</a>&nbsp;up 2.08% to $272.99; <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/xrp-price-prediction/">XRP</a> up 0.99% to $0.3912;&nbsp;<a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/dogecoin">DOGE</a>&nbsp;up 1.26% to $0.09114; ADA up 1.20% to $0.3116 and MATIC up 2.42% to $0.9219.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the worst performing tokens in the last 24 hours among the top 100, excluding the top 10, are&nbsp;<a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/gmx-price-prediction/">GMX (GMX)</a>, Stacks (STX), ApeCoin (APE), and&nbsp;<a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/bitcoin-sv-price-prediction/">Bitcoin SV (BSV)</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly,&nbsp;GMX was down 7.37% to $54.63;&nbsp;STX was down 6.17% to $0.2862;&nbsp;<a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/apecoin-ape-price-prediction/">APE</a>&nbsp;was down 1.23% to $4.07; and BSV was down 2.12% to $45.98.</p>



<p>Finally, the best performers in the top 100, not considering the top 10 cryptocurrencies are&nbsp;<a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/toncoin-price-prediction/">Toncoin (TON)</a>, GMX (GMX),&nbsp;Near Protocol (NEAR), <a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/okb">OKB (OKB)</a>, and Lido DAO (LIDO).</p>



<p>TON was up 21.45% to $2.78;&nbsp;<a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/near-protocol-price-prediction/">NEAR</a> was up 6.30% to $1.73;&nbsp;OKB was up 6.88% to $22.98; and&nbsp;<a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/lido-dao">LIDO</a> was up 8.13% to $1.14.</p>

             14 December 2022
 
     

     
   
 
  
    
       
      
 
             <p></p>

<p>For almost 50 years, the foundation of our work has been to provide unique identification through the barcode, &nbsp;with the GS1 GTIN (the barcode number) and other supply chain standards, ultimately benefitting consumers and patients.</p>

<p>In order to continue on this path, our vision today is to empower the digital transformation of industry. To do that, we must ensure that all GS1 identification keys and links to other sources of data associated with those keys are present in trusted, neutral, authoritative digital registries.</p>

<p>When all physical products are uniquely identified with a barcode number, brand owners and manufacturers can be confident that their items will be represented in the digital world just as they are in the physical world. Industry will see better operational efficiencies, such as reduced time to market and smoother logistics and supply chain processes, as well as better consumer transparency, a reduction in counterfeits and more accurate product information.</p>

 The GS1 Registry Platform 

<p>In 2019, after in-depth consultations with a large and diverse group of brand owners, manufacturers, retailers, solution providers and other industry representatives, as well as our own GS1 Member Organisations (MOs), we developed a data services strategy and immediately began to work on the GS1 Registry Platform.</p>

<p>The GS1 Registry Platform is a cloud-based repository of Global Company Prefixes (GCPs), GS1 Identification Keys such as Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs or barcode numbers) and GS1 Global Location Numbers (GLNs), each accompanied by a minimum set of data attributes and links to other sources of data.</p>

<p>Brand owners upload this data via their local GS1 office, and they are ultimately responsible for the information they provide. In addition, a range of structural and completeness checks inside the system ensure that the data added is of the highest possible quality.</p>

<p>No matter how big or how small a company is, no matter whether they have a thousand products or just a few, no matter where they are in the world, the GS1 Registry Platform ensures that their information is available globally.</p>

<p>With our Registry Platform, GS1 provides industry members with a neutral, authoritative and global source of information where they can verify basic data about products. The GS1 Registry Platform is also the foundation for user-centric, easily consumable and simple services, built on global standards that are open and easy to integrate into external systems.</p>

 Verified by GS1 

<p>Of course, these registries are only meaningful if organisations can access and use the valuable information they contain – and that’s where Verified by GS1 comes in.</p>

<p>Verified by GS1 enables retailers, marketplaces, customs officials, solution providers and others to verify product information and company identity by querying the GS1 Registry Platform. Verified by GS1 answers the question: “Is this the product that I think it is?”.</p>

<p>In March 2022, we launched <a href="https://www.gs1.org/services/verified-by-gs1">Verified by GS1 on gs1.org</a>. This freely available tool allows anyone to make up to 30 queries per day. Designed to increase awareness, it helps retailers, marketplaces and brands better understand the benefits as well as visualise how the data is presented.</p>

 Wemade, a gaming company, filed an appeal against a court for rejecting its request to block the delisting of the WEMIX token. 



 The price of the WEMIX token jumped 1.26% in the last 24 hours and is price at $0.433937 at the time of writing. 



 Wemix (WEMIX) raised $46 million from Microsoft, and asset management firms Kiwoom Securities and Shinhan Asset Management. 



 Wemade claims that the exchanges are abusing their power and did not provide proper guidelines. 
 



 



<p>Recently, the big five major crypto exchanges in South Korea, one of the fastest-growing crypto hubs in the world, Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax, which form the <a href="https://bitnation.co/microsoft-backed-wemix-delisted-by-korean-exchanges/">Digital Asset eXchange Alliance&nbsp;(DAXA), decided to delist the WEMIX token</a>, a crypto coin that is backed by tech giant Microsoft. Interestingly, the company behind the token, Wemade, has filed an appeal against a court for its decision of refusal of the company’s request to suspend the delisting of the token from exchanges.</p>



<p>Wemade filed an <a href="https://law.go.kr/LSW/lsInfoP.do?lsiSeq=180680&amp;viewCls=engLsInfoR&amp;urlMode=engLsInfoR#EJ15:0">immediate appeal</a> against the court’s decision on Tuesday and as per the law in South Korea, such an appeal grants a complaint to be filed to a lower court within one week from the decision of the court. Meanwhile, the big five exchanges decided to delist the crypto coin in November and cited misreporting of total token circulation data as the reason for doing so. </p>



<p>On the other hand, Wemade, a gaming company, filed injunctions against all the exchanges for doing so which were dismissed by a Seoul court last week. However, <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/wemix-price-prediction/">the WEMIX token</a> was finally removed from all the platforms on Dec. 8, and the as a result, the company’s shares and cryptocurrency values plunged, causing losses to the investors as well, who sold their holdings at lower prices.</p>



<p>It is crucial to note that Wemade has stated in its argument that Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax have abused their powers and cornered the firm. The gaming company also claims that the exchanges did not provide proper guidelines to crypto firms which is the basis of the DAXA delisting the WEMIX token. </p>



<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/wemix">Wemix (WEMIX)</a> had raised $46 million from Microsoft, and asset management firms Kiwoom Securities and Shinhan Asset Management, as per a Nov. 4 announcement and as a result, it attracted investors from different backgrounds. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Wemade has listed the WEMIX token on GDAC, another local crypto exchange that currently only serves token-to-token transactions while the big five exchanges also provide token-to-fiat on and off-ramps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In November, when the exchanges announced the delisting of the crypto coin, WEMIX price plunged as investors hurridly sold off their holdings. However, Wemade announced that it will be burning off $10 million worth of tokens in an attempt to recover the price of the token. </p>



<p>Wemade is a well-known gaming firm created in 2000 and enjoyed success with the help of “The Legend of Mir 2.” The company has recently adopted blockchain into its games and as a result, created play-to-earn MMORPG game MIR4 Global, which had over 1.4 million concurrent users last year.</p>



<p>Additionally, following the announcement of the appeal, the price of the WEMIX token jumped 1.26% in the last 24 hours and is price at $0.433937 at the time of writing.</p>

 Binance has debuted “Pay” feature for all its customers in the United States.  



 The feature was launched in Feb 2021 but wasn’t available for US customers. 



 Users can now send money “immediately” using their smartphones. 



 The firm is also working on a web version for the Binance Pay feature.  



 The exchange has also re-opened USDC withdrawals. 
 



 



<p>The world’s biggest crypto exchange, Binance, has opened a new payment method for its customers in the United States. As per a blog post from the leading crypto platform, America-based customers of the exchange can now use the “Pay” feature to send money to other users quite easily, avoiding complex payment methods which take time for settlements. </p>



<p>As per a Tuesday blog post, Binance Pay will be available to the US customers and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said payments is one of the “most obvious use cases for crypto.” It is crucial to note that the Pay feature has been a part of the exchange’s ecosystem since February 2021 and since then, a US release has been pending. </p>



<p>However now, Binance Pay will allow “users to send, request and receive almost 150 different cryptocurrencies from other users, enabling instant, zero-cost crypto transfers.” This seems to be an attempt to increase the trading volume on the crypto exchange amid an increasingly bearish crypto market which has affected the prices of all the crypto coins. The exchange also removed trading fees from <a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/bitcoin">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> and <a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/ethereum">Ether (ETH)</a> trading pairs to bolster volume on the platform.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Pay eliminates the complexities of transferring crypto to contacts as users no longer need to enter a complex deposit or withdrawal address, pay gas fees, or wait an unspecified amount of time for transactions to successfully settle,” the company said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Currently, US-based users can immediately use the Binance Pay feature from their smartphones. However, the company is still working on a web-based feature that could be released in the near future. </p>



 Binance Reopens USDC Withdrawals 



<p>As reported earlier by Bitnation, the leading crypto exchange had paused withdrawals of Circle’s USDC on the platform which gave rise to a FUD in the crypto community. Many people started withdrawing their money from the exchange which was already facing the consequences of a Reuters report stating that half of the US Department of Justice (DoJ) is <a href="https://bitnation.co/binance-denies-claims-of-money-laundering-investigations/">aiming to file criminal charges against Binance</a>. </p>



<p>The leading exchange denied the charges while the crypto community stated that this is a co-ordinated media attack. Due to the rumors of a DoJ investigation and potential issues in the Binance proof of reserves report, the platform’s native token, <a href="https://bitnation.co/binance-denies-claims-of-money-laundering-investigations/">BNB, crashed as well</a>.</p>



<p>However, the USDC withdrawals are back online on Binance as per a blog post late Tuesday. Interestingly, the exchange saw above $1 billion withdrawn from it in just 24 hours owing to fears of another insolvent firm. Although, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO and co-founder of the exchange, stated that this “is a good idea to “stress test withdrawals” on each CEX on a rotating basis.” </p>



 
<blockquote><p>We saw some withdrawals today (net $1.14b ish). We have seen this before. Some days we have net withdrawals; some days we have net deposits. Business as usual for us.<br><br>I actually think it is a good idea to “stress test withdrawals” on each CEX on a rotating basis. <br><br>1/2 <a href="https://t.co/uF9lLPDSyS">https://t.co/uF9lLPDSyS</a></p>— CZ  Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1602676998094069760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>It was also revealed that Binance has over $60 billion in cold wallets which is sufficient to back customers funds in case things go South. </p>



 
<blockquote><p>wait binance have 60 billion in cold wallets? dis seems like 420 magnitudes more professional than ftx scrambling in absolute shit defi farms just to meet last few redemptions before they 0'd and ftx barely had a cold wallet so why are ppl scared <a href="https://t.co/jnQBNkWnVd">https://t.co/jnQBNkWnVd</a> <a href="https://t.co/o2o4OVDtk4">pic.twitter.com/o2o4OVDtk4</a></p>— CL (@CL207) <a href="https://twitter.com/CL207/status/1602577519009763329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>Talking about the USDC withdrawal pause, the executive <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1602579499903852544">stated</a> that the channel to swap from PAX/BUSD to USDC requires going through a bank in NY in USD and since the banks were not open, the situation regarding the stablecoin couldn’t be restored. </p>

<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic closed offices and forced governments to rapidly move services online, if they weren’t already, to serve its citizens. Although usernames and passwords are easy to deploy and easy for citizens to use, they leave systems and users vulnerable to cyberattacks. They are especially vulnerable to phishing attacks designed to steal login credentials and compromise legacy multi-factor authentication (MFA) tools like those using one-time passwords (OTP) and push notifications. With phishing attacks on the rise, it is imperative for governments to support “phishing-resistant” MFA technology that is also accessible, efficient, and cost-effective.</p>



<p>Enterprises and governments around the globe are turning to modern online authentication solutions featuring FIDO specifications based on public key cryptography. Governments and industries have embraced FIDO as the preferred way to deliver high-assurance MFA to consumers. Notably, the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), refers to FIDO security keys as <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/mfa">the gold standard of MFA1</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several governments globally have deployed and/or supported FIDO authentication for citizens to securely conduct government transactions, including making tax payments and applying for and accessing government benefits. Governments leveraging FIDO authentication solutions have realized reduced operational costs and increased consumer satisfaction.</p>



<p>This white paper provides guidance for policymakers and department/agency heads seeking to learn about FIDO authentication to support or deploy FIDO for e-government services.</p>

  The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly filed charges against the recently arrested founder of the bankrupt exchange, FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried. The watchdog accused Bankman-Fried of violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

 The SEC accused Bankman-Fried of diverting customer funds for personal use. 



 The 30-year-old was said to have given investors the false impression that FTX was safe and had appropriate risk management systems. 



 Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas recently after being charged in the United States. 
 



 



<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-219">reportedly</a> filed charges against the recently arrested founder of the bankrupt exchange, FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried. The watchdog accused Bankman-Fried of violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>



<p>The SEC claimed SBF ran nothing less than a “brazen,” years-long fraud from the start of FTX, which enabled him to mismanage and divert billions of users’ funds for personal use. Legal filings released on Tuesday said Bankman-Fried used customer funds to bail out his trading company, Alameda Research, which was supposed to operate separately from FTX. The 30-year-old is also said to have misused funds to push his political ambitions with heavy donations.</p>



<p>According to the civil lawsuit the agency filed in the Southern District of New York, Bankman-Fried generated more than $1.8 billion from investors who purchased equity stakes in the exchange&nbsp;under the impression that FTX had effective control and proactive risk management. </p>



<p>Customers allegedly “believed his lies” and thought the platform was secure, and trusted the exchange with billions of dollars. The filing claimed SBF “spent lavishly on office space and condominiums in The Bahamas, and sank billions of dollars of customer funds into speculative venture investments.”</p>



<p>SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The SEC filed the lawsuit a day after Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas by law enforcement after being informed that a criminal indictment had been brought against him in a New York court. Bankman-Fried <a href="https://bitnation.co/sbf-misses-the-deadline-to-respond-to-committees-request/">previously</a> claimed he did not knowingly commit fraud. However, regulators believe that had been the plan from the start.</p>



<p>SBF was accused of misleading investors with lies regarding the relationship between FTX and Alameda Research. The FTX founder reportedly claimed, “Alameda was just another platform customer with no special privileges.” But the complaint said Alameda was illegally granted special status with lines of credit and a waiver from the FTX’ liquidation protocols, enabling it access to users’ funds.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried’s arrest could give regulators increased control over the crypto space.</p>

 Bitcoin (BTC) has once again reclaimed price action above $17k, while Ether (ETH) is very close to breaking above $1,300. 



 The worst performing tokens are Trust Wallet Token (TWT), Neutrino USD (USN), ApeCoin (APE), and Chain (XCN). 



 The best performing cryptocurrencies are Toncoin (TON), GMX (GMX), Compound (COMP), and Lido DAO (LIDO). 



 The total crypto market liquidation in the last 24 hours amounts to $48.09 million of which BTC makes up around $15.70 million. 
 



 



<p>The crypto market saw a slight upward movement on Tuesday as the crypto coin with the biggest market share, <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/bitcoin-price-prediction/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, was seen above $17k price level once again. The leading cryptocurrency has retested $16k price level as support multiple times and continues its attempts to break above $20k in the near future. Additionally, investors are still uncertain regarding the short-term future price movements.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Bitcoin reclaiming the $17k price level comes as relief as $16k has successfully held. Overall, the market capitalization of the entire industry has also moved up a bit. On the whole, Tuesday has treated investors fairly and now, BTC holders are wondering if the leading crypto coin can pick up pace as a new year is coming soon. </p>



<p>As of 6:47 am ET Monday, the price of 1 <a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/bitcoin">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> stands at $17,444, up 2.66% in the last 24 hours while in the last seven days, the price has jumped by around 2.75%. If a similar cycle continues this week, holders might see the leading cryptocurrency make a move towards the $20k price level which was lost when former multi-billion dollar crypto exchange FTX collapsed and filed for bankruptcy. </p>



<p>The market dominance of Bitcoin stands at 39.22% while the trading of the cryptocurrency has jumped by 15.63% in the last 24 hours which means that buyers are gradually gaining dominance over the sellers in the market. However, BTC is still significantly low (about 75%) from its all-time high of $69k noted in November 2021.</p>



<p>According to the chart below from&nbsp;<a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/bitcoin">PricePredictions</a>, Bitcoin is making a rising trendline on the one hour timeframe which suggests that BTC is picking up pace and volatility might rise further. Investors can expect the cryptocurrency to retain $17k if situation remains the same.</p>

<p>The market sentiment is currently bullish on a shorter timeframe. </p>

<p>The indicators are bullish on almost every time frame except the daily time frame. All the major indicators used in the crypto space can be seen below and to summarize, the 5 mintue, 15 minute, 30 minute, one hour, two hour and four hour time frames are bullish while the 24 hour frame is bearish.</p>

<p>Furthermore, according to the publicly available data, the crypto market’s Fear and Greed Index’s value has remained at 27, after rising from 26 to 27 as per our&nbsp;<a href="https://bitnation.co/bitcoin-barely-holds-17k-altcoins-not-looking-good/">Crypto Market Performance Report for Dec. 12</a>. Moreover, the market sentiment reads “fear,” confirming that investors are still unsure regarding their investments and the future price action of Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the market cap of the&nbsp;<a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/">entire crypto space</a>&nbsp;at the time of publication stands at $856 billion, and this value is up 1.42% in the last 24 hours. Moreover, the number of crypto coins is 22,022, as listed on CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>It is also crucial to note that the world’s second-biggest cryptocurrency, the Ether (ETH) token, which is the closest competitor to Bitcoin, has performed identically to BTC and is up 2.69% in the last 24 hours and is currently priced at $1,287. The trading volume of the crypto coin has surged by 27.96%, while the market dominance stands at 18.41%.</p>



<p>According to the data from&nbsp;Coinglass, the total crypto market liquidation in the last 24 hours amounted to $48.09 million, of which, Bitcoin made up $15.70 million and Ether made up $12.02 million.</p>



<p>Excluding Bitcoin and Ether, the other top 10 cryptocurrencies in the industry are&nbsp;<a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/bnb">Binance Coin (BNB)</a>,&nbsp;Ripple (XRP),&nbsp;Dogecoin (DOGE),&nbsp;<a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/cardano-price-prediction/">Cardano (ADA)</a>, and&nbsp;Polygon (MATIC).</p>



<p>The other top 10 cryptocurrencies show bullish movements except <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/bnb-price-prediction/">BNB</a>, which is&nbsp;down 5.23% to $268.66. Additionally, XRP is up 3.16% to $0.3865; <a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/dogecoin">DOGE</a> is up 0.80% to $0.08988; ADA is up 0.74% to $0.3084; and MATIC is up 1.32% to $0.901.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the worst performing tokens in the last 24 hours among the top 100, excluding the top 10, are&nbsp;<a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/trust-wallet-token-price-prediction/">Trust Wallet Token (TWT)</a>, Neutrino USD (USN), ApeCoin (APE), and <a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/chain">Chain (XCN)</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the best performers in the top 100, not considering the top 10 cryptocurrencies are&nbsp;<a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/toncoin-price-prediction/">Toncoin (TON)</a>, GMX (GMX), <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/lido-dao-price-prediction/">Lido DAO (LIDO)</a>, and Compound (COMP).</p>



<p>TON was up 9.37% to $2.29;&nbsp;GMX was up 3.41% to $59.03;&nbsp;<a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/compound">COMP</a> was up 4.34% to $39.22; and&nbsp;LIDO was up 5.56% to $1.05.</p>

 Outgoing secretary-general of Financial Stability Board (FSB) stated that the body plans to roll out crypto regulations swiftly in 2023. 



 Dietrich Domanski said that the FSB will set a timeline for regulators to discuss and implement its first recommendations on global crypto regulation. 



 The body will also outline several areas of the crypto space where policymakers could benefit from “more clarity” before making  rules. 



 The crypto regulation strategy “shows clearly what the way forward (for crypto) regulation looks like,” said Domanski. 
 



 



<p>The crypto industry is currently in a sticky mess following the collapse of former multi-billion dollar crypto exchange, FTX. The implosion of the exchange was the last straw for regulators around the globe to converge and target the regulation of these digital assets for investors’ protection. As a consequence, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has confirmed that it is preparing for a rapid rollout of crypto regulations in 2023.</p>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/88d4b6a7-926b-43c9-9198-37455e5a1afc">Financial Times</a>, the outgoing secretary-general Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system, Dietrich Domanski, revealed the global body’s intentions regarding crypto assets. Interestingly, in November, the FSB <a href="https://www.fsb.org/2022/11/fsb-announces-new-secretary-general-3/">appointed</a> John W Schindler as its new secretary-general who has yet to talk about these incoming regulations. </p>



<p>A criticism of regulators around the globe might’ve been the reason for this rapid development of crypto regulations from the FSB. The report further adds that the international will be working on the regulations and roll them out switfly in 2023. Interestingly, there has been a regulatory vacuum in the crypto space which has allowed crypto firms like FTX to achieve sky-high valuations without a proper business in place. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“One objective of this work plan is precisely to counter a perception that all this (work on cryptocurrency) is disperse and slow and is not focused on a single common goal,” Dietrich Domanski revealed in a statement a day before his five year tenure at FSB ends. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the coming months, the FSB will set a timeline for global regulators to discuss and implement its first recommendations on global crypto regulation and the financial body will also outline several areas of the crypto space where policymakers could benefit from “more clarity” before making rules. These areas will be inspired by the recent collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX and Do Kwon’s stablecoin project, Terra.</p>



<p>Furthermore, as per the outgoing secretary-general, the members of the FSB had a “strong agreement” about the crypto regulation strategy which “shows clearly what the way forward (for crypto) regulation looks like,” more than five years after the FSB began evaluating the sector’s risks.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Many crypto market participants argue that authorities are hostile to innovation. I would say so far, authorities have been fairly accommodating . . . recent events have reinforced the recognition that it is indeed urgent to address risks,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Domanski said that the objective of the new crypto guidelines is to regulate the space in such a way that blockchain firms “would be held to the same standards as banks . . . if they provide the same service that banks provide.” </p>



<p>In the light of crypto regulation in the US, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently issued guidelines asking firms to <a href="https://bitnation.co/sec-demands-companies-to-reveal-their-exposure-to-crypto/">reveal their exposure to cryptocurrencies</a> and also if they have existing relationships with crypto companies.</p>

 Crypto exchange Binance’s BNB token dropped around 5% and as of 12:40 am ET, the price 1 BNB token stands at $267.65. 



 The price crash is a result of a Reuters report stating that half of DoJ prosecutors want to file criminal charges against the exchange. 



 Additionally, Binance has paused USDC withdrawals via on the Ethereum Network and the BEP2 Network. 



 Binance has refuted the report while adding that it has smooth relations with regulators. 
 



 



<p>Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, seems to have become the center of attraction for the entire crypto community, and even the slightest of rumors seem to have grave repercussions. A report was circulated regarding a criminal investigation of the leading crypto exchange which has led to a strong crash in the price of the exchange’s native token, BNB.</p>



<p>Currently the world’s forth biggest cryptocurrency, the BNB token is used for multiple purposes in the Binance ecosystem and differs from other tokens like FTX’s FTT token, which had no underlying value. Interestingly, as of 12:40 am ET, the price of 1 BNB token stands at $267.65, and it is down by almost 5% in the last 24 hours due to the panic and FUD created by a report from Reuters that the US Department of Justice (DoJ) is investigating the leading exchange for money laundering activities. </p>



 
<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a> coin <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24bnb&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$bnb</a> drops by almost 6% in the last 24 hours. <a href="https://t.co/aVF1FV9PPB">https://t.co/aVF1FV9PPB</a> <a href="https://t.co/bVGdqQjvXG">pic.twitter.com/bVGdqQjvXG</a></p>— PricePredictions.com (@pricepred) <a href="https://twitter.com/pricepred/status/1602520777697660928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>It is also crucial to note that the trading volume of Binance’s BNB token has surged by 115.72% in the last 24 hours which suggests a surge in the selling pressure for the same. According to the algorithm from <a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/bnb">PricePredictions</a>, the forth largest cryptocurrency is currently trending downwards, a potential loss is eminent for holders.</p>



<p>Additionally, according to the chart below, a downtrend on the hourly timeframe can also be confirmed. </p>

<p>The chart indicators for BNB token currently show that traders as well as investors are becoming increasingly bearish on Binance crypto exchange’s native token which is not a very good sign for holders. Additionally, the market dominance of the token will fall below 5% if the price crash continues to strengthen. </p>



 Investigation of Binance  



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N3321X6">Reuters</a>, there is a split between the U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors regarding a long-running criminal investigation into Binance. This split has caused a delay in the authorities reaching a decision, as per four people familiar with the matter. Interestingly, this case began in 2018 when the Changpeng Zhao-led crypto exchange was in its initial days. </p>



<p>The report states that this investigation is regarding Binance’s compliance with anti-money laundering laws and sanctions of the United States. Interestingly, at least half of the prosecutors believes that there is circumstancial evidence to make a move against the exchange and its founder, who is also popular as CZ in the crypto community, and file criminal charges. On the other hand, the remaining prosecutors want more time to review evidence. </p>



<p>Interestingly, the report also added that Binance’s defense attorneys at U.S. law firm Gibson Dunn have held meetings with DoJ officials recently regarding the case. Furthermore, sources told Reuters that the charges are related to unlicensed money transmission, a money laundering conspiracy, and criminal sanctions violations. </p>



<p>It is also crucial to note here that Binance has paused USDC withdrawals via on the Ethereum Network and the BEP2 Network, as seen in the image below. </p>







<p>Reuters also claims that Binance had weak anti-money laundering laws, due to which it was able to process over $10 billion in payments for criminals and companies seeking to evade US sanctions. </p>



<p>Additionally, it is also crucial to note that the official Binance Twitter account refuted Reuter’s report stating that the media outlet “has it wrong again.”</p>



 
<blockquote><p>Reuters has it wrong again. <br><br>Now they're attacking our incredible law enforcement team.

<p>The exchange stated that it has a team of almost <a href="https://bitnation.co/binance-denies-claims-of-money-laundering-investigations/">300 cyber investigators collaborating with authorities around the world</a> and Binance collaborated on 70 workshops and training sessions with law enforcement and prosecutors in a variety of countries including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, Philippines, Sweden, South Korea, Thailand, the UK, and more.</p>

 A New Approach to Building Trust in Decentralized Systems 

 by Christopher Allen 

<p>Musings of a Trust Architect is a series of articles by <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/">Life with Alacrity author</a> and Blockchain Commons founder Christopher Allen that lays out some of the foundational ideas and philosophies behind the technology of Blockchain Commons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ABSTRACT: Progressive trust is the concept of gradually building trust over time. It differs from classical models of trust, which rely on authentication mechanisms and centralization; and zero-trust models, which assume that trust should never be relied upon or which mandate the use of “trust frameworks” or “trust registries”. Progressive trust is based on the idea that trust is not a binary state but instead a dynamic and evolving process involving gradually learning about your partners through successful interactions. It’s how trust works in the real world, between people and groups. This architecture is critical for protecting human rights and dignity, as it allows individuals to defend against coercion and violations of their privacy, autonomy, agency, and control. To support a progressive trust architecture, capabilities such as data minimization, elision/redaction, escrowed encryption, and cryptographic selective disclosure must be used.</p>

<p><a></a></p>

<p>I first wrote about progressive trust back in 2004<a>1</a>. There, I suggested that software should “better serve our needs and the needs of the groups that we are involved in” and that to do so, “we need to figure out how to apply an understanding of how human groups behave and work.” Recently, that concept has finally been gaining traction: in the world of decentralized systems, it can be used as a new approach for modeling and building trust.</p>

<p>The basic idea behind progressive trust is to model how trust works in the real world, between real people, groups, and businesses, rather than solely relying on mathematical or cryptographic trust. To explain this concept, I often use the example of meeting someone at a conference.</p>

<p>When we meet at a conference, we spend time listening to and understanding each other. We do this because being at the same conference has allowed us to create a simple credential for each other: that we are both interested in the same things. We continue to talk and exchange information, such as people we know in common, shared interests, and meaningful ideas. As our conversation progresses, we may unconsciously check to see if others are listening and adjust our conversation or location accordingly.</p>

<p>If we decide to meet again to continue our discussion, we may authenticate some of the credentials we have been given to ensure that we are comfortable with the level of trust we have in each other. As our collaboration grows, we may seek out more credentials and endorsements and engage in more tests of our mutual trust. Eventually, we may bring in third parties to witness and enforce our mutual obligations.</p>

<p>This is the way human trust works. It is also similar to how groups function and how businesses manage risk. It allows us to build trust and collaboration in a more natural and effective way. A progressive trust architecture thus permits us to support this gradual building of trust over time algorithmically.</p>

<p>The traditional algorithmic mechanism for building trust is to verify every interaction or transaction as “trusted.” This is often done through authentication mechanisms such as passwords or digital certificates and/or by identifying interactions as being inside a trusted firewall or VPN. However, these mechanisms can be easily compromised and do not adequately capture the dynamic and evolving nature of trust between people and groups.</p>

<p>More modern zero-trust architectures instead assume that trust should never be relied upon by any system or network. They mandate the use of a centralized third-party, or more recently a “trust framework”<a>2</a> or “trust registry”<a>3</a>, to manage and enforce the trust relationships. All parties must consult that registry to determine who is a trusted issuer.</p>

<p>While this approach has the advantage of removing the need for individual parties to trust each other, it has numerous shortcomings:</p>

<p>Trust registries create new risks of centralization and vulnerability to coercion. In addition, trust registries may not be able to capture the dynamics of trust-building over time, which can be vital to building trust in complex or evolving systems. Further, trust registries can become outdated or irrelevant as requirements and details change for each party, resulting in gaps that make it difficult to determine the authenticity and reliability of new data with a privacy-breaking “phone home.” Finally, trust registries must rely on a third party to hold and update the registry. This highlights some of the flaws of centralization, such as the trust registry not treating the risks of all parties equally, or focusing on mitigating the risks of those parties with more power to influence the registry, or creating a dependence that is likely to be expensive and only benefits the few.</p>

<p>The problems with trust registries highlight the importance of using architectures that support the autonomy and agency of all parties. Progressive trust offers this alternative through its model of how trust is built and maintained in the real world. It is based on the idea that trust is not a binary state but rather a dynamic and evolving process. As a result, trust is built gradually over time through a series of interactions and transactions that allow parties to test and verify each other’s credentials and capabilities.</p>

<p>This progressive trust architecture protects human rights and dignity in a way that traditional models do not. Unlike traditional models of trust, progressive trust instead focuses on the choices of each party, allowing individuals to defend against coercion, financial and data loss, and violations of their privacy and authority. With progressive trust, individuals can do all of this, as the architecture is designed to support the autonomy and agency of each party.</p>

<p>Specific technical capabilities must be in place to support a progressive trust architecture. These include data minimization, elision/redaction, escrowed encryption, and various cryptographic selective disclosure techniques. Data minimization, for example, involves limiting the amount of shared data to the minimum necessary to protect privacy and reduce the risk of data loss or harm. Elision/redaction allows parties to decide what information to share, removing or masking portions to give them greater control over managing their own risks. Cryptographic selective disclosure enables parties to prevent future data correlation, and escrowed encryption allows information and promises to be enforced in the future. Fundamentally, these are all techniques that we use in real-life when progressively increasing trust with someone else; they just need to be modeled in digital space.</p>

<p>In terms of design principles, progressive trust architectures must be flexible and scalable to adapt to changing trust requirements over time. This means leveraging modular and atomic credentials, claims, and proofs that can be combined and updated as needed. It also requires using various cryptographic tools such as cryptographic inclusion proofs and zero-knowledge protocols and leveraging data models that express how the various sub-credentials are connected, allow for gaps, and minimize undue correlation.</p>

<p>One of the key challenges in building a progressive trust architecture is that trust is not binary; instead, it includes more gray areas. Trust is also not universal: each party will have a different view about it. For example, in a decentralized system, not all parties may be willing or able to share sensitive information, leading to gaps in the data. Additionally, as new information is added and existing data gaps are updated, the level of trust may change, making it difficult to evaluate the authenticity of a piece of information with certainty. These challenges require verifiers to understand their own business risks and choices and apply them instead of relying on third parties to make these decisions.</p>

<p>Ultimately, mechanisms must be put in place to ensure that the progressive trust architecture is secure and resilient. Robust software security development techniques and practices must be used, including requiring proper cryptographic security reviews and developing decentralized governance models that can support the decision-making processes necessary for building and maintaining trust in the system.</p>

<p>Progressive trust offers an important new alternative to traditional and zero-trust models for online trust. By understanding and applying the principles of how human trust and collaboration work in real life, we can build trust and collaboration more naturally and effectively. Progressive trust supports each party’s autonomy and agency and allows trust to evolve and adapt to changing requirements and information. As more organizations and individuals begin to explore decentralized systems, progressive trust architecture usage will only continue to grow.</p>

 Reuters claims the DOJ’s inquiry involves prosecutors at the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington in Seattle, and the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. 



 Binance, refuting reports of possible criminal charges, said it has a team of almost 300 cyber investigators collaborating with authorities around the world. 
 



 



<p>Earlier today, Reuters reported that a possible division among prosecutors in the&nbsp;US Department of Justice&nbsp;is&nbsp;delaying the completion of a lengthy criminal investigation into Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange. The platform claimed that sources familiar with the matter said prosecutors have different opinions about whether the present evidence is sufficient to press charges against the exchange and its executives.</p>



<p>However, Binance took to Twitter to dismiss the report, claiming the news site got it wrong this time. The trading platform accused Reuters of “attacking our incredible law enforcement team. A team that we’re incredibly proud of – they’ve made crypto more secure for all of us.”</p>



 
<blockquote><p>Reuters has it wrong again. <br><br>Now they're attacking our incredible law enforcement team.

<p>Binance shared a statement and a blog post detailing its fight against crime. The trading company, via a spokesperson, said it does not have any insight into the inner workings of the US Justice Department, adding that it would be inappropriate to comment if it did.</p>



<p>Binance revealed that it had in its ranks some of the most renowned cyber investigators representing major law enforcement agencies around the world. The popular exchange further said it has a team of almost 300 financial crime investigators working to keep users safe, adding that “their hard work has directly resulted in a crypto ecosystem that has far less criminal activity on average than the traditional cash system.”</p>



<p>Binance also noted that the team collaborated with law enforcement agencies around the world to solve cases involving hacks, scams, investment fraud, money laundering, nation-state-sponsored attacks, and other crimes. Additionally, the crypto exchange revealed that the team has held sessions with Interpol, Europol, and enforcement agents in Brazil, Argentina, and other countries.</p>



<p>Binance shared more details in a blog <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/leadership/inside-binances-fight-against-crypto-crime-5422427314690193337?ref=AZTKZ9XS&amp;utm_source=BinanceTwitter&amp;utm_medium=GlobalSocial&amp;utm_campaign=GlobalSocial">post</a>, saying,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>During the past year, this program has led to us sharing our insider knowledge and expertise over the course of more than 70 workshops and training sessions with law enforcement and prosecutors in a variety of countries —&nbsp;from Asia to Europe, and the Americas. The list includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, Philippines, Sweden, South Korea, Thailand, and the UK — to name but a few.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



 Binance and the DOJ 



<p>The focus&nbsp;of the<a href="https://bitnation.co/doj-is-investigating-ftx-founder-for-sending-funds-out-of-us/"> DOJ</a>‘s inquiry, which began in 2018, was Binance’s compliance with AML regulations and sanctions in the United States. U.S. authorities were looking into allegations of conspiracy to launder money, unauthorized money transmission, and criminal sanctions breaches.</p>



<p>According to two Reuter’s&nbsp;sources, several of the at least six federal prosecutors working the case feel that the information previously acquired supports taking serious action against the exchange and charging certain officials, including the founder Changpeng Zhao, with crimes. The sources claimed that others have urged for taking the time to consider further evidence.</p>



<p>According to the article, Binance’s defense lawyers met with Justice Department representatives recently and advocated against taking legal action. The crypto exchange&nbsp;warned that any legal action taken against them might have a disastrous effect on the cryptocurrency industry. The negotiations allegedly covered prospective plea bargains, according to the report.</p>

<p>FIDO: New help on the way:</p>



<p>In 2021, the FIDO Alliance developed an open standard called the Fido Device Onboard (FDO) protocol. FIDO will make it easier to connect IoT devices to cloud-based and on-premises device management platforms. The FIDO protocol can autonomously onboard an IoT device without an admin knowing how to configure or access the underlying network and Internet infrastructure the device runs on. The updated FIDO2 protocol enables IoT device onboarding without the need for a password and maintains the network’s security and governance requirements.</p>

<p>Thanks to authors:<br>Ken Lyon, Global expert on logistics and transportation and Trace Labs advisor,<br><a href="https://medium.com/@jurij.skornik">Jurij Skornik</a>, Trace Labs’ General&nbsp;Manager</p><p>Well-oiled supply chains have always been the key enabler of successful international trade. We have seen a notable rise in their prominence and importance in the last few years, driven by a significant increase in consumer demand and events that exposed how fragile these business networks are, such as the Evergreen blockage of the Suez canal. Understanding the ins and outs of supply chains is critical to tackling such challenges through successful deployment of innovative technology, improving not only business outcomes, but also the sustainability of supply chains in the broadest sense. In this article we deep dive into the complexities of global supply chains, look at how state of the art technology such as OriginTrail can be a driver of change, and examine an industry example of a tech-driven initiative that recently closed down, TradeLens.</p> Supply chains as&nbsp;networks <p>Supply chains are, by definition, interconnected groups of organisations that have agreed to perform a series of tasks which usually results in the delivery of a product (or service) to a customer.</p><p>Over time supply chains have become extended, often span the globe, operate to a much faster tempo and are also significantly more fragile. The principal causes have been the growing consumer demand in industrialised nations and advances in technologies such as computers, communications and manufacturing. In response, many organisations, particularly logistics service providers, have transformed the scope and scale of their operations, such that the largest of them have established physical global networks operating continuously to collect and deliver “almost everything to pretty much anywhere”.</p><p>Supply chains are really networks rather than linear ‘chains’. As these complex webs of connectivity extend, some of the links become very fragile and prone to unexpected failures or disconnects. Because they are usually physical channels, the ‘unexpected’ will include weather events, political or social upheaval, or just basic equipment failures.</p>Network of supply&nbsp;chains<p>Establishing many of these networks has in some cases taken years of effort to establish the necessary levels of trust. But this approach conflicts with the demands for the agile and adaptable supply chains that can respond to unexpected events or challenges. It is true that the Internet has made it much easier to exchange data and collaborate with partners, but the necessary levels of trust are still reinforced through either personal relationships or third party services that struggle to operate at&nbsp;scale.</p> Global networks, global complexities <p>As an example, a small jewellery manufacturer will probably buy materials from companies they have known for a while. They will sell to customers either in a physical store, where the customer will pay for the products directly, or through an online platform where a third party payment system supported by a bank will confirm the transaction. This arrangement will continue to work well, providing there is not a significant step change in demand. In short, if the jeweller usually sells 50 items a week, and demand for a popular item suddenly jumps to 4,000 a week, it becomes impossible to fulfil within a reasonable timeframe without drastic changes in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>In contrast, a major automotive manufacturer has several supply chains that will operate across multiple geographies, with thousands of suppliers, including a handful of global component manufacturers, who each have their own constellations of suppliers and subcontractors, with some common to both. Like the previous example of the jeweller, the major relationships have been established over long periods of time and the value exchanges of information, money and material, are usually significant. There will also be a degree of churn and change at the edges as small suppliers fail, or stop providing the products required. These changes are usually handled within the existing (established) processes that are defined by the need to ‘trust’ any new party entering the&nbsp;network.</p><p>These processes are often cumbersome, inflexible and may not reveal any inherent weakness that could compromise the entire network in the future. They rely on a third party somewhere in the chain of command, to validate any new entrants before they can perform the services they are required to deliver. In a high velocity supply chain this can introduce problems further along the chain. In short, it is inefficient.</p><p>This requirement for validation by third parties can be a significant weak spot in diverse and extended supply chains. In 2011, extensive rainfall across south east Asia led to massive floods in Thailand. This stopped operations at a significant number of the worlds contract manufacturing plants specialising in disc drive production who were clustered in that area. Computer manufacturers scrambled to find alternative suppliers, but due to the requirement to validate new suppliers, it was easier to work with existing suppliers and have them boost output in other locations. This proved challenging, as it required the suppliers with functioning plants elsewhere to prioritise customers. Some 14,000 manufacturers were impacted and it took months to resolve, impacting delivery schedules, and forcing some out of business.</p><p>Furthermore, switching production to other locations required the establishment of new logistics pathways and working with new subcontractors, all of whom had to be validated and approved.</p><p>The issue wasn’t that the organisations involved did not have the capabilities to perform what was required. It was that they needed to be ‘validated’ so that they could be trusted by their partners in the network. This is where decentralised trust mechanisms, such as those illustrated by blockchains, are very valuable to extended supply chains with huge numbers of participant organisations. These decentralised networks use a consensus network of thousands of independent systems to ensure immutability and verifiable integrity of identities, transactions and computation. They can support massive scale and are robust and extremely difficult to compromise.</p> OriginTrail and knowledge assets <p>The OriginTrail Decentralised Knowledge Graph (DKG) was designed to exploit and advance these technologies to support the necessary flexibility and adaptability of critical global supply chains. It achieves that by bringing the complex, fragmented processes in global supply chains to a common denominator using a simple yet powerful building block — a knowledge asset. With the endless variety of possible scenarios in global supply chains, a knowledge asset is there to represent any single (small or large) part of it, whether that’s raw material, finished product, professional service, factory building, compliance certificate, quality claim or anything else you can think of. But even though they can be so incredibly diverse, they all share the same core characteristics:</p>  unique identity which can be pointed to using a Unique Asset Locator (UAL is derived the same way how URLs are created in the world wide&nbsp;web),  verifiable ownership ensuring chain of custody can be followed throughout the asset lifecycle,  knowledge asset graph of data combining all relevant claims about an asset with precise data permissioning capabilities from fully private claims, limited access or fully public&nbsp;claims.  An example of OriginTrail Decentralised Knowledge Graph (DKG) in the pharmaceutical supply&nbsp;chain.<p>Each of these characteristics ensures a powerful building block which we can use, almost like lego blocks, to recreate the fragmented reality that are modern supply chains. The most important part, however, is that all these assets aren’t created in data silos but rather issued on a global DKG where they are organised in a way that they can be discovered, verified and used. Because the DKG is not owned, controlled or run by any single entity (it is a permission-less network), it provides the ideal, neutral, common ground where each participant can own and control their assets and important business information while still be able to share it with anyone they wish to share it with. It is perhaps one of the most critical innovations for supply chain, as for once, interoperability of systems based on global standards is the fundamental starting point rather than an after-thought or even seen as something that is not desirable when service providers are pursuing vendor lock-ins.</p> De-siloing data for frictionless international trade <p>The enormous potential of OriginTrail’s DKG is that it can also address many of the challenges embedded within the regulatory structures that underpin the global trading system. Much of the inherent inertia that permeates global supply chains is due to the bureaucracy required to validate and authorise parties and contracts.</p><p>Governments and trade organisations are constantly trying to harmonise regulations and agree on common standards, but technology may now be able to reframe the essence of the debate with the advent of the DKG. With the collaboration of the BSI and others, OriginTrail has been able to demonstrate how the DKG can serve as a universal and immutable system of record for licences and credentials. These digital ‘assets’ of the organisation can now be referenced from anywhere by any relevant authority, thus avoiding unnecessary duplications of certifications, authorizations, inspection and audit&nbsp;reports.</p><p>This has huge implications as there is an enormous amount of cost and operational overheads in the duplication, sharing and managing the documentation necessary for legislative compliance across global supply chain operations. The Supplier Compliance Audit Network (SCAN) is a clear example of how this can work in practice. There are currently 52 SCAN members that have audited some 22,000 factories across 80 countries for security and social responsibility compliance. This collaboration of SCAN members and a small number of audit firms now enables supplier audit reports to be shared with SCAN members removing the necessity for them to conduct their own&nbsp;audits.</p><p>The key element of this is that the approach ensures anonymity and confidentiality, so members do not see proprietary sourcing information, only the information confirming that the audit report confirmed compliance with the agreed standards. This avoids duplication of effort and cost and saves huge amounts of time when establishing new trading partner networks.</p><p>This initiative is growing and is helping the US CBP, CTPAT, and other Authorised Economic Operators (AEO) establish common security standards that can easily be referenced and checked in a secure manner. As more organisations are accredited with AEO status, the ability to record this accreditation on a secure, immutable platform such as the DKG will be immensely beneficial. It is this evolution of a recognized credential into a digital asset, immutably owned by the accredited party and capable of being instantly referenced from anywhere that is transformational.</p><p>As the SCAN example has shown, being able to reference existing accreditations in a fast, trusted and secure manner saves time and also reduces the operational costs when setting up new trading relationships.</p><p>But the real advantages of the DKG will be realised within organisations that are able to record their physical inventories as immutable digital assets on the DKG. Being able to trust inventory data across the supply chain is essential. Inaccurate and unverified inventory results in duplications, excess cost and often disappointed customers due to stock shortages.</p><p>As an example, when inventory items are moved, they may be recorded in a number of different systems. These systems frequently assign different identifiers to the inventory items, without corresponding links back to the original reference. This disconnect makes it harder to identify missing items or duplications. This can be expensive if the supply chains involve pharmaceuticals, or semiconductors.</p><p>For decades there has been a demand for a ‘Single version of the Truth’ when considering visibility systems. The track and trace systems of the global integrated carriers were the first to provide some kind of end to end view of a shipments progress. But as soon as it left their information domain (e.g. passed to another carrier), the information flow either broke down or was delayed. Across a global supply chain comprising multiple partners and a myriad of systems, these data update delays and disconnects illustrate that ensuring referential integrity is very difficult.</p><p>The advent of the DKG provides the opportunity to rethink supply chain visibility. If inventory items are represented as digital assets on the DKG there should be no need to keep recording them in different systems, merely refer back to the original digital asset and its attributes. As it physically moves through the supply chain as an order or shipment, each stage of the journey should reflect the ownership, status and chain of custody as a cluster of digital assets, immutably recorded on the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>This is a very seductive and powerful proposition, as it implies a huge improvement in efficiency and reduction in errors and exceptions. This is because every participant will have access to the same information, certain in the knowledge that all of the participants are looking at the same data, albeit in their specific&nbsp;context.</p><p>Clearly, it will take time to achieve this as it is not a trivial exercise to transform existing stores of inventory data into digital assets. The performance of the underlying technology will also have to improve, but initiatives such as Version 6 of the DKG, the Network Operating System (nOS) enabler for enterprises, and Project Magnify are accelerating things.</p>Trace Labs’ Network Operating System&nbsp;(nOS)<p>Innovative companies and curious staff members in the horizon scanning and scenario planning functions of major corporations should explore what the OriginTrail and the Trace Alliance have been doing. As the world evolves from Web2 to a Web3 landscape, those organisations that understand and appreciate the power of Decentralised Knowledge Graphs will have the advantage.</p> TradeLens takeaways: Not less, but more decentralisation and interoperability <p>The importance of having a common infrastructure rooted in decentralisation, neutrality, and interoperability can be reinforced by examining one of the high-profile industry initiatives that has recently announced it is closing down, TradeLens. TradeLens was a joint effort of Maersk and IBM established in 2018 and was considered by many as one of the most promising ventures deploying blockchain technology in the shipping industry. But if that was the case, why did it fail, and how does OriginTrail DKG address the shortcomings that were the root causes of this&nbsp;failure?</p><p>There are a plethora of reasons that led to TradeLens’ demise, but below are some of the ones we consider the most important.</p><p>Low level of digitalization in the shipping industry. In a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/the-multi-billion-dollar-paper-jam-unlocking-trade-by-digitalizing-documentation">report</a> from October this year, McKinsey estimated that only around 1% of all Bill of Ladings (BLs) are digital today. Such low levels of digitalization present a significant barrier to industry-wide initiatives such as TradeLens. To help overcome that barrier, the Network Operating System (nOS) offers multiple avenues to help organisations create assets on OriginTrail DKG. This ranges from as easy as providing inputs via e-mail to more automated API data ingestion capabilities. Interoperability among multiple inputs is achieved thanks to supporting global data standards such as GS1 EPCIS and DSCA’s Electronic Bill of Lading (eBL), ensuring all created assets are interoperable. And there is a lot of potential in the digitalization of the shipping industry. In the same report mentioned above, McKinsey estimates that 100% adoption of the eBL would have an annual impact of around USD 50bn in the ocean trade ecosystem alone.</p><p>Lack of willingness to share data. It’s no surprise that industry players are reluctant to share sensitive business data, as questions around data privacy and ownership inevitably pop up. This is especially true when the underlying infrastructure is provided by a competitor, as was the case with TradeLens — Maersk being the largest shipping company globally. OriginTrail provides industry players with a way to transform their existing data into assets that are discoverable and verifiable on the DKG, but remain fully within their control and can be shared as needed, for example with customs authorities or other government agencies. This is important as assets (and data) need to be discoverable to be useful, but that should never happen at the expense of data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Level of decentralisation and neutrality. Closely tied to the previous point, the level of decentralisation and neutrality of TradeLens’ infrastructure was not sufficient to facilitate an industry-wide adoption. If any industry-wide initiative is to succeed, the infrastructure needs to ensure that all participants are on an equal footing and minimise the potential for vendor lock-ins. OriginTrail DKG provides this neutral, common ground as a permissionless, open-source infrastructure that is not owned, controlled, or run by any single&nbsp;entity.</p><p>Interoperability of data and infrastructures. Interoperability is crucial to successful industry-wide initiatives. And there are two facets of interoperability, the first being interoperability of data and the second being interoperability of infrastructure. The TradeLens experiment made it clear that more focus needs to be put on both facets, and that industry-wide permissioned blockchains don’t deliver the expected business value. OriginTrail tackles this interoperability challenge from both angles. Data interoperability is achieved by assets on OriginTrail utilising global data standards such as GS1 EPCIS and DSCA’s Electronic Bill of Lading (eBL). From an infrastructure point of view, OriginTrail is multichain by design, meaning a global graph backed by multiple permissionless blockchains (currently Polkadot, Ethereum, Gnosis, and Polygon), giving organisations full flexibility in terms of what infrastructure they want to&nbsp;use.</p><p>While we still have a long way to go, the digitalisation of global supply chains continues, and TradeLens provided valuable insights, as well as highlighted some of the core issues that need to be addressed moving forward. With the paradigm-changing shift from data to assets, OriginTrail can serve as one of the components that will help address those issues and facilitate the successful digital transformation of international trade.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by organizing humanity’s most important knowledge assets. It leverages the open source Decentralized Knowledge Graph that connects the physical world (art, healthcare, fashion, education, supply chains,&nbsp;…) and the digital world (blockchain, smart contracts, Metaverse &amp; NFTs,&nbsp;…) in a single connected reality driving transparency and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Advanced knowledge graph technology currently powers trillion-dollar companies like Google and Facebook. By reshaping it for Web3, the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph provides a crucial fabric to link, verify, and value data on both physical and digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>World class companies are already using OriginTrail to create value for their ecosystems. For example, OriginTrail is enabling frictionless international trade for over 40% of US imports by fostering secure exchange of security audits. The same semantic fabric of the decentralized knowledge graph protects pharmaceutical supply chains or can be used to organize blockchain data for seamless access by decentralized applications (e.g. Metaverses).</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p><p>👇 More about Trace&nbsp;Labs👇</p><p>Trace Labs is the core developer of <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> — the open source Decentralized Knowledge Graph.

During the seminar, leading organizations shared major updates that will further the Alliance’s mission to replace passwords with simpler and stronger authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A significant milestone came last May when <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/">Apple, Google and Microsoft announced plans to expand support for FIDO</a> with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, a phishing-resistant replacement for passwords that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices. Passkeys can be leveraged across devices and platforms to offer an end-to-end passwordless sign-in option, or bound to a particular device such as a FIDO security key for high-assurance use cases. Passkeys are supported today in iOS 16, macOS Ventura, Android and ChromeOS, with Windows coming soon.</p>



<p>Notably, global service providers such as <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2022-10-24-PayPal-Introduces-More-Secure-Payments-with-Passkeys#:~:text=Passkeys%20are%20a%20new%20industry,is%20no%20shared%20passkey%20data">PayPal</a> have expanded their FIDO support and are offering passkey sign-ins, while early FIDO adopters in Japan have announced passkey commitments or adoption as their next steps towards passwordless:</p>



 
 Yahoo! JAPAN has been working on passwordless initiatives with FIDO since 2015, and more than 38 million active users in 2022 are signing in without passwords. Yahoo! JAPAN now supports passkeys iOS, iPadOS and MacOS. 



 KDDI has <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/deploying-fido-in-japan-an-interview-with-kddi/">first launched FIDO in 2020</a> for its au ID platform with more than 30 million customers. Now au ID is accessible with passkeys on iOS and FIDO2 on Android.&nbsp; 



 NTT DOCOMO has been a leader both within and outside FIDO Alliance beginning with its <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-welcomes-ntt-docomo-to-board/">Board appointment in 2015</a> and is the first mobile operator to deploy FIDO authentication at scale. DOCOMO has announced its intention to support passkeys for its more than 50 million of d ACCOUNT users beginning in early 2023.&nbsp; 
 



<p>“From the very beginning of the FIDO Alliance, Japan has been a global hub of innovation, support and deployments of FIDO authentication. It is not a surprise that several leading organizations in the region will be some of the first globally to offer their customers FIDO sign-ins with passkeys,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “This is illustrative of our global membership’s commitment to the passwordless future, and their collaboration to maximize the reach, usability and security of FIDO authentication.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within the FIDO Alliance’s 250+ members, 58 actively take part in the FIDO Japan Working Group, now beginning its 7th year working together to spread awareness and adoption of FIDO in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About the FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="http://www.fidoalliance.org">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

<p>By: FIDO Staff</p>



<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is an increasingly critical and difficult area for IT devices that need to be secured.</p>


 
 


<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit: The FIDO Fit in IoT held on Dec. 7, a series of experts outlined FIDO Alliance efforts to help device manufacturers and developers better secure IoT. A key theme of the event was all about understanding how the FIDO Device Onboarding (FDO) specifications can help improve IoT security.</p>



<p>David Turner, director of standards development at FIDO Alliance, kicked off the event by noting that passwords remain a large problem across the IT industry. The challenge of passwords is compounded with IoT devices, which scale into the millions and potentially billions of devices. Challenges with passwords for IoT include password re-use, which can be a huge problem with IoT. If a system ships with a default password, it can be trivially easy for attackers to exploit.</p>



<p>“Hackers don’t break into IoT, they log into it,” Turner said.</p>



<p>One way to help secure IoT is with the FIDO Alliance’s FDO standard. Turner explained that FDO is an open standard that allows organizations to quickly and securely onboard IoT devices.</p>



<p>Small things, big impact: The path to FDO</p>


 
 


<p>Rolf Lindemann, director of product at Nok Nok and one of the leaders of the FIDO Alliance IoT Technical Working Group, explained that FIDO authentication standards are applicable to users as well as device authentication.</p>



<p>Lindermann said that there is a clear need to have a strong foundation to help secure IoT. The first step is to have hardened hardware elements at the CPU level including things like TPMs, TrustZone and SGX which are provided by the silicon vendors. The next critical step is to add device level attestation to help with supply chain integrity that also helps to reduce the complexity for device onboarding. The third step is to have strong authentication, that ensures only legitimate entries get access.</p>



<p>“To make the IoT ecosystem more secure, you need strong authentication that’s the front door providing fishing resistance and being still practical for daily large scale use,” Lindermann said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How FDO tackles the onboarding challenge</p>



<p>The challenge of onboarding is where the FDO specifications come into play.</p>


 
 


<p>Richard Kerslake, general manager of industrial controls and robotics, IoT business unit at Intel, explained that onboarding is the process by which a device can establish a trusted connection with a service or platform.</p>



<p>“We have an IoT device, it’s going to connect to a platform or service and we just need to be sure that everyone in that equation is who they say they are,” Kerslake explained. “Is the device talking to the platform that it thinks it is talking to, and is the platform talking to the device that it thinks it is talking to. So we really need to make sure that both sides of that equation are true.”</p>



<p>Onboarding today is often a very manual process. The promise of FDO is an automated approach that benefits from strong authentication. Kerslake explained that in December 2019 the decision was made to base the FDO specification on Intel’s Secure Device Onboard technology. The FDO 1.0 specification was released in March 2021 and updated to version 1.1 in April 2022.</p>



<p>Going a step further beyond just the specifications FIDO has worked with the Linux Foundation’s LF Edge project which has an <a href="https://www.lfedge.org/projects/securedeviceonboard/">open source implementation of FDO</a>.</p>



<p>Going for a deep dive with FDO</p>



<p>There is a fair amount of nuance and details that go into the FDO specification.</p>


 
 


<p>In a deep dive session, Geoffrey Cooper, principal engineer, IoTG at Intel, explained the workflow, technical specification and procedures that enable FDO implementations.</p>



<p>Cooper explained that for example if a device is drop-shipped to a location and the device gets powered up and connected to the network, the goal with FDO is to enable that device to figure out who it’s supposed to connect to with proper authentication, sets everything up, and then it goes right into service.</p>



<p>“The idea is we’re taking something that was a very heavy touch kind of operation that we’re turning it into a zero touch operation,” Cooper said.</p>



<p>Enabling that zero-touch approach with FDO involves a series of protocols that are part of the specification. The protocols include device initialization and onboarding components. There is also a concept known as the FDO Service Info Module (FSIM) that provides an extension mechanism to help support devices.</p>


 
 


 



<p>During a robust Q&amp;A session during the Authenticate virtual event, attendees asked a wide variety of questions.</p>



<p>Among the questions was one about what’s needed to help spur adoption for FDO.&nbsp; Kerslake said there are companies today in different industry verticals including the energy sector, where operators are saying they will not proceed with bringing in new devices without an automated secure onboarding solution.</p>


 
 


<p>There are also a growing number of industry solutions that support FDO. Megan Shamas, senior director of marketing at the FIDO Alliance, said that by developing FDO in an industry standards body there are lots of opportunities for collaboration and promotion as well.</p>



<p>“We are in the midst of creating an implementer showcase, which should be live on the website soon,” Shamas said.</p>



<p>The path toward FDO certification</p>


 
 


<p>Looking beyond just the FDO specification there is also a need for certification, which is something the FIDO Alliance is now working on.</p>



<p>Paul Heim, director of certification at FIDO Alliance, said that&nbsp; product certification ensures standardization and interoperability of products within an industry. He added that one of the most important factors about certification is that it helps to ensure consumer enterprise, and industrial protection. The lifecycle for FDO certification includes both functional and security certification.</p>



<p>“The FIDO device onboard certification program is intended to certify IoT devices and onboarding services certification that will be available for both FIDO members, and non-members,” Heim said.</p>



<p>The certification effort is still in development with a program launch set for the first quarter of 2023.</p>

 Energy Web RPC nodes on AWS Marketplace is the first step towards Energy Web as-a-service <p>Zug, Switzerland — December 8, 2022 — This year, Energy Web’s technology roadmap focused on achieving one objective: making it easier for enterprises to use <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/why-we-exist/">Web 3 technology to create real business value</a> in support of the global energy transition. A key pillar of this strategy is to dramatically <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=ceea861f-8fff-4307-8bc7-659637b29e5d">streamline the way companies access EW solutions</a> by offering them as-a-service.</p><p>Today we’re excited to announce the initial step in this journey with the release of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=ceea861f-8fff-4307-8bc7-659637b29e5d">Energy Web RPC nodes in the AWS Marketplace</a>. For the first time, companies can now configure and deploy a component of the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/how-we-work/#section-1117-8306">Energy Web Decentralized Operating System</a> with the push of a button. Over the coming months we will expand these offerings to include additional components and public cloud marketplaces.</p> Why we’re offering EWC technology in cloud marketplaces <p>There’s an adage in the business world that to be successful you need to meet your customers where they are. There are lots of ways to interpret this, but ultimately it boils down to delivering a product or service in a way that aligns with customers’ existing practices and habits. In the context of enterprise software, historically this has been a weakness of Web3 solutions, including Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>Today nearly every category of enterprise software — from marketing to resource planning, HR management to project management, and teleconferencing to file sharing — is dominated by “Software-as-a-Service” (SaaS) solutions that are offered via subscription models. With few exceptions, gone are the days where large companies roll out complex business applications don’t need any specialized skills or dedicated technical resources in order to adopt a new system; rather, with just a couple of clicks they can launch and customize their solution, and it just&nbsp;works.</p><p>In contrast, up until recently implementing an Energy Web solution required a team of developers to provision a dedicated hosting environment prior to creating a bespoke deployment pipeline to configure, install, and integrate multiple discrete components downloaded from public Github repositories. Even with <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/how-tos-and-tutorials/testnet-and-mainnet">robust supporting documentation and tutorials</a>, that’s a tall ask for companies with mature engineering departments. For companies with more limited IT resources, this approach is simply a nonstarter.</p><p>Public cloud marketplaces can significantly reduce this friction by automating and abstracting all of the deployment steps, and delivering a clean user interface to configure and administer EW solutions. Beyond the technical benefits, the marketplace approach also simplifies procurement by consolidating costs under an existing cloud account. Just as popular mobile app stores radically simplified distribution of consumer applications, public cloud marketplaces can act as a springboard for driving widespread adoption of enterprise software.</p><p>At Energy Web, we view cloud marketplaces as a critical channel for scaling our impact in 2023 and&nbsp;beyond.</p><blockquote>“The business value of Energy Web solutions is clear, but when it comes to implementation we need to deliver the user experience that enterprises have come to expect” said Energy Web CTO, Mani Hagh Sefat. “With SaaS, things that used to take lots of time and effort can now be done with the click of a button. By offering EW solutions in cloud marketplaces, we can enable any business user to start using our technology and getting value from it right&nbsp;away.”</blockquote> What’s currently available? <p>RPC nodes, with support for the high-performance Nethermind client (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-cb37zifmdfcec?sr=0-3&amp;ref_=beagle&amp;applicationId=AWSMPContessa">EWC main net</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-c26a4lcsltmdm?sr=0-4&amp;ref_=beagle&amp;applicationId=AWSMPContessa">Volta test net</a>) and legacy OpenEthereum client (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-w5fqsiqd6jc5s?sr=0-2&amp;ref_=beagle&amp;applicationId=AWSMPContessa">EWC main net</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-7n2n5v7kx726m?sr=0-1&amp;ref_=beagle&amp;applicationId=AWSMPContessa">Volta test net</a>), are the first EW service being offered in the AWS Marketplace. RPC nodes act as a gateway to connect to a blockchain, and are required for any application that reads data from or initiates transactions on the EWC (and Volta test network). Prior to the AWS Marketplace offering, the only options for connecting to the EWC were to <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/how-tos-and-tutorials/connect-to-energy-web-chain-main-network-with-metamash">subscribe to a public RPC node</a> (which is rate limited and not suited for enterprise workloads) or to <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/how-tos-and-tutorials/running-a-local-node">use the command line to run a dedicated private node</a> (which is technically complex).</p><p>With RPC nodes now available in AWS Marketplace, developers and enterprises can easily deploy their own dedicated nodes to enable programmatic and high-volume interactions with the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain.</p>How it started: “quickstart” instructions for EW&nbsp;RPCHow it’s going: EW RPC in AWS Marketplace<blockquote>The Nethermind team has long collaborated with Energy Web to provide smooth, reliable, performant solutions for running EWC nodes. We look forward to seeing enterprises enjoy this improvement to quick node deployment and welcome any opportunities to build solutions for clean and distributed energy resources together. — Tomasz Stańczak, CEO</blockquote> What’s next? <p>Long-term, our vision is to deliver all EW Solutions (and individual EW-DOS components) via a fully self-sovereign solution-as-a-service offering that delivers the simplified user experience of public cloud marketplaces with the flexibility and customization features of existing self-hosted models. In this offering, customers will have the ability to deploy EW solutions in multiple public clouds and/or their own environments.</p><p>In the near term, we will expand public cloud marketplace offerings (both increasing the number of EW services available, such as Data Exchange and Green Proofs solutions, and adding more cloud providers, such as Azure and Google Cloud) in Q1 — Q2&nbsp;2023.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers.

<p>By Christina Hulka, executive director and COO of the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>FIDO Authentication has reached broad support across the web – all major operating systems, browsers and billions of devices support FIDO Authentication today. Having reached such a milestone and the resulting FIDO roll outs from a broad array of service providers, the FIDO Alliance is increasingly focused on ways to make FIDO Authentication more usable and accessible for all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In achieving FIDO Alliance’s mission of more secure and password-free authentication, we must ensure that we meet the needs and preferences of people with disabilities. Today, we are pleased to announce the publication of “Guidance for Making FIDO Deployments Accessible to Users with Disabilities,” to provide guidance on planning FIDO deployments that are accessible to users with a wide range of disabilities. It also aims to help hardware manufacturers identify opportunities to deliver more accessible external authenticators.</p>



<p>An estimated 15% of the world’s population lives with some sort of disability today, and in many countries, laws prohibit discrimination to help ensure that these people can fully and equally participate in every aspect of society. Authentication is an important component of the ability to participate, as it provides digital access to many aspects of society including (but not limited to) education, employment, and entertainment. While legacy forms of multi-factor authentication (MFA) like SMS or email codes are technically “accessible,” they often require advanced skill, knowledge and/or assistive technology to enter the codes. FIDO, with its stronger and simpler authentication model, is well positioned to provide accessible authentication, as it supports a wide range of options that accommodate vastly diverse needs. The paper released today details why, and considerations for, deploying FIDO with the needs of people with disabilities in mind. We strongly encourage service providers to reference these guidelines in planning their FIDO deployments.</p>



<p>Much work and collaboration went into this paper. We would like to thank Yao Ming of Meta for his extensive work as lead author on this paper. We’d also like to thank Joyce Oshita of VMware for her contributions, including providing her own experiences leveraging various authentication methods, including FIDO, as a person who has lost her eyesight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the white paper, Yao and Joyce will be joining us on December 15, 2022 at 2pm ET for a webinar to discuss their perspectives on this topic. To attend the webinar, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/event/webinar-making-fido-deployments-accessible-to-users-with-disabilities/">register here</a>.</p>

We looked at how community members engaged with each other and the community of practice as a whole. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S4Is3Pg1ttXAUKOJvyLvKB5g29beVd1FOKBXpQ4pYAI/edit#slide=id.g14ce548e3e4_0_191">See the full output in slide&nbsp;form</a>.</p><p>We are analysing this data to have a look at how the community is progressing through growth, activity, and sense of community. Are we maturing? Let’s find&nbsp;out!</p><p>For a more complete walkthrough of the data we’ve collected, <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/080e5da9106243ba92871be40b5e8e2c">here is a video</a> (transcript included!).</p> Why you want to look at&nbsp;data <p>It’s awesome that you might feel that your community is healthy, but likely the community ambitions extend beyond being a friendly and inclusive place. As a community of practice evolves, you likely have specific goals, outcomes and activities you’re promoting.</p><p>To judge whether or not you are achieving these goals, you will want to look at how the community changes over time. We do this with data! Start by setting some baselines to measure against. With a data-driven approach, we can more accurately observe how a community is having&nbsp;impact.</p> Methodology and types of&nbsp;metrics Our three buckets of&nbsp;data<p>You’ll want to set a couple of different kinds of metrics, both qualitative and quantitative. You’ll want to look at how people engaged, how people were recognised and gather insights from the community members themselves. Your first step is to think about what you want to&nbsp;know.</p> 1. Individual Engagement <p>Individual engagement is a way to look at how community members are interacting with one another and the community more broadly. Typically, you will want to look at things&nbsp;like:</p>  Did people introduce themselves?  Did people made a contribution to or start a discussion?  Did they join an event, either online or in real&nbsp;life?  Did they sign up to courses or seminars on&nbsp;offer?  What other signup or attendance rates can you&nbsp;collect?  46% of our sample was actively&nbsp;engaged<p>Depending on the size of your community and the data capabilities of the platform(s) you’re using, you may need to come up with a sampling technique. Sampling allows you to select a fair and impartial subset of your community members to set engagement baselines.</p><p>The sampling technique we used for the KBW community was to select every 5th member who joined the community (listed by date). This technique allowed us to look at approximately 20% of the entire community, a decent sized&nbsp;sample.</p> 2. Community Metrics <p>Many platforms have data capabilities of some kind. You might be able to look&nbsp;at:</p>  the total number of posts per&nbsp;month  the total number of active&nbsp;members  the total number of new discussions.  <p>Setting baselines for posting activities can help you determine if the community is becoming more&nbsp;engaged.</p>41% of the KBW community earned at least one&nbsp;badge<p>The KBW community issues a variety of badges to recognise engagement and to encourage pro-social behaviours. With our community metrics, we were able to see how many badges were earned and what the most popular badges were. We found that 41% of the community earned at least one badge! Community members can earn badges that are discussed and displayed in the community as well as <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wtf-are-stealth-badges-41130a75a1a9">stealth badges</a>. There are badges related to specific activities as well, such as Badge Wiki badges for people who contribute to the community’s knowledge base.</p><p>Looking at these metrics over the course of a year can help you determine ebbs and flows of activity. They can also help you see what kinds of content led to the most engagement.</p> 3. Surveys <p>The third thing you should look at is what community members think and feel. Create an end of year survey focused on the key factors you’d like to know&nbsp;about.</p>  How do you want community members to&nbsp;feel?  What kind of ambitions for the community do you hope people&nbsp;have?  How do community members want to improve the community’s offerings?  we asked people how they felt about the KBW community<p>For the KBW Birthday Survey, we used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale">Likert Scale</a> and a subset of questions from McMillan and Chavis’s 1986 paper Psychological Sense of Community. We wanted to know if people felt like they belonged, if they identified with the values of the community and if their needs were being met. We also wanted to see if they thought the community had influence and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>The best part of surveying actual community members is the things they write in, so be sure and provide open text fields. People offer kudos as well as constructive criticism, so you’re sure to learn a lot about your community.</p> What’s next <p>Once you’ve collected and analysed your data, share it with your community! Other members of the community will have their own insights and ideas to make your community of practice even&nbsp;better.</p><p>We recommend putting on some music and diving into your community data. It’s easy to get excited about the things you learn because your data-driven insights can propel you, collectively, forward towards your&nbsp;goals.</p><p>Join us in <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d">the KBW community</a> and learn more about communities of practice and all things&nbsp;badges</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-to-gather-data-on-a-community-of-practice-881af2846d0d">How to Gather Data on a Community of Practice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>When we look at the state of defending human rights today, it is clear that digital technologies play a role – both as a creator of risk and harm and, potentially, as a tool to protect rights and strengthen the work of rights defenders. However, this was not always as clear, and even today, it can be difficult to understand how digital technologies magnify existing harms, introduce new dynamics, and can be used by advocates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learning from what others have tried –&nbsp;what has worked and what hasn’t – is important in this space. As such, we were honoured to work with <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/tech/" title="">Amnesty Tech</a> on a pair of case studies looking back at how Amnesty International has woven a critical understanding of technology into their human rights defence work. We conducted desk research and interviews with Amnesty Tech in 2020, and developed the case studies we’re sharing today. Despite the time that has passed, the learnings continue to be relevant for exploring questions like:</p>



 
 How can we weave a deeper understanding of tech into human rights programme work? What impact will that have on our work? 



 What does it take to shift internal ways of working? 



 What are ways to approach digital threats and risk management? 
 



<p>In the first case study <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/TheJourneyOfAmnestyTech_Public.pdf" title="">The journey of Amnesty Tech: How a large organisation integrated technology into human rights work</a>, we look at how Amnesty Tech came to be –&nbsp;the advocates, resources and successes that led to Amnesty Tech becoming an integral part of the broader organisation’s human rights work.</p>



<p>In the second, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AmnestyTechEmpowerement.pdf" title="">Amnesty Tech Empowerment: Transforming digital security support for human rights defenders</a>, we see how Amnesty’s deep knowledge of human rights defenders and their needs around risk management and protection shaped their approach to rising digital threats.</p>

<p></p>     <p>All Smart City services are delivered through technology platforms. From a technology perspective, a global trend is clearly underway — namely, the progressive integration of all services into technology platforms. Of the wide range of platforms in the global digital marketplace, the mobility platform boasts the most complex technology. The mobility platform provides the foundational technology layer for integrating all user-centered services, thus becoming the hub of service delivery.</p>
          <p>Challenges of the Smart City Digital Ecosystem</p>
<p>Today’s great challenge for Smart Cities is developing a “meta-platform” capable of integrating IoT devices, connectivity, data, and apps providing core and value-added services. Around the world, integration is emerging as a new paradigm not only in technology but in business and governance; and interoperability must become a standardized practice in the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Achieving full interoperability is therefore critical to overcoming fragmentation among several functional areas (Smart Governance, Smart Education, Smart Energy, Smart Infrastructure, Smart Mobility, Smart Healthcare, Smart Buildings, Smart Technology, and others) in the global Smart City market. Interoperability requires open and shared standards.</p>
                      <p>Energy Insurance</p>
<p>The insurance sector plays a key role in climate adaptation and building climate resilience through promoting climate mitigation and incentivizing green behaviors. This can range from asset management and underwriting to supporting clean technologies and climate-friendly operational changes.</p>
<p>Current global climate and environmental emergencies are pushing regulatory frameworks, business models, and marketing toward standardizing units of measurement. In this global framework, the carbon footprint is emerging as the standard global unit of measurement for a net-zero society.</p>
<p>Carbon footprint measurement is beginning to appear in companies’ reports on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities. This data may also be required for B Corp, ISO, and GHG certifications, eco-labeling, participation in carbon markets, and carbon tax calculations.</p>
                      <p>MOVENS and wefox</p>
<p>One global leader bringing the insurance industry into the digital age is German-based insurtech firm wefox, which developed a new approach to revolutionizing insurance, focused on consumer empowerment and prioritizing solutions for secure data-driven experiences. wefox has developed an insurance platform that leverages data from energy consumption to determine what appliances are in use, enabling innovative and precise coverage for users.</p>
<p>wefox adopted MOVENS technology developed by Henshin Group. MOVENS is a cloud-agnostic IoT platform designed to be the Integration Hub for the Smart City, connecting all layers and related entities involved in the Smart City ecosystem.</p>
<p>The microservice architecture of the wefox platform can cover not only households but also small and medium-sized enterprises and offices by processing the infinite streams of data from MOVENS.</p>
<p>In fact, by reading data and energy curves from machinery and household appliances, wefox can design insurance coverages that cover these risks and any possible damages. This can ultimately help companies avoid breakdowns and business interruptions in addition to helping families keep their disposable income. In addition, to encourage the adoption of environmentally friendly practices, wefox offers insurance coverages that reward sustainable behaviors. More specifically, by collecting data that show evidence of sustainable driving behavior, wefox can offer rewards and incentives in collaboration with other partners to promote risk-averse behaviors and foster loyalty among customers. This, in turn, can result in lower premiums and higher cost savings.</p>
                      <p>Henshin and MOBI</p>
<p>MOVENS platform is evolving according to the global standards set by MOBI. Its high-level microservice abstraction architecture enables the integration of all layers involved in the Smart City ecosystem and encourages the implementation of cutting-edge technology for each layer. The platform thus provides the foundational technology layer for integrating all user-centered services.</p>
<p>MOVENS technology currently includes verticals in the Mobility, Energy, and Insurance sectors. The platform speeds up value creation through an open innovation model, supporting the energy transition.</p>
<p>Henshin joined MOBI for a simple reason: to be part of the global innovation ecosystem and to have the chance to collaborate with other valuable members and their breakthrough technologies. Collaboration is key to driving persistent innovation and accelerating the evolution of the MOVENS platform as the technological infrastructure for the implementation of Smart City initiatives, starting with the integration between mobility and energy sectors.</p>
<p>Henshin is a member of the <a>DRIVES Program</a> and has contributed to the release of two recent standards: the <a>Battery SOH (State of Health) Standard</a> and <a>Rechargeable Battery Identification Number (BIN)</a>.</p>

              Belgian consumers who want to know more information about food items beyond what fits on the label can now turn to an app that uses product data provided by brand owners. 

 
 
<p>Non-profit organisation Aktina offers a free web and smartphone app designed to help Belgian consumers understand the information on food labels.<br>
The app—called BATRA for BArcode TRAnslator—allows shoppers to decipher a food product label in the blink of an eye, simply by scanning the barcode on the product. It’s part of Aktina’s work to promote healthy behaviours and sustainable mindsets.</p>

 <a href="https://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/gs1_gdsn_success_story_aktina.pdf">Read the case study </a> 
 

  
 
 
     

     
   

         
                                                                                                                                                                                              
   

    
   
    
                         
           
  
    
       
      
 
              Thanks to GS1 GDSN, shoppers access data straight from the source 

<p>The information provided by BATRA is drawn from product data made available by brand owners themselves, because it draws upon the product data in My Product Manager, the GS1 GDSN-Certified Data Pool of <a href="https://www.gs1belu.org/en/gs1-global-data-synchronisation-network-gs1-gdsn" title="GS1 Belgilux GDSN">GS1 Belgilux</a>.</p>

<p>The Aktina BATRA app helps consumers better understand the terms, ratings and graphics on food labels, so they can shop thoughtfully and with confidence.</p>

 Data enables helpful notifications for consumers 

<p>BATRA also allows users to create personalised settings and notifications. For example, consumers can request to be alerted if a product contains a certain allergen. They can also ask to be informed if the AFSCA, Belgium’s Federal Agency for Food Chain Safety, has issued a recall on a product being scanned – or even a product the user has scanned at some point in the past.</p>

 GDSN helps create a direct link between consumers and suppliers 

<p>BATRA is an excellent example of how the <a href="https://www.gs1.org/services/gdsn" title="GDSN">GDSN</a> can be part of B2B2C* strategies, serving the needs of business, brands and manufacturers all while they, in turn, serve the needs of end-consumers.</p>

 The open-source Data Privacy Capability Model is a step-by-step guide to designing, running, and evaluating a strong data privacy program for any organization. 



<p>PHOENIX, ARIZONA, UNITED STATES, December 5, 2022 /<a href="http://www.einpresswire.com/">EINPresswire.com</a>/ —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oceg.org/">OCEG</a>&nbsp;is pleased to announce the release of the new Integrated Data Privacy Capability Model (IDPM) and associated certification for Integrated Data Privacy Professionals. Together with a global review committee of privacy experts and the input of Singapore-based OCEG training partner, Straits Interactive, we have developed an open-source capability model that offers a detailed step-by-step guide to designing, running, and evaluating a strong data privacy program for any organization.</p>



<p>Carole Switzer, OCEG Co-Founder, and President notes, “Unlike other available resources and certifications, which generally outline the requirements of various data privacy regulations and tell you what you need to comply with, through this Capability Model we are seeking to help you understand how to meet those needs. Following the structure of our respected GRC Capability Model, we walk you through every stage of identifying relevant requirements for your organization, keeping track of where and how you are collecting and processing personal information, and ensuring that your data privacy program is transparent and auditable.”</p>



<p>The Capability Model is a free, open-source resource that anyone may download directly from the OCEG site.</p>



<p>“We are pleased to offer this important certification as an addition to our GRC Professional and GRC Audit certifications,” says OCEG Founder and Chair, Scott Mitchell, “and to include it at no additional cost for anyone who holds an OCEG All Access Pass. The AAP provides access to our premium resources and all our certification exams at one low cost, which ensures that every organization can have skilled and credentialed teams to address these critical needs.”</p>



<p>Said Kevin Shepherdson, CEO, Straits Interactive, “This Model, which we are honored to have authored with OCEG, offers something that has been missing in the information market for data privacy, that is, looking at privacy from an integrated governance, risk management and compliance perspective. The certification demonstrates an individual’s knowledge of how to build, run and assess an effective and agile data privacy program. As data privacy management becomes more challenging, it would be in every organization’s interest to ensure that its data privacy team and every manager of units with data privacy responsibilities, follow the model and obtain this valuable certification.”</p>



<p>Integrated Data Privacy Capability Model vs Other Privacy Certifications<br>The Integrated Data Privacy Capability Model provides a roadmap for both GRC and privacy professionals. Those with specialized privacy certifications can now broaden their expertise into GRC as data privacy involves governing personal data, managing risks relating to personal data as well as complying with data privacy laws and regulations.</p>



<p>As for those who have the GRCP certification, this provides a roadmap for GRC professionals to cover data privacy which has become a big focus due to the General Data Protection Regulation and the introduction of many new data privacy laws around the world. By achieving the certification in the Integrated Data Privacy Capability Model, they have the option to then specialize in the area of data privacy and take on additional privacy certification qualifications.</p>



<p>Testimonials from Testers<br>Testimonials from those who recently took the training have been encouraging and are shared here:<br>“The course has a definitive guide for Data Protection Officers who are looking towards being operationally ready. What I learned the most would be the specific steps in preparing a robust data protection management program.”</p>



<p>“Relevant to my consulting practice going forward [the Model] provides a more detailed framework to advise clients on how to set up their privacy management plan.”</p>



<p>“The ‘learn and align’[component structure] provides a good way to frame the settings for our consulting with the management to align with their business objectives and enroll support.”</p>



<p>“The training provides in detail the steps required to set up a data privacy program (right from the start).”</p>



<p>“The training is very useful, how we combine data privacy knowledge and GRC perspective.”</p>



<p>“Found it useful to have understood the privacy framework in the larger context of GRC.”</p>

<p>Create Ceramic App is a new way to create an app using Ceramic, much like Create React App or Create Next App. We built Create Ceramic App to ensure that you know all the parts and packages that go into using our decentralized network—from interacting with data to using a Web3 wallet for user authentication.</p><p>Before you get started with Create Ceramic App we recommend that you read some of our documentation—it clarifies the terms that we’ll use throughout this post. Create Ceramic App will handle the implementation, but reading about <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.3.x/api/classes/devtools.Composite#frommodels">Composites</a>, <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/glossary/#dids">DIDs</a>, and other important concepts will help you understand how Ceramic works.</p> Getting Started <p>Get started with Create Ceramic App by running <code>npx @ceramicstudio/create-ceramic-app clone</code> . You will encounter a series of prompts, after running the command, that we will explain in a later section.</p> Provided Templates  DID-DataStore <p>This template is a simple implementation of our DID-DataStore package using NextJS and DID Sessions (<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/accounts-evolution-of-3id/">a successor to 3ID Connect</a>). This template will interact with the published BasicProfile DataModel on the Clay Testnet.</p> ComposeDB [Developer Preview] <p>Using a locally created <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.3.x/guides/creating-composites/schema">Composite</a>, which is similar to the BasicProfile DataModel, you can create data for any DIDs that you control. This template also provides access to this data through either the provided ComposeClient or through GraphiQL. This template also provides scripts to handle deploying and updating your Composite and will dynamically run all dependencies that the application requires.</p> Creating App <p>After running <code>npx @ceramicnetwork/create-ceramic-app clone</code> you’ll encounter a simple CLI where you can fill in the project name and choose your template. We’ll just call it ‘sample’ for now.</p><p>We provided templates for DID-DataStore and for the Developer Preview of ComposeDB, both templates have a similar structure so you can focus on the specifics of the two different libraries. We’ll go into details on the differences in the next section.</p><p>Below you’ll find the output of selecting the DID-DataStore template. This template does not cover any DataModel creation and does not create a configuration file, so there’s nothing to note.</p><p>Our ComposeDB template does include creating a Composite (if you’re familiar with DID-DataStore this is roughly equivalent to a DataModel); because of this, we need to have a configuration file generated that contains an Admin DID (here we use a Key DID), this Admin DID is critical for interacting with Ceramic’s restricted admin APIs. The image below shows the three major steps we take to set up your project.</p>  We clone the GitHub Repository that hosts our projects  We generate our Admin DID and its seed  We generate our configuration file with the Admin DID included so your new project can have indexing enabled from the first time you start coding  <p>When we selected the ComposeDB template we also created a new Key DID to authenticate our Composite, as well as a configuration file to allow indexing of our newly-created Composite. The configuration file is saved as <code>composedb.config.json</code> and the seed for the newly generated Key DID is saved as <code>admin_seed.txt</code>. Neither of these files should be included in your version control and both have been explicitly mentioned in the provided <code>.gitignore</code>.</p> Starting the Application <p>Regardless of the template that you use, starting the application is the same. Just use the command <code>npm run dev</code> in your directory like you would with a NextJS application.</p> Idea for a feature? Need more documentation? <p>Please post any feedback on the Create Ceramic App to our <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/">Forum</a>, we'd love to hear from you and discover more about what you're building. If you want to learn and develop more with ComposeDB we recommend checking out <a href="https://composedb.js.org/">the latest docs</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.goldmoney.com/research/the-upside-down-world-of-currency">Authored by Alasdair Macleod via GoldMoney.com,</a></p>



<p>The gap between fiat currency values and that of legal money, which is gold, has widened so that dollars retain only 2% of their pre-1970s value, and for sterling it is as little as 1%. Yet it is commonly averred that currency is money, and gold is irrelevant.</p>



<p>As the product of statist propaganda, this is incorrect. Originally established in Roman law, legally gold is still money and the states’ debauched currencies are not — only a form of credit. As I demonstrate in this article, the major western central banks will be forced to embark on a new round of currency debasement, likely to put an end to the matter.</p>



<p>Central to my thesis is that commercial bank credit will contract sharply in response to rising interest rates and bond yields.&nbsp;This retrenchment is already ending the everything bubble in financial asset values, is beginning to undermine GDP, and given record levels of balance sheet leverage makes a major banking crisis virtually impossible to avoid. Central banks which are already in a parlous state of their own will be tasked with underwriting the entire credit system.</p>



<p>In discharging their responsibilities to the status quo, central banks will end up destroying their own currencies.</p>



<p>So, why do we persist in pricing everything in failing currencies, when that will almost certainly change?</p>



<p>When the difference between legal money and declining currencies is finally realised, the public will discard currencies entirely reverting to legal money. That time is being brought forward rapidly by current events.&nbsp;</p>







 <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/istockphoto-1285637350-612x612.jpg?itok=ZwuIlLzB"></a>Why do we impart value to currency and not money? 



<p>A question that is not satisfactorily answered today is why is it that an unbacked fiat currency has value as a medium of exchange. Some say that it reflects faith in and the credit standing of the issuer. Others say that by requiring a nation’s subjects to pay taxes and to account for them guarantees its demand. But these replies ignore the consequences of its massive expansion while the state pretends it to be real money. Sometimes, the consequences can seem benign and at others catastrophic. As explanations for the public’s tolerance of repeated failures of currencies, these answers are insufficient.</p>



<p>Let us do a thought experiment to highlight the depth of the problem. We know that over millennia, metallic metals, particularly gold, silver, and copper came to be used as media of exchange. And we also know that the use of their value was broadened through credit in the form of banknotes and bank deposits. The relationships between legal money, that is gold, silver, or copper and credit in its various forms were defined in Roman law in the sixth century. And we also know that this system of money and credit with the value of credit tied to that of money, despite some ups and downs, has served humanity well ever since.</p>



<p>Now let us assume that in the absence of metallic money, in the dawn of economic time a ruler instructed his subjects to use a new currency which he and only he will issue for the public’s use. This would surely be seen as a benefit to everyone, compared with the pre-existing condition of barter. But the question in our minds must be about the durability of the ruler’s new currency. With no precedent, how is the currency to be valued in the context of the ratios between goods and services bought and sold? And how certain can one be about tomorrow’s value in that context? And what happens if the king loses his power, or dies?</p>



<p>Clearly, without a reference to something else, the king’s new currency is a highly risky proposition and sooner or later will simply fail. And even when a new currency has been introduced and linked to an existing form of money, if the tie is then cut the currency will struggle to survive. Without going into the good reasons why this is so, the empirical evidence confirms it. Chinese merchants no longer use Kubla Khan’s paper made out of mulberry leaves, and German citizens no longer use the paper marks of the early 1920s. But they still refer to metallic money.</p>



<p>Yet today, we impart values to paper currencies issued by our governments in defiance of these outcomes. An explanation was provided by the great Austrian economist, Ludwig von Mises in his regression theorem. He reasonably argued that we refer the value of a medium of exchange today to its value to us yesterday. In other words, we know as producers what we will receive today for our product, based on our experience in the immediate past, and in the same way we refer to our currency values as consumers. Similarly, at a previous time, we referred our experience of currency values to our prior experience. In other words, the credibility and value of currencies are based on a regression into the past.</p>



<p>Mises’s regression theory was broadly confirmed by an earlier writer, Jean-Baptiste Say, who in his&nbsp;Treatise on Political Economy&nbsp;observed:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Custom, therefore, and not the mandate of authority, designates the specific product that shall pass exclusively as money, whether crown pieces or any other commodity whatever.”<a href="https://www.goldmoney.com/research/the-upside-down-world-of-currency#_edn1">[i]</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Custom is why we still think of currencies as money, even though for the last fifty-one years their link with money was abandoned. The day after President Nixon cut the umbilical cord between gold and the dollar, we all continued using dollars and all the other currencies as if nothing had happened. But this was the last step in a long process of freeing the paper dollar from being backed by gold. The habit of the public in valuing currency by regression had served the US Government well and has continued to do so.</p>



 The role of a medium of exchange 



<p>Being backed by no more than government fiat, to properly understand the role that currencies have assumed for themselves, we need to make some comments about why a medium of exchange is needed and its characteristics. The basis was laid out by Jean-Baptiste Say, who described the division of labour and the role of a medium of exchange.</p>



<p>Say observed that human productivity depended on specialisation, with producers obtaining their broader consumption through the medium of exchange. The role of money (and associated credit) is to act as a commodity valued on the basis of its use in exchange. Therefore, money is simply the right, or title, to acquire some consumer satisfaction from someone else. Following on from Say’s law, when any economic quantity is exchanged for any other economic quantity, each is termed the value of the other. But when one of the quantities is money, the other quantities are given a price. Price, therefore, is always value expressed in money. For this reason, money has no price, which is confined entirely to the goods and services in an exchange.</p>



<p>So long as currency and associated forms of credit are firmly attached to money such that there are minimal differences between their values, there should be no price for them either, other than a value difference arising from counterparty risk. A further distinction between money and currencies can arise if their users suspect that the link might break down. It was the breakdown in this relationship between gold and the dollar that led to the failure of the Bretton Woods agreement in 1971.</p>



<p>Therefore, in all logic it is legal money that has no price. But does that mean that when its value differs from that of money, does currency have a price? Not necessarily. So long as currency operates as a medium of exchange, it has a value and not a price. We can say that a dollar is valued at 0.0005682 ounces of gold, or gold is valued at 1760 dollars. As a legacy of the dollar’s regression from the days when it was on a gold standard, we still attribute no price to the dollar, but now we attribute a price to gold. To do so is technically incorrect.</p>



<p>Perhaps an argument for this state of affairs is that gold is subject to Gresham’s law, being hoarded rather than spent. It is the medium of exchange of last resort so rarely circulates. Nevertheless, fiat currencies have consistently lost value relative to legal money, which is gold, so much so that the dollar has lost 98% since the suspension of Bretton Woods, and sterling has lost 99%. Over fifty-one years, the process has been so gradual that users of unanchored currencies as their media of exchange have failed to notice it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This gradual loss of purchasing power relative to gold can continue indefinitely, so long as the conditions that have permitted it to happen remain without causing undue alarm. Furthermore, for lack of a replacement it is highly inconvenient for currency users to consider that their currency might be valueless. They will hang on to the myth of its use value until its debasement can no longer be ignored.</p>



 What is the purpose of interest rates? 



<p>Despite the accumulating evidence that central bank management of interest rates fails to achieve their desired outcomes, monetary policy committees persist in using interest rates as their primary means of economic intervention. It was the central bankers’ economic guru himself who pointed out that interest rates correlated with the general level of prices and not the rate of price inflation. And Keynes even named it Gibson’s paradox after Arthur Gibson, who wrote about it in&nbsp;Banker’s Magazine&nbsp;in 1923 (it had actually been noted by Thomas Tooke a century before). But because he couldn’t understand why these correlations were the opposite of what he expected, Keynes ignored it and so have his epigonic central bankers ever since.</p>



<p>As was often the case, Keynes was looking through the wrong end of the telescope. The reason interest rates rose and fell with the general price level was that price levels were not driven by interest rates, but interest rates reacted to changes in the general level of prices. Interest rates reflect the loss of purchasing power for money when the quantity of credit increases. With their interests firmly attached to time preference, savers required compensation for the debasement of credit, while borrowers — mainly businesses in production — needed to bid up for credit to pay for higher input costs. Essentially, interest rates changed as a lagging indicator, not a leading one as Keynes and his acolytes to this day still assume.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, that is why Gibson’s paradox is not a paradox but a natural consequence of fluctuations in credit and the foreign exchanges and the public’s valuation of it relative to goods. And the way to smooth out the cyclical consequences for prices is to stop discouraging savers from saving and make them personally responsible for their future security. As demonstrated today by Japan’s relatively low CPI inflation rate, a savings driven economy sees credit stimulation fuelling savings rather than consumption, providing capital for manufacturing improvements instead of raising consumer prices. Keynes’s savings paradox — another fatal error — actually points towards the opposite of economic and price stability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is over interest rate management that central banks prove their worthlessness. Even if they had a Damascene conversion, bureaucrats in a government department can never impose decisions that can only be efficiently determined by market forces. It is the same fault exhibited in communist regimes, where the state tries to manage the supply of goods— and we know, unless we have forgotten, the futility of state direction of production. It is exactly the same with monetary policy. Just as the conditions that led the communists to build an iron curtain to prevent their reluctant subjects escaping from authoritarianism, there should be no monetary policy.</p>



<p>Instead, when things don’t go their way, like the communists, bureaucrats double down on their misguided policies suppressing the evidence of their failures. It is something of a miracle that the economic consequences have not been worse. It is testament to the robustness of human action that when officialdom places mountainous hurdles in its path ordinary folk manage to find a way to get on with their lives despite the intervention.</p>



<p>Eventually, the piper must be paid. Misguided interest rate policies led to their suppression to the zero bound, and for the euro, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc, even unnaturally negative deposit rates. Predictably, the distortions of these policies together with central bank credit inflation through quantitative easing are leading to pay-back time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rapidly rising commodity, producer and consumer prices, the consequences of these policy mistakes, are in turn leading to higher time preference discounts. Finally, markets have wrested currency and credit valuations out of central banks’ control, as it slowly dawns on market participants that the whole interest rate game has been an economic fallacy. Foreign creditors are no longer prepared to sit there and accept deposit rates and bond yields which do not compensate them for loss of purchasing power. Time preference is now mauling central bankers and their cherished delusions. They have lost their suppressive control over markets and now we must all face the consequences. Like the fate of the Berlin Wall that had kept Germany’s Ossies penned in, monetary policy control is being demolished.</p>



<p>With purchasing powers for the major currencies now sinking at a more rapid rate than current levels of interest rate and bond yield compensation, the underlying trend for interest rates is now rising and has further to go. Official forecasts that inflation at the CPU level will return to the targeted 2% in a year or two are pie in the sky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Nero-like, central bankers fiddle commercial banks are being burned. A consequence of zero and negative rates has been that commercial bank balance sheet leverage increased stratospherically to compensate for suppressed lending margins. Commercial bankers now have an overriding imperative to claw back their credit expansion in the knowledge that in a rising interest rate environment, their unfettered involvement in non-banking financial activities comes at a cost. Losses on financial collateral are mounting, and the provision of liquidity into mainline non-financial sectors faces losses as well. And when you have a balance sheet leverage ratio of assets to equity of over twenty times (as is the case for the large Japanese and Eurozone banks), balance sheet equity is almost certain to be wiped out.</p>



<p>The imperative for action is immediate. Any banker who does not act with the utmost urgency faces the prospect of being overwhelmed by the new interest rate trend. The chart below shows that the broadest measure of US money supply, which is substantially the counterparty of bank credit is already contracting, having declined by $236bn since March.</p>







<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2022-11-19_14-00-29.jpg?itok=O0IZnId6"></a></p>



<p>Contracting bank credit forces up interest rates due to lower credit supply. This is a trend that cannot be bucked, a factor that has little directly to do with prices. By way of confirmation of the new trend, the following quotation is extracted from the Fed’s monthly Senior Loan Officers’ Opinion Survey for October:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Over the third quarter, significant net shares of banks reported having tightened standards on C&amp;I [commercial and industrial] loans to firms of all sizes.&nbsp;Banks also reported having tightened most queried terms on C&amp;I loans to firms of all sizes over the third quarter. Tightening was most widely reported for premiums charged on riskier loans, costs of credit lines, and spreads of loan rates over the cost of funds. In addition, significant net shares of banks reported having tightened loan covenants to large and middle-market firms, while moderate net shares of banks reported having tightened covenants to small firms. Similarly, a moderate net share of foreign banks reported having tightened standards for C&amp;I loans.</p>



<p>“Major net shares of banks that reported having tightened standards or terms cited a less favourable or more uncertain economic outlook, a reduced tolerance for risk, and the worsening of industry-specific problems as important reasons for doing so. Significant net shares of banks also cited decreased liquidity in the secondary market for C&amp;I loans and less aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as important reasons for tightening lending standards and terms.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Similarly, credit is being withdrawn from financial activities. The following chart reflects collapsing credit levels being provided to speculators.</p>







<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2022-11-19_14-01-45.jpg?itok=KL0OWYpU"></a>In the same way that the withdrawal of bank credit undermines nominal GDP (because nearly all GDP transactions are settled in bank credit) the withdrawal of bank credit also undermines financial asset values. And just as it is a mistake to think that a contraction of GDP is driven by a decline in economic activity rather than the availability of bank credit, it is a mistake to ignore the role of bank credit in driving financial market valuations.</p>



<p>The statistics are yet to reflect credit contraction in the Eurozone and Japan, which are the most highly leveraged of the major banking systems. This may be partly due to the rapidity with which credit conditions are deteriorating. And we should note that the advanced socialisation of credit in these two regions probably makes senior managements more beholden to their banking authorities, and less entrepreneurial in their big-picture awareness than their American counterparts. Furthermore, the principal reason for continued monetary expansion reflects both the euro-system and the Bank of Japan’s continuing balance sheet expansion, which feed directly into the commercial banking network bolstering their balance sheets. It is likely to be state-demanded credit which overwhelms the Eurozone and Japan’s statistics, masking deteriorating changes in credit supply for commercial demand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ECB and BOJ’s monetary policies have been to compromise their respective currencies by their continuing credit expansion, which is why their currencies have lost significant ground against the dollar while US interest rates have been rising. Adding to the tension, the US’s Fed has been jawing up its attack on price inflation, but the recent fall in the dollar on the foreign exchanges strongly suggests a pivot in this policy is in sight.</p>



<p>The dilemma facing central banks is one their own making. Having suppressed interest rates to the zero bound and below, the reversal of this trend is now out of their control. Commercial banks will surely react in the face of this new interest rate trend and seek to contract their balance sheets as rapidly as possible. Students of Austrian business cycle theory will not be surprised at the suddenness of this development. But all GDP transactions, with very limited minor cash exceptions at the retail end of gross output are settled in bank credit. Inevitably the withdrawal of credit will cause nominal GDP to contract significantly, a collapse made more severe in real terms when the decline in a currency’s purchasing power is taken into consideration.</p>



<p>The choice now facing bureaucratic officialdom is simple: does it prioritise rescuing financial markets and the non-financial economy from deflation, or does it ignore the economic consequences of protecting the currency instead? The ECB, BOJ and the Bank of England have decided their duty lies with supporting the economy and financial markets. Perhaps driven in part by central banking consensus, the Fed now appears to be choosing to protect the US economy and its financial markets as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The principal policy in the new pivot will be the same: suppress interest rates below their time preference. It is the policy mistake that the bureaucrats always make, and they will double down on their earlier failures. The extent to which they suppress interest rates will be reflected in the loss of purchasing power of their currencies, not in terms of their values against each other, but in their values with respect to energy, commodities, raw materials, foodstuffs, and precious metals. In other words, a new round of higher producer and consumer prices and therefore irresistible pressure for yet higher interest rates will emerge.</p>



 The collapse of the everything bubble 



<p>The flip side of interest rate trends is the value imparted to assets, both financial and non-financial. It is no accident that the biggest and most widespread global bull market in history has coincided with interest rate suppression to zero and even lower over the last four decades. Equally, a trend of rising interest rates will have the opposite effect.</p>



<p>Unlike bull markets, bear markets are often sudden and shocking, especially where undue speculation has been previously involved. There is no better example than that of the cryptocurrency phenomenon, which has already seen bitcoin fall from a high of $68,000 to $16,000 in twelve months. And in recent days, the collapse of one of the largest crypto-exchanges, FTX, has exposed both hubris and alleged fraud, handmaidens to extreme public speculation, on an unimaginable scale. For any student of the madness of crowds, it would be surprising if the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies actually survives.</p>



<p>Driving this volte-face into bear markets is the decline in bond values. On 20 March 2020, when the Fed reduced its fund rate to zero, the 30-year US Treasury bond yielded 1.18%. Earlier this week the yield stood at 4.06%. That’s a fall in price of over 50%. And time preference suggests that short-term rates, for example over one year, should currently discount a loss of currency’s purchasing power at double current rates, or even more.</p>



<p>For the planners who meddle with interest rates, increases in rates and bond yields on that scale are unimaginable. Monetary policy committees, being government agencies, will think primarily about the effect on government finances. In their nightmares they can envisage tax revenues collapsing, welfare commitments soaring, and borrowing costs mounting. The increased deficit, additional to current shortfalls, would require central banks to accelerate quantitative easing without limitation. To the policy planners, the reasons to bring interest rates both lower and back firmly under control are compelling.</p>



<p>Furthermore, officials believe that a rising stock market is necessary to maintain economic confidence. That also requires the enforcement of a new declining interest rate trend. The argument in favour of a new round of interest rate suppression becomes undeniable. But the effect on fiat currencies will accelerate their loss of purchasing power, undermining confidence in them and leading to yet higher interest rates in the future.</p>



<p>Either way, officialdom loses. And the public will pay the price for meekly going along with these errors.</p>



 Managing counterparty risk 



<p>Any recovery in financial asset values, such as that currently in play, is bound to be little more than a rally in an ongoing bear market. We must not forget that commercial bankers have to reduce their balance sheets ruthlessly if they are to protect their shareholders. Consequently, as over-leveraged international banks are at a heightened risk of failing in the new interest rate environment, their counterparties face systemic risks increasing sharply. To reduce exposure to these risks, all bankers are duty bound to their shareholders to shrink their obligations to other banks, which means that the estimated $600 trillion of notional over the counter (OTC) derivatives and on the back of it the additional $50 trillion regulated futures exchange derivatives will enter their own secular bear markets. OTC and regulated derivatives are the children of falling interest rates, and with a new trend of rising interest rates their parentage is bound to be tested.</p>



<p>We can now see a further reason why central banks will wish to suppress interest rates and support financial markets. Unless they do so, the risk of widespread market failures between derivative counterparties will threaten to collapse the entire global banking network. And that is in addition to existential risks from customer loan defaults and collapsing collateral values. Central banks will have to stand ready to rescue failing banks and underwrite the entire commercial system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To avert this risk, they will wish to stabilise markets and prevent further increases in interest rates. And all central banks which have indulged in QE already have mark-to-market losses that have wiped out their own balance sheet equity. We now face the prospect of central banks that by any commercial measure are themselves financially broken, tasked with saving entire commercial banking networks.</p>



<p>When the trend for interest rates was for them to fall under the influence of increasing supplies of credit, the deployment of that credit was substantially directed into financial assets and increasing speculation. For this reason, markets soared while the increase in the general level of producer and consumer prices was considerably less than the expansion of credit suggested should be the case. That is no longer so, with manufacturers facing substantial increases in their input costs. And now, when they need it most, bank credit is being withdrawn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not generally realised yet, but the financial world is in transition between economies being driven by asset inflation and suppressed commodity prices, and a new environment of asset deflation while commodity prices increase. And it is in the valuations of unanchored fiat currencies where this transition will be reflected most.</p>



 Physical commodities are set replace paper equivalents 



<p>The expansion of derivatives when credit was expanding served to soak up demand for commodities which would otherwise have gone into physical metals and energy. In the case of precious metals, this is admitted by those involved in the expansion of London’s bullion market from the 1980s onwards to have been a deliberate policy to suppress gold as a rival to the dollar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Bank for International Settlements, at the end of last year gold OTC outstanding swaps and forwards (essentially, the London Bullion Market) stood at the equivalent of 8,968 tonnes of bullion, to which must be added the 1,594 tonnes of paper futures on Comex giving an identified 10,662 tonnes. This is considerably more than the official reserves of the US Treasury, and even its partial replacement with physical bullion will have a major impact on gold values. Silver, which is an extremely tight market, is most of the BIS’s other precious metal statistics content and faces bullion replacement of OTC paper in the order of three billion ounces, to which we must add Comex futures equivalent to a further 700 million ounces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the winding down of derivative markets alone, the impact on precious metal values is bound to be substantial. Furthermore, the common mistake made by almost all derivative traders is to not understand that legal money is physical gold and silver — despite what their regulating governments force them to believe. What they call prices for gold and silver are not prices, but values imparted to legal money from depreciating currencies and associated credit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it may be hard to grasp this seemingly upside-down concept, it is vital to understand that so-called rising prices for gold and silver are in fact falling values for currencies. Some central banks, predominantly in Asia are taking advantage of this ignorance, which is predominantly displayed in western, Keynesian-driven derivative markets.</p>



<p>Perhaps after a currency hiatus and when market misconceptions are ironed out, we can expect legal money values to behave as they should. If a development which is clearly inflationary emerges, it should drive currency values lower relative to gold. But instead, in today’s markets we see them rise because speculators take the view that currencies relative to gold will benefit from higher interest rates. A pause for thought should expose the fallacy of this approach, where the true relationship between money and currencies is assumed away.</p>



<p>In the wake of the suspension of the Bretton Woods agreement and when the purchasing power of currencies subsequently declined, interest rates and the value of gold rose together. In February 1972, gold was valued at $85, while the Fed funds rate was 3.3%. On 21 January 1980 gold was fixed that morning at $850, and the Fed funds rate was 13.82%. When gold increased nine-fold, the Fed’s fund rate had more than quadrupled. And it required Paul Volcker to raise the funds rate to over 19% twice subsequently to slay the inflation dragon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the seventies, the excessive credit-driven speculation that we now witness was absent, along with the accompanying debt leverage in the financial sectors of western economies and in their banking systems. A Volcker-style rise in interest rates today would cause widespread bankruptcies and without doubt crash the entire global banking system. While markets might take us there anyway, as a deliberate act of official policy it can be safely ruled out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We must therefore conclude that there is another round of currency destruction in the offing. Potentially, it will be far more extensive than anything seen to date. Not only will central-bank currency and QE expansion fund government deficits and attempt to compensate for the contraction of bank credit while supporting financial markets by firmly suppressing interest rates and bond yields, but insolvent central banks will be tasked with underwriting insolvent commercial banks.</p>



<p>At some stage, the inversion of monetary reality, where legal money is priced in fiat, will change. Instead of legal money being priced in fiat, fiat currencies will be priced in legal money. But that will be the death of the fiat swindle.</p>

 <a href="https://structuredweb.com/"></a>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak_lafWYacQ">this video</a> Steven Kellam walks the audience through how Zoom put the boom in partner engagement and demand generation with personalized video. 
<p>At 00:10, he introduces himself as the Chief Revenue Officer at <a href="https://www.structuredweb.com/">StructuredWeb</a>, and from 00:42 introduces the guest speakers for this webinar: Gerard Suppa, Director of Product Management at StructuredWeb and Joan Morales, Head of Partner Marketing at Zoom.</p>
<p>At 01:25, Steven outlines the 3 takeaways of the webinar. The first one is ‘what is a Personalized video and why is it an imperative?’</p>
<p>The second one is ‘How can channel marketers easily enable Personalized video for their partners?’ and the third is ‘The real demonstration of Personalized video from both partner’s and vendor’s perspectives’.</p>
 Overview of StructuredWeb 
<p>From 02:28, Steven gives a brief overview of StructuredWeb: They provide a powerful and easy-to-use channel marketing automation platform, and he outlines their three key differentiators:</p>
<p>The first is Partner Experience, the second is that StructuredWeb is entirely focused on channel marketing, and the third differentiator is that StructuredWeb is a data-driven organization.</p>
<p>From 04:01 Steven describes a snapshot of the tools and capabilities that StructuredWeb enables for channel marketers and partners.</p>
<p>There are 20 tools that are further categorized into 5 categories of marketing tools, digital advertising, content syndication, and customizable assets. Among customizable assets, one of the tools is a Personalized video, which this webinar explains.</p>
<p>At 05:08 Steven shows their hybrid engagement model and the three ways StructuredWeb allows vendors to interact with their partners.</p>
<p>The first and the simplest way is a self-serve portal, the second is a marketing concierge where they execute and build campaigns for the partners, and the third is an agency marketplace which is for high-potential strategic partners.</p>
<p>At 05:58, he shows the brands and technology partners that they work with. These include IBM, Zoom, Google, etc.</p>
 Personalized Video 
<p>From 06:41 Steven invites Gerard to explain what is a Personalized video from a partner’s perspective.</p>
<p>Gerard explains that the main concept of personalized video is to infuse video with your company branding into a video, and as you would expect the key element is to personalize the message that you are sending in a video. This personal touch will help in connecting with customers, increase email conversions, and improve customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>At 07:53 Steven invites Joan from Zoom to talk about why personalized video is so critical to them. Joan states that being a part of Zoom, video is naturally very critical for everything they do from a communication perspective.</p>
<p>Secondly, it provides partners a way to reach out to their customers, and thirdly in many cases partners need to sell complex solutions and a video can best explain the details, such as whether it is a subscription service or a product.</p>
<p>From 09:24 Steven adds to Joan’s perspective on the importance of video for the faster transferring of complex messages to customers. Joan also states that video can now be inserted in many places on the web including all social media and other platforms.</p>
 Vendor Demonstration 
<p>From 11:05 Steven hands the discussion over to Joan, who will walk the audience through personalized video from a vendor’s perspective.</p>
<p>11:28 – Joan takes the stage and starts with the partner demand center that they have developed for their partners, sharing his screen to show the environment that they have built. At Zoom, they didn’t have a co-marketing platform for scale and so they built it with StructuredWeb.</p>
<p>On this platform, they have a section for campaigns that partners can leverage. Multiple campaigns are available here and more are created regularly. Partners can also filter that content easily or can activate any of the campaigns and it includes the facility for translating any of the campaigns into any language. In these campaigns, you have landing pages, emails, social media, banners, and everything that will be part of the campaign.</p>
<p>You can also edit and personalize your campaigns, and download them. All of this is available in campaigns and the asset library section. In the asset library, the partners can come and find an asset that they may need, where they can search for anything and the results will be filtered. Partners can also filter these results by language, solution, type of asset, and campaign focus. The important thing is that you can also share these results with one of your partners.</p>
<p>In this partner demand center, they also have social syndication, web syndication, event syndication, and video marketing. Finally, if partners need any sort of help, everything is present in the knowledge hub. Partners can receive help via the marketing concierge service and support is provided in their region from a local member of their team.</p>
 How does Video Personalization work? 
<p>At 18:52 Steven turns to Gerard to walk the audience through how simple it is to make video personalization work from both the vendor and the partner side.</p>
<p>From 19:02 Gerard shares his partner’s demand center and shows the video section in the navigation bar. Here, not only is the video library present but you can also go back to any previous videos that they have customized previously.</p>
<p>In the video library, we can see a plethora of videos that have already been produced. There are professional marketing videos with some of them having language support. We can preview any of the videos and can also perform certain actions with videos. We can share them via direct link, embed videos on a website, and also download a particular video.</p>
<p>At 21:10 Gerard clicks on customizing the video option, which takes a couple of seconds, and makes a customized version of this. Gerard also mentions the key aspect of the interface, i.e., simplicity and ease of use. In the customized options panel, there are a few more options that we can use to personalize this video. We can edit the intro scene message, which will appear at the start of the video.</p>
<p>If we want to further personalize that video, we can add the person’s name whom we are going to address. There is also an option for the outro where we can put another message. We can also select the music for the intro and outro. In the last option, we can select the background color intro and outro according to our branding.</p>
<p>At 24:40 he applies changes to the setting made on the video. During this time, on the right-hand side of the video preview, we can see the changes being processed and applied to the customized video. After the video is ready to be used, we can then preview it. Once the video completes, we can see that the outro also contains our personalized information pulled in automatically. All of this information is pulled from our partner profile within the platform.</p>
<p>From 27:10 Steven asks Gerard a question about whether one can embed a Calendly link in the outro, for a clear call to action? Gerard then says that it can be displayed on the video but it would not be an active link on the video itself. However, it can be included as a visual piece for customers.</p>
<p>At 27:54, Gerard explains the next step once we have done customizing our video. Once we are done with our video editing, we can then go to the share tab. On the share tab, there are three different options on how we can use this video. The first is a direct share link, the second is embedding the video on a website, or we can also download the video.</p>
 Wrap Up 
<p>At 29:10 Steven concludes the webinar by pulling up some numbers for the audience. Steven asks Christopher to show some facts and figures, who highlights that almost 87% of businesses use video for marketing purposes. 84% of them say that video helps them generate more leads, and 78% say that it increased sales.</p>
<p>Demonstrating the power of StructuredWeb, for personalized video these facts become even better. It generated 8x higher conversion rates and 5x higher engagement rates.</p>
<p>At 30:00 Steven outlines the five key takeaways for partners and vendors.</p>
<p>The first one is the ease of use both from the vendor and partner’s perspectives. The second was brand integrity, third was personalized messaging where we can send messages personalized to our users. The fourth was co-branding by which we can use our brand color and company logo. Joan explains the fifth one which is amplification reach by which partners and vendors can both experience increased business success.</p>

<p>In the first of our series of upcoming member spotlights we interviewed PassiveBolt’s co-founder Kabir Maiga. His company is an Associate Member of DIF and he shares some of PassiveBolt’s work in advancing decentralized access as a Tier1 supplier. </p><p>TRANSCRIPT:</p><p>Limari: Welcome<br></p><p>Kabir: Thanks for having me. <br></p><p>Limari: What I always like to ask people just in the decentralized space is really what's your journey, because decentralized identity, it is relatively new and people have all sorts of interesting stories about how they came into this space. So I just wanted to maybe get your background and how you came to work on what you are developing at this moment?<br></p><p>Kabir: Yeah. Oh, absolutely. So I started out as an engineer, gosh I guess I'm getting old, I graduated almost 14 years ago now. Wow. And yeah, electrical engineer, worked in the automotive industry, worked in investment banking, as a software engineer, went and got a master's degree in business from Ross at the University of Michigan, and really ended up going back into the automotive industry where I got into access control. That's basically keyless entry systems for cars. You're probably familiar with some of the tech that I used to work on, which is touching the vehicle door handle to unlock, not using your phone to control access to your car, things like that. It was a great experience, great team. We worked on tech that eventually has gotten deployed in over 120 million vehicles globally. So a really exciting project. But it's really working on that project I think I had an epiphany or idea which is, the automotive industry at the time, this was the 2016-18 timeframe, seemed to be ahead of the rest in access control, in terms of &nbsp;its technology stack. I think one of the reasons why that was the case is because it had an entire Tier 1 class of companies that basically innovated and supplied OEMs. (Original Equipment Manufacturers) So OEMs never had to worry about designing the latest closure systems, they would just source it from innovative suppliers. So really bringing that type enabling class of company to the rest of access control was what I set out to do, and worked to spin off with my core team out of continental automotive, where I used to work, which is a 50 billion euro automotive Tier 1 one of the leading Tier 1s. I was able to get the blessing to really spin off and start PassiveBolt as a separate company with the express intent of really looking at how do we enable companies that make products and solutions, security solutions for controlling how people get in and out of secure spaces? </p><p>One opportunity that we saw is really providing that tier one base to security industry companies that design access control solutions across the board. In doing that, we quickly realize how fragmented it all is. A lot of it had to do with systems being siloed. Each system is behind its own login. I &nbsp;don't care if you bought a smart safe, to unlock it you need an app, or &nbsp;to unlock your smart lock you added on some door. It doesn't matter what you do. If I sat down and said what would it all look like in five, ten or twenty years down the line, I can imagine owning 100 apps just to access physical spaces. &nbsp;Because as hotels, car rentals, you know all physical spaces became smart, I will just be onboarding and creating digital identities in several different silos and my data living on all of those systems. That's really what got us into decentralized identity, because that clearly was not a future that I wanted to live in. So we really transformed PassiveBolt into a web3 focused company that's really pioneering access control by leveraging an identity meta system. We're creating and establishing basically the identity layer, the missing identity layer in physical space network communications. That's for the security industry more specifically. In other words, we basically want to enable identity wallets, SSI or decentralized identity based wallets to unlock any and all physical spaces. One obvious application of digital identity is in machine to machine interactions, you know, password-less login or supply chain or provenance, etc. IoT is a great opportunity as well, in the sense that we do live in a physical world and access in physical spaces, it means that if I'm leveraging my digital identity to do so, I need protocols in place to allow me or my wallet to talk to physical spaces, right to be able to convey a verifiable credential that shows that I have access to a specific space.</p><p>Limari: Yeah that's very interesting. I think for a lot of people, the &nbsp;issue of identity, it's kind of front and center for them. I think just the general populace are confronted with the problems of that. It's interesting just imagining a world where you need 100 different apps to access everything that you own, all spaces that you own and just how unsustainable that is. I think that some people may be wondering, “How is this different from my keyless entry I already have, or &nbsp;is what you're doing better than what I have. You highlight a very important point in that, as you keep growing this centralized model, it becomes very unsustainable. But I would be interested, I mean, our audience, a lot of them are involved with deep tech. If you did want to go a little bit more in depth on the decentralized aspect of PassiveBolt, feel free to fill some of that in some more, and then maybe, what are some of the interests you have in the decentralized identity community and how it intersects that?<br></p><p>Kabir: Yeah so we've basically created a technology stack from the root, meaning the blockchain layer all the way up to physical devices for physical spaces. So you know the bottom layer is obviously the identity meta system itself so the root of trust. We created a blockchain that is purpose built for digital identity. So really it's effectively a registry, a verifiable data registry for digital identifiers, but specifically addresses the needs of the security industry. We could have gone with an existing platform, or an existing blockchain, I should say. But we wanted a blockchain that's built for and by the security industry, that all manufacturers of physical security systems can leverage. So consider that a common public registry for the security industry. The second layer, and I should say that, first, the bottom layer, was obviously put in, in the public domain, it's a public utility for the security industry. So PassiveBolt obviously conceived of it, built it, but again, it is intended to be governed and maintained by the security industry itself as a whole. &nbsp;To clarify maybe for some of our viewers, by security industry I'm referring specifically to manufacturers of access control systems hardware like locks, etc, or software solutions like physical access control software for issuing key cards to people or mobile keys to people, things like that. The second layer, obviously once you have a registry is now you have to have the software stack to go with it. So &nbsp;there's the identity wallet, and you have the attestation infrastructure, or to use the W3C language, the verifiable credential layer. So we have those two layers above where we basically created protocols that allow the use of verifiable credentials, digital agents and, or wallets, containing wallets, to be able to communicate with physical devices. So in essence, any lock that can do cryptography can be made into a web3 device. </p><p>One thing that was important to us is not imagining every manager of physical space having to rip out their hardware. That might be counterproductive, and the investment would be significant to be able to deploy decentralized identity in terms of physical access. So our solution is really to create an offline way of being able to utilize a verifiable credential to unlock physical spaces and that's what we did. &nbsp;So that layer protocol that we've created at PassiveBolt really allows any and all digital agents to be able to achieve that. Our identity wallet that we created &nbsp;is just one first implementation on top of that blockchain that I mentioned. It allows you to set up your PII &nbsp;to be able to receive verifiable credentials and be able to share them. PII being personally identifiable information. But what's great about this is there was a time where if you wanted access to physical spaces, your only option was to surrender PII somewhere in exchange for a keycard. So here's who I am, put it in a database that you get to store and I get a key card and I can badge into that hotel room or office or whatever. Then we switched to doing it over mobile using mobile keys, but then we never really did fix that identity piece of it. Now I'm logging, I'm registering, I'm surrendering PII to create an account number which is effectively a digital identity into that siloed system. Then I can receive a digital key. In this paradigm, leveraging decentralized identity, you don't have to log into anything of course with your identity while you're self sovereign. Using just your identifier, we have protocol, &nbsp;where you can basically be assigned access to a space, without sharing any PII, without the access provider needing to store any personal information about you. It makes it interoperable. So you can get into, with your identity wallet, you can get into any and all web3 capable physical spaces.<br></p>The team at PassiveBolt<p>Limari: That's amazing. Maybe you can give us just kind of a brief idea, maybe &nbsp;a vision for people someday using this technology, this is how you're going to be able to go through spaces, maybe kind of like a real life use case.</p><p>Kabir: &nbsp;Here's what I want you to be able to do. I want you a couple years down the road, to be able to grab your identity wallet, and book a vacation somewhere using your identity wallet. You publish your need. So looking for a hotel, let's say you're going to New York City, looking for a hotel and a car rental in New York City for these days. You get offers, private offers from hotels and &nbsp;travel service providers, generally speaking, so that they are now able to give you a direct offer via DID to DID communication, which means they're not giving you a rate that's public. So they can be more aggressive to get your business to improve their occupancy rate. You're able to book seamlessly and deal with a direct relationship with a service provider. Then you show up at the airport, I want you to be able to just tap your device and prove your identity. You are who you say you are, and it's verified. Obviously, for government purposes, let's throw in two factor authentication or facial recognition. You get to the plane, you've got your plane ticket that was delivered in that booking that you did with one click and you're able to just tap again, to just prove that you are who you are, and you walk onto the plane with your seat. You land in New York City. I want you to just be able to walk onto the Hertz parking lot or company alpha and just go straight to spot seven B where they told you your vehicle is parked and you tap and it unlocks. You go in, you push a button, it starts, no key exchange no need to interact with anyone perhaps. You drive to hotel beta, at that hotel beta, you walk in, you go to room 402, no stops needed, unless you want to say hello to somebody. If you tap your identity wallet again, the room unlocks and you go in. &nbsp;All of this is possible because from when you did your booking, be it through the wallet or through an aggregator, doesn't have to be through the wallet, you were delivered verifiable credentials through that device, through that wallet. Those verifiable credentials have allowed you to unlock all of those physical spaces along the way. I really emphasize access to physical spaces, because there's a tendency to always focus on virtual spaces like apps, websites and the like. I think there's significant value as we build decentralized identity ecosystems to really capture physical spaces, because that's where we live. This whole journey that I described, your trip from California to New York is you needing to get into all the physical spaces in between to get to your hotel room, and then to maybe that concert later that evening. It's all physical spaces. That's really what we want to help shape and build.<br></p><p>Limari: That's really really amazing and I know that for a lot of people not working within this space, on this technology, some of this is very hard to grasp because we are so shaped by just the centralized system that we are living in today. The fact that we are able to do that without giving away all of this personally identifiable information, it's just amazing that we can have that capability. So one last thing I'm curious to hear your thoughts about is just in terms of the community at DIF, if there's been any work items, like maybe you've had your eye on that you find are interesting here in this space that you think might contribute to what you're doing at PassiveBolt?<br></p><p>Kabir: I think &nbsp;many of the working groups are phenomenal, messaging is one that comes to mind. I think the group that I've been particularly interested in and really participated in every week is the Travel SIG within DIF. The Travel SIG is currently working on travel profiles, which is really a way to simplify how you communicate information data to travel providers. So that experience I had described between California and in New York your ability to do it with a single click, just give them the information they need, authorized access to information, they need to provide you of service, but in a way that preserves PII and preserves privacy, that's key. The work that DIF is doing, I think is to come up with a standard. We have a way we're doing it at PassiveBolt, but working through DIF we’re hoping to have a standardized way of doing it. &nbsp;I think all the great minds you have there, you know &nbsp;people with significant industry experience, travel experience, that we're able to work together with. As technologists, there's nothing better than to really hear direct input from people who've been in the industry for 30, 40 years to make sure that the systems we're designing are taking into account all the different dynamics in the space. So I think that SIG is particularly interesting and work product of a traveler profile schema that will come out of it will be very beneficial, not just to PassiveBolt, but all companies and all entities looking to help us or help everyone really design the traveler experience of the future.<br></p><p>Limari: Just to clarify for our audience who may not be familiar with our open groups at DIF, Kabir is referring to the Hospitality and Travel Special Interest group. It's one of the groups that we have at DIF that anybody can just hop on, and you can join in the discussion there. So awesome. Well, thank you so much. It's been such an interesting conversation. I truly enjoyed learning more about PassiveBolt, what you're doing and how this technology will be applied to travel and to going between spaces, accessing our homes, hotels, etc. So, &nbsp;truly enlightening. Also, maybe if you like to let people know how they can learn more about PassiveBolt.<br></p><p>Kabir: Go to PassiveBolt.com or you can reach out to me if you want to connect Kabir [at] passivebolt.com<br></p><p>Limari: Thank you so much. Once again, I appreciate you taking the time. And thank you everyone who decided to join us today and watch and we'll have many more interviews to come very soon. So thanks.</p><p>Kabir: Thank you</p><p>You can learn more at https://passivebolt.com/ </p><p>If you would like to become a member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation join us at https://identity.foundation/<br></p>

<p>The code documents the values we stand for and the standards of professional conduct we expect.</p> 


<p>At its meeting on October 13 and 14 the OASIS Board of Directors approved a Code of Conduct to apply to all activities of the consortium.</p>



<p>The purpose of the Code of Conduct is to document the values we stand for and the standards of professional conduct we expect from one another. The process document gives instructions for reporting an incident and describes the steps we will take in response.</p>



<p>The code is published on the OASIS Policies &amp; Guidelines page and can be found at <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-participants-code-of-conduct/">https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-participants-code-of-conduct/</a>. A description of the reporting and response process is also available at <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/code-of-conduct-incident-reporting-and-response-process/">https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/code-of-conduct-incident-reporting-and-response-process/</a>.</p>



<p>This code was adapted from the widely-used Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html">https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html</a>.</p>



<p>Projects that have already adopted a Code of Conduct can continue working under their version so long as nothing in it conflicts with or contradicts the OASIS version.</p>



<p>The Board invites feedback from members and project participants on these documents. Feedback can be provided by sending email to oasis-board-comment@lists.oasis-open.org. Suggestions for improvements will be brought the Board’s Governance committee or Process committee for consideration.</p>

<p>Insight: Sharing cybersecurity successes and failures leads to improvement – Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO at the FIDO Alliance, explains why a culture of secrecy surrounding cybersecurity is holding back progress</p>



<p>If your organisation were hit by a cyber attack, would you tell anyone?</p>


 
 


<p>Historically, the answer would be an unequivocal no. Many believe that sharing that you were a target exposes your company’s (or your personal) vulnerabilities, making you more susceptible to further attack or ridicule. But this ‘security by obscurity’ mindset is not only outdated, it hinders the industry’s ability to harden our collective defences, most notably by eliminating our dependence on passwords and other knowledge-based credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While this year saw a 5%-7% drop globally in the use of passwords for entry, it is still by far the most popular online authentication method, which is a big problem. Passwords are not only highly insecure, but they also cause major consumer headaches and are costing businesses; 59% of consumers gave up on accessing an online service and 43% abandoned a purchase when asked for a password in the past month. More than 82% of data breaches are caused by weak or stolen login credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The benefits of multi-factor authentication (MFA) are widely reported but many firms have been sheepish about sharing their adoption figures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This may be because the figures weren’t great. Twitter revealed its two-factor-authentication adoption figures last summer, revealing that just 2.3% of accounts had it enabled. Of those, 80% relied on SMS-based backup, the least secure mode. Communicating this doesn’t make Twitter any less secure. Instead, it sets a powerful benchmark for improvement, and gives the industry a reality check that considerable work remains to get more customers using MFA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other organisations to be applauded are Cloudflare and Twilio. The two cloud computing giants recently reported that they were targeted by a near-exact phishing attack. Employees were targeted with a text message from a supposed IT department, directing them to a fake website requesting a password change. Neither Twilio nor Cloudflare’s monitoring systems detected the attack, and, as you’d expect, some employees were caught off-guard and shared credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Twilio fell victim to the attack (along with dozens of other companies), Cloudflare’s employees were protected because they use Fast ID Online (FIDO) security keys which are tied to users. Origin binding also prevented any credentials from being shared. Since the incident, Twilio has followed Cloudflare’s lead, as it shared in its updated incident report. This is a great example of how sharing successes and failures alike leads to two on the whole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the FIDO Alliance, we’re working with the world’s leading tech companies and consumer service providers to solve this challenge. Together, we’ve created technology that’s increasingly cited as a ‘gold standard’ by governments, including the US’s cybersecurity body, CISA, and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To best defend against cyber attacks, organisations should take inspiration from the Twilio and Cloudflare story and build in security protocols that are phishing-resistant. These protocols are often implemented with USB keys or built-in biometric authentication on devices, and can be added as a critical layer of security to both an organisation’s own network and information, and for customers accessing its services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, the work we do at the FIDO Alliance, creating and implementing new technology, is an important part of moving the world away from passwords and other weak forms of legacy authentication – but it isn’t the most critical piece. Industry-wide commitment to creating intuitive and common user journeys, underpinned by architectural best practices, will enable the kind of cultural shift and mass adoption of this technology that will be required if we want to remove passwords from our daily lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collaboration and transparency are key ingredients that raise the bar for all involved – including for hackers, who need to have a far harder time executing remote attacks.</p>

<p>The Silicon Salon is Back for the New Year!</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons will be facilitating Silicon Salon 3 in mid-January, tentatively on January 18th. These Silicon Salons are an ongoing series of virtual events intended to bridge the gap between wallet requirements and semiconductor development, between academic research and real-world practice. Our ultimate objective is to ensure that the next generation of cryptographic semiconductors meets everyone’s needs, advancing the entire cryptography industry.</p>

<p>We will bring together semiconductor designers, secure hardware developers, academics, and other experts to present at Silicon Salon 3 and are calling for other contributors who are interested in making a presentation focused on silicon-logic-based cryptographic acceleration or support for new functionality such as Multi-Party Computation (MPC) leveraging hardened semiconductor-based security.</p>

<p>The field of MPC (Multi-Party Computation) for security applications has been an area of energetic academic research since first introduced by Andrew Yao in 1986. More recently, increases in computation capability and improvement in the efficiency of algorithms have enabled MPC to move from the theoretical to the practical. Varous MPC-TSS (MPC-Threshold Signature System) approaches offer significant benefits in security, robustness, and recovery versus traditional “single private key” systems. However, practical MPC is still in its infancy and is rapidly evolving, which introduces challenges in providing silicon support for the future of cryptography.</p>

 Read More 



<p>Some presentations lined up so far are:</p>
 
   In Pursuit of an Open Secure Element.  What are the elements that make a semiconductor more or less “open”, and what is really important? 
   Silicon &amp; MPC (Cramium). In this talk Cramium will overview silicon architecture approaches to addressing concerns of security, performance and efficiency, economic concerns, and flexibility to accommodate future improvements.  We will overview some facets of MPC-based distributed key management that receive little academic attention, but are important in a practical context. 
 

<p>If you are interested in making a presentation at Silicon Salon 3, please <a>contact us</a> with a proposal. Include the following:</p>

 
   The title. 
   A summary of what your presentation will be about. 
   A summary of how that relates to silicon-logic-based cryptographic acceleration &amp; new functionality and/or the general topic of integrating cryptography into new semiconductors. Note that this can be a discussion of capabilities from the point of view of a semiconductor manufacturer, of needs from a wallet manufacturer, or other discussions from someone in the broader decentralized community. 
   The name of the presenter(s). 
   A description of who they are and how they or their company have the expertise, capability, or reach to benefit the Silicon Salon conversation. 
 

<p>Final presentations should be about five minutes long, supported by a slide deck or some sort, which you will present in our Zoom salon on the date of the salon.</p>

<p>Please note the following deadlines for Silicon Salon 3 proposals and contributions:</p>

 
   December 23 - Final date for submission of proposals. 
   January 4 — Blockchain Commons selection of proposals. 
   January 11 — Submission of draft slidedecks to Blockchain Commons for any comments. 
   January 16 — Submission of final slidedecks to Blockchain Commons for inclusion in post-event web pages. 
   January 18 — Presentation at Silicon Salon 3. 
   January 25 — Blockchain Commons finalization of web site release. 
 

<p>Also please note that the January 18th date is tentative. We are checking with likely participants for conflicts, and ensuring that the holidays won’t cause too much conflict. If it moves, then the January deadlines will move accordingly.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/action/skills-education/"></a>As described in a <a href="https://digitalscot.net/micro-credentials-building-blocks/">previous blog</a> a key foundation for Scotland’s Digital Education strategy are ‘micro-credentials’, implemented through ‘Digital Badge’ systems. 
<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/skillsdevscot/status/1237702387839762432">this tweet</a>&nbsp;from Skills Development Scotland highlights digital badges offer an ideal starting point for modernizing education in such a way it supports the further modernization and growth of skills and employment.</p>
<p>A number of vendor options are available for implementing such a system:</p>
 Digitary 
<p>A leader in this space is Digitary. As they write here <a href="https://www.digitary.net/the-value-of-digital-badges-in-the-education-sector/">Digital Badges in Education</a> offer the ability for learners to establish portfolios and express knowledge.&nbsp;Critically they demonstrate how they can be applied across the entire educational ecosystem.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://e54b1a5c-a1c1-4de5-92be-372a9479ac65.filesusr.com/ugd/5bcc07_25aca1d75ef040708d1e87318cef59d9.pdf">this news</a>&nbsp;highlights one of the first customers to harness this capability is the Association of the Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada (ARUCC), choosing&nbsp;Digitary&nbsp;as the solution provider for the Made for Canada National Network.</p>
<p>This has been followed by launching ‘<a href="https://e54b1a5c-a1c1-4de5-92be-372a9479ac65.filesusr.com/ugd/5bcc07_b96a19aa6e6c46dd9d1d697089a306e1.pdf">MyCreds</a>‘, a national, bilingual credential wallet supported by a comprehensive website for Canada’s post-secondary community and learners.</p>
<p>This initiative means the Canadian higher education community is creating the very first online platform and national credential wallet for post-secondary learners. Once fully operational, the Network will enable 3 million learners across the country to access and share their official digitized post-secondary transcripts and credentials online – anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>Also as they describe in <a href="https://www.digitary.net/digital-badges-available-to-irish-higher-education-sector/">this news</a>&nbsp;the Irish education sector is adopting this approach too:</p>
<p>“EduCampus and Digitary are excited to announce an additional feature under the collaborative framework agreement, enabling all EduCampus clients from Irish higher education institutions to be able to adopt Digital Badges. Sitting alongside the existing Digitary CORE solution for the issuance of academic credentials, such as degree certificates, academic transcripts, European Diploma Supplements (EDS) and other official academic documents; Digital Badges enables institutions to recognise all kinds of learners skills, competencies and learning experiences.”</p>
 Credly 
<p>Another major player is <a href="https://credly.com/">Credly</a>, who&nbsp;<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/24/credly-raises-11-1-million-to-issue-and-manage-digital-badges/">raised $11m in 2019</a> and were recently&nbsp;<a href="https://plc.pearson.com/en-GB/news/pearson-acquires-digital-credentialing-leader-credly">acquired by Pearson</a>. Their CEO <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelbarthur/2021/07/19/an-innovators-views-on-digital-credentials---from-credlys-jonathan-finkelstein/">describes</a> how they help foster a more diverse and inclusive workforce.</p>
<p>Users include&nbsp;<a href="https://frederick.edu/degrees-certificates/credly.aspx">Frederick College</a>, where they highlight the value of digital badges:</p>
 
 Provide a more complete picture of your interests and experience 
 Show potential employers evidence of your up-to-date proficiency, relevant skill sets, and achievements 
 Help assist employers in matching you to their specific positions 
 Reflect your efforts to engage in more flexible ways of learning and scope of knowledge 
 Can be displayed on social media channels, LinkedIn, emails, and your resume 
 Display current knowledge in your occupational field and reflect professional development 
 
<p>They are widely used across industry, including learning platforms like&nbsp;<a href="https://support.skilljar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055164133-Issue-Credly-s-Badges-on-Course-Completion">Skilljar</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://experience.intellum.com/student/activity/1006629-credly-learner-experience">Intellum</a>, and corporate users like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/Digital-Badges">ISC2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/digital-badges/credly-acclaim-faq.html">Cisco</a>. They are also a great way to add value to your own technology product, for example Optimizely, a Digital Experience Platform,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.optimizely.com/support/education/digital-badging/">offers a digital credential</a>&nbsp;using Credly.

<p>The definitive reference for security advisories expressed in JSON is now published and available</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the publication of its newest OASIS Standard, approved by the members on 18 November 2022:</p>



<p>Common Security Advisory Framework Version 2.0<br>OASIS Standard<br>18 November 2022</p>



<p>This OASIS Standard is the definitive reference for the language elements of CSAF version 2.0. The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) is a language to exchange Security Advisories formulated in JSON.</p>



<p>The term Security Advisory describes any notification of security issues in products to or from product vendors, Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs), product resellers and distributors, and others. The focus of the term is on the security aspect impacting specific product-platform-version combinations. Developers of security scanning tools in particular are likely to find CSAF files most useful.</p>



<p>The TC received 3 Statements of Use from Oracle Corporation, TIBCO Software Inc., and Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) Germany.</p>

		<p>by Trinh Nguyen-Phan</p>
<p>The concept of an “ecosystem” has been increasingly adopted in data management, innovation, and business strategy. Yet, more often it is used metaphorically without a specific reference to the literature. As Socrates (470 – 399 B.C.) put it, “The beginning of wisdom is the definition of terms.” This is especially relevant to the ToIP Ecosystems Foundry Working Group (EFWG) because our very name is based on this term. So the EFWG has been working for over a year to deliver a white paper called <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Ecosystem-Defining-Digital-Trust-Ecosystem-V1.0-2022-10-13.pdf">Defining Digital Trust Ecosystems (PDF)</a>. The first version of this white paper has now been approved by the ToIP Steering Committee and we are pleased to announce its official release.</p>
<p>The white paper draws on the characteristics of natural ecosystems and human economies to propose a concrete definition of digital trust ecosystems. It also discusses the characteristics of digital trust ecosystems, the challenges of sustaining digital trust ecosystems, and the role of the ToIP Foundation.</p>
<p>Given that multiple disciplines use the term “ecosystem” with an implied reference to its biological root, the EFWG&nbsp; asked a biodiversity scientist, Dr. Autumn Watkinson, to introduce us to ecology as a discipline. Based on her talk, we saw many parallels to the work we do in the EFWG. Surveying the literature in biology, psychology, business strategy, and data management, we discovered interesting convergences and divergences of the concept of “ecosystems” in biology and other disciplines. Interconnectedness and competition are the two most referenced characteristics of natural ecosystems in other disciplines; whereas resilience, diversity, and the sustainability mechanism of natural ecosystems are by and large dismissed. This might be caused by the lack of understanding of what natural ecosystems entail, as the renowned forester and writer Wohlleben said in ‘The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate’:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>
“The forest ecosystem is held in a delicate balance. Every being has its niche and its function, which contribute to the well-being of all. Nature is often described like that, or something along those lines; however, that is, unfortunately, false.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>– (Wohlleben, 2015, p. 113)</p>
<p>We suggested three lessons from nature:</p>
 
 First, ecosystems must optimize the diversity of its membership.&nbsp; 
 Second, ecosystems survive and thrive without clear-cut boundaries and no ecosystem is completely independent of others.&nbsp; 
 Third, and most importantly, Digital Trust Ecosystems must have a built-in mechanism to counteract overexploitation. 
 
<p>As the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> aspires to foster decentralized digital trust, these three lessons are particularly pertinent to support, facilitate, and sustain digital trust ecosystems. This applies not just within one ecosystem, but between different digital trust ecosystems. We believe that this work is fundamental to further work on designing ecosystems governance frameworks. We invite you to read the white paper, join the discussion of digital trust ecosystems, and examine the applications of these concepts to your related work.</p>

 Babelfish: Service Integration in Heterogeneous Environments has been selected for funding as one of the brightest projects for building the Next Generation Internet in Europe 
  
<p><a href="https://www.ownyourdata.eu">OwnYo</a>urData and the <a href="https://www.kybernos.com/esg">Kybernos ESG Data Services GmbH</a> are taking part in ONTOCHAIN, to co-develop a new software ecosystem for trusted, traceable &amp; transparent ontological knowledge</p>
 
<p>WHAT IS ONTOCHAIN?</p>
<p>ONTOCHAIN is a new software ecosystem for trusted, traceable &amp; transparent ontological knowledge management funded by the European Commission as part of the Next Generation Internet initiative (NGI).</p>
<p>ONTOCHAIN empowers internet innovators to develop Blockchain-based knowledge management solutions that address the challenge of secure and transparent knowledge management, as well as service interoperability on the Internet.</p>
<p>The ONTOCHAIN software ecosystem aims to demonstrate its potential in high impact domains, such as eHealth, eGovernment, eEducation, eCommerce, decentralised infrastructures and similar, in order to achieve trustworthy information exchange and trustworthy and transactional content handling.</p>
<p>Babelfish is taking part in ONTOCHAIN to provide service integration in heterogeneous environments. Our project proposes to describe services on a technical, semantic, and governance layer and will implement a component that uses such descriptions to translate interfaces (APIs), data, and data agreements from a foreign (and maybe proprietary format) to an interoperable format understood by the recipient. A registry maintains a list of all services and thus spans up an interoperable data space.</p>
<p>HOW WILL IT WORK?</p>
<p>ONTOCHAIN Open Call 3 was looking for interoperable and sustainable applications that employ Semantic Web and Blockchain concepts, to enhance data quality aspect, as well as the trustworthiness of data communication and handling processes.</p>
<p>Web3 innovators were invited to propose applications covering real needs of end users in vital sectors of the European economy, built on top of the software services of the ONTOCHAIN ecosystem. Applicants could also submit proposals around missing blocks of the ONTOCHAIN infrastructure.</p>
<p>A total of 105 projects applied for the call and the evaluation process resulted in the selection of 14 proposals addressing the following topics:</p>
<p>ONTOCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE</p>
 
 Service Integration (Gateways APIs) for ONTOCHAIN applications 
 Energy-efficient and sustainable hosting infrastructure for the ONTOCHAIN software ecosystem and services 
 
<p>ONTOCHAIN APPLICATIONS</p>
 
 Semantic Digital Logbooks for Companies, Buildings, Cars or similar 
 Decentralised Fact Checking and Data Credibility for Social Content 
 Semantic energy data management 
 Automotive, e.g., electric vehicle charging, road side management, car insurance, communication interoperability 
 Distribution Logistics / Supply Chains Using Trustworthy Semantic Data 
 Data/Digital content /Multimedia marketplace, including social media 
 Decentralised Public Services &amp; Common Goods 
 Other applications aligned with ONTOCHAIN objectives 
 
<p>ONTOCHAIN will support Babelfish through a 10-month programme and provide funding support up to 119.500 Euros. As part of the action, experts in diverse fields will also provide technology development guidance, working methodology, as well as access to top infrastructure, coaching, visibility and community building support.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/solutions/blockchain"></a>A major accelerator for Scotland’s economy is the intersection of powerful new technologies with existing high-growth markets. 
 The intersection yields potential for exponential growth as there is a multiplier effect, of further boosting sales of already booming industries, as well as advancing the local technology capabilities in IT sectors that themselves also present hyper-growth opportunities. 
<p>A keynote example of this is ‘Whisky on the Blockchain’, how Scottish whisky suppliers are improving the appeal and sales of their products through tapping into mega trends like NFTs.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/newsroom/2021-exports-show-industry-on-road-to-recovery">Scotch Whisky Association reports</a> in 2021 the value of Scotch Whisky exports was up 19% to £4.51bn, and as <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/blockchain-technology-market-90100890.html">Markets and Markets reports</a> the global Blockchain Market was valued at $4.9 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach $67. 4 billion by 2026.</p>
<p>Building Scotland’s innovation capacity in a market set to grow to over $60 billion, by growing one it’s largest export sectors, offers a concentrated, exponential strategy for economic growth.</p>
 The Whisky Barrel – Scottish Innovators Pioneer World’s First Single Cask Scotch with a Digital Provenance Certificate 
<p>Pioneers of this field include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thewhiskybarrel.com/">The Whisky Barrel</a>, who have launched the world’s first single cask Scotch with a ‘Digital Provenance Certificate’.</p>
<p>The Whisky Barrel project demonstrates i) how they have integrated it into and enhanced their e-commerce strategy, and ii) the technology field is still so young that it’s possible to achieve world firsts, and thus significant competitive advantage and associated PR potential.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.insider.co.uk/news/scotch-whisky-bottler-releases-one-26433299">Insider reported</a> they have released one of the world’s first single-cask Scotch whiskies with a digital provenance certificate, using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to digitally certify its whisky.</p>
<p>This securely transmits essential product information on a public ledger, helping collectors and connoisseurs alleviate the risk of investing in counterfeit whisky.</p>
<p>Each of the 152 individually-numbered bottles feature a unique QR code that links to its corresponding digital certificate.&nbsp;This token provides digital proof of ownership, as well as the provenance of each bottle.&nbsp;Each NFT is minted on the <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana blockchain platform</a>, which was chosen for its carbon-neutral and low-energy consumption qualities.</p>

		 
			 
				Featured Digital Scot: <a href="https://digitalscot.net/directory/listing/cd-corp/">CD Corp</a>.<p></p>
<p>The Whisky Barrel has pioneered this project with the support of CD Corp, who offer a range of marketing, branding &amp; design, web development services as well as commanding experience in creating value-driven NFT projects.</p>

			 
		 
	
 Industry Innovators: Whisky and Digital Art 
<p>The intersection is headlined by initiatives from whisky suppliers to combine their product offerings with NFT digital art.</p>
<p>Other industry innovators include <a href="https://www.alcoholprofessor.com/blog-posts/how-glenrothes-is-distilling-custom-art-amp-real-life-experiences-in-nft-drop">Glenrothes offering</a> a micro (168 bottle) batch of 36-year-old Single Cask Scotch Whisky for $3,600 a bottle with an interactive NFT artwork, and <a href="https://bdaily.co.uk/articles/2022/10/07/scotch-whisky-distillery-blends-tradition-and-innovation-with-nft-collection-launch">Benriach launching</a>&nbsp;a luxury twinset with two bottles exclusively as an NFT.</p>
<p><a href="https://technode.global/2022/05/18/scotch-whisky-johnnie-walker-releases-nfts/">Johnnie Walker is offering</a> seven whisky connoisseurs the chance to own an extremely rare bottle of 48-year-old Johnnie Walker Masters of Flavour NFTs, alongside their very own digital art – The tokens unlock access to a unique piece of graphic design by artist Kode Abdo aka BossLogic.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://bernardmarr.com/glenfiddich-sells-18000-super-rare-whisky-as-nfts-heres-what-that-means/">Bernard Marr writes</a> and explains in the featured videos distillers William Grant and Son have recently sold 15 bottles of 46-year-old Glenfiddich whisky for $18,000 apiece, each one accompanied by its own NFT revolving image/ artistic impression of the bottle that not only allows them to show off their purchase but also acts as a counterfeit-proof certificate of ownership.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/solutions/blockchain/"></a>There are a number of routes available to you for creating Blockchain apps. 
 Ideally the right choice is one that will enable you to launch and bring to market a successful app, quickly and effectively. 
 Zumo Enterprise 
<p>This highlights ventures such as&nbsp;Zumo, the Edinburgh-based crypto wallet and payments platform, who also recently launched <a href="https://zumo.tech/">Zumo Enterprise</a>, its new B2B ‘Crypto-as-a-Service’ solution that enables companies to offer crypto products and services to their customers.</p>
<p>The first of its kind in the UK, Zumo Enterprise is the market’s only full-stack, embedded crypto solution.</p>
<p>Zumo Enterprise allows fintechs and financial institutions to effortlessly embed crypto within their existing infrastructure, offering a fast, flexible, low-barrier and compliant route to market while opening up new revenue streams, attracting new customers and supporting customer retention. It follows on from ZumoKit, a beta product released last year to test out the proposition.</p>
<p>Zumo Enterprise has been created amidst growing demand for crypto products and services, with worldwide adoption jumping by over 880% last year. Businesses realise the scale of this opportunity, with 80% of respondents to a recent global Deloitte survey agreeing their respective industry will see new revenue streams from blockchain, digital assets and crypto solutions, and 73% believing their organisation will lose competitive advantage if it doesn’t adopt such solutions.</p>
<p>Importantly, by being compliant in the UK, Zumo Enterprise enables fintechs and financial institutions to fulfil their duty of care to customers, harnessing crypto solutions in a safe and secure manner. Zumo Enterprise also features an embedded ESG and net zero strategy.</p>
<p>Nick Jones, Co-Founder and CEO, Zumo, said: “Consumer preferences are changing. Digitalisation is accelerating. Amidst an increasingly competitive and fast-evolving financial landscape, the demand for new, alternative solutions is booming.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Zumo’s embedded crypto technology plugs seamlessly into fintechs’ and banks’ existing tech stacks, helping them to tap into this surging demand for digital assets. Zumo Enterprise offers a compliant, flexible solution that removes the need to deploy specialist teams or incur huge development costs. It will help forward-thinking financial institutions to meet the needs of both present and future customers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Available via either API (Application Programming Interface) or SDK (<a href="https://developers.zumo.money/">Software Development Kit</a>), Zumo Enterprise’s white-label solution gives businesses a blockchain-agnostic suite of tools through which to enable customers to securely hold, buy, sell and send digital currencies, complete with wallets, exchange service, and managed onboarding and compliance. Zumo Enterprise’s customers can choose modules as required and benefit from direct access to Zumo’s team of industry experts.</p>
<p>Zumo Enterprise has been developed following the success of the B2C Zumo App, which offers consumers a secure, easy-to-use cryptocurrency wallet that allows anyone to buy, sell, store, send and spend cryptocurrencies alongside traditional British Pounds. Zumo App’s customer base has grown 25% month-on-month since the platform launched in August 2020.</p>
 FinTech Innovation 
<p>These tools provide the foundations for building new financial services and solutions. Zumo have pioneered innovations such as their <a href="https://www.insider.co.uk/news/edinburgh-fintech-launches-pay-crypto-24090015">virtual payment card</a>&nbsp;for example.</p>
<p>Accepting payments is just the building block, the real secret sauce for what will be of great value to SMEs is the increasingly sophisticated functionality that builds upon this, in a way that truly supports and enables the growth of their business, such as a loyalty rewards scheme for example. Zumo’s SDK would enable other digital entrepreneurs to create these types of solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Fn5R9Cv3g">Speaking at FinTech Week London</a> Eddie Robb, Zumo’s Commercial Director, explains that all the modules they have developed for their successful direct to consumer crypto trading app are available via the developer kit, meaning that other financial organizations could integrate their crypto services into their own offering,&nbsp;such as remittances and cross-border payments among others.</p>
<p>This would enable entrepreneurs to more easily create very high-growth digital business models, such as a <a href="https://digitalscot.net/mobile-super-app-embedded-finance/">Mobile ‘Super App’ for Embedded Finance</a>.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/action/skills-education/"></a>The ultimate goal of our <a href="https://digitalscot.net/action/skills-education/">Digital Skills initiative</a> is a system that creates high quality learning resources that lead to equally high quality work opportunities for Scots. 
 ‘Ecosystem’ models are an approach for designing a system that features multiple collaborating organizations. 
<p>This approach is required rather than it being addressed through one single organization or web site as ultimately the needs of users are met through this combined set of services.</p>
<p>This is especially so when you consider the overall journeys taken by users as they develop and fulfill their career, featuring learning providers, recruitment sites et al.</p>
 Micro-credentials and Route to Work Pathways 
<p>As described in the <a href="https://digitalscot.net/micro-credentials-building-blocks/">previous article</a> ‘micro-credentials’ are an ideal tool for supporting this agenda. They support breaking down employment skills into bite-sized chunks that are more easily accessible to learners and more directly applicable to work opportunities.</p>
<p>They are an especially apt approach when the objective is helping people into work, as often many jobs don’t require a whole general degree but much rather favour a particular skill specific to the role.</p>
<p>For example <a href="https://www.insider.co.uk/news/brewdog-teams-up-skills-body-23941416">Brewdog created</a> an online academy for it’s employees to gain new work-specific skill qualifications, and Alzheimer Scotland a <a href="https://twitter.com/AlzScotCPP/status/1400786620106825734">virtual academy</a> for their carers. Rather than academic qualifications these are entirely workplace-specific and an immediate relevance to possible job opportunities.</p>
<p>Technology is also an industry where specific credentials lead to specific work, such as Mike becoming a <a href="https://twitter.com/mgifford/status/1400086073112502281">certified Web Accessibility Specialist</a>. It’s also&nbsp;present across the public sector, like Business Gateway requiring workshop trainers to have a recognized credentials such as an IIP Practitioner or Professional Trainers Certificate.</p>
<p>Individual credentials can form the component parts of an overall learning journey and career pathway, forming well defined ‘Routes to Work’, such as <a href="https://codeclan.com/blog/what-path-to-choose-after-graduating-from-data-analysis/">CodeClan explaining</a> the career pathways for data analysts following graduation. E-Sgoil <a href="https://twitter.com/eSgoil/status/1406899010745647105">runs webinars</a> sharing insights on career pathways.</p>

		 
			 
				
 Action Plan 
<p>The goal of the Action Plan is to scale this approach nationally, developing a single micro-credentials framework that is shared across Scotland’s skills and employment organizations, implemented through key activities including:</p>
 
 Work with employers to develop their own curriculum of workplace skills e-learning, which generate micro-credential Digital Badges, and collaboratively develop Route to Work pathways. 
 Provide user tools for them to own, display and share their digital badges, such as mobile wallets and across social media profiles. 
 Provide tools to recruitment portals to enable resume sections to display badges, and enable employers to search on these criteria. Directly launched job sites with this functionality to accelerate it’s uptake.

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/action/social-tech/"></a>For the <a href="https://digitalscot.net/action/social-tech/">Social Tech Digital Nation Action Project</a> the key question and objective is how do bring together the right group of stakeholders, identify social impact needs and scale the impact of those projects. 
 Organizations like the <a href="https://twitter.com/homelessnetscot">Homeless Network</a> are at the front line, so the fundamental question is what can tech and entrepreneurs do to best help them? 
<p>Adam Lang of NESTA explores this in a series of articles, on <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/improving-social-innovation-in-scotland/">How we improve social innovation in Scotland</a>, through <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/changing-the-narrative-on-scotlands-major-social-challenges/">Changing the narrative</a>, <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/rethinking-risk/">Rethinking risk</a> and most importantly, <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/more-space-for-experimentation/">Providing more space for experimentation.</a></p>
 Social Tech Innovations and Best Practices 
<p>Adam makes the critical point that “we need more approaches to testing, designing and scaling practical solutions to shared social problems”, through more innovation labs that try out new ideas and then integrate lessons learned into public policy.&nbsp;This is what a Social Tech innovation group would be ideal for.</p>
<p>For example in a <a href="https://digitalscot.net/social-reporting/">previous blog</a> I identified two key learnings from my own experience of homelessness. One being a need for more ‘Social Reporting’ and the other community knowledge resources, capturing the street know how from those on the streets and sharing it with those new to it: “Social Mapping”.</p>
 Social Mapping 
<p>In short something like <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2014/11/01/maps-created-by-homeless-people-show-newcastle-in-a-completely-new-light-4930671/">this homeless map</a> of Newcastle would have been ideal, a map of the city endorsed with local knowledge by homeless people there.</p>
<p>Of course a paper-based map would have limited value and in this day and age online map directories are very simple to produce.</p>
<p>For example&nbsp;The Glasgow Community Food Network provides <a href="https://glasgowfood.net/find-local-food-services">this map</a> of resources like food banks.&nbsp;On a global scale the <a href="https://twitter.com/hotosm">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> apply advanced capabilities towards global scale needs.</p>
 Building Capacity 
<p>This highlights the first step that can be taken, to build a team with capabilities in key tech areas and showcasing how others have used it as a stimulus to encourage further ideas for where else it could be applied.</p>
<p>Mapping is one technology and there are many others. For example Eric Rice believes at <a href="https://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/how-to-solve-homelessness-with-artificial-intelligence/92033/">AI can solve homelessness</a>, and with Scotland recently forming an <a href="https://twitter.com/Scottish_AI">AI Alliance</a> there is a cluster in that field that could contribute this expertise towards this end. A great example of the powerful effect achieved through the intersection of these fields is how <a href="https://futurescot.com/edinburgh-tech-firm-to-use-ai-to-produce-fuel-poverty-risk-maps-across-the-uk/">UrbanTide is using AI</a> to produce fuel poverty risk maps.</p>
<p>Through the use of open source and hackathons much of these are easily translated into actionable tech innovation projects that can be piloted for little effort and cost, so the potential for real impact is distinctly tangible.</p>
<p>There is also the process of learning from and repeating innovations already developed by others around the world. As AWS documents the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/texas-homeless-network-uses-aws-to-prevent-and-combat-homelessness/">Texas Homeless Network</a> used their services to pilot a data sharing project, which offers not only domain experience learning but highlights the key benefit of the Cloud, which is that these apps and thus their best practices can be easily repeated.</p>
 Scaling Social Impact 
<p>The second main question is then one of scale; how can test bed projects be rolled out on a much larger scale and in general how can we achieve a wholesale systemic transformation?</p>
<p>In his article Adam Lang emphasizes this challenge for Scotland, noting that there are few policy innovation mechanisms for growing social impact in Scotland, asking questions such as “Where are the innovative finance mechanisms for long-term public benefit?”</p>
<p>Investigate journalism cooperative The Ferret provides a taste of where this type of need exists in the public sector, <a href="https://theferret.scot/councils-tax-havens-own-hundreds-vacant-properties/">reporting</a> that local authorities own over 1,100 vacant properties in Scotland’s cities.</p>
<p>Clearly this is a massively under utilized public asset and as I <a href="https://twitter.com/DigitalscotNews/status/1595721318930186240">tweeted</a>, is an ideal scenario for the type of Social Tech innovation project, using the tools described here, combining mapping with community and marketplace process features for matching ideas and project proposals to properties.</p>
 Social Financing 
<p>Financing large scale change is also a field with many innovative ideas and developments that could be called upon to scale impact.</p>
<p>In Scotland there are organizations like <a href="https://www.socialinvestmentscotland.com/">Social Investment Scotland</a>, who provide investment for Social Enterprises and on a broader basis there are policy innovations spanning from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_impact_bond">Social Impact Bonds</a> through to emerging ‘Social Stock Markets’, the same principle as any other stock market except all the companies that are listed are also socially active in some way.&nbsp;For example India has a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/social-stock-exchange-what-kind-of-organisations-can-list-on-it-122083100408_1.html">Social Stock Exchange</a>.</p>
<p>Again the intersection of new technologies and these innovations presents potential for hugely accelerated impact. For example&nbsp;in Gibraltar their stock exchange <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/blockchain-firm-valereum-gets-approval-buy-gibraltar-exchange-2022-10-31/">has been acquired</a> by a Blockchain technology business, with a view to integrating the use of that technology to&nbsp;link traditional securities with NFT ownership.</p>
<p>This represents a fusion of two massive drivers of financial leverage. Cryptocurrencies have only just begun to transform global finance and within the right context offer a tremendous potential for very large scale social change, of new models for democratized asset ownership and wealth distribution.</p>
<p>Scotland’s opportunity is to be at the forefront of realizing that potential, combining our technology abilities and ambitions with our national desire to build a modern, socially progressive and inclusive country.</p>

 From Data to Assets: Transforming Global Supply Chains with OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph  Ongoing digital transformation of global supply&nbsp;chains <p>Organizations have been on a journey of digitally transforming their supply chains for a number of years. This journey was accelerated by the COVID pandemic that highlighted the fragility of global supply chain networks, coupled with a rapid increase in consumer demand and e-commerce volumes. Transformation efforts have been taking place on multiple fronts, such as transparency, sustainability, purchasing, warehouse operations, and trade documentation, to name a few. While progress has been made in each of those areas, we’ve seen few leapfrog advances. There are several reasons for that, ranging from a complex landscape of involved players to siloed and poorly interoperable data that prevents organizations to have a holistic understanding of what’s going on in their supply chain networks.</p><p>Even with the slow progression, however, advanced technologies that will enable supply chains to enter and benefit from the metaverse — the fusion of physical and digital worlds — are steadily being&nbsp;adopted.</p><p>In one of <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/business-functions-blog/metaverse-supply-chain-networks">their reports</a>, Accenture found that about two-thirds of supply chain management executives think that metaverse will have a positive impact on their organization. They see metaverse technologies benefiting organizations in multiple ways, from enabling a better alignment of supply and demand through enhanced customer engagement to facilitating more seamless navigation between physical and digital worlds and providing real-time insights that reduce the gap between supply chain planning and execution. But we still have a lot of work to get&nbsp;there.</p> OriginTrail — introducing discoverable and verifiable Web3 assets to supply&nbsp;chains <p>Achieving the vision of fully metaverse-enabled global supply chains requires a strong and paradigm-shifting foundational infrastructure. OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) brings this required radical change in the way supply chains operate by enabling organizations to transform their data into Web3 assets. To make it easier to understand, Web3 assets in the context of supply chains can be a variety of&nbsp;things:</p>  Products or groups of products that are flowing along the supply&nbsp;chain.  Logistics equipment such as shipping containers, trailers, pallets, and other equipment used to handle, transport, and store products.  Business locations where products are manufactured, transported, stored, and&nbsp;sold.  Supply chain events describing what happened to products and equipment — we use the GS1 EPCIS 2.0 standard to ensure interoperability.  Trade documents like Bills of Lading (BL), Airway Bills (AWB), CMRs, Credit notes, Proof of Delivery (POD), Purchase Orders, Invoices, and&nbsp;others.  Credentials of trade partners such as facility audits and certificates.  Other relevant supply chain components.  <p>Assets from various supply chain partners on OriginTrail DKG are discoverable, verifiable, and linked, providing a holistic insight into the supply chain network and making it easy to use them in a variety of business applications — anything from track and trace and security monitoring to precise recall management and insurance claims. Additionally, as OriginTrail DKG assets use global data standards such as GS1 EPCIS, W3C Verifiable Credentials, and e-Bill of Lading (eBL), they are interoperable and can be used in any existing IT system that “understands” the standards.</p><p>One concern that usually pops up is data privacy and ownership — most of the supply chain data is of a sensitive nature after all. No worries there, as OriginTrail DKG allows a full spectrum of privacy configurations, ranging from assets that are fully private to assets that are fully public, and everything in between. Assets on OriginTrail DKG also incorporate the concept of ownership, as asset ownership can be verifiably transferred from one supply chain partner to another as required. This opens up a world of exciting opportunities for process improvements and new ways to generate value. For example, no more paper handovers of trade documents (such as Bills of Lading) and fuzzy to non-existent audit trails. Or imagine organizations being able to engage with and understand their customers better by transferring ownership of a product in the form of a Web3 asset to them after purchase. The possibilities are&nbsp;endless.</p><p>What I described above is not theoretical — OriginTrail DKG is already positively impacting supply chains in different industries. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKgqGpZablw&amp;t=26673s">SCAN Trusted Factory</a> uses OriginTrail to safeguard security audits of the largest US retailers such as Disney, Walmart, and Target. <a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/healthcare/donated-medicines-and-vaccines/">AidTrust</a> provides trust and transparency in pharmaceutical supply chains. <a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2022/june/one-year-on-since-bsi-and-trace-labs-joined-the-innovate-uk-consortium-to-develop-new-digital-solutions-for-the-food-and-trade-industry/">Trusted Bytes</a> looks at enabling UK Customs to achieve comprehensive shipment risk assessments. And many more are on the&nbsp;way.</p> Network Operating System (nOS) — where the magic&nbsp;happens <p>But how do we get from the siloed, fragmented, and poorly interoperable data landscape in supply chains today to discoverable, verifiable, and linked Web3 assets on OriginTrail DKG? Enter Trace Labs’ Network Operating System (nOS), designed to streamline the connection between legacy IT systems (ERP, WMS, LMS, and others) — where data that can be transformed into assets is stored — and OriginTrail DKG.</p>Network Operating System (nOS&nbsp;)<p>nOS allows organizations to create, update, and utilize their supply chain assets on OriginTrail DKG from existing data in their IT systems in a simplified way, without the need to deal with complexities usually associated with decentralized infrastructure (e.g. crypto token management is automated with nOS). This is facilitated with three sets of tools within&nbsp;nOS:</p>  Data ingestion tools, enabling organizations to easily connect nOS to their IT systems and set up automated (API-based) or manual data ingestion, depending on their business requirements. For example, an organization can set up an automated connection to its Transport Management System (TMS), ensuring shipment data is ingested as it becomes available.  Asset creation tools, allowing organizations to transform their data into discoverable, verifiable, and linked assets on OriginTrail DKG. This set of tools also allows the application of different sets of global data standards (e.g. GS1 EPCIS, W3C Verifiable Credentials, eBill of Lading, eCMR, etc.), ensuring created assets are fully interoperable. For example, an organization that has extracted shipment event data from its TMS can transform that data into GS1 EPCIS 2.0 structured assets.  Asset querying tools, providing organizations with an easy way to query for assets on OriginTrail DKG for use in their business applications such as supply chain traceability, credential verification, and others. For example, an organization (or multiple organizations in a supply chain network) that has created GS1 EPCIS 2.0 structured assets can set up the necessary queries to utilize those assets in its track and trace application.  <p>With the help of nOS, turning siloed data into discoverable and verifiable assets on OriginTrail has never been&nbsp;easier.</p> So what’s&nbsp;next? <p>OriginTrail DKG introduces a new, asset-focused paradigm to global supply chains that can be a significant enabler for a variety of other metaverse technologies, ranging from augmented reality and AI to Internet of Things (IoT) and next-generation digital twins. All these technologies require a strong foundation to deliver business value and this is where OriginTrail DKG plays an important role. And with nOS facilitating the transition from siloed data in legacy IT systems to verifiable Web3 assets on OriginTrail DKG, we are on a strong path towards the vision of metaverse-enabled global supply&nbsp;chains.</p><p>👇 More about Trace&nbsp;Labs👇</p><p><a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/TraceLabsHQ">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tracelabs.io">Facebook</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/trace-labs/">LinkedIn</a></p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/from-data-to-assets-transforming-global-supply-chains-with-origintrail-decentralized-knowledge-4c2aaa7e622d">From Data to Assets: Transforming Global Supply Chains with OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/action/skills-education/"></a>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnmSiAXc5Jw">this video</a> Stephen Reid from Microsoft, Ian Stuart from Avantis Education and educators from around the world discuss the challenges and opportunities around the Eduverse, the metaverse for education. 
<p>Before summarizing the video let’s talk about what is the Eduverse and Metaverse, and how does it work?</p>
 What is the Metaverse? 
<p>Eduverse is a web3 virtual environment where educators can choose their own adventure, connect as avatars, learn and earn NFTs, trade contents, find jobs, explore resources and earn tokens.</p>
 What is the Metaverse for Education? 
<p>Metaverse is a 3D virtual world where you can meet, play, work and interact with others via digital avatars. In the metaverse, people can do things that they do in their real life, whether it’s going to the mall, attending a concert or buying virtual clothing.</p>
<p>People can also socialize with other people, hold work meetings, among other things. Metaverse presents an opportunity for students to have the experience of being in a class without physically leaving their country of residence.</p>
<p>Metaverse will allow students to have an increasingly “cyber-physical” university experience, where the virtual world merges with the real. Many students have experienced the same thing. The Metaverse can change the way education and academic work are monetized.</p>
 How does the Metaverse work? 
<p>According to Unicef, the education of 91% of students worldwide was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Since early 2020, both students and teachers have had to adapt to a new, remote style of learning. Technology has been crucial to the continuation of learning throughout the global lockdowns.</p>
<p>And now tech experts and educators alike are wondering the same thing: if the internet is beneficial to learning in its current state, what kinds of things could we do with the metaverse?</p>
<p>The Metaverse can promote education by:</p>
 
 Virtual Learning 
 Stimulating Real-Life Situations 
 Participating in virtual campus activities 
 
 Video Summary 
<p>Stephen Raid, the first speaker, is from Microsoft and his expertise is in technology and game-based learning. He has used about 140 games to help children learn through gaming.</p>
<p>According to Stephen there are three pillars of game-based learning. The first pillar is an explicit curriculum through which children can have access to science, art, geography, history etc. The second pillar is social and emotional learning which helps children to develop their capacity as human beings. The third pillar is career readiness which helps children to explore their career options.</p>
<p>By using game-based learning children are taught in school important topics like gender equality, refugee crisis, climate change, civil rights etc. There are two types of curriculum for children in school. The first one is an explicit curriculum which must be taught by the teachers and they have to assess the teaching at the end of year of school. The other one is an implicit curriculum which teachers are not bound to teach the children but if they teach these curriculum, it will contribute to developing the moral of children.</p>
<p>In Scotland Stephen was involved in the Pave Project. It was an alternative vocational education program for young offenders. At this program the teachers used digital platforms like Minecraft to teach the children about various topics. Minecraft is a virtual game-based learning platform that promotes creativity, collaboration and problem solving in an immersive digital environment. Game-based learning is a blessing for children from working class families.</p>
<p>Due to their financial restraint, they cannot afford to often go to the beach, hills or the zoo. Through these virtual games they can experience what it feels like to go to these places without actually being there. Thus, by using game-based learning educators bring abstract concepts to life. Educators also teach children emotional vocabulary for writing.</p>
<p>Stephen was also involved in another project named the 100,000 trees project in France. The purpose of this project was to teach children the importance of trees in the environment, to teach them how to maintain and plant trees to reduce global warming and climate change.</p>
<p>They were taught about biodiversity and interaction between humans and plants. At this program the educators created fake scenarios to help children see the wider picture then they observed their reactions and make them feel what it is like to be in that situation.</p>
<p>For example, to teach children the concept of refugee crisis, educators created fake BBC reports where they wrote that their country is under invasion and they have to flee their houses and have shelter in some other countries. Then they let the children find a solution to this crisis. By using this method children learned empathy and critical analysis of a crisis.</p>
<p>According to Stephen, because of the current systematic pressure in the grading system, children are not taught empathy and analysis and for this they often cannot understand the gravity of a crisis. When they will feel empathy, they will learn about the concepts themselves.</p>
<p>By using Metaverse classroom educators have seen drastic change in the teaching system. Children learn more efficiently through these digital platforms and most important is they are really interested to learn about new concepts.</p>
<p>The Metaverse permits an immersive experience into the digital classroom environment where students will be able to interact with the learning content. Thus, it provides users with an empowered learning experience. The experiences in the metaverse space are limited only by one’s imagination.</p>
<p>This digital platform has been recently used in Korea. By using these digital platforms educators make the children problem solvers and creators for real world problems. They are also triggered through empathy to believe in that problem and find an effective solution and will break the barrier.</p>
<p>To make the education system effective the teachers training colleges and organization should be monitored and the educators must be experts in Metaverse education. Educators can collectively change the education system and enhance learning by using Metaverse education.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/action/skills-education/"></a>A key foundation for Scotland’s future digital economy and education policies and infrastructure are Digital Badge ‘Micro-credentials’. 
<p>As <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/higher-education-certifying-your-future/0/steps/213776">FutureLearn describes</a> a Micro-credential is a “Certification of learning that can accumulate into a larger credential or degree, be part of a portfolio that demonstrates individuals’ proof of learning, or have a value in itself.”</p>
<p>They are offered by Education providers like the <a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/microcredentials">Open University</a> and <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/study/microcredentials/">Glasgow University</a> among many others.</p>
 Route to Work Pathways 
<p>They are especially potent due to their modular nature making them ideal for utilizing them to define a series of steps that constitute and lead to specific job roles. A great example of this is the <a href="https://www.pmi.org/certifications/micro-credentials">PMI offering micro-credentials</a>.</p>
<p>The QAA offers this <a href="https://www.qaa.ac.uk/quality-code/characteristics-statements/micro-credentials">detailed definition</a>, highlighting:</p>
<p>“Micro-credentials have a key role to play in upskilling and re-skilling the workforce as short, credit-bearing courses that support a learner-led engagement in higher education which could be spread over many years. </p>
<p>Micro-credentials would not normally constitute an award in their own right, but they have standalone value and could also contribute to a recognised qualification. They also widen access to learners who might not have considered a more traditional approach to achieving a qualification, as well as potentially assisting with meeting skills needs for employers and learners.”</p>
<p>Critically:</p>
<p>“While higher education providers have a long history of running short courses, micro-credentials are closely aligned with employability and also offer more structured opportunities for progression which brings new challenges.”</p>
<p>The BCS describes this as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcs.org/content-hub/digital-badging-the-future-of-professional-development/">future of professional development</a>, with many organizations like&nbsp;<a href="https://new.siemens.com/uk/en/company/education/teachers/siemens-digital-badges.html">Siemens</a>&nbsp;using them this way. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.badges.sssc.uk.com/getting-started/what-you-need-to-know-about-open-badges/">Scottish Social Services Council using them</a>&nbsp;to underpin workforce learning.</p>
<p>Writing for the RSA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thersa.org/cities-of-learning/articles-blogs-and-reports/badges-for-jobseekers">Jillian Linton provides</a>&nbsp;a great overview of how badges can help jobseekers stand out from the crowd. This&nbsp;<a href="https://lincs.ed.gov/professional-development/resource-collections/profile-716">Lincs report</a>&nbsp;examines how they are ideal for supporting adult learners, with both combined highlighting how they offer great potential for helping those experiencing difficulty with getting back into the workforce.</p>
 Digital Badges 
<p>Highlighting the enabling role of technology micro-credentials can be implemented and represented through ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_badge">Digital Badges</a>‘.&nbsp;These can enable gamified learning models through to providing a complete framework for a common, industry-wide credential recognition system.</p>
<p>As the&nbsp;<a href="https://raccoongang.com/blog/digital-badges-education-what-are-they/">Racoon Gang describe</a>&nbsp;they provide a modular approach for rewarding achievements and encouraging motivation.</p>
<p>“With digital badges you don’t have to depend solely on exams and other conventional assessment methods. The badges can be associated with everything, including class participation, information retention, attentiveness, positive behavior, etc.”</p>
<p>In his article the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ascd.org/el/articles/the-power-of-digital-badges">Power of Digital Badges</a>&nbsp;David Niguidula explains how they can be utilized to define learning pathways, steps of progress required to achieve the badge.</p>
<p>These journeys are often described as “quests”, highlighting the sense of adventurous fun and reward they offer students.</p>
 Digital Nation Infrastructure 
<p>Implementing this type of technology further highlights the fact this would form one component part of a common national infrastructure, calling upon technologies such as the Blockchain and Digital Identity, which would also be used for other industry requirements.</p>
<p>The building block of how these are work are an aspect of Digital Identity technologies, notably the sharing of ‘<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SSIMeetup/verifiable-credentials-101-for-ssi-and-decentralized-digital-identity-tyler-ruff">Verifiable Credentials</a>‘, the mechanism for different digital services to recognize those login details provided by another, and&nbsp;‘<a href="https://www.learningmachine.com/badges-and-blockcerts/">Blockcerts</a>‘ is an open source blockchain project for enabling a Universal Verifier that will verify any digital certificate issued by any institution, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Students will be able to store their Digital Badges in their own digital wallets. In his <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Medium blog</a> Timothy Ruff provides an excellent, detailed summary of this interconnected ecosystem will begin to take shape and the role these wallets will play, functioning as a ‘Learner Wallet‘.</p>
<p>He explains how:</p>
 
 Organizations like the&nbsp;T3 Innovation Network, within the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, are developing Learning and Employment Records, powered by the same VC standards and technologies that enable self-sovereign student ID, with the same issue, hold, verify model to/from an SSI wallet, which they call a “learner wallet” for simplicity. 
 This will help reduce and eliminate student fraud. Once organizations realize they can receive cryptographic proof directly from the student, they can lessen their reliance on passwords, social security numbers, and other personal information. 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>This strategy offers Scotland multiple levels of accelerating economic benefit, most notably:</p>
 
 An improved approach for explicitly linking the skills requirements of employers to available skills programs and academic courses. 
 Advancing a common digital economy infrastructure that will service multiple use cases including this one.

<p>This year we<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-strengthening-our-digital-resilience/" title=""> started an organisational project to improve our digital resilience</a>. We use the term “digital resilience” to refer to a set of practices that enable an organisation to protect itself from — and respond to — digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of its people and to adopt infrastructures that respond to ever-changing needs and contexts.</p>



<p>Throughout this project we <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/mapping-digital-resilience-challenges-in-social-justice-organisations-learnings-from-our-partners/" title="">mapped digital resilience issues</a> that social justice organisations we work with are facing, as well as strategies to approach them. One of the overall findings was that organisations are going through constant change both internally and externally due to factors outside their control. Challenges such as organisational changes, contextual shifts in the region, pandemic effects on human resources and even new tools can result in fundamental shifts to the ways we work internally.</p>



<p>For this reason, The Engine Room will be hosting a Community Call December 8th at 10am ET to create a peer-to-peer space as a way to address this need to share what we’ve learned in the last year. We will be presenting our own learnings from our attempts to adapt to change as well as facilitate a conversation to reflect on challenges and ways to address and adapt to them going forward.</p>



<p>Register <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEqf--tqTwrGdWM339n_53Aci90Gm0kKfoL" title="">HERE</a>.</p>



<p>All are welcome! Whether you’re a practitioner, a civil society organisation working with impacted communities, or just keen to learn more, join us at our Community Call. See you on December 8th!</p>

<p>Industry experts to share insights into how FIDO and related technologies can bring passwordless authentication to IoT</p>



<p>Mountain View, Calif., November 22, 2022 – The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> today announces its latest Authenticate Virtual Summit: <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/event/securely-onboarding-all-the-things-the-fido-fit-in-iot/">Securely Onboarding All the Things: The FIDO Fit in IoT,</a> sponsored by Daon and Nok Nok. Responding to rising industry demand for more insight into the role of FIDO and passwordless technology in IoT, the free event will offer attendees expert perspectives and education from leading industry organizations and solution providers on strengthening authentication in IoT. The program will take place virtually on December 7 2022, from 8:00am – 12:00pm PT, and will be made available to registrants on-demand following the event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lack of IoT security standards and outdated processes, such as shipping with default password credentials and manual onboarding, leave devices and the networks they operate on open to large-scale attacks. As the IoT market continues to grow, <a href="https://internetofbusiness.com/iot-spending-to-hit-1-2-trillion-by-2022-claims-idc/">projected to surpass the $1 trillion mark in 2022</a>, the FIDO Alliance formed the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/working-groups/">IoT Technical Working Group</a> to address these challenges – aiming to provide a comprehensive authentication framework for IoT devices relying on passwordless authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Launched in 2021, the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/intro-to-fido-device-onboard/">FIDO Device Onboard (FDO)</a> specification is the working group’s first output: an open IoT standard which enables devices to simply and securely onboard to cloud and on-premise management platforms. The upcoming virtual summit will delve into this specification and FIDO’s role in IoT with speakers from Intel, Qualcomm, FIDO Alliance and more:</p>

<p>About the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3680846-1&amp;h=3017224622&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3675645-1%26h%3D118128989%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.fidoalliance.org%252F%26a%3Dwww.fidoalliance.org&amp;a=www.fidoalliance.org">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3680846-1&amp;h=1859032702&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3675645-1%26h%3D1704427835%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ffidoalliance.org%252Fspecifications%252F%26a%3Dstandards&amp;a=standards">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>1) Two of the primary issues that <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter </a>currently faces are bots and a lack of a proper check for recognizing real users and business brands from these bots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Both these problems can be solved with a single solution - By issuing credentials to individuals and brands. Users can pay for the check, and the issued credential can be used on <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter </a>as well as is interoperable and can function anywhere on the web.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) The credentials should work on the Web3 standard and could be integrated by <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter</a>’s team tomorrow. Moreover, new products and services can be launched from this starting point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Decentralized Identities (DIDs)/credentials can enable payments (SelfKey uses DID:ETH as a starting point), so <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter </a>can try new business models - like <a href="https://t.co/6VR3M0tkkV">http://earn.com</a>, started by <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">@balajis</a>, which allows users to pay to message certain people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Imagine being able to message all verified crypto CEOs and ensure the message lands in their DM. That’s cool, but it’s somewhat transactional. <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter </a>needs to go public again - but public investors love recurring revenue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) How can we get a recurring revenue model to maximize shareholder value? Imagine a ‘closed circle’ on <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter </a>where you could connect pseudonymously with other verified business owners (who perhaps have submitted proof of ownership over a company/organization).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7) Furthermore, the same ‘closed circle’ of crypto CEOs (a userbase with discretionary spending, who, by and large, respect and admire <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">@elonmusk</a>) require a monthly access fee.<br>
8) Use this exact same <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter </a>codebase but with a paywall, and facilitate occasional ‘masterminds’ (exclusive <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces">@TwitterSpaces</a>) again based on credentials. This will unlock value for users by connecting them to like-minded individuals to help each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9) Even further, <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter </a>feeds could be filtered/customized to show posts from users that have a certain credential (republican, millionaire, business owner), which allows users to find and subscribe to new closed circles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10) TL;DR </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter</a> can solve the identity issue, become an integral provider of decentralized identity for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Web3?src=hashtag_click">#Web3</a> (or <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/web5?src=hashtag_click">#web5</a>? whatever <a href="https://twitter.com/jack">@jack</a> calls it nowadays), and find new recurring revenue streams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11)<a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter</a> can start by rolling this internally or opening up APIs so external companies can do it. <a href="https://twitter.com/SelfKey">@SelfKey</a> has a decentralized identity protocol founded by <a href="https://t.co/YfWDhaC7nu">http://KYC-Chain.com</a> (a b2b KYC SAAS tool) and can enable what’s described above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12) We’ve barely scratched the surface in this - there are much more, starting with the POI/Sybil attack prevention mechanisms discussed in the <a href="https://bit.ly/3ES1YgN">latest whitepaper</a>, composable NFTs, new revenue for <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter</a> avatars, monetization of TwitterUsernames/DIDs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">@elonmusk</a> Contact <a href="https://twitter.com/SelfKey">@SelfKey</a>, the future of <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter">@Twitter</a> and free speech - depends on it. And our devs won’t walk out on you!</p>

<p>Accenture, Cisco, Cryptsoft, Cybeats, Dell, EclecticIQ, Hitachi, Huawei, IBM, Microsoft, U.S. NIST, Oracle, Red Hat, and Others Advance Open Standard for Automated Security Advisories</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, USA, 21 November, 2022 – OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, announced the approval of the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) 2.0 as a full OASIS standard, a status that signifies the highest level of ratification. This new version of CSAF includes support for the Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange (VEX) profile, which is especially helpful in efficiently consuming SBOM data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current threat landscape has profoundly changed how systems and people are protected, driving new approaches to cybersecurity, especially around vendor advisories dealing with vulnerability disclosure issues. The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=csaf">OASIS CSAF Technical Committee’s</a> work developing machine readable security advisories makes it possible for cyber defenders to quickly and automatically assess the impact of vulnerabilities and respond in an automated way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Security advisories play a crucial role in securing on-premises and cloud-based assets as they contain critical information about how to remediate vulnerabilities,” said OASIS CSAF chair, Omar Santos, of Cisco. “CSAF v2.0 brings more than machine readable advisories in JSON format; it specifies the distribution mechanism and how new CSAF documents can be discovered and disclosed. It’s the result of an international, industry-wide effort to standardize the reporting of security issues. CSAF enables software producers and consumers to modernize their vulnerability management and response programs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participation in the OASIS CSAF TC is open to all through membership in OASIS. Providers of products and services that produce, consume, or process security vulnerability remediation information, along with their customers who consume this information, and all other interested parties, are invited to join the group.</p>



<p>The CSAF TC is holding a webinar on Thursday, 1 December at 11am ET, “Using CSAF to Respond to Supply Chain Vulnerabilities at Large Scale.” Speakers include Diane Morris of Cisco, Justin Murphy of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Omar Santos of Cisco, and Thomas Schmidt of the Federal Office for Information Security Germany (BSI). Attendance is free and open to all. View more specifics&nbsp;<a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_KqD-a1t5SpuMI7w9cI7ZDg">here.</a> </p>



<p>Support for CSAF&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cybeats<br>“As the number of vulnerabilities exponentially increases, it is paramount to modernize and automate the way organizations exchange information about these risks. Cybeats is proud to be part of OASIS Open and supports the important work of developing CSAF 2.0, as standard of machine readable format. Cybeats is among the first companies to use CSAF 2.0 to generate VEX for SBOMs.”<br>– Dmitry Raidman, CTO, Cybeats</p>



<p>Oracle<br>“Oracle is an early adopter of the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) 2.0, an evolution of the Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF). CSAF 2.0 further enhances organizations’ capabilities in assessing vulnerabilities to prioritize their patching effort. This new version will support the Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) format, which provides a means to determine whether specific vulnerabilities in commonly-used components are exploitable in the context of a given product distribution.”<br>– Mary Ann Davidson, Chief Security Officer, Oracle</p>



<p>Red Hat&nbsp;<br>“Enhancing the security of software supply chains is critical for modern organizations, as complex, multi-footprint digital services take a greater presence in all aspects of society. As a contributor to the CSAF v2.0 framework, we see this effort helping IT security teams to more rapidly and efficiently respond to potential threats via these concepts that modernize and automate security workflows without compromising operations.”<br>– Pete Allor, Director, Red Hat Product Security</p>

<p>This week I had the opportunity to take part in the GS1 Healthcare Conference in Paris together with BSI’s Global Director for Healthcare, Courtney Soulsby. As usual, GS1 event brought together a lot of people and organizations looking for innovative approaches to solving the industry’s biggest challenges. Speaking with some of the largest players in the space, a few recurring themes were present across the majority of our conversations that showcased how Web3 assets can play a key role in addressing them.</p>Courtney Soulsby, BSI’s Global Director for Healthcare, and Jurij Skornik, Trace Labs’ General Manager at Global GS1 Healthcare Conference<p>While today the Web3 industry might be appearing in the news for a plethora of reasons, I’m certain that the true and biggest opportunities are being seized by those focusing on education and building tangible value. By understanding how we can leverage this technology, we can address some of humanity’s biggest challenges, like those present in the industry that comprises ⅔ of the world’s GDP — supply chains. Here are 3 pain points that were mentioned often in our conversations in Paris and can very effectively be addressed using Web3 technology:</p>  Access to information — actionable knowledge derived from information that is currently scattered across supply chain networks can unlock possibilities of precise alignment of supply and demand; quality/origin claims backed by verifiable data; forward tracking to minimize diversions and gray market sales; and many other high-impact solutions.  Digital twins — creating a Web3 asset representation of a physical product, digital certificate/credential, or even a service — is a game changer. Not only are you able to have a much more precise understanding of asset ownership (chain of custody), but you have a single place to access key information about each product. This can be useful in ensuring product authenticity (counterfeit medicine is a huge problem), precise patient support during complex treatments and pin-pointing critical items in the unfortunate event of&nbsp;recalls.  Expanding the supply chain — no supply chain today ends at the point of sale but rather extends to the consumer, and in the event of circular approaches, can even end up back at the producer. In healthcare, the element of extending the supply chain towards patients is more and more critical. Receiving real-time information about the correct effects of the medicine and medical devices can not only hugely increase the speed of innovation but also save lives. However, a big challenge of handling patient data and providing direct incentives for data sharing exists, both of which Web3 assets can be the right solution&nbsp;for.  <p>The discussions we had also came as a great validation for solutions we’re building at Trace Labs. With the new OriginTrail — decentralized knowledge graph version 6 (DKG V6) — enabling us to describe any supply chain using Web3 assets as building blocks we can tackle all these huge challenges head-on.</p><p>Before signing off — Trace Labs is also releasing a big update to our Network Operating System (nOS) allowing us to address challenges like those above with efficient deployments. Having it entirely transformed to fully exploit the new and more efficient DKG V6, the nOS now allows any user to evolve the data structured according to GS1 and other important data standards into Web3 assets that can be made discoverable (available) and verifiable for plethora of business cases (some solutions built on top of the nOS can be seen here). The nOS also abstracts all complexities with regards to digital assets required to use the public decentralized infrastructure, so all you have to focus on is creating value for your business.</p>Network Operating System&nbsp;(nOS)<p>Subscribe to <a href="https://origintrail.io/">our newsletter</a> to be among the first ones to receive news about the latest technology updates!</p><p>P.S.: The croissants in Paris were amazing,&nbsp;too.</p><p>👇 More about Trace&nbsp;Labs👇</p><p><a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/TraceLabsHQ">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tracelabs.io">Facebook</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/trace-labs/">LinkedIn</a></p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/gs1-healthcare-conference-paris-was-more-than-just-croissants-89ad2b7fedd9">GS1 Healthcare Conference: Paris was more than just croissants</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Introduction  <p>Soulbonds are evolving NFTs that reflect a Web3 user's on-chain activity. Users can construct, customize and upgrade their Souls (using 220+ hand-drawn traits) to represent adventures they’ve embarked on and tailor the NFT to their unique experience. </p><p>"The Soul becomes their reflection in the decentralized web, a true reflection of their digital identity," the Soulbonds teams says. </p><p>Soulbonds chose to build on Ceramic to significantly improve usability. With Ceramic, users can apply new traits to their NFTs when they obtain on-chain achievements. Leveraging Ceramic to update Soulbonds metadata avoids all costs related to these data transactions.</p><p>"Storing Soulbonds data on Ceramic also offers users a decentralized gateway that allows Soulbonds the same accessibility as IPFS, removing any centralization risk or server damage, and ensures that user content remains permanently available," the Soulbonds team says. </p><p>Ultimately, Ceramic enables Soulbonds to store data in a decentralized way without incurring transaction fees for users.</p><p>Before creating Soulbonds, the team noticed a lack of popular projects that allow the customization of NFTs. Using a centralized server with APIs was one possible solution to create evolving NFTs. Zerion DNA, for example, offers customizable NFTs but it comes at the cost of losing decentralization. The Soulbonds team also considered another option: upgrading NFTs via on-chain transactions; however, this approach would become prohibitively expensive for users frequently updating their data.</p><p>The team chose to build Soulbonds on Ceramic because of its ability to perform off-chain data updates in a decentralized environment. </p> Ceramic Offers Mutability and Decentralization  <p>NFTs are a set of links between blockchain addresses, NFT metadata, and media content. These links could lead to:</p>  Centralized servers of the project company (i.e. CryptoKitties)  Decentralized storage (i.e. Arweave or IPFS)  <p>Decentralized storage solutions like Arweave or IPFS are immutable—this means that changing the stored content is usually impossible for certain use cases, like an ever-evolving NFT. From a security point of view, immutable storage is important, but it limits the number of possible applications (like the ability for NFTs to evolve). On Arweave or IPFS, a change in content means that the link also changes, this requires paying gas fees on blockchains every time. This can be a big issue for NFT projects that allow customization to be done frequently, since they need to use a proxy that will contain the latest version of the NFT.</p><p>Ceramic allows decentralized access to the entire history of changes affecting the Soulbonds NFT (including new features), as well as the most recent version of the metadata. With Ceramic, users do not have to pay for updates or sacrifice decentralization.</p> How Soulbonds Built With Ceramic <p>For Soulbonds, Ceramic stores a sequential stream of metadata along with links to media stored on IPFS. Using one of the API endpoints, projects can request the current state of the content in the stream. Since Ceramic is decentralized, there is no threat that content owned by users will someday be lost.</p><p>In addition to dynamic NFTs, the Soulbonds team continues to push new features, including a leaderboard to rank users via on-chain activity and bootstrapping mechanisms to reward Soulbonds token holders. </p> Get in Touch  <p>The Soulbonds team completed beta testing and encourages the ecosystem to check them out on these <a href="https://linktr.ee/soulbondsnft">channels</a>. </p><p>Join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/6VRZpGP">Discord</a> to learn about how you can build your application on Ceramic!</p><p></p>

<p>Microsoft has removed a key obstacle facing organizations seeking to deploy phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) by enabling certificate-based authentication (CBA) in Azure Active Directory. This comes as experts anticipate advanced phishing attacks will rise next year. “I think social engineering and MFA bypass attacks will continue to grow in 2023, where some other major service providers suffer meaningful breaches like we did this year,” Andrew Shikiar says.</p>

<p>Poor password hygiene is the root cause of more than 80% of data breaches, according to the FIDO Alliance. Efforts to ditch easy-to-guess, phrase-based passwords are gaining more traction with the adoption of passkeys, paving the way for the passwordless future cybersecurity pros dream of. Growing passkey adoption requires widespread availability, industry collaboration and regulatory support, says FIDO Alliance executive director Andrew Shikiar.</p>

<p>The use of biometric technology has taken off in recent years which could largely be down to loopholes in password security becoming more apparent. Biometrics represents the most convenient and easy form of Multi-Factor Authentication and is therefore very well placed to increase security. It’s easy to combine biometric patterns, fingerprint combined with facial, for example, and to complete it with other authentication method – as per FIDO Alliance standards.</p>

   A Web 3.0 search engine with a Blockchain-based community ecosystem business model. 
 The post Kin – Pioneering the Next Generation Internet in Scotland appeared first on digitalscot.net.

<div class='wrap'>

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/solutions/blockchain/"></a>A unique blockchain-based search engine aims to disrupt the search market. 
 The Kin search engine has been developed in Scotland and turns the traditional ad-based, data-harvesting model on its head. 
<p><a href="https://www.betterinternetsearch.com/">Better Internet Search</a>, the Fife based company behind the unique Kin search engine is doing things very differently.</p>
<p>They have ditched the traditional ad-based revenue model that is universally used by search engines, instead they have developed a new model with a community-based ecosystem and revenue share that enables users to participate in the development and success of the platform.</p>
<p>Blockchain and web 3 ideologies are the foundations of the new platform. This not only facilitates the highest levels of user privacy, but also provides a mechanism for community rewards. Users and supporters’ participation within the platform is the catalyst for both community and revenue growth. Digital tokens with a finite supply are used as incentives and recirculate within the company’s ecosystem.</p>
<p>The ‘tokenomics’ model used is explained fully in the company’s <a href="https://www.betterinternetsearch.com/whitepaper">white paper</a>.</p>
 Pioneering the Next Generation Internet 
<p>Kin is the brainchild of serial tech entrepreneur, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gordonpovey/">Dr Gordon Povey</a>, who filed his ideas for a new type of search engine into a patent (now granted) back in 2017. He then worked with cyber-security expert <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billatnapier/">Prof Bill Buchanan</a> and his team at Edinburgh Napier University, and with a grant from the European Union’s <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/">Next Generation Internet</a> project they were able to demonstrate a proof-of-concept in the lab.</p>

		 
			 
				The first experiments with a digital rewards token used the Scotcoin cryptocurrency and then a partnership with <a href="https://www.partisiablockchain.com/">Partisia Blockchain</a> enabled the company to mint its own Kin rewards token and create an internal ecosystem.
			 
		 
	
<p>The Kin revenue model is based on brokerage (finding what people want to buy) rather than advertising (convincing people to buy what you want to sell) and is effective because online sales are now high and continue to grow.</p>
<p>Almost all online sales are the result of searches and advertising tends to reduce the efficiency of this process, and biases decisions in favour of known brands and large advertising budgets. This works in favour of the advertiser rather than the customer, but Kin reverses this bias.</p>
<p>The minting of digital tokens on blockchain via a smart contact ensures that only a limited volume of tokens can exist, and this enables the company to raise funds via token sales to supporters. The <a href="https://www.betterinternetsearch.com/token-sale">first of these</a> opened on 1st November 2022 and on 1st December the tokens purchased will begin to be distributed into supporter’s digital wallets.</p>
<p>The growth of the Kin community (and the continuous need for user rewards) creates a demand for the finite tokens and increases its value over time.</p>
<p>Profit sharing provides a fund to buy and recycle tokens within the ecosystem. This gives the token its utility within the ecosystem and liquidity in the wider market. While raising funds via token sales is certainly not unique, it is very rare in Scotland and again underlines this company’s approach to doing things differently in order to disrupt the status quo.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The unbranded Kin prototype has been tested by early adopters around the globe and is available <a href="https://search.betterinternetsearch.com/login">for Digital Scotland readers to try</a>. The beta and full release version are scheduled for early in 2023. The above table demonstrates the significant differentiation that Kin has from other search engines in the market.</p>

<p>Genericode is a single semantic model for code lists, designed to IT-enable the interchange of machine-readable code list information between systems.</p> 


<p>OASIS and the Code List Representation TC [1] are pleased to announce that Code List Representation (genericode) Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>Code lists have been with us since long before computers. They should be well understood and easily dealt with by now. Unfortunately, they are not. As is often the case, if you take a fundamentally simple concept, you find everybody has their own unique view of what the problem is and how it should be solved.</p>



<p>The OASIS Code List Representation format, “genericode”, is a single semantic model of code lists and accompanying XML serialization that can encode a broad range of code list information. The serialization is designed to IT-enable the interchange or distribution of machine-readable code list information between systems.</p>

 Find the pockets of interop
 
 Which companies interop with what other companies; build bridges between the pockets 
 
 
 Interop testing
 
 Don't boil the ocean. Start with small targets. Let the question "what are we trying to accomplish with interop?" guide the targets. 
 Interested in a public assessment framework. 
 Bonnie Yau of IDLab mentioned they're working on a framework, starting from (or modelled after) the Aries Agent Test Harness. 
 
 
 Approaches to Localization
 
 BC Gov gave a demo of a localized wallet app with credential localization using OCA. (Link to demo pending) 
 What other approaches? 
 
 
 What does "interoperable" mean to different communities?
 
 Often gets thrown around in marketing jargon but what are some real metrics for defining whether something is "interoperable?" 
 
 
 Wallet UX
 
 There might be some other working groups focused on UX already. There might be some overlap with interop.

<p>This article explains how a programmable framework of impact evaluators can be built on top of Ceramic in order to distribute rewards to a wide range of community contributors—allowing DAOs to distribute funds more effectively to the people that create meaningful value.</p> What is an impact evaluator? <p>Impact evaluators (IE) are not new. The Bitcoin block reward is likely the simplest, and oldest, example of an impact evaluator. It’s an objective function that takes a measure of the world and distributes rewards based on that measure. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1soPQ31ZHkQ">Juan Benet defines</a> an impact evaluator as follows:</p> <code>ImpactEvaluator {
  foreach round {
    m := measure(world)
    w := evaluate(m)
    r := reward(w)
  }
}
</code> <p>The IE runs iteratively in rounds, with each round distributing a reward. There isn’t really a limit as to what the IE can measure and reward. However, it’s important that the measure is fairly objective and as non-gameable as possible. The more objective and immutable the IE is the more powerful it can generally become since actors interacting with it can reason about rewards long into the future.</p> Examples in Practice   Bitcoin block reward: Rewards miners based in <code>minerHashRate/totalHashRate</code>  Filecoin block reward: Rewards miners based on storage capacity they add to the network  <a href="https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/summoning-the-money-god-2a3f3564a5f2">RAI PID controller</a>: Rewards all participants based on the market rate of the RAI token  <a href="https://sourcecred.io/">Sourcecred</a>: Rewards contributors on Github, Discord, etc. based on a weighed page rank algorithm  <a href="https://coordinape.com/">Coordinape</a>: Rewards contributors based on the rating and feedback of other contributors  <a href="https://givepraise.xyz/">Praise by GivEth</a>: Rewards contributors based on how much “praise” they received  <a href="https://www.openq.dev/">OpenQ</a>: Rewards developers for closing PRs  <a href="https://jogl.io/">Just One Giant Lab</a>: Community peer reviews   Govrn <p><a href="https://medium.com/govrn/govrn-governance-model-27603e6dedd9">Govrn</a> stands out, from other projects tracking contributions in a social graph, since it allows projects to create an ontology of various types of contributions, which lets the IE of the DAO dynamically evolve over time.</p> Three Modalities of Rewards <p>There are thee main methods of distributing the rewards of an IE.</p> Rewards From DAO Treasuries <p>The <code>r</code> of the IE comes directly from the DAO treasury that is operating the IE. This can be seen as a way to reward the community of the DAO more effectively than running a grant program, or as a more fair continuous airdrop.</p> New Token <p>With a new token, an IE can mimic the Bitcoin reward curve. This can be seen as a fair launch based on the evaluation criteria of the IE.</p> Governance Shares <p>In certain DAO structures, such as Moloch, members hold non-transferable shares. An IE could easily be made to distribute these sort of shares as well. Here a Bitcoin-like reward curve could be used as well, and could be customized for the DAO in question.</p> Verifiable Data on Ceramic <p>Data written to Ceramic (e.g. using ComposeDB, Ceramic’s decentralized graph database) is ideal for creating verifiable contribution graphs. This is due to three main properties:</p>  Hash linked event logs - all data is stored as streams in Ceramic. A stream is an event log that can be independently verified by anyone who runs a node in the network  Timestamps - all streams are periodically anchored into the blockchain, providing a tamper-proof timestamp of when data was created  Attributable - all streams have one account as the controller and all events added to a stream needs to be signed by this controller. In practice the controller is a blockchain account (e.g. Ethereum address)   Trust Graphs and Evaluations <p>The framework for IE’s should be programmable such that developers can create their own IE for whatever actions they want to reward their community for. In order to reason about what this programming framework would look like we need to consider what data goes into the evaluation.</p> Data Apps on Ceramic <p>Some example of DAO-centric apps that can be built on Ceramic’s data layer:</p>  Issue tracking - who opened and closed issues  Project management - planning and management of projects  Personal contribution logs - individuals can state all the contributions they have made and to which projects / DAOs the contribution might be valuable for (this is the approach MetaCred is using)  Governance forums - proposals, discussions, etc.  Contribution evaluation - data similar to Coordinape or Praise  Knowledge graphs - e.g. Lateral’s Discourse Graph, or Foresight institute’s tech trees   Computation Over the Contribution DAG <p>All data in Ceramic is represented as an <a href="https://ipld.io">IPLD</a> DAG. An IE would have a specific CID (content identifier) hash that represents the entire contribution graph and runs the computation over this graph. This will make the computation easily reproducible, as long as it is deterministic.</p> Trusted Seed <p>In order to mitigate the issue of sybil accounts adding random or noisy data, an initial set of accounts that the graph is based upon is likely a good idea. This can be a simple list at first, but it should eventually leverage something like <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/gitcoin-builds-passport-on-ceramic/">Gitcoin Passport</a>. In addition to the initial trusted seed, the set of eligible accounts could grow through attestations according to some web-of-trust-like logic in the IE.</p> Evaluation Function <p>Let’s explore what the IE function will run each round.</p> World <p>First we need to measure the world. We can define a completely verifiable world as follows:</p>  Ceramic Data Models - the IE model would select a set of Ceramic models from which to read contribution data  Trusted seed - the set of accounts that root the trust of the contribution graph  Previously distributed rewards - the rewards that have been distributed in previous rounds  Other data - potentially including data from other sources, such as on-chain state   Evaluator <p>The evaluator itself should be a function with the world as parameters, and return a reward as a list of accounts and value. This function should be easy to implement in a general programming language. Something like Javascript (using <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-ses">Secure Ecmascript</a>) or WASM would make sense.</p><p>The world input parameters could be defined as follows:</p> <code>ImpactEvaluatorParams {
  ceramicData: [CID] // a list of CIDs defining the contribution graph DAG
  trustedSeed: [DID] // a list of initially trusted accounts
  previousRewards: CID // a merkle root of previous rewards
  otherData: CID // other verifiable data, e.g. ethereum state
}
</code> <p>The output of the IE, ideally, is easily claimable on-chain. It could be a CSV file for distributing tokens in Safe. These sort of distributions can be quite expensive as the contribution set grows. A better approach is to use some sort of merkle drop, basically putting the rewards in a merkle tree and allowing people to claim rewards as they see fit. <a href="https://github.com/Astrodrop/shrine">AstroDrop</a> is a good example of this that allows you to easily update the merkle tree. A merkle tree can also be represented in IPLD, which is nice for our compute function. The return value would likely need to return an updated trusted seed, as well, to enable growing of the user set using some sort of web-of-trust model.</p> <code>ImpactEvaluatorResult {
  rewards: CID // merkle root of rewards
  newTrustedSeed: [DID] // an updated list of trusted accounts
}
</code> <p>Ideally subsets of the IE function can be reused as modules and are composable.</p> Bringing Results On-Chain <p>The result of the IE needs to be put on-chain every round so that participants can claim rewards. There are a few different approaches to this outlined below.</p>  Oracles - A trusted third party, a set of nodes, or some sophisticated oracle network could be used to put the merkle tree root on-chain. Ideally there is some dispute mechanism that can be used if the oracle misbehaves. Worth noting is that the IE function should be reproducible / deterministic. This means that it’s straight forward for an outside observer to determine if the oracle behaved well or not  Verification game - A verification game like fraud proofs in optimistic rollups or Truebit. These can be quite complicated to implement but possible as a way to reduce trust assumptions  ZKP - In principle the entire IE function can be evaluated in a zk circuit and the proof posted on-chain. This would make the IE’s completely trustless. However, it would be a quite big undertaking to implement provers for every IE. It would be more convenient to rely on some sort of general circuit. Something like <a href="https://github.com/DelphinusLab/zkWasm">zkWasm</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lurk-lang">Lurk</a> could be good candidates   A Practical Approach <p>In order to bring the programmable IE primitive to as many DAOs as possible a good first approach would be an integration with <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/">Safe</a> using <a href="https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-reality/get-started">Zodiac’s reality</a> module. Reality is a configurable oracle that uses Reality.eth. It could be easily used to put the root of the reward merkle tree on-chain, attached to some custom logic. In practice, every round some off-chain actor would load all Ceramic streams and associated data, run the IE function over this data (e.g. using <a href="https://www.bacalhau.org/">Bacalhau</a>), and make a call to the Reality.eth oracle on-chain. Other actors can run the same computation over the same data and dispute the result if necessary. Final arbitration could be handled by the Kleros court, for example. Note that, in contrast to normal arbitrations that Kleros deals with, here we have a completely objective outcome that the arbiters will need to judge. They can easily run the computation for themselves to see the desired result.</p> Next steps   <a href="https://app.radius.space/grants/a644017a-fd11-4ae4-8e86-0d0293ddd0c1">Apply for the MVP implementation grant!</a> Ceramic and Bacalhau have put together a joint grant to fund the development of an MVP impact evaluator protocol  <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/">Share your Impact Evaluator ideas on the Ceramic forum</a>  Eventually there might be an IE that rewards apps adding valuable data to the Ceramic network

 RMI Partners with Energy Web to Build Sustainable Aviation Fuel Certificate Registry, as Part of Ongoing Decarbonization Work with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers&nbsp;Alliance  A digital registry for sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc) can give corporate fliers, fuel suppliers, the aviation sector, and its investors confidence to aim higher and scale&nbsp;faster. <p>Boulder, CO — November 16, 2022 <br>RMI and Energy Web Foundation today announced that they will build a digital registry for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) certificates that will bring more transparency to emissions reduction claims about air travel. The registry will also support and accelerate the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels that drastically reduce lifecycle emissions from air transport.</p><p>The registry will support ongoing work with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (<a href="https://rmi.org/saba">SABA</a>), a coalition of corporate buyers and aviators committed to decarbonizing aviation, co-founded by RMI and the Environmental Defense&nbsp;Fund</p><blockquote>“RMI is very excited to see this crucial tool to fruition,” said Bryan Fisher, managing director for RMI’s Climate-Aligned Industries Program. “A transparent, easy-to-use registry built on a rigorous accounting approach will lift public confidence in SAF emissions reduction claims, propel investment in SAF production, and accelerate decarbonization of the aviation&nbsp;sector.”</blockquote><p>SAF is a drop-in fuel made with renewable or waste feedstocks that can decrease the lifecycle emissions of flight by up to 99 percent. Currently, SAF production is insufficient to meet demand from corporate flyers that aim to decarbonize flights taken by their employees and&nbsp;goods.</p><p>SAF certificates enable companies and other aviation customers to pay for the environmental benefits (such as emissions reductions) of SAF, even if the physical fuel is not yet available for their flights. Decoupling the environmental attributes of SAF from the physical fuel will democratize access to SAF’s benefits and catalyze SAF supply at scale. A digital registry in which SAFc can be securely and consistently issued, transferred, and retired is critical to ensure that these certificates represent unique and verified emissions reduction claims.</p><blockquote>“This registry is a wonderful opportunity to showcase how technology can bring transparency and trust to complex supply chains like SAF,” said Jesse Morris, CEO at Energy Web. “And by building the registry open source, the SAF industry can help other hard-to-decarbonize sectors understand what’s possible with digital technology.”</blockquote><p>The registry will enable SAF suppliers, airlines, corporate flyers, freight carriers, logistics service providers, and freight shippers to demonstrate and verify that the SAF and SAFc they invest in meets specific sustainability criteria linked to certifications of each fuel’s supply chain. It will support companies’ ability to make auditable claims about their investments in climate disclosures.</p><blockquote>“The development of the SAFc registry represents the first major milestone for the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance, making good on our promise to break down roadblocks and create the tools necessary to decarbonize the aviation sector,” said Kim Carnahan, head of SABA’s Secretariat and Senior Director for Net Zero Fuels at Engie&nbsp;Impact.</blockquote><p>The SAFc registry is expected to go live in mid-2023.</p><p>Media inquiries please&nbsp;contact:</p><p>Alexandra Jardine Wall, Strategic Communications Manager for the Climate-Aligned Industries Program, RMI.

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/action/social-tech/"></a>For a while in 2014 I found myself homeless on the streets of Toronto. 
 Here’s what I learned that inspired and informed my passion and ambitions for ‘Social Tech’ innovations. 
 
 Stories and stereotypes – The greatest challenge we face in addressing poverty-related social issues is the dark stereotypes harboured about poor people and grotesquely amplified by the tabloid media. 
 Community knowledge – Angels operate among us, providing charitable services to help the homeless, and knowledge of who/what/where/when is shared by word of mouth. 
 
<p>These insights can help begin to identify where technology innovations could be applied.</p>
 Challenging Stereotypes 
<p>Just a few years before my own experience of homelessness I was a dotcom millionaire, living in a house with an indoor swimming pool and driving a BMW 7 Series, thinking I was the cock of the walk.&nbsp;Fast forward through a series of terrible decisions and disasters and I was a resident of the Salvation Army homeless shelter in Toronto.</p>
<p>So, a poster boy for how a riches to rags tale can happen to any one and testimony to no matter how smart and well off you think you are, every one is just a few mistakes away from ending up on the streets.</p>
<p>This provided a starting point for my learning.</p>
<p>There are often dark stereotypes peddled about the homeless, that they are all where they are due to substance abuse and do little to help themselves, indeed it is broadly applied to all aspects of poverty. Those on welfare are demonized as lazy and taking advantage of the system. Immigrants receive the same treatment. It greatly impacts how they are treated.</p>
<p>In short they are reduced one dimensional caricatures by hate spreaders like the Daily Mail, when the reality is as you would expect, there is a huge diversity of different people with different, tragic stories for how their life journey led them to situations like homelessness. Mine was just one in a sea of other, far worse experiences.</p>
 Social Reporting – Helping Invisible People Become Visible 
<p>So one of the most important steps we can take is to challenge these nonsensical and harmful stereotypes that influence people’s perception of those affected: That the homeless community is made up of every possible human story across the spectrum of life you might imagine.</p>
<p>This led me to the idea of ‘Social Reporting’, ways in which this spectrum can be communicated to an audience such that they too come to this realization, on a large scale.</p>
<p>For example in Canada a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/teen-photographer-portrays-homeless-1.4192340">teen photographer</a>&nbsp;set out to capture the photos and life stories of the homeless around cities in North America, such as the man from Winnipeg who lost his three year old daughter and whose wife committed suicide, published into a book Nowhere to Call Home with a goal of&nbsp;<a href="https://surreyhomeless.ca/news/2017/07/theyve-never-stopped-to-talk-to-the-person-sitting-on-the-corner-of-the-street-they-just-walk-by/">encouraging others</a>&nbsp;to see the homeless as people not stereotypes.</p>
<p>An especially powerful initiative is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/InvisiblePeople/videos">Invisible People Youtube series</a>. The host has spent years interviewing homeless people across the world building a vast library of the most painful human experiences you can be exposed to, entirely destroying the idea that there is a single stereotypical homeless story.</p>
<p>Critically it also highlights that from a Social Tech point of view, it doesn’t have to be advanced technologies like the Blockchain or Ai, but rather it’s simple journalism tools that can achieve the most impact. How we might scale their use to achieve a wholesale societal transformation is the key question.</p>

<p>The ToIP Foundation is pleased to announce the release of the first public review draft of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification V1.0</a>. This document specifies the architectural requirements for the ToIP Technology Stack shown on the left side of the diagram below. (The first generation requirements for the ToIP Governance Stack on the right side were <a href="https://trustoverip.org/news/2022/02/01/the-toip-foundation-releases-its-first-official-governance-specifications/">published in January 2022</a>.)</p>







<p>This first public review draft represents over a thousand collective hours of work by members of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group">Technology Architecture Task Force</a> of the ToIP <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group">Technology Stack Working Group</a>. It is divided into 12 sections:</p>



 
 Introduction 



 Terminology 



 Motivations 



 Audience, Purpose, and Scope 



 Example Use Cases 



 Reference Architecture Overview 



 Endpoint Systems and the Layered Stack 



 The ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol 



 Intermediary Systems 



 Supporting Systems 



 Endpoint System Interoperability 



 Integration with the ToIP Governance Stack 
 



<p>It also includes three helpful Appendices:</p>



 
 Consolidated Requirements — a table of all 30 normative architectural requirements broken down by layer 



 Consolidated Views of the ToIP Stack — a set of diagrams showing different ways of viewing the technology stack as a whole. 



 Evolution of the ToIP Stack — a synopsis of the new living document published by the ToIP Foundation — <a>see below</a>. 
 



 The Hourglass Model 



<p>Of the 17 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack</a> developed by the ToIP Foundation in 2021, perhaps none is more important than #3, the Hourglass Model. It can be summarized as:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In a layered protocol architecture, the most successful design takes an hourglass shape where a single “spanning layer” in the middle connects a family of higher-level application-facing protocols with a family of lower-level transport protocols.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Hourglass Model is widely cited as the key reason for the success of the TCP/IP stack that gave us the Internet. Here is a depiction of the TCP/IP “hourglass” from a <a href="https://www.iab.org/wp-content/IAB-uploads/2010/11/hourglass-london-ietf.pdf">2001 IETF presentation</a> by Steve Deering of Cisco:</p>







<p>As this diagram shows, for the TCP/IP stack, the spanning layer is the IP protocol in the middle. For the ToIP stack, the spanning layer is the ToIP trust spanning protocol, as shown in this figure from section 6.2 of the specification:</p>







<p>The importance of the trust spanning layer is reflected in the fact that 60% (18 out of 30) of the requirements in the ToIP Technology Architecture Specification V1.0 are for this layer. The full implications of the Hourglass Model — when applied to establishing Internet-wide decentralized digital trust infrastructure — are further suggested by this diagram from Appendix B of the ToIP Technology Architecture V1.0 Specification:</p>







 The Public Review Process 



<p>The release of the first public review draft of the ToIP Technology Architecture Specification V1.0 is just the first step in completing the specification. The ToIP Technology Stack Working Group is reaching out to all related industry organizations and stakeholders for feedback. We plan to publish at least one (and possibly several) additional public review drafts before the 1.0 spec is finalized.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">draft specification</a> is available in both PDF and Markdown formats. To provide feedback on the draft specification, please <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">see the instructions on this page</a>.</p>



 Evolution of the ToIP Stack 



<p>The release of the ToIP Technology Architecture V1.0 Specification for public review is the next major milestone in a multi-year process of fully defining the ToIP stack. To help audiences outside the ToIP Foundation better understand this planned progression of deliverables, the Foundation has also published a new living document called <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/evolution-of-the-toip-stack/">Evolution of the ToIP Stack</a>. This document explains the four major stages of development as illustrated in this diagram:</p>







<p>The Evolution of the ToIP Stack also includes a mapping of existing technologies and specifications to the ToIP technology stack. Since this mapping will evolve both as the ToIP Technology Architecture Specification and the component technologies/specifications evolve, the ToIP Foundation intends to publish new versions of the Evolution of the ToIP Stack at each major evolutionary milestone. You can track new versions of the document <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/evolution-of-the-toip-stack/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In October, the Human Colossus Foundation <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/oca-v1-launch">released</a> the “Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA)” and announced the intent to launch the “Decentralised Semantics Working Group (DSWG)”. The DSWG is where the ongoing active development of OCA and future decentralised semantics standards at the Foundation will occur. A month on, the Foundation is officially launching the DSWG and inviting you to <a href="https://www.meetup.com/geneve-new-technology-meetup-group/events/289662414/">join the kickoff call</a> on Thursday, November 17th, at 17.00 CET.</p><p>Decentralised Semantics is an exciting new data domain spearheaded by the Foundation to enable the structuring of unstructured data with morphologic, semantic, and pragmatic accuracy. It is an essential underpinning of our envisioned Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) and guides tooling development for the DDE Semantic Layer (Layer 1 of the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f2893465394d4b829661bc/1660062007339/HCF+DDE+Trust+Infrastructure+Stack+v1.0.0.pdf">DDE Trust Infrastructure</a>). One of the first tools we created for the Semantic Layer is the recently released OCA, an architecture for capturing the metadata necessary to interpret and preserve the meaning of inputted data.</p><p>OCA is the Foundation’s proposed global standard for data capture that promises to significantly enhance the ability to define, manage, and use data in terms of simplicity, accuracy, and allocation of resources. The DSWG will maintain the official<a href="https://oca.colossi.network/"> OCA </a><a href="https://oca.colossi.network/specification/">Technical Specification</a>, generate Source Code for open-access schemas, and create and maintain related datasets and assets to benefit the<a href="https://oca.colossi.network/ecosystem/tour.html"> OCA Ecosystem</a> (a reference implementation of the OCA specification). We also expect to discover further standardisation and tooling needs for Decentralised Semantics through the Working Group.</p><p>Paul Knowles and Ryan Barrett will co-chair the DSWG. Paul is a co-founder of the Foundation and the Head of our Advisory Council. Paul plays an instrumental role in identifying and defining Decentralised Semantics. He is also the inventor of OCA, the brainchild of his over 20 years of experience in roles spanning different stages of the data management cycle. Ryan is an independent Tech Lead/Architect with over 20 years of experience building and designing reliable and innovative software systems. He currently represents the Dutch Ministry of Health as a Technical Architect after playing a leading role in the pandemic Contact Tracing and Vaccination Passport systems.</p><p>The Working Group will meet weekly on Thursday at 5 pm CET. We will release more information about how to join the Working Group and contribute on the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/decentralised-semantics-wg">website</a>. For the kickoff call, we will walk through the DSWG Charter, provide an overview of the current status of OCA, give a brief synopsis of the short-term roadmap, and describe the standard <a href="https://github.com/the-human-colossus-foundation/oca-spec">Request for Comment (RFCs) lifecycle</a> for OCA development.</p><p>To learn more about Decentralised Semantics and OCA before the kickoff, we recommend the following resources:</p>  <p>The New Blog Post - “A quest for accurate data (Part 1)” [<a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/accuratedata1">Link</a>]</p>  <p>The Academic Paper - “Decentralised semantics in distributed ecosystems” [<a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3249/paper4-OSS.pdf">Link</a>]</p>  <p>The OCA Technical Specification [<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/634d55c7cb2c9a43206480c1/1666012626086/HCF+Overlays+Capture+Architecture+%28OCA%29+v1.pdf">Link</a>]</p>  <p>We look forward to meeting you at the Decentralised Semantics Working Group kickoff meeting on Thursday, November 17th, at 17.00 CET!</p>

<p></p>     <p>Increasing demand for batteries in consumer electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), and grid support has accelerated the global market. In the U.S. alone, batteries landed in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2021/11/30/supply-chain-challenge-20-complex-auto-industry-transitions-to-electric/?sh=563ed5cc1192">top 3 imports</a> for September 2021. Globally, EVs are projected to make up <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/26/electric-vehicles-projected-to-make-up-31-of-the-global-fleet-by-2050/">31% of all light-duty vehicles by 2050</a>. This increased demand — in addition to recent proposed legislation such as the EU’s carbon border tax — puts pressure on battery manufacturers, suppliers, and vehicle manufacturers (OEMs) to ensure a safe, secure, efficient, and sustainable global battery value chain.</p>
<p>As demand skyrockets, we’re seeing a surge in new regulations surrounding the composition, manufacturing, usage, and recycling of batteries around the globe. Battery labeling — which includes attaching physical labels to a battery to provide its unique characteristics, such as number of cells, cell chemistry, dimensions, and more — is of particular interest to regulators and battery supply chain stakeholders hoping to increase visibility and efficiency as well as reduce the margin of error in battery recycling, reuse, and repurposing procedures.</p>
                      <p>The European Commission (EC) lays out clear requirements for battery labeling in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02006L0066-20131230&amp;rid=1">Directive 2006/66/EC</a> and amendments to <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R1020&amp;from=EN">Regulation (EU) No 2019/1020</a>. EC regulations specify size and location requirements for the label, stating that all batteries must meet these labeling requirements to be placed on the market in the EU. For example, the EU will require batteries measuring above 2 kWh to provide carbon footprint labeling.</p>
<p>The California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) Lithium-ion Car Battery Recycling Advisory Group also mentioned battery labeling in its <a href="https://calepa.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/2022_AB-2832_Lithium-Ion-Car-Battery-Recycling-Advisory-Goup-Final-Report.pdf">final report</a>, released in March 2022. In this report, the advisory group suggests requiring OEMs in California to attach standardized physical battery labels to help with reuse, repurposing, and recycling efforts. The California Air Resource Board (CARB) is also developing a labeling requirement as part of their proposed <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/advanced-clean-cars-program/advanced-clean-cars-ii">Advanced Clean Cars II</a> regulation.</p>
<p>At MOBI, we believe that trusted multiparty track-and-trace systems are needed to effectively manage assets in the value chain, enhance interoperability between stakeholders, and empower consumers to make informed purchasing decisions with confidence. In addition to spurring second-life and recycling use cases, battery labeling is also necessary to enable trusted track-and-trace applications for battery manufacturers, OEMs, and consumers, as peer-to-peer traceability requires that all participants reference a standardized framework for identifying assets as they travel upstream and downstream the value chain. Labeling is a foundational element for recording battery State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH) data, managing battery-electric-grid integration, tracking maintenance and repairs, managing recalls, and more.</p>
                      <p>In July 2022, MOBI released the <a href="http://dlt.mobi/standards/">Battery Identification Number (BIN) Technical Specifications</a>, which specifies the format, content, and physical requirements for a globally unique identity of battery packs. The BIN is composed of a Battery Manufacturer Identifier (BMI), a Battery Descriptor Section (BDS), and a Battery Identifier Section (BIS), each of which denotes a battery’s specific characteristics, integrated with a unique and traceable identity. Similar to the vehicle identification number (VIN), the BIN is designed to be a physical indelible identity included on the battery’s physical label. The unique BIN number can be included as an attribute in a digital identity such as the one standardized by MOBI called Battery Birth Certificate, which is based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials (VCs</a>) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> standards.</p>
<p>Additionally, in 2021 and 2022, MOBI developed a <a href="http://dlt.mobi/citopia-partstrak/">pilot to demonstrate a traceability flow</a> for maintaining a verifiable chain of custody in the EV battery supply chain with multiple stakeholders. In the demonstration, a Battery Birth Certificate containing BIN information such as the battery’s serial number, energy capacity, and chemical composition was issued by the battery supplier. The battery certificate was linked with the Vehicle Birth Certificate (stored in a vehicle’s <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twin</a>, or SSDT, as defined in MOBI’s <a href="http://dlt.mobi/standards/">VID Standards</a>) when installed by the OEM. When dealing with faulty batteries that were returned to the supplier, RevocationList2020 from W3C’s VC standard was implemented to revoke the vehicle or battery credentials if the components of the vehicle or battery were changed. The Battery SSDT is designed to be linked to a physical label on the battery, so that the physical label can be resolved to the battery’s digital identity, credentials, and other data. We aim to integrate these capabilities developed during the demonstration in the ongoing <a href="http://dlt.mobi/battery-innovation/">Battery SSDT and the Battery Passport</a> initiatives.</p>
                      <p>MOBI’s <a href="https://dlt.mobi/mobi-working-groups/">Supply Chain Working Group</a> is developing a guideline for the industry to use previously mentioned technology components in battery passports for reuse, repurposing, and recycling traceability. The Supply Chain Working Group contributors include Accenture, AIOI, Anritsu, Arxum, ASJade Tech, Aucnet, Autodata Group, AWS, Blockedge, BMW, CEVT, Dana, DENSO, DLT Labs, DMX, Fifth-9, Ford, Hitachi, Honda, IBM, IOTA, ITOCHU, Marelli, Mazda, Nara Institute, ParkMyFleet, Politecnico Di Torino, Quantstamp, R3, Reply, State Farm, Stellantis, SyncFab, Thirdware, TICO, and Vinturas.</p>

<p>According to the Bitwarden survey, roughly half of respondents deploy or have plans to deploy password-less technology. Of that percentage, 66% have one-to-two user groups or multiple teams using password-less technology, and 13% have deployed to their entire organisation. Of those that have made the switch, 51% are or would consider implementing ‘something you are’ password-less authentication. Half (47%) say they are very familiar with the FIDO2 password-less authentication standard and consider it important to their company’s password-less experience.</p>

<p>Finding a way to easily implement verifiable credentials? 🧐</p>
<p><a href="https://verifiablecredentials.info/">Verifiable Credentials Ltd</a>&nbsp;has 20 years of university research experience that users the most standards conformant, easiest to implement, fully secure, and privacy-protecting verifiable credentials eco-system from a co-author of the W3C Recommendation.</p>
<p>We have had the pleasure to interview&nbsp;<a href="https://spaces.fundingbox.com/spaces/ngi-next-generation-internet-ngi-news-events/20%20years%20of%20university%20research%20brings%20you%20the%20most%20standards%20conformant,%20easiest%20to%20implement,%20fully%20secure,%20and%20privacy%20protecting%20verifiable%20credentials%20eco-system%20from%20a%20co-author%20of%20the%20W3C%20Recommendation">David Chadwick</a>, CEO at Verifiable Credentials and renowned expert on SSI, which will explain to you the beginning of this idea and which are their goals in the future.</p>
 1. Introduce yourself and your company, and what services or products you offer. 
<p></p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials Ltd (VCL) was a spin out company from the University of Kent, led by David Chadwick, Professor of Information Systems Security. The objective of VCL was to commercialise Professor Chadwick’s 20+ years of research into identity management that started with X.500/X.509 in the 1990s, and culminated in a proof of concept Verifiable Credentials prototype at about the same time that the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model Recommendation was first published. VCL applied to the first business-oriented eSSIF-lab call in order to build&nbsp;a user friendly controlled natural language (CNL)&nbsp;GUI for creating the policies that verifiers will need to specify for requesting verifiable credentials from users 1. The GUI allows users to specify their policies in either conjunctive normal form or disjunctive normal form, in the controlled natural language of their choice. English, German, French and Portuguese variants were produced during the eSSIF project. The CNL is then translated into VCL’s JSON-based policy language 2 and stored in an open-source Policy Server, allowing many different wallets and verifiers to share the same policy.</p>
 2. What have you achieved with your idea thanks to eSSIF_Lab project? 
<p>One of the unexpected outcomes of participating in eSSIF-lab, was that VCL was introduced to the TRAIN project being run by Fraunhofer. TRAIN allows verifiable credential ecosystems to provide scalable trust in issuers. This functionality was already in Professor Chadwick’s roadmap for VCL, so it was opportune to work with Fraunhofer and to integrate TRAIN into VCL’s prototype.</p>
<p>Shortly after the eSSIF project was completed in 2021, Crossword Cybersecurity PLC (CCP), a UK SME listed on the London AIM stock market, acquired VCL, in order to strengthen VCL’s development and marketing teams. CCP now licenses the Identiproof product, which is a fully standard conformant implementation of the W3C VC Data Model.</p>
<p>Identiproof comprises a VC issuer, a wallet for both Android and iOS, and a VC Verifier, along with background services such as a policy server and audit server. CCP is currently leading the NGI Atlantic project “Next Generation SSI Standards” which is implementing the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OID4VCs) protocol suite. Partners in this project are Spruce Inc from the USA and Fraunhofer from Germany. Interworking tests between Spruce’s (or CCP’s) wallet and CCP’s (or Spruce’s) issuer and verifier are currently taking place, Under this project TRAIN has been extended by Fraunhofer to support scalable trust in both verifiers and wallet software providers, as well as in issuers. A protocol enhancement to OIDC4VCs has been specified in order for TRAIN to be tested between the USA and Europe.</p>
 3. What are your goals for the middle/long-time future? 
<p></p>
<p>CCPs short to medium-term goals are to fully integrate the OIDC4VCs protocol suite and enhanced TRAIN infrastructure into Identiproof, and to add a web-based wallet to Identiproof to complement its existing iOS and Android offerings. Since the education market is one of CCP’s identified markets for verifiable credentials, CCP’s short-term goal is to successfully participate in the JFF Plugfests in order to show that Identiproof is a standards conformant product that can interwork with a whole range of different verifiable credential products from different providers across the globe.</p>
 4. Any piece of advice for those who are looking for public funding? 
<p></p>
<p>CCP’s advice to others who are looking for public funding is to&nbsp;keep one step ahead of the crowd in your R&amp;D work, so that when calls for proposals are issued you already have a very good idea and well worked-out plan of what you want to develop. Ideally, you may already have a proof of concept in your lab.</p>

 New end-to-end solution has settled $1B in transactions to date with Checkout.com and will enable a global digital asset economy for merchants, entrepreneurs and creators. 



<p>Fireblocks&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.fireblocks.com/">www.fireblocks.com</a>), an easy-to-use platform to create innovative products on the blockchain and manage day-to-day crypto operations, announced today the public launch of its Payments Engine, a new suite of tools that will enable payment service providers (PSPs) with the ability to provide a blockchain agnostic, end-to-end solution for merchants, entrepreneurs and creators to accept, manage and settle digital asset payment transactions across any geography.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early pilot partner Checkout.com, who was instrumental in supporting the development of the Payments Engine, has facilitated more than $1 billion in digital asset merchant settlements through their solution this year. Today, Fireblocks welcomes FIS, the largest merchant acquirer in the world, into its network of partners using the Payments Engine. FIS and its Worldpay solutions already provide card-to-crypto processing services for 4 of the top 5 cryptocurrency exchanges and was the first global merchant acquirer to offer USDC settlements. Together, the payment services providers&nbsp;collectively serve over a million merchants around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the last several years, critical work has been done in the space to address pieces of the payments system,” said&nbsp;Michael Shaulov, CEO of Fireblocks.&nbsp;“From stablecoin settlement to cross-border payments to payouts for creators, we believe that the payments system must be addressed holistically, especially as we see digital assets continue to proliferate into mainstream technologies and the global economy. We have seen a tremendous amount of momentum from some of the biggest names in categories such as creator economies, streaming applications, and ride-sharing apps, who are actively thinking about more efficient ways to remit payments to marketplace participants.”</p>



<p>Following the acquisition of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/accelerating-our-payment-capabilities-with-first-digital-acquisition/#:~:text=We%27re%20excited%20to%20announce,make%20payouts%20in%20digital%20currencies.">First Digital</a>, which brought specialized digital asset payments capabilities to the Fireblocks’ platform, the newly launched Payments Engine provides a turnkey solution for businesses that want to integrate digital asset operations into existing or new products. Utilizing Fireblocks’ Payments Engine, PSPs will have a secure platform to deploy new digital asset payment rails, expanding their capabilities to accept, collect, payout, process and settle transactions using digital assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The widespread use of stablecoins have made digital asset-based payments use cases very compelling for payments companies,” said&nbsp;Fireblocks Vice President and Head of Payments, Ran Goldi.&nbsp;“Fireblocks’ new Payments Engine will allow PSPs to offer and interact with a new breed of payments technology. We have had the privilege of working alongside the largest PSPs in the world to develop innovative fit-to-purpose solutions to support the next generation of payments products and services. We’re excited to roll out our vision for the payments space with our partners and showcase the results of these collaborative efforts with our customers in the upcoming months.”</p>



<p>With&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/technology/us-cons-merchant-getting-ready-for-crypto.pdf">reports</a>&nbsp;anticipating that over 75% of retailers plan to adopt digital asset payment services within the next two years, early movers in the payments space like Checkout.com and FIS have already begun taking advantage of Fireblocks’ Payments Engine to offer merchants the flexibility of 24/7 settlement, increasing cash flow, and reducing operational complexity.</p>



<p>“We’re enthusiastic about a wide-scale shift among enterprises and consumers towards digital payment systems,” said&nbsp;Nabil Manji, Head of Crypto &amp; Web3 at FIS. “Together we will enable crypto-native and traditional businesses to accept, manage and settle digital assets so that they may choose their preferred currency for conducting business. This further builds on our relationship with Fireblocks, where we have already teamed to provide enterprise-grade&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fisglobal.com/about-us/media-room/press-release/2022/fis-teams-with-fireblocks-to-accelerate-crypto-adoption-within-capital-markets-industry-globally">digital asset investing and wallet technology</a>&nbsp;to our capital market clients.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to stablecoin settlements, PSPs can use Fireblocks’ Payment Engine for:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Cross-border internal settlement&nbsp;— PSPs can now provide global, multinational companies ability to easily settle finances across multiple currencies with greater transparency 



 Creator/seller payouts&nbsp;—&nbsp;Enabling PSPs to offer payouts to marketplace participants faster and with more transparency in a way that is more suited to micropayments 



 Pay-ins&nbsp;—&nbsp;Allowing PSPs to enable their merchants to accept crypto as a payment method with significantly lower processing fees 
 



<p>“Across the globe, businesses, organizations, local governments, and individual consumers are all emphatically embracing new Web3 and digital payments technologies,” said&nbsp;Max Rothman, Head of Crypto &amp; Digital Assets at Checkout.com.&nbsp;“To that end, through Checkout.com’s partnership with Fireblocks’ Payments Engine, we are able to pioneer new Web 3 solutions for our clients, such as our Stablecoin Settlement solution launched earlier this year. The result is faster, more affordable, and more secure transactions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accessible via its UIs and APIs, Fireblocks’ Payments Engine provides a platform for PSPs to manage their merchants’ money flow in an easy and secure manner. Fireblocks is the highest-valued digital asset platform in the world, currently valued at $8 billion, and has also secured the transfers of over $3 trillion in digital assets.</p>

<p>Several government departments around the world are keen to offer their citizens seamless interactions and engaging experiences, akin to those in the private sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The public sector is often riddled with manual processes, time-consuming verifications, legacy systems leading to low transparency and high costs. Over the years, digitalization has alleviated some of the challenges, but rising threats on privacy, data security coupled with the increasing legislations that enshrine the right-to-be-forgotten such as Europe’s GDPR or California’s CCPA pose new challenges for leaders serving in the public sector.</p>



<p>In the future, we will witness a monumental shift in what citizens will come to expect from their governments – nothing short of how they experience retail or banking in their life. While this digital transformation has already begun in the public sector, technologies such as blockchain are essential foundations that will power the next generation of citizen experiences. Blockchain and, more broadly, distributed ledger technologies will create a core of trust, transparency, and immutability that&nbsp; breaks down information silos, reducing&nbsp; cost all while vastly enriching the citizen experiences.</p>



<p>Infosys is proud to have been part of the transformation that is driving change in the public sector. We are happy to share a couple of examples where Infosys brought our strong capabilities in blockchain to help clients reimagine citizen experiences.</p>



 
 Blockchain helps reimagine public records validation for Riverside County California 
 



<p>Riverside County California relied heavily on security paper and wet signatures to establish ‘trust’ and authenticate records. Citizens often had to wait for the physical copies of verified documents to reach them by post, which led to delays. In addition, easy access to numerous online tools increased the incidence of fraud, making it challenging to verify proof-of-records and physical documents, which was done manually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Infosys Public Services helped create a blockchain-based digital records fulfillment solution for Riverside County’s Assessor-County Clerk-Recorder Office. Built on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework, the new platform can seamlessly verify and authenticate several types of digital records (like land records, births, marriages, and deaths). The solution also bypasses physical paper records by issuing digital documents when a citizen or entity requests them, thereby providing an e-commerce-like experience. The blockchain solution will help Riverside County California achieve cost savings, faster turnaround time, and enhanced customer service.</p>



<p>Read the full case study to see <a href="https://www.infosyspublicservices.com/insights/public-records-validation-process.html">how Riverside County authenticates and delivers digital records with 100% trust to citizens</a>.</p>



 
 Blockchain streamlines professional license issuance and verification for the State of Rhode Island 
 



<p>The Department of Business Regulation (DBR) in the State of Rhode Island chose to pilot a blockchain solution for identity validation, which is a pre-requisite for issuing licenses. The department used paper-based applications to issue nearly 200,000 licenses annually. This led to high operational inefficiencies, greater costs, and a poor citizen experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DBR partnered with Infosys Public Services (Infosys) for its proven expertise in transforming government processes and implementing blockchain technology. Infosys implemented a blockchain-based identity and credential management solution using Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries that can quickly and securely validate an individual’s credentials. The solution is built on the Self-Sovereign Identity Model where citizens are the custodians of their data (i.e., personal data is stored on citizen mobile wallets, not on the blockchain). Instead, the blockchain stores the information needed to cryptographically validate the citizen’s credentials, which is shared with other parties. This solution can be easily adopted by other departments within the state paving the way for greater adoption across the entire state.</p>



<p>Read the complete case study to see <a href="https://www.infosys.com/services/blockchain/analyst-reports/streamline-identity-validation.html">why blockchain was the right solution for the State of Rhode Island</a>.</p>



<p>Beyond the buzz, blockchain is proving to be a beneficial technology in the real world across banking, insurance, retail and other industries. Governments around the world are not sitting on the sidelines but jumping mainstream into this disruptive technology to drive citizen-centered governance.</p>

<p>Geneva, Switzerland, November 10 2022&nbsp;<br>“Integrity” and “Authenticity” are the cryptographic data security properties to ensure data accuracy across a digital network, connection, or exchange. Unfortunately, both properties are only sometimes adhered to simultaneously, which leads to security degradation. For example, even if a data source is authentic, it does not necessarily mean that the metadata and data in the message have integrity. This blog post delves into the dualism of the two data security properties and how they translate to data capture and entry processes in a digital system. These properties ensure uncompromised cryptographic data security and provide the basis for structuring metadata and data to preserve the original context of messages at any interaction point in a data lifecycle.</p><p>Data accuracy, the sole standard of data quality, refers to data consistency with reality, where data messages require the following characteristics to be deemed accurate.</p>  <p>Authenticable lineage assures where the data originated and where it moves over time in a chain of interrelated events.</p>  <p>Incorruptible content assures that the data was not intentionally or unintentionally modified from source to target.</p>  <p>Comprehensible meaning provides information about the context of the data and how to interpret and comprehend it.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Nowadays, it is common in digital systems to have uninterpretable data from a known source in its original format. Furthermore, approximately 80% of recorded data in today's digital landscape is unstructured, and the trend is towards more unstructured data [1][2]. However, data is more accessible for systems to interpret for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and statistical analysis if it is tied to structured metadata to provide comprehensible meaning.</p><p>Without “meaning”, even the most secure data won’t provide value because it is difficult to interpret for processing.</p> The integrity of digital objects and objectual relationships <p>Data semantics is the study of the meaning and use of specific pieces of data in computer programming and other areas that employ data. Without a system of interpretation, data has no inherent structural, definitional, or contextual meaning. This interpretation is provided by "metadata", sets of data that give meaning to any stored sequence of bytes. In computer science, an object or objectual relationship can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method [3]. Metadata organises objectual data by using terms associated with a particular object. Any change in metadata could influence the meaning of the data it describes, which is why assuring metadata integrity is as important as guaranteeing the integrity of the data itself.</p><p>Data capture is the process of collecting structured and unstructured information electronically and converting it into data readable by a computer or other electronic device. The process entails implementing structural, definitional, and contextual definitions (“metadata”) to interpret data that adhere to those definitions. In a balanced digital network [4], connection, or exchange, data capture requires messages to be deterministically identifiable and content-addressable to ensure the integrity of the objectual content of the message.</p><p>So, "Integrity" relates to objects. All objects and their relationships MUST be deterministic to ensure data accuracy, completeness, and consistency. An object is deterministic if any operation's result and final state depend solely on the initial state and the operation's arguments.</p><blockquote><p>We can achieve objectual integrity by combining data integrity with metadata integrity.</p></blockquote> The authenticity of digital events <p>Data inputs are sequences of bytes that provide information to a computer in a moment. In computer science, a factual event is an action or occurrence identified by a program that has significance for system hardware or software. Stored sequences of bytes are known as "data".</p><p>Data entry is the process of transcribing information into an electronic medium such as a computer or other electronic device. The process entails storing state changes as recorded events to determine the authenticity of the data origin (the “source”), its status, and where it moves over time. In a balanced digital network [4], connection, or exchange, data entry requires append-only logs to accompany signed data inputs to identify the origin and creation of authentic events at recorded moments so that the inputted data can be considered factual.</p><p>So, "Authenticity" relates to events where cryptographic unicity is the only available tool in the digital landscape.

<p>With deterministic data capture and authentic data entry processes, cryptographically accurate data is possible. However, another data security property we need to consider is “Veracity”, the data's truthfulness, which is epistemic, and, therefore, down to human accountability. So, just because a data capture construct may facilitate semantically accurate data, a free-form text field at the capture point would allow the user to enter erroneous data. Unfortunately, technology is not a cure for human fallibility.</p><p>Let's provide the following hypothetical scenario. Suppose I were to enter "Rpbwrt" instead of "Robert" as my first name. The inputted data might have objectual integrity (i.e., the structural, definitional, and contextual characteristics of the data capture are deterministic), it would have factual authenticity (i.e., you could verify that I entered it), and yet I've still managed to enter a typographical error into the system, where the veracity of the data is compromised.</p><p>The quest for "accurate data" is indeed challenging.&nbsp;We will address the veracity of inputted data in part 2 of the series.</p> The Dynamic Data Economy and Decentralised Semantics <p>Although treated as separate security properties, "Integrity" and “Authenticity" are interdependent. As with any successful union, they are interconnected and counterbalancing. For example, the accuracy of data lineage refers to the authenticity of the data origin, what happens to it, and where it moves over time. The accuracy of data contextualisation refers to the integrity of the message content so that all interacting actors can understand its meaning in context.</p><p>At the Human Colossus Foundation, we created and are fostering the development of the Dynamic Data Economy (DDE), the critical infrastructure for a data-agile economy, to empower people and organisations through better-informed decisions. The <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f288b25f9c364d7945e6eb/1660061875006/HCF+DDE+Principles+v1.0.0.pdf">DDE Principles</a> define these fundamental security principles (“Objectual Integrity” and “Factual Authenticity”), demonstrating their interdependence. The DDE <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f2893465394d4b829661bc/1660062007339/HCF+DDE+Trust+Infrastructure+Stack+v1.0.0.pdf">Trust Infrastructure Stack</a> recognises the differentiation between them, offering objectual integrity to the Semantic infrastructure (Layer 1) and factual authenticity to the Inputs infrastructure (Layer 2). In combination, the two properties provide the necessary cryptographic assurance to data capture and entry processes within any secure digital system, providing the basis to tackle consensual veracity, the primary security principle of the Governance infrastructure at Layer 3.</p><p>Guiding the tooling development for the DDE Semantic Layer is Decentralised Semantics [5], an exciting new data domain spearheaded by the Foundation. Decentralised Semantics refactors the definition of integrity by putting the meaning of data at the core of objectual integrity. This domain provides enhanced data modelling for an evolving data-agile economy comprising distributed data ecosystems where harmonisation between competing standards is essential for data object comprehension in any bilateral exchange. As a result, it enables the structuring of unstructured data with morphologic, semantic, and pragmatic accuracy.</p><p>If you are interested in reading more about data accuracy, <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/home/#newsletter">sign up for our newsletter</a> and stay tuned for part 2 of the series.</p> References <p>When writing this post, we were conscious of the need for accuracy regarding the terms used in this article.

<p>Gitcoin Grants Round 15 (GR15) wrapped up at the end of September, resulting in the distribution of almost $4.4M to 1,495 grants for public goods. In order to ensure that each vote was linked to a human, Gitcoin created <a href="https://passport.gitcoin.co/">Passport</a>—a reputation system built on Ceramic. Gitcoin introduced Passport during GR14 in June; by the close of GR15, in September, the number of passports rose to 33,515.</p><p>This article covers Gitcoin’s recent quadratic funding rounds (GR14 &amp; GR15), the challenges of sybil resistance and how Gitcoin built with Ceramic—the data layer powering Gitcoin Passport. It also explains how any application can leverage Gitcoin Passport on Ceramic—adding robust anti-Sybil protection and a proof-of-personhood reputation system.</p> What is Gitcoin Grants and Passport?  <p>Gitcoin Grants is the largest Quadratic Funding (QF) application in Web3, having contributed over <a href="https://gitcoin.co/results">$72.5M</a> in funding for a variety of hackathons, bounties, and open source projects since its inception in 2017. The Gitcoin Passport and the Trust Bonus are grants mechanisms that provide identity verification, improve Sybil resistance, increase the cost of forgery, and increase the weight given to grants donations from verified funders.</p><p>Passport is an identity verification utility that uses Ceramic to store personal credentials—making them self-sovereign to the user and allowing them to be portable across ecosystems and applications. By connecting their internet identities to Gitcoin Passport (Facebook, Twitter, ENS, etc), donors were able to receive up to 150% matching bonuses during GR15. The team launched Gitcoin Passport for GR14 and added 11 more verification methods or “stamps” to this <a href="https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/gr15-results">most recent grants round</a>.</p> Sybil Resistance Improves Public Goods Funding <p>Quadratic Funding is the<a href="https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&amp;grant=&amp;grant=&amp;grant=&amp;match=1000"> mathematically optimal way</a> to fund public goods in a democratic community. At the core of QF is its matching pool of funds provided by partners, companies, or protocols supporting public goods projects. The matching pool of funds is used to amplify the individual contributions to different projects. In short, projects undergo a crowdfunding campaign that is matched with funds according to the QF algorithm, where the number of contributors is weighed more than the amount funded.</p><p><a href="https://finematics.com/quadratic-funding-explained/">For example</a>, imagine Project A receives a total of $1,000 in funding from five contributors ($200 each) and Project B receives a total of $1,000 from 20 contributors ($50 each). Assuming a matching pool of $10,000, according to the QF algorithm, Project B would receive over $7,000 of the matching funds while Project A receives about $2,000.</p><p>Essentially, QF incentivizes individuals to contribute small amounts and pushes decision-making powers away from whales who donated a much larger amount. This ultimately creates more democracy in public goods funding.</p><p>While QF is the most optimal way to democratically allocate funds to projects that a community cares about, it is<a href="https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-policy/policy/understanding-potential-attack-vectors/sybil-attack"> susceptible to Sybil attacks</a>. Sybil attacks happen when an attacker pretends to be multiple people at the same time, manipulating a distributed peer-to-peer network and its incentives to their benefit. In Gitcoin Grants, the Sybil attack could mean that a user spreads their funds across multiple wallets and donates to the same project. Since QF weighs the number of donations over the total amount donated, attackers can game the system to receive a larger slice of the QF matching pool.</p><p>To build in Sybil resistance, the Gitcoin team asks users to verify their “proof of personhood” by proving ownership over various accounts and data. Gitcoin Grants integrates with a variety of identity providers (Proof of Humanity or BrightID), Web2 services (Google, Twitter, or Facebook), and Web3 accounts (ENS). The more providers that users link, the higher their ‘<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/a-higher-personhood-score-means-more-contribution-matching/">Personhood Score</a>’ and the more eligible they are for a ‘Trust Bonus’. Contributors begin with only 50% of their eligible matching funds actually being matched. As they verify more providers, they are eligible for up to 150% of their eligible matching funds being matched.</p><p>While the Trust Bonus helps to minimize the impact of Sybil attacks, it isn’t the end solution. Gitcoin has long subsidized these payouts (called a Fraud Tax) to ensure that no grant has received less than it was supposed to due to any detected Sybil attacker. Since<a href="https://gitcoin.co/blog/a-community-based-roadmap-for-sybil-detection-across-web-3/"> Grants Round 7,</a> identity verification has evolved to take several variables into consideration, including training a Machine Learning model to detect adversarial behavior. By introducing these mechanisms, between Grants Rounds 9 to 11, the Fraud Tax paid out by the Gitcoin team has<a href="https://medium.com/block-science/gitcoin-grants-round-11-anti-fraud-evaluation-results-50f4b0f15125"> decreased from 6.6% of the pool to about 0.6%</a>.</p> Why Gitcoin Built Passport on Ceramic <p>In addition to reinforcing the algorithms behind the Trust Bonus, the Gitcoin team long explored the concepts behind Passport as it is today. Primarily, Passport has been designed to adhere to two principles: the data generated must be sovereign to the user, and the app must be built on open standards to be composable, programmable, and portable. Aligning to this vision, Gitcoin built an alpha version of the Passport to issue NFTs attesting to the user’s identity claims that are sovereign to the user and built on the ERC-721 open standard.</p><p>The Gitcoin team believes in the World Wide Web Collective (W3C) standards, specifically that <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/"> Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) and<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/"> Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) are the best place for personhood information to live; this is what initially drew them to Ceramic. DIDs are globally unique identifiers, mapping a blockchain-specific address to a chain-agnostic identifier that can be used to collect and attest to verifiable claims and credentials.</p><p>It’s particularly attractive that these standards are not blockchain specific, and in-fact, exist across Web2 and Web3 technologies, promoting high levels of interoperability between technology stacks. In addition to being chain-agnostic, VCs are cryptographically signed when they are issued, leading to useful tamper-resistance properties. Finally, DIDs and VCs are abstractions on top of user information and can be leveraged to secure Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</p><p>Ultimately, Ceramic aligns with Gitcoin’s driving principles for Passport: Self-sovereign data stored on a chain-agnostic protocol supported by open standards.</p> How Gitcoin Built With Ceramic <p><a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a> is a decentralized data network that brings composable data to Web3 applications. Applications use Ceramic’s shared infrastructure and open API to store, modify, and retrieve data that can be reused or repurposed within other applications—across any blockchain, wallet or account. Therefore, any JSON data can be stored in streams, each controlled by an authenticated DID.</p><p>Gitcoin Passport leverages Ceramic to link a user’s Ethereum address to a DID, enabling users to create and control data streams on the Ceramic network. If a user already has a DID linked to their Ethereum address, the application will not prompt them to create a new one. Users will specifically generate a DID method called did:pkh, which generates a DID from the Ethereum address’s Public Key Hash. Ceramic recently adopted this DID method to align with the<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-1/"> Sign-In With Ethereum</a> (SIWE) specification—leading to a clean, standardized authentication flow with minimal user interaction and greater clarity around what data is being requested and transferred.</p><p>From the Passport application, as users verify their online identities with various trusted third-parties (BrightID, Google, Facebook, ENS etc), Gitcoin signs and issues “stamps” to the user’s Passport. Since Gitcoin is acting as a signatory in this relationship, these stamps verify and publicly attest the user’s identity claims. Each identity that a user attests is assigned a weight and is used to calculate a weighted Personhood Score that secures the Quadratic Funding mechanism.</p><p>Behind the scenes, both the Passport and stamps are stored as a<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/advanced/standards/data-models/"> Ceramic Data Model</a>, which specifies a schema on what the data stored in those streams look like. The stamps are issued as Verifiable Credentials that include information about the identity that has been verified (Google, ENS etc.), to whom they are issued (user’s DID), and the signatory (Gitcoin). Once a VC is issued, it’s then stored on Ceramic streams and controlled by a Gitcoin DID. A reference to the VC is stored on the streams controlled by the user’s DID. The user’s Passport streams are simply a collection of references to the stamps assigned to them.</p><p>The Gitcoin team runs Passport as an app that assigns pre-determined weights to each account a user verifies. In the future, the Passport app will be progressively decentralized as a public utility so that any application can assign custom weights to the issued credentials and calculate its own Personhood Score. For example, a decentralized exchange may weigh a KYC (Know Your Customer) credential higher than a social media verification. On the other hand, an online community for developers may prefer to heavily weigh a Github verification stamp. Since the Passports and credentials are stored on Ceramic, it makes it simple for any application to leverage this data.</p> The Results <p>Gitcoin Grants Round 14, from June 8-23, was<a href="https://gitcoin.co/blog/gr14-results/"> record breaking on all fronts</a>: 44k+ community members contributed $1.7M to over 1250 grants, with a total of $3.2M ultimately matched. In this round, a total of $4.9M was distributed as part of the Quadratic Funding mechanism.</p><p>It was during Grants Round 14 that Gitcoin launched Passport, encouraging users to verify their personhood so that their matching contributions could be increased. Gitcoin users created over<a href="https://cerscan.com/mainnet/family/kjzl6cwe1jw148h1e14jb5fkf55xmqhmyorp29r9cq356c7ou74ulowf8czjlzs"> 22,000 individual Passports</a> during the two-week grants round.</p><p>During that time, Ceramic and Gitcoin co-hosted the Passport Hackathon, encouraging collaboration among identity owners, issuers, and field experts to find solutions to pressing identity verification issues using Gitcoin Passport. This hackathon brought together 270 participants from around the world and 50 submissions to build interfaces, integrations, and educational materials for Passport.</p><p>During Grants Round 15, from September 7-22, almost $4.5M was distributed to public goods as part of the round, of which $3.1M came from the combined matching pools and $1.3M was contributed by the community.</p><p>This round also saw strong community participation. The number of passports that had one or more stamps by the end of GR15 was 33,515 passports (up from 22,000 passports created during GR14).</p><p>This means that 33,515 users are now able to travel across the Web3 metaverse with their Gitcoin Passport and prove to other applications that they are in-fact a human being. This information can be treated as a public utility—moving DAOs to adopt a one-human-one-vote policy and unlock use cases like quadratic funding, quadratic voting, sybil-resistant airdrops, and improved spam resistance for any decentralized application.</p> Are you building a reputation system? <p>Ceramic is a solution that seamlessly integrates DIDs and VCs along with robust database-like features for users and applications to issue, store, and share their credentials. Accruing credentials in a multi-chain metaverse and associating them with a chain-agnostic DID allows users to portray an accurate picture of their digital reputation and carry that with them into any application they use.</p><p>Here are a few <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/highlighted-projects/#reputation">projects using Ceramic</a> to build robust identity and reputation systems.</p><p>Gitcoin Passport on Ceramic can be leveraged by and integrated into any application, adding robust anti-Sybil protection. If you’re working on a project on identity, credentials, and reputation, Ceramic might be a great fit in your tech stack—join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/6VRZpGP">Discord</a> and we’d love to chat!</p>

If users no longer have access to the wallet or if they lose or replace the device, the backup enables the contents of the Lissi Wallet to be restored. Currently, the function is limited to the beta version available on <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">testflight</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1">Android</a>.</p><p>The backup consists of an encrypted file containing the wallet data and a backup key. The key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. Users need both parts (file + key) to restore the backup. The key is randomly created by the wallet and consists of 12&nbsp;words.</p> Restore the Lissi Wallet with the&nbsp;backup Process illustration of the steps for creating the&nbsp;backup Create backup of the Lissi Wallet in six&nbsp;steps:   Select “Create backup” in the&nbsp;settings  Read the explanatory text  Write down the backup&nbsp;key  Confirm the backup&nbsp;key  Export the encrypted backup file to a place where you can easily find it again and where it will not get lost, e.g. in your personal&nbsp;cloud  Check the status of the backup with the timestamp   Restore the&nbsp;backup Process illustration of the steps to restore the&nbsp;wallet Restore the Lissi Wallet backup in five&nbsp;steps:   Select “Restore Wallet” for a new installation or within the settings of an existing&nbsp;wallet.  Select the backup file (.ZIP) that you saved yourself when you created the&nbsp;backup.  Enter your backup key, which consists of 12 English&nbsp;words.  Check the date of the backup you want to&nbsp;restore.  Confirm the restore&nbsp;process   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): <p>Can the Lissi Wallet be restored without first exporting the backup?<br>No, if users have not created a backup themselves before it’s not possible to restore the old&nbsp;data.</p><p>Does the backup include all credentials including self-scanned customer cards and PK.Pass files?<br>Yes, the backup includes all data that can be stored in the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Can a backup of the Lissi Wallet be restored in another wallet?<br>No, it is currently not possible to restore a backup of the Lissi Wallet within a wallet of other providers. However, we are already in contact with other wallet providers and the community to enable smooth data portability.</p><p>What are the next steps?<br>For now, we focus on a coherent and well functioning backup process. Next, we want to enable data portability to and from other wallets. Further expansion steps include the use of hardware tokens (such as the German identity card) for additional security, as well as the possibility to store the encrypted files using a cloud backup. We will also evaluate other methods (such as social key recovery) and discuss them with the community.</p> About Lissi: <p>Lissi provides convenient applications for companies and organisations to receive, organise and share trusted data from end users while respecting privacy and data sovereignty.

Wir sind jedoch bereits mit anderen Wallet Anbietern und der Community im Austausch, um eine reibungslose Datenportabilität zu ermöglichen.</p><p>Was sind die nächsten Schritte?<br>Wir werden vorerst gewährleisten, dass der Backup-Prozess gut funktioniert und verständlich ist. Anschließend möchten wir die Datenportabilität von und zu anderen Wallets ermöglichen. Weitere Ausbauschritte sind die Verwendung von Hardware Tokens (wie z.B. dem deutschen Personalausweis) zur zusätzlichen Absicherung, sowie die Möglichkeit, die verschlüsselten Dateien mittels eines Cloud-Backups zu speichern.

<p>Zug, Switzerland — 8 November 2022 — Today, Energy Web announced that Japan’s Electricity Power Exchange (JEPX) has joined as Energy Web’s newest member. JEPX has been tasked by the Japanese government to operate a new Non-Fossil Fuel Certificate (NFFC) market, and it is keen to explore the potential of utilizing blockchain technologies to support the market’s operation.</p><blockquote>“JEPX plans to track all non-fossil certificates in one to two years, and by using blockchain technology, all non-fossil certificates traded on the non-fossil value trading market will be attached with granular attributes such as generation type and location. This will simplify the process of obtaining attribute information on non-fossil certificates and encourage information disclosure as companies become more environmentally conscious’’ said Ryoichi Kunimatsu, General Manager at&nbsp;JEPX.</blockquote><blockquote>“We are thrilled to welcome Japan’s Electric Power Exchange into the Energy Web ecosystem. Recently, we have been in discussion with many market participants from across the Asia Pacific region; JEPX will be the first of many new Energy Web partners and solutions from this part of the world. In this case, Energy Web technology is a great fit for JEPX’s business requirements and their vision for the future of the Japanese renewable energy market.” added Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy&nbsp;Web.</blockquote><p>About JEPX<br>The Japan Electric Power Exchange facilitates spot and forward transactions of electrical power among electric utilities in Japan. Formed as an intermediary corporation in November 2003 to create an electric power wholesale market, in 2004 it invited members for its central committee and commenced transacting in wholesale power transactions from April 1, 2005. In November 2008, JEPX also established a Green-power exchange.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>This blog post is written to explain decentralized self sovereign data, snippets of it shared at the <a href="https://www.ifc.org">IFC</a> hosted session on “distributed data ecosystems: heterodox approaches to data portability” at the Singapore FinTech Festival on the 4 Nov&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Let me start with a basic understanding of the economic property of data. It is a “non rivalrous” good. That means one party using it doesn’t deny another party from using it as well. So every institution with data of data subjects (the “producers” of data) can potentially have their data be used by both themselves and the data subject concurrently, if they&nbsp;wish.</p><p>Let’s assume, if you will, that a technology in the form of a <a href="https://www.hubofallthings.com">cloud data server</a>, at a few cents a month, can now be provisioned for a person or a micro SME to be a decentralized legal entity on the Internet, hold any content or data they have rights to with their own set of APIs. This was what was created from more than $10m research funding across 8 universities in the&nbsp;U.K.</p><p>What it means is that data that currently sit in any producer’s server can now sit with data subjects or microSMEs on their own servers. Same data, same entitlements to use the&nbsp;data.</p><p>I will repeat for emphasis. It is now technically and legally possible for 2 identical copies of the same data, one centralized and one decentralized, sitting on 2 different servers with 2 sets of APIs for that data, with the same entitlements and licensing rights to share and transfer the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Which would create better functioning markets? For us, the answer is&nbsp;both.</p><p>The producer’s centralized server has data that is heavily regulated, terribly siloed, badly portable and facing one of the largest market failures in the digital economy can now have the same data in a decentralized form in their own customer servers, now legally transformed into self sovereign data to be used and shared across territories and yet be fully verified by the producer’s server.</p><p>Now you’re probably wondering which organization would allow that. The answer may surprise&nbsp;you.</p><p>The same institutions that may not be so willing to share data through open APIs with third parties are now more willing to decentralize data to data subjects because they obtain better engagement and create loyalty. In addition, they are paid for every transaction of the data, thereby creating a market for the data that they can verify (we call this a data asset) and have painfully invested into over&nbsp;years.</p><p>Since data cannot create a market unless individuals have the right to contract on it, IP rights are necessary. But these IP rights have a great market effect in terms of the distribution speed and scalability of a data asset. It takes only 3 minutes for a new demand side merchant/partner to sign up to a data terminal to receive verified data. No legal or tech integration is necessary with the producer. Across borders. Because the contract is with the individual. So the producer provide the source of truth, individuals transport it, the merchant pays. With the speed and scalability that self sovereign data brings, the revenue multiplier for the producer is significant. This creates an incentive for producers to create and scale their own data ecosystem which I’ve blogged about in an <a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things/designing-markets-and-scaling-data-ecosystems-1d799e870250">earlier&nbsp;post</a>.</p><p>In a web3 environment, decentralized self sovereign data can move meaningfully between services, carried by data subjects themselves to any service provider. Indeed, the data servers themselves can be hosted by country level custodians. The data is always up to date because there is incentive compatibility and there can be efficient bargaining on the price of the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Much like money devolved to bank accounts created markets with payment systems, we expect self sovereign data to create large markets, achieving data at the speed of money as any consumer app can have a data wallet to decentralize data and build their ecosystems across&nbsp;borders.</p><p>This infrastructure is currently scaling up in Malaysia and entering US and Germany in the first quarter of 2023. The stewardship and governance of data flow contracts is under the oversight of a <a href="https://www.hatcommunity.org">foundation</a> set up by the original universities and we welcome public and private sector involvement.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things/decentralized-self-sovereign-data-c8dd796d8c12">What is Decentralized Self Sovereign Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things">Hub of All Things</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>After publishing our report exploring the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-report-at-the-confluence-of-digital-rights-climate-justice/" title="">intersections of digital rights, tech and climate justice</a>, we wanted to make space to collectively imagine what it would look like to turn our research findings into action. So on October 18, we <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/join-our-community-call-digital-rights-climate-justice/" title="">hosted a community call</a> to plot a course for future work in this area. We were joined by activists, researchers and practitioners who are working on issues such as tech policy, environmental sciences, open data, digital rights, health, indigenous data and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the call we focused on two main themes: 1) environmental data &amp; AI for climate and 2) tech sustainability and decarbonization. While it is hard to capture how much collective energy was in the room, we’re sharing some of the main takeaways from the call below.</p>



 Environmental data &amp; AI for climate 



<p>Participants had a lot of ideas for how the digital rights community could support environmental and climate justice activists. One suggestion was supporting indigenous data sovereignty efforts by helping communities apply this lens to the popular FAIR and open data approaches, and avoiding “imposing AI discourse” and data projects that continue extractive methods. These suggestions overlap with the ways environmental justice and climate justice (EJ-CJ) are connected to other types of justice, such as anti-racism. The group recommended that digital rights advocates support data efforts that focus on environmental racism and identify areas where AI and other data initiatives can harm communities even as they further EJ-CJ priorities.</p>



<p>To bring environmental and climate justice activists into digital rights work in an effective way, digital rights communities should use their skills, knowledge and networks to help strengthen environmental justice and climate justice work. Participants said this could be done by providing advice on secure collaboration and communication, facilitating training on digital security and digital rights and showcasing work that could benefit from exposure. Additionally, EJ-CJ and digital rights communities could do skill/knowledge sharing around such topics as digital rights, environmental racism &amp; AI, tech labour issues, how companies collect and use user data, strategic litigation methods, environmental risk assessment, community engagement and trust-building processes.</p>



<p>Another priority was collaboration and adaptation. Participants recommended “identifying issues and models that demonstrate how data sharing collaboration is possible”, sharing “facilitation methods to identify real and perceived data collaboration risks”, and “bringing data back to the community as a model for sharing”. Others suggested sharing designs and source code “to enable tool use and adaptation”, adapting and designing apps for more intuitive and comprehensive monitoring and mapping work or interoperability, and connecting efforts for broader impact (e.g., linking data governance to spatial efforts can support food sovereignty).</p>



<p>Finally, participants identified four top priorities for how digital rights communities can engage on environmental data &amp; AI for climate:</p>



 
 Understand how vulnerable communities are affected by critical AI questions. 



 Ask probing questions like, “What is meant by green AI? Sustainable for whom?” 



 Address the need for more secure monitoring tools and build “better bridges” between them. 



 Facilitate community convenings that emphasise “diverse spaces and backgrounds”.&nbsp; 
 



 Tech sustainability &amp; decarbonization 



<p>These groups quickly zeroed in on the need for the digital rights community to expand their push for transparency around algorithms, platform governance and other technical issues of companies to include transparency around environmental data. Specifically, participants mentioned transparency around the “environmental impact of data-driven processes”, including data centres, and social and environmental issues around the mineral extraction that digital technology currently requires, especially so-called “green minerals” and supply chains.</p>



<p>Relatedly, participants would like to see digital rights activists demand accountability from social media companies regarding disinformation and misinformation. This might include advertising transparency around fossil fuel and energy companies, limitations and better moderation on greenwashing, misleading environmental claims and climate conspiracies across platforms, including in paid ads/content and increased efforts to promote digital literacy.</p>



<p>Two rights were top of mind: privacy and right to repair. One participant said they want to see digital rights communities “consistently use and promote privacy-by-design tools to prevent data collection by big players”. Right to repair was a popular topic of conversation, as participants wanted to see it enforced for product developers along with fixable software that can be supported in older devices and an end to planned obsolescence, which forces people to constantly buy new devices, increasing extractive mining and its harms to local communities. Said a participant, “Back in the day, people around the corner could fix my Nokia, but now tech companies make it hard”. We’re left with an over-reliance on tech companies.</p>



<p>Participants also identified three areas of cross-sector and cross-movement collaboration:</p>



 
 Connecting digital rights and labour organising by “supporting organised labour [especially in all areas of tech], teaching about cooperatives, building scalable tech frameworks for these movements” and supporting digital literacy across movements. 



 Adapting divestment strategies from the climate justice movement. 



 “Anticipating that the transition will be destructive [and] ‘our’ job as privileged people is to cushion the less privileged”. 
 



<p>Ultimately, people emphasised the urgent need for advocacy around climate reparations, tying many of the above issues together. They pointed out that not only are the people most affected by climate change the least responsible for it, but they also tend to be left out of the solutions, which mirrors other areas of the tech sector. Those most harmed by digital rights restrictions are often left out of strategising and decision-making. A commitment to EJ-CJ and digital rights means imagining and advocating for climate reparations on all fronts.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, November 3, 2022  – Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Edge’s Assistant Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, will lead a session at the Internet2 Technology Exchange (TechEX) “Leveraging the Cloud for Research” December 5-9, 2022. This annual conference brings together thought leaders in technology and innovation, including researchers, analysts, engineers, technologists, and students. Together, attendees will explore the&nbsp; issues facing researchers and which tools and services could be implemented to better support the global research community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TechEX Conference explores the most critical challenges and exciting opportunities in research and education, with expert-led sessions, tutorials and working meetings in advanced networking, cloud technology, research engagement, identity and access management, and information security. Featured under the research engagement track, Dr. Ghahramani’s presentation session will share findings from the the Ecosystem for Research Networking&nbsp; (ERN) Broadening the Reach (BTR) working group’s workshops and surveys conducted within the community, including the challenges and opportunities as institutions are leveraging the cloud to advance their research and education initiatives.</p>
<p>Many smaller, mid-sized and under-resourced campuses, including minority-serving institutions (MSI), Hispanic-serving institution (HSI), Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities (HBCU), and Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) institutions, have compelling science research and education activities along with an awareness of the benefits associated with better access to cyberinfrastructure (CI) resources. “These schools can benefit greatly from resources and expertise for cloud adoption to augment their in-house efforts,” says Dr. Ghahramani. “By directly focusing on the under-resourced academic institutions in the region, the ERN BTR working group is learning how to better support these organizations by enhancing advanced computing capabilities and research collaboration.”</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope is a specification for the achitecture of a “smart document”. It supports the secure, reliable, and deterministic storage and transmission of data such as seeds, keys, decentralized identifiers, and verifiable credentials  in a way that enables privacy while preserving structure. Gordian Envelope’s privacy features are built on a hashed Merkle Tree that provides implicit support for cryptography of your choice and explicit support for privacy-related methodologies such as progressive trust and Merkle-based selective disclosure.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons is currently working with multiple companies on the development and deployment of Gordian Envelopes via regular biweekly meetings; <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">contact us</a> if you’d like to be involved. We are also presenting Envelopes as a prospective Informational Draft for the IETF and engaging in discussions with the W3C Credentials Community Group.</p>

 The Envelope as Metaphor 

<p>The name “envelope” was chosen for this smart-document architecture because that provides an excellent metaphor for its capabilities.</p>

<p></p>

<p>These capabilities include:</p>

 
   Envelopes can have things written on them. Plaintext parts of a Gordian Envelope can be read by anyone. 
   Envelopes can have routing instructions. That plaintext information can include data on how to use the Gordian Envelope, such as how to open or close it. 
   Envelopes can contain things. Things can be placed within the structure of a Gordian Envelope. 
   Envelopes can contain envelopes. The Gordian Envelope structure is fully recursive: any part of an envelope can actually be another envelope. 
   Envelopes can have a seal. A signature can be made for the contents of a Gordian Envelope, verifying their authenticity and that they haven’t been changed. 
   Envelopes can be certified. Beyond just guarding against changes, a Gordian Envelope signature can also act as a certification of the envelope’s contents by some authority. 
   Envelopes can be closed. Encryption allows any part of a Gordian Envelope to be protected from prying eyes. 
   Envelopes can have windows. Selective disclosure allows for some parts of a Gordian Envelope to be readable while others have been redacted. Merkle proofs can proof that those parts were present in the original envelope. 
   Different recipients can open envelopes in different ways. Just as people might use letter openers, their fingers, or a machine to open a normal envelope, special permits can grant people different ways to open a Gordian Envelope. 
 

 Why Envelopes Are Important 

<p>The Gordian Envelope is intended as a more privacy-focused encoding architecture than existing data formats such as JWT and JSON-LD. We believe it has a better security architecture than JWT and that it doesn’t fall victim to the barriers of canonicalization complexity found in JSON-LD —&nbsp;which should together permit better security reviews of the Gordian Envelope design.</p>

<p>However, new features of Gordian Envelope not available in JWT or JSON-LD offer some of the best arguments for using the Smart Document structure.</p>

<p></p>

 Fundamental Design 

<p>Gordian Envelope was designed with two key goals in mind: to be Structure-Ready, allowing for the reliable and interopable storage of information; and to be Privacy-Ready, ensuring that transmission of that data can occur in a privacy-protecting manner.</p>

 
   Structure-Ready. Gordian Envelope is designed as a Smart Document, meant to store information about a subject. More than that, it’s a meta-document that can contain or refer to other documents. It can support multiple data formats, from simple hierarchical structures to labeled property graphs, semantic triples, and other forms of structured graphs. Though its fundamental structure is a tree, it can even be used to create DAGs through references between Envelopes. 
   Privacy-Ready. Gordian Envelope protects the privacy of its data through progressive trust, allowing for holders to minimally disclose information by using elision or encryption, and then to optionally increase that disclosure over time. The fact that a holder can control data revelation, not just an issuer, creates a new level of privacy for all stakeholders. The progressive trust in Gordian Envelopes is accomplished through hashing of all elements, which creates foundational support for cryptographic functions such as signing and encryption, without actually defining which cryptographic functions must be used. 
 

<p>The following structural decisions support these goals:</p>

 
   Structured Merkle Tree. A variant of the Merkle Tree structure is created by forming the hashing of  the elements in the Envelope into a tree of digests. (In this “structured Merkele Tree”, all nodes contain both semantic content and digests, rather than semantic content being limited to leaves.) 
   Deterministic Representation. There is only one way to encode any semantic representation within a Gordian Envelope. This is accomplished through the use of <a>Deterministic CBOR</a> and the sorting of the Envelope by hashes to create a lexicographic order. Any Envelope that doesn’t follow these strict rules can be rejected; as a result, there’s no need to worry about different people adding the assertions in a different order or at different times: if two Envelopes contain the same data, they will be encoded the same way. 
 

 Elision Support 

 
   Elision of All Elements. Gordian Envelopes innately support elision for any part of its data, including subjects, predicates, and objects. 
   Redaction, Compression, and Encryption. Elision can be used for a variety of purposes including redaction (removing information), compression (removing duplicate information), and encryption (enciphering information). 
   Holder-initiated Redaction. Elision can be performed by the Holder of a Gordian Envelope, not just the Issuer. 
   Granular Holder Control. Elision can not only be performed by any Holder, but also for any data, allowing each entity to elide data as is appropriate for the management of their personal (or business) risk. 
   Progressive Trust. The elision mechanics in Gordian Envelopes allow for progressive trust, where increasing amounts of data are revealed over time. It can even be combined with encryption to escrow data to later be revealed. 
   Consistent Hashing. Even when elided or encrypted, hashes for those parts of the Gordian Envelope remain the same. 
 

 Privacy Support 

 
   Proof of Inclusion. As an alternative to presenting redactive structures, proofs of inclusion can be included in top-level hashes. 
   Herd Privacy. Proofs of inclusion allow for herd privacy where all members of a class can share data such as a VC or DID without revealing individual information. 
   Non-Correlation. Encrypted Gordian Envelope data can optionally be made less correlatable with the addition of salt. 
 

 Authentication Support 

 
   Symmetric Key Permits. Gordian Envelopes can be locked (“closed”) using a symmetric key. 
   SSKR Permits. Gordian Envelopes can alternatively be locked (“closed”) using a symmetric key sharded with Shamir’s Secret Sharing, with the shares stored with copies of the Envelope, and the whole enveloped thus openable if  copies of the Envelope with a quorum of different shares are gathered. 
   Public Key Permits. Gordian Envelopes can alternatively be locked (“closed”) with a public key and then be opened with the associated private key, or vice versa. 
   Multiple Permits. Gordian Envelopes can simultaneously be locked (“closed”) via a variety of means and then openable by any appropriate individual method, with different methods likely held by different people. 
 

 Future Looking 

 
   Data Storage. The initial inspiration for Gordian Envelopes was for secure data storage. 
   Credentials &amp; Presentations The usage of Gordian Envelope signing techniques allows for the creation of credentials and the ability to present them to different verifiers in different ways. 
   Distributed or Decentralized Identifiers. Self-Certifying Identifiers (SCIDs) can be created and shared with peers, certified with a trust authority, or registered on blockchain. 
   Future Techniques. Beyonds its technical specifics, Gordian Envelopes still allows for cl-sigs, bbs+, and other privacy-preserving techniques such as zk-proofs, differential privacy, etc. 
   Cryptography Agnostic. Generally, the Gordian Envelope architecture is cryptography agnostic, allowing it to work with everything from older algorithms with silicon support through more modern algorithms suited to blockchains and to future zk-proof or quantum-attack resistent cryptographic choices. These choices are made in sets via ciphersuites. 
 

 Usage of Envelopes 

<p>Gordian Envelopes are a foundational architecture that we expect to support many advanced projects involving self-sovereign control of digital assets.</p>

<p>Currently, it’s being used in two major Blockchain Commons projects.</p>

 
   Crypto-request/response. Requests and responses are specified ways to ask for and send information needed for self-sovereign operations, including when transmitting across an Airgap. Our second generation of requests and responses encodes those communications in Gordian Envelopes. 
   Collaborative Seed Recovery. The <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/CSR.md">CSR system</a> requires the use of Smart Documents to store shares of seeds that have been sharded for backup and recovery. The Gordian Envelope is thus the heart of that system. 
 

<p>There are a broad swath of additional use cases, some of which can be found in our [Use Case Overview of Envelopes] (PENDING). These include:</p>

 
   User-centric Educational Certification: All sorts of credentials can be created in Gordian Envelopes, but certifications and other educational credentials are likely to be some of the most popular. These can be credentials signed by accredited institutions or by Web of Trust peers. Elision and third-party manipulation can allow these credentials to be safely passed around for a variety of purposes. Herd privacy features can create even greater anonymity.
     
       Example Transactions: institutions can issue centralized credentials; individuals can issue peer-to-peer credentials using metadata to assist validation; subjects can elide credentials to preserve privacy or prevent discrimination; third-party holders can further elide credentials based on their own risk models; all parties can repackage credentials with signatures or additional information; issuers can create large batches of credentials and issue individual proofs to credential holders, allowing them to either reveal their credentials or maintain herd privacy. (See <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Envelope-Use-Cases-Educational.md">Educational Use Case</a>) 
     
   
   Resilient Asset Control: There are many different use cases for helping users to resiliently control their digital assets, going beyond the specific design of CSR. These include the inclusion of metadata for resilience, the usage of salts to block correlation, and the creation of variable-use permits to allow multiple ways to open an envelope.
     
       Example Transactions: users can store private keys, seeds, or other vulnerable data using encryption; users can improve the resilience of data with unencrypted metadata; users can alternatively wrap envelopes to encrypt their data entirety; users can use Shamir’s Secret Sharing or other sharding technologies to resiliently lock data so that it can be restored by bringing together multiple envelopes, each of which contains a share and the encrypted data; users can create multi-permits that further improve resilience by allowing their data to be recovered in multiple ways, such as either with sharded shares or a private key. (See <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Envelope-Use-Cases-Assets.md">Assets Use Case</a>) 
     
   
   Structured Software Release: The standardization of Gordian Envelopes is another of their strengths. Case studies involving source-control signing demonstrate how a field that is currently managed in a variety of different ways could allow for real improvements in security.
     
       Example Transactions: structured data can standardize software releases and ensure that all validation data is in one place; multiple signatures can allow verification by multiple sources; releases can be chained, so that once a user trusts one software release, they know to trust all future software releases; changes in release signers can be introduced through chained releases in an automated way that maintains trust.  (See Use Case PENDING) 
     
   
   Privacy-Focused Data Transfer: The privacy-ready design of Gordian Envelopes allows for use cases where elision is used differently over time, including progressive trust and situations whree data is differently elided for different circumstances.
     
       Example Transactions: structured data can be publicly released; data can be authenticated through signatures and validation; data can be differently elided for different sorts of queries; data can be released through a model of progressive trust by slowly reducing elision; data can be entirely elided so that it’s only visible to queries that know to ask for the data; data can be entirely elided so that it’s only visible to queries if someone provides a hash and a proof that allows them to verify the data. (See Use Case PENDING)

<p>The world is going digital, offering unmatched flexibility and potential for global interoperability. Mobile credentials allow users to authenticate with their smartphone and use it as their key to accessing everything from a bar where an individual must prove their age to a government web-based service where an individual must verify their identity. Balancing the wealth of opportunities, however, are the risks of having these new levels of convenience undermine any expectation of privacy. The&nbsp;<a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/l/cp/0BXjjcnX">Privacy-Enhanced Mobile Credentials Working Group</a>&nbsp;within&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>&nbsp;is working to help address this challenge, focusing on mobile credentials such as mobile drivers’ licenses (mDL).&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the PEMC WG charter, the PEMC WG exists “to create a set of requirements and conformance criteria to protect the privacy of individuals holding or using mobile credentials such as mobile Driving Licenses.” This work is being done against the backdrop of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:18013:-5:ed-1:v1:en">ISO/IEC 18013-5</a>-compliant mobile driving license ecosystem. While the ISO standard establishes details regarding the credential itself, more work is needed to provide assurances to the holders of mobile credentials that relying parties collecting their identity attributes will only use those attributes for fulfilling the purposes for which the mobile credential was presented. Failing to respect the consent of the mobile credential holder or the legal authority of the verifier to collect the identity attributes could violate the privacy of the mobile credential holder.</p>



 Expected Work Items 



<p>The PEMC WG is working through a phased approach to writing requirements and conformance criteria for the various endpoints of data flows in a mobile credential ecosystem. This ecosystem describes the interactions of the Issuer, Holder and Verifier, and includes the software, hardware, individuals, and entities at the technical endpoints. In ISO/IEC 18013-5, these are the “Issuing Authority”, “Issuing Authority Infrastructure”, “mDL What about including a simple table where you map the ISO term to the “common language” version? Holder”, “mDL” (credential and holding software), “mDL Verifier”, and “mDL Reader”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the course of the next one to two years, the PEMC WG plans on producing several reports and guidelines, including an Implementors Report, the Requirements for Issuers, Verifiers, and Providers, and various Compliance Profiles.&nbsp;</p>



 PEMC Implementors Report 



<p>The group’s focus today is on creating the outline that will provide the scope and structure for the PEMC Implementors Report. The mobile credential ecosystem includes people and/or organizations that hold the credential and consent to its use (Holders),&nbsp; issue the credentials (Issuers), and verify the credential as valid or legitimate (Verifiers). Each of those entities has roles, expectations, and responsibilities that must be clearly defined such that later work can build upon that information to develop assessment and conformance criteria. The Implementors Report offers the necessary framing, guidance, and description of appropriate evidence that will allow the group to develop the requirements and profiles needed for implementing the best practices described by the PEMC WG.</p>



<p>The goal is to have this report published by the end of the 2022 calendar year.</p>

 PEMC Requirements for Issuers, Verifiers, and Providers 



<p>Once the initial report has framed the discussion, the group will produce three additional documents that set out the specific requirements for each type of entity in this ecosystem. These requirements will offer a complete set of guidelines that will serve as the basis for allowing assessors to measure whether an Issuer, Verifier, or Holder (and the specific technology they use) is compliant with the privacy-supporting&nbsp;</p>



<p>While not the focus of the group today, the PEMC WG has spent considerable time discussing the requirements in the past, and will continue to flesh them out once the Implementor’s Report is done. You can see the&nbsp;<a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/l/cp/0ozvM0cB">candidate requirements</a>&nbsp;on the PEMC WG wiki.</p>



 PEMC Compliance Profiles 



<p>With almost every requirement comes an “it depends” caveat as to whether that requirement applies in all cases. For example, any requirement about the handling of age data doesn’t apply if there is no age data being shared. Alternatively, there may be a use case where even more stringent requirements for handling that data are appropriate. The general requirements set the baseline; profiles set the details for common scenarios. Profiles cannot add entirely new requirements, but they can specify how the existing requirements must be implemented in the scenario they are capturing.</p>



<p>The final output of the PEMC WG will be these compliance profiles. Exactly what scenarios will be captured will be determined by the working group participants.</p>



 How to Learn More 



<p>Interest in mobile credentials in general–and mDLs in specific–is growing as governments and commercial organizations move to explore the possibilities.

<p>The OpenID Foundation is a non-profit open standards body with a vision to help people assert their identity wherever they choose and a mission to lead the global community in creating identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy-preserving. One of the OIDFs strengths is creating identity protocols that serve billions of consumers across millions of applications. In that context, OIDF welcomes the opportunity to help fund and facilitate this ambitious yet pragmatic effort in service to the global community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly,&nbsp; Kantara Initiative believes in the importance of this work to serve the global community by closing the gaps between policy and protocols. Kantara is a non-profit, global leader in privacy certification with a shared goal of offering safe spaces for open conversations by the community. Kantara seeks to materially improve the privacy landscape across all markets and sectors. One of its key strengths is deep dive audits of client implementations to ensure standards like NIST 800-63-3 are met against clear conformance criteria. The joint approach of Kantara and OIDF&nbsp; to both projects serves as a model for the kinds of partnership required to build technically viable policies and policy-supportive protocols.</p>

<p>Over the past year, my <a href="https://www.dataswift.io">Dataswift</a> team and I have been so busy designing, building and rolling out data ecosystems that we’ve not had time to do much else. Thanks to invitations from friends at <a href="https://www.ctrl-shift.co.uk">Ctrl Shift</a>, <a href="https://www.ifc.org">IFC</a> and <a href="https://www.adb.org">ADB</a> (thank you!) I now have an opportunity to talk a bit about what we do at the <a href="https://www.fintechfestival.sg">Singapore Fintech Festival</a> Distributed Data Ecosystem session, the ADB reception on their sandbox (Singapore) and at the <a href="https://www.openxcongress.com">OpenX Congress</a> (London). This blogpost is the full version of the&nbsp;topic.</p> The view from here:&nbsp;web2.0 <p>Let’s start with how I view data, as someone who has spent many years working on <a href="https://ireneng.com/markets/">markets and ecosystems</a>. In the web2.0 world, data is mostly fragmented, with disparate pieces of information about a person held across companies. This world, which we currently live in, is populated by centralized systems that have made “platform business models” very popular. These businesses usually design, build and operate the technology of all three business layers – service (applications/website), data (traits/attributes of people), custodian (storing the&nbsp;data).</p><p>Each of these layers in the business stack is tightly coupled with one another with centralized technologies. Almost all businesses use centralized digital technologies today, whether single service or platforms, because they are technically very efficient. Coupling between the layers can be made looser for large conglomerates looking to share data amongst multiple apps/services/businesses, but they are often also built in a centralized fashion. Building decentralized systems require a very different mindset but that’s a subject of a different post.</p> Web3.0 <p>In the web3.0 world (which we are actively engaged in), data is self sovereign and decentralized to individuals. This separation of data from service is important because self-sovereign data provide agency and autonomy. By providing the “nodes, pipes and plumbing” of self-sovereign data, our clients’ data wallets and services have greater freedom to operate on more data and can also compete better in vertical&nbsp;markets.</p><p>This separation also matters for regulatory purposes; while self-sovereign data is compliant and portable across all global territories, services on top of self-sovereign data would still need to conform to a specific country’s regulation. For example, our client in Europe who is creating their “Bring your Own” Identity Service using our decentralized data infrastructure would still require <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS">eIDAS</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.electronicid.eu/en/blog/post/qualified-electronic-signature/en">QES</a>.</p><p>Separated from the service, data is more portable, making it possible for data ecosystems to be designed and&nbsp;built.</p> How we design data ecosystems <p>In web2.0 where data is siloed, it is the virtualization of human traits and attributes. Web2.0 tends to focus on aggregation and prediction for better recommendations with better data products, or to ascertain risks of an individual’s behaviour.</p><p>In web3.0 with decentralized self-sovereign data, multiple traits and attributes can now be grouped together across companies, giving visibility to micro-behaviours. These micro-behaviours can be linked up to form journeys that are enabled by data within a data wallet. At Dataswift, we are often called to design these journeys, together with the types of data that form them. These journeys bring the person into a “Phygital” environment – where the physical and the digital interact.</p><p>Of course, getting multiple data sources to decentralize their data requires them to come together to form a data ecosystem. And many of our clients do so, because it reduces customer churn, improves engagement, and cuts their customer acquisition costs. Much like how Star Alliance competes with One World in the airline sector, data ecosystems also create collective stickiness. Most of all, ecosystem owners potentially increase their income because every use of their customer data in the ecosystem earns them revenue (more of that&nbsp;below).</p> The art of the&nbsp;possible <p>With data ecosystems and data wallets, it is now possible to design and intervene in journeys to achieve large-scale outcomes such as ESG goals. This ability to achieve mass coordination while preserving privacy and enabling agency is what’s most exciting about data ecosystems.</p><p>The following are some examples of data ecosystems we have designed for our clients; the illustrations should be self-explanatory.</p><p>This customer journey is the shortest we’ve ever designed. A KYC process takes only 5 mins and yet its reusability is of such high&nbsp;value.</p><p>This journey is quite unique as it involves self-sovereign data of a micro-SME where the individual is a shop&nbsp;owner.</p><p>This journey will probably have huge potential for the measurement of scope 3 emissions.</p> “Phygital” Journeys <p>You will notice that these journeys bring the person into a “Phygital” environment – where the physical and the digital interact. And in doing so, enable the full potential of the metaverse and decentralisation to be realised.</p><p>Of course, designing and rolling out data ecosystems is one thing; using a market to scale it is&nbsp;another.</p> How we scale data ecosystems <p>At Dataswift, we design a data ecosystem for a “triple coincidence of wants” (see my rather dry <a href="http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/160054/">paper</a> on&nbsp;this):</p>  Individuals want better offers and more contextual and personalized recommendations.  Partners want to reach audiences with selected attributes.  The app/website and ecosystem owner wants greater loyalty, better engagement, lower acquisition costs and most of all, to generate revenues from the data they hold of their customers.  <p>So when we design data ecosystems, we adhere to certain market design principles that will ensure that the ecosystem is able to grow, reinforce itself and self regulate. When all this happens, revenues for the ecosystem owner should start flowing in and outcomes are achieved with minimal intervention. For example, it should take mere minutes for a completely new partner to sign up to use verified data when an individual shows up at their business; they should not need to deal with cumbersome tech and legal integration. This is how revenues of a data ecosystem can scale exponentially.</p><p>Data ecosystems usually attract the interest of private equity funds. They often partner us by bringing low-performing investees who hold customer data, so that we can help them achieve a larger multiplier of returns with a data ecosystem.</p><p>One of our most visible ecosystems is <a href="http://sejutakg.my">SejutaKG</a>, which is looking to get the whole nation of Malaysia to lose 1 million kg in weight through changing micro-behaviours and micro-habits, and checking the country’s obesity epidemic while using the market to fund its roll-out. SejutaKG has completed their pilot and would be scaling in the next few months. It is a good example of charities/NGOs that struggle to raise funding or donations and may wish to build a data ecosystem that can generate sustainable revenues for their&nbsp;cause.</p><p>We have many more data ecosystems on our design table. Working with NFTs, stable coins and CBDCs are some we can’t quite talk about yet but we’ll put them out when we can. If you want to earn revenues from decentralizing your customer data and think you need a data ecosystem, we usually ask you three questions:</p>  What micro-habits / behaviours do you wish to incentivize?  What customer journey do you wish to transform /&nbsp;improve?  What impact / outcome do you wish to achieve (as a business and as a community)?  <p>If you have answers for each of these, a data ecosystem may be&nbsp;viable.</p><p>In fact, if you have a “wicked” problem, have thrown money at a collective outcome, have had difficulty scaling data portability and want to gain advantage over your competitors, <a href="https://www.dataswift.io/contact">let’s have a chat</a>. I’m in Singapore for the Singapore Fintech Festival week starting 31 Oct and in London for the OpenX Congress in the week beginning 7 Nov, then in the US for a month from 14&nbsp;Nov.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things/designing-markets-and-scaling-data-ecosystems-1d799e870250">Designing markets and scaling data ecosystems</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things">Hub of All Things</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

              Retailer MC has seen a 50% reduction in time spent receiving a case of products at its warehouse, and a 99% reduction in labelling errors, since introducing a labelling solution on cases and pallets based on GS1 standards. 

<p>The particularities of the OTC supply chain regarding product identification, unit of purchase, supplier’s technological maturity and constitution of logistic units such as pallets, lead to great inefficiencies and high levels of operational errors and rejection of orders.</p>

<p>By Andy Parsons, Sr. Director, Content Authenticity Initiative </p><p>Every year around this time after <a href="https://www.adobe.com/max.html">Adobe MAX</a>, the Content Authenticity Initiative team takes a moment to reflect on MAX milestones and the work ahead. This year I’m incredibly proud of the steps we’ve taken with strong partnerships and in the growing CAI community which now boasts over 800 members. With the announcement of partnerships with Leica and Nikon to implement provenance into cameras, we celebrate adoption of provenance throughout the content lifecycle, with a focus on photojournalists using these iconic devices to tell authentic stories. We’ve also released significant updates to Content Credentials in Photoshop, Verify, and upgrades to our open-source tools for provenance, all based on your feedback. Keep it coming, please. &nbsp;</p><p>The CAI team spent the week at MAX interacting with partners, creators, and CAI members across several venues. We had a demo station in the main Adobe booth in the convention center, hosted a session in the Photoshop graphic design track which included a demo of provenance from &nbsp;camera to Photoshop editing, to export, to Verify display. And we hosted a lively happy hour where it was fantastic to meet many community members face-to-face. These connections are the energy on which the CAI runs, be they in-person or virtual.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a recap of our news and everything that launched at MAX 2022:&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2022/10/18/major-steps-forward-cai-partnerships-leica-nikon-new-content-credentials-features-photoshop-beyond-max-2022">Adobe blog post</a> on all product updates and the Leica and Nikon integrations of provenance into cameras, which will be consumer ready as early as 2023. &nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/content-credentials.html">Enable Content Credentials in Photoshop</a>, now available for all Creative Cloud subscribers. Content Credentials now supports increased flexibility and collaboration, turn the feature xon in your global preferences and choose to attach with each document. Also new: publish to Content Credentials cloud to save space in your files and create more robust creator attribution.&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2022/10/18/bringing-next-wave-ai-creative-cloud">Adobe commits to preserving creator attribution with CAI technology</a> integration across tools as they explore Generative AI capabilities. Content Authenticity will be a key factor in creator attribution as we move forward with more research and experimentation of Generative AI technology.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The <a href="https://verify.contentauthenticity.org/">Verify</a> site has been updated to include search and recovery of data when work is exported to the Content Credentials cloud, making Content Credentials permanently associated with your content, no matter where it travels. &nbsp;</p>  <p>Our <a href="https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org">three open-source tools for digital content provenance</a> now include updated documentation and quicker file processing time, and support select audio and video file formats, plus mobile development. &nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://www.wired.com/sponsored/story/content-authenticitys-chain-of-trust-reaches-cameras/">Content Authenticity’s Chain of Trust Reaches Cameras</a>–more on our Leica and Nikon partnerships, both implementing attribution and provenance to the point of image creation in cameras. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>We have much more ahead and hope you’ll join us in this work. If you’re not yet a member, <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/membership">you can join the 800+</a> large and small companies, researchers, technologists, NGOs, and more working on creating a more trustworthy and transparent digital ecosystem with our free membership.</p><p></p>

<p>Energy Web is working with Shell on Avelia, a digital platform for scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), one of the most promising new technologies for reaching net zero in the aviation&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Zug, Switzerland — 27 October 2022 — All areas of the economy need to reach net zero in the coming decades. This will be much more straightforward for some sectors than others. In many cases, the deciding factor will be the speed at which technologies develop.</p><p>One way of thinking about large-scale decarbonization is as a triangle with three points, all three of which need to be spoken for to drive change at&nbsp;pace:</p>  Technology: We need technologies which can replace current ways of doing things with low-carbon options — such as electric vehicles replacing petrol&nbsp;cars  Clear targets: On top of the desire to want to reach net zero, we need to maintain clear targets to make sure we progress towards our end&nbsp;goal.  Economics: We need the economic drivers which will make switching to new technologies and approaches financially viable.  <p>For the aviation sector, governments around the world made a major step last month towards evidencing the middle of these three points. At the assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the air transport division of the United Nations, <a href="https://www.icao.int/Newsroom/Pages/States-adopts-netzero-2050-aspirational-goal-for-international-flight-operations.aspx">184 countries signed a landmark treaty</a> agreeing to target net zero carbon emissions for air transport by&nbsp;2050.</p><p>The sector will require major changes to hit this long-term goal in the time allotted, from all actors in the industry, and progress has to start now. Aviation is currently responsible for around 2.5% of global CO2 emissions. With the total number of passengers globally expected to continue growing as flights become more accessible, this is only set to increase.</p><p>Flying, however, has typically been a difficult area for emissions reductions, primarily because the technologies simply don’t yet exist to completely replace the kerosene-powered jet engines which are responsible for emissions.</p><p>Manufacturers and engineers are working hard on this central problem. Airbus’ <a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/innovation/zero-emission/hydrogen/zeroe">ZEROe concept aircraft</a> explore hydrogen-powered propulsion for zero-emission flight. And <a href="https://www.afar.com/magazine/electric-planes-are-coming-sooner-than-you-think#:~:text=The%20largest%20electric%20plane%20in,BAE%20Systems)%20with%20electric%20batteries.">United will start flying</a> Heart’s 19-seat ES-19 electric aircraft in 2026 for short-hop journeys.</p><p>But these aircraft and the associated infrastructure for fuelling and charging may be decades off from widespread use. And for greater uptake for longer-ranges, electric aircraft will require major battery technology improvements.</p><p>Over the past decades, much improvement has come from advances in flight efficiency through improvements to aerodynamics, engines, weight distribution, and&nbsp;routing.</p><p>But what goes in the engines is proving to be just as important. One of the most promising areas for emissions reductions right now is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is a fuel which can be mixed with regular jet fuel and be used without having to modify the jet engine, and is made of renewable sources such as plant or animal material — including cooking oil, urban and agricultural waste, and even&nbsp;algae.</p><p>Over the lifecycle of an aircraft, it can reduce emissions by up to 80%, and has already been successfully deployed by some industry actors, with around 450,000 flights having already used it. It’s a great example of a technology which, if supported correctly, can be worked seamlessly into existing operations to cut emissions.</p><p>There are problems though. SAF is currently much more expensive than traditional jet fuel — often double the price. For all the net zero goodwill, airlines simply can’t operate without workable&nbsp;costs.</p><p>In addition to the massive demand from airlines for this fuel, it’s also scarce. In 2021, 100 million litres of SAF were produced — against the global aviation’s typical yearly usage of <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/environment/sustainable-flying-blog/why-saf-is-the-future-of-aviation/">360 billion litres</a> of jet fuel, accounting for less than 0.03% of industry consumption.</p><p>We’re working with Shell, one of the largest energy companies in the world and a founding member of Energy Web, as well as Accenture and American Express, on a blockchain powered book-and-claim solution that provides fully traceable SAF purchases, to help scale&nbsp;SAF.</p><p>It works like this: corporate travelers use Avelia’s book-and-claim system to purchase a share of SAF for the flight they are taking. If SAF isn’t available on that flight, then the total equivalent SAF paid for is used by another flight — contributing to the overall demand for the fuel, and allowing travelers to claim a purchase. The environmental benefits of this purchase are then recorded in the company’s favor.</p><p>This has benefits for everyone. Airlines access the buying power of corporations for SAF needs, while companies can use the traceable attributes Avelia provides to meet their own sustainability targets, and one day include them as part of corporate reporting.</p><p>The ultimate goal of Avelia is to create and evidence the demand necessary to help SAF to scale up. By creating a straightforward and transparent way to purchase SAF, we send clear buying signals to the market, giving SAF suppliers the confidence to invest in ramping up production.</p><p>At the same time, by furthering investment in production, Avelia will help to lower the price of SAF for all airlines. In this way, we’re contributing to the third point on the decarbonization triangle above: by facilitating the economic drivers needed to make SAF more accessible, we’re aiming to turbocharge its&nbsp;uptake.</p><p>Green Proofs, which you can<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions/green-proofs/"> read more about here</a>, is our solution for registering and tracking low-carbon products — like SAF — in a traceable, efficient manner, helping to validate proof of ownership and environmental benefit for corporate customers.</p><p>In 2022, SAF saw <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/environment/sustainable-aviation-fuels/">$17.0 Billion in forward purchase agreements</a> — fantastic progress. But we need a lot more. With Avelia, we’re hoping to help share the costs of SAF across companies, airlines and travellers, to help the SAF industry — and aviation’s net zero transition — to take off.<br>You can visit Avelia’s website<a href="https://aveliasolutions.com/"> here</a> to see&nbsp;more.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>Ceramic recently launched Sign in With Solana (SIWS)—a specification developed in partnership with the Chain Agnostic Standards Association and leading Solana wallets and apps—to provide secure and user-friendly authentication.</p><p>Signing in with a wallet means users don’t have to worry about pop-up modals or needing to sign every action they take on an app.</p><p>Check out an example below, using a Phantom wallet to sign into <a href="https://orbis.club/blog/kjzl6cwe1jw1496mwu9sxirb3rc3bml8tutthakzi7vcd4jee6lybme6fl2qytr">Orbis Protocol</a>. Developers use Orbis to build features such as social timelines, comment systems or private messaging on top of their applications, with the underlying Ceramic data infrastructure facilitating performant social experiences.</p><p>How Sign-In With Solana works:</p>  Ceramic uses the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> standard for users accounts. DIDs require no central authority—users control their data and decide who they share it with.  With the <code>did:pkh</code> DID method, a persistent ID is securely generated from the public key hash of a wallet address. This enables one-click sign-on with a wallet to many apps on Solana.  App developers can pair it with the DID-Sessions library, which allows a stream author (user) to delegate to another entity (app developer) the ability to sign certain read/write actions on their behalf for a time-bound period.  The SIWS spec passes a human-readable message between a Solana wallet, like Phantom, and a Solana app, like Magic Eden. The message includes sign-in, defines which capability permissions the user is offering to the developer, and for how long—similar to a web2 session today.  <p>You can learn how to use DID:PKH by invoking a Solana auth provider <a href="https://did.js.org/docs/authorization">here</a>. Learn more about DID-Sessions <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/accounts/did-session/">here</a> and Capability Permissions <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/capability-based-data-security-on-ceramic/">here</a>.

		<p>Webinar</p>
 
 
<p>For years, Online Program Managers (OPMs) have provided costly, cookie-cutter digital learning options for institutions looking to fast-track a presence in the online market. Now, as many institutions have made investments in their own digital learning capabilities over the last two years, and federal guidelines and regulations on OPM providers continue to tighten, institutions have a perfect opportunity to foster successful home-grown digital learning programs.</p>
<p>In this session, Edge Chief Digital Learning Officer Josh Gaul will share insights into why institutions should take this opportunity to evolve beyond OPM partnerships, and how to do so successfully.</p>
<p>This session will outline:</p>
 
 
 How the drawbacks of OPM partnerships far outweigh the benefits 
 How institutions can take advantage of unique institutional characteristics and intellectual property to evolve beyond OPM branded programming 
 Steps institutions will need to take to effectively replace OPM capabilities, including instructional design, faculty training, student support, and more 
 The role of digital learning leaders in launching and maintaining sustainable online programming 
 How Edge can support a successful shift away from OPMs with support services and collaborative community-building

We are more or less open depending on our context and situation. However, we also know that working openly has been shown to have benefits for organisations and society as a whole, as well as the individuals who choose to work&nbsp;openly.</p><p>Learning to work more openly is a process. There are a variety of themes to understand and find tactics for. We developed the free email course “<a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/open-course/">What We Talk About When We Talk About Open</a>” to serve as an introduction.</p>First Steps in working openly&nbsp;badges<p>We know it takes time to be comfortable working openly, so we’ve created badge pathways to help people take their first steps and then take a few more. The “<a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/badges/open-working-badges/">First Steps in Open Working</a>” pathway recognises people who are able to show that they have demonstrated one of the principles of a characteristic in accordance with the Open Organization Definition.

<p></p> 
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Systems Integration Solutions&nbsp;is a Lithuania-based company specializing in blockchain technical solutions in information technology.</p>
<p>Their team is part of the eSSIF-Lab project and participated in Completing the Framework Open Call, which has helped them to develop their open-source SSI solution.</p>
<p>We’ve had the pleasure of interviewing&nbsp;Deividas Umbrasas, project manager at Systems Integration Solutions where he’s leading a team to build an interoperable, decentralized self-sovereign identity framework.</p>
<p>In this interview, he explained to us what Systems Integration Solutions is about, what are their goals for the middle and long time and give us a piece of advice about what other companies like his should do to get a public funding opportunity.</p>
 1. Introduce yourself and your company, and explain what makes you different. 
<p>First and foremost, Systems Integration Solutions would like to thank eSSIF-Lab for the invitation to the interview; it was an incredible journey in which we had to overcome many challenges in order to bring our self-sovereign – decentralized identity product package CorpoSign DID to fruition. I would like to express my gratitude to our amazing team, our CEO Rišardas Bedulskis, our lead software developer Dainius Preimantas, and our application developer Augis Bražiūnas, without them it would never have happened.</p>
<p>To return to the subject at hand, my name is Deividas Umbrasas, and I work as a project manager at Systems Integration Solutions, LLC, a Lithuania-based company specializing in blockchain technical solutions in information technology. I have worn several hats in my career, but blockchain technology sparked my attention in 2017. It all started with trading cryptocurrencies, which inspired my curiosity in blockchain technology, and now I am leading a team to build an interoperable, decentralized self-sovereign identity framework on European Blockchain Service Infrastructure.</p>
<p>At Systems Integration Solutions, we are working with European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) to create a Self-Sovereign identity and European Identification Framework with the product CorpoSign DID. Being the first one to launch an EBSI node in Lithuania and one of the first in the EU to be fully conformant with EBSI, W3C, and the first to offer Self-Issued OpenID v2 – CorpoSign DID main advantage lies in the streamlined process of simultaneous login, authentication, and KYC (know your customer) using trust anchor’s power of attorney verifiable credentials.</p>
 2. What services or products do you offer? 
<p>Everything began with the development of an open-source SSI solution, made possible by eSSIF-Lab CFOC funding. We started in the e-Government domain by enabling government and business entities to participate in the cross-border logistics ecosystem, by authorizing their representatives to conduct relevant acts on their behalf, using an ecosystem-specific scheme (business or government power of attorney).</p>
<p>As there was a clear need for new authorization methods, we have implemented them into our eCMR (<a href="https://sis.lt/projects/diginno-proto">https://sis.lt/projects/diginno-proto</a>). By scanning a QR code with a mobile application, a user can verify or authorize data on behalf of the organization, or just log in. But as we neared completion of this project, we realized that we had produced the majority of tools and components necessary to launch our Software as a Service or White label offerings.</p>
<p>Currently, our novel technology enables CorpoSign users to exchange any sort of data and decide how their data is used and processed, without the need for any login credentials. CorpoSign’s decentralized identity makes it a self-sovereign, privacy-protecting, and user-friendly application that anybody can use and benefit from, to easily communicate any form of data utilizing interoperable DID and SSI solutions; we specialize in Natural, Legal Persons IDs &amp; Diplomas.</p>
<p>Shortly, we offer the issuance of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) via our custom client panels or APIs, the storage of VCs in our mobile application wallet, and the sharing and verification of Verifiable Presentations (VP) via custom or universal verifiers and SDKs. We can also launch public/private blockchains with white-label solutions if needed.</p>
<p>Please view our brief product demonstration at&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/fIo%20Gdz80K8">https://youtu.be/fIo Gdz80K8</a></p>
 3. What milestones have you achieved so far since your project launch? 
<p>In just seven months, we have accomplished things we never imagined we would attain. With the assistance of the eSSIF-Lab community, we have finalized our business case and are on the verge of completely commercializing CorpoSign DID as a SaaS or White label service. We are prepared to adapt this technology to provide streamlined data exchange, KYC, authorization, and SDK logins.</p>
<p>Regarding business potential, we have begun discussions with local institutions and schools about adopting the SSI solution for diplomas and student identification cards. In addition, we are in discussion with government entities to implement SSI for natural and legal persons in cross-border solutions. We are already in discussions with our local AML KYC providers to join forces for a better future, as we are continually pondering simpler KYC procedures.</p>
<p>Also, in our eSSIF-Lab CFOC project CorpoSign DID (also known as eSSIF4Logistics), we have released and described the majority of our APIs and infrastructure decisions to contribute to the standardization and global interoperability (<a href="https://cutt.ly/sBXsHys">https://cutt.ly/sBXsHys</a>), as we are ardent supporters of both W3C and EBSI standards for SSI and DIDs. We take this matter seriously; so, we have also made an envisioned interoperability table with most of the eSSIF-Lab participants.</p>
 4. What have you achieved with your idea thanks to the eSSIF_Lab project? 
<p>The purpose of the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF) was to enable individuals to control their digital identities and authenticate securely to government and business websites. We knew we were at the right place at the right time since both of our objectives were to drastically lower the expenses of verification; automate notarization, enhance data integrity and security by integrating digital audit trails, and more.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>As previously said, because eSSIF-Lab saw the possibility from the same perspective as we do, they encouraged us to commercialize our contribution to SSI solutions, aided in the development of a detailed business case and increased the exposure of our work. In addition to the financing, consultations, and awareness, the engagement and collaboration with other eSSIF-Lab subgrantees, as well as the consortium’s assistance, were the key benefits. We hope to continue on this adventure together.</p> 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  5. What are your goals for the middle/long-time future? 
<p>Our mid-term objective is to promote Verifiable credentials and decentralized identities, which will enable governments to easily link natural persons to organizations and migrate to a fully digital world, therefore enhancing both export market access and border security. We anticipate that data-sharing technologies will be globally interoperable in the near future.</p>
<p>Some may wonder why and how this is possible. Verifiable credentials have the unique scalability attribute of issuer and verifier separation. Issuers can go fully digital at any time without requiring other parties to invest in EDI and API connections or register on hubs. At any time, verifiers can continue using paper-based methods or switch to automated data extraction and verification.</p>
<p>Regarding the future, we are huge fans of Unece.org’s recently published whitepaper, “eDATA Verifiable Credentials for Cross-Border Trade”, which asserts that World Wide Web Consortiums (W3C) DID approaches for data sharing, are the only way to accomplish worldwide interoperability at now. Currently, we are investigating how to completely embrace our technology for all whitepaper-mentioned use cases, such as mitigating compliance concerns, tampered papers, product counterfeits, illicit trade and items, and easing trade financing, while maintaining scalable and user-friendly technology.</p>
<p>We recognize that the majority of this will be a formidable obstacle, but we are prepared to face it in the hopes that we are not the only ones who desire global interoperability.</p>
 6. Any piece of advice for those who are looking for public funding? 
<p>I am yet to raise a substantial amount of money, so I might be not the one to give this kind of advice. Nobody can answer this question for sure, however, let me try.</p>
<p>Always be searching, learning, and improving, there are opportunities everywhere, you just might be at the wrong place, so do not waver if something went wrong. If your application was rejected – insist to give honest feedback (request to give reviewer’s comments), even if it will hurt you.</p>
<p>Hire a company, that knows how to prepare and submit for public funding or investment, and make sure they have a substantial portfolio.</p>
<p>I would also add that you should never stop seeking like-minded people, since we are stronger in numbers, and the most common reason for public funding rejection is a lack of expertise or project execution plan (wrong program, idea, or budget problems).</p>
<p>Lastly, ask whether you may resubmit during the next grant period and how your application might be improved. Hope that helps!</p>

<p>Passkeys are designed to replace passwords and allow seamless logins for consumers across devices and platforms. Makes online purchases easier for consumers, removes checkout friction for merchants.</p>



<p>SAN JOSE, Calif.,&nbsp;Oct. 24, 2022&nbsp;/PRNewswire/ — Today, PayPal announced it is adding passkeys as an easy and secure log in method for PayPal accounts. Passkeys are a new industry standard created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium that replace passwords with cryptographic key pairs, offering customers a simple and secure way to log in to PayPal based on technology that is resistant to phishing and designed so that there is&nbsp;no shared passkey data between platforms. The new PayPal log in option will first be available to iPhone, iPad, or Mac users on PayPal.com and will expand to additional platforms as those platforms add support for passkeys.</p>



PayPal introduces passkeys as an easy and secure log in method for PayPal accounts.



<p>A founding member of the FIDO Alliance, PayPal is one of the first financial services companies to make passkeys widely available to its users. This cutting-edge security standard is significant as passkeys address one of the biggest security problems on the web, which is the weakness of password authentication. Over 2.6 billion records were hacked in 2017 and of these hacks, 81% are estimated to have been caused by password stealing and guessing1. Many consumers recycle passwords across online services, which can not only be cumbersome but can also lead consumers to reuse the same, potentially vulnerable passwords across services. Passkeys are designed to replace passwords for an even more seamless and secure login experience with PayPal.</p>



<p>Passkeys will also help more consumers complete their purchases with PayPal – once PayPal users create a passkey, they won’t have to remember their password, allowing them to check out with greater ease. According to a recent survey of U.S. consumers, 44% of consumers have abandoned an online purchase because they forgot a password.2</p>



<p>“Launching passkeys for PayPal is foundational to our commitment to offering our customers safe, secure and easy ways to access and manage their daily financial lives,” said&nbsp;Doug Bland, SVP and GM, Head of Consumer, PayPal. “We are excited to provide our customers a more seamless checkout experience that eliminates the risks of weak and reused credentials and removes the frustration of remembering a password. We are making it easier for customers to shop online.”</p>



<p>How to Create a PayPal Passkey</p>



<p>Creating and using a passkey with PayPal is a quick and easy process on an Apple device. Once created, passkeys are synced with iCloud Keychain, ensuring a strong, private relationship between a customer and their device, and an easy sign-in experience for PayPal users with devices running iOS 16, iPadOS 16.1, or macOS&nbsp;Ventura.</p>



  Once existing customers log in to PayPal with a browser on desktop or mobile web using their existing PayPal credentials such as a username and password, they will have the option to “Create a passkey.”  Customers will then be prompted to authenticate with Apple Face ID or Touch ID. Then the passkey will be automatically created, and next time PayPal customers log in, they won’t need to use or manage a password again.  



<p>PayPal Passkeys Can Be Used to Log In on Any Device</p>



<p>If they have devices that don’t support passkeys yet, users can still use an iPhone to log in with a PayPal passkey. Users simply scan the QR code that will appear after they enter their PayPal User ID.</p>



<p>PayPal passkeys will start rolling out today to customers in the U.S.. PayPal passkeys will become available in additional countries early in 2023, and on additional technology platforms as they add support for passkeys.</p>



<p>About PayPal</p>



<p>PayPal has remained at the forefront of the digital payment revolution for more than 20 years. By leveraging technology to make financial services and commerce more convenient, affordable, and secure, the PayPal platform is empowering more than 429 million consumers and merchants in more than 200 markets to join and thrive in the global economy.

Welcome 
Gail Hodges – OIDF


12:35-1:00
OIDF Privacy Whitepaper Listening Session: “Help Design a Scalable Future for Personal Privacy”<br>
Government-issued digital IDs have the potential for amazing societal impact but getting there from here means bridging the gaps in identity validation, verification, privacy, and control. In this session, we offer an open conversation to gather different perspectives on how policies and protocols need to evolve to help government-issued IDs fill their role in a global privacy-preserving infrastructure. Come join us to be a part of thinking outside the box of today so we can achieve tomorrow’s promise of government-issued IDs as a benefit to all.
Heather Flanagan – Spherical Cow Consulting


1:00-1:25
OIDF Government Whitepaper Listening Session: “Citizen-Centric Identity Systems”<br>
The OpenID Foundation is developing a whitepaper for governments and their associated stakeholders with the goal of supporting them in making good decisions when implementing citizen-centric digital identity systems – and to help them understand where OIDC and its extensions fit in. This session will be a facilitated discussion about the key concerns of government when thinking about digital identity:<p></p>
 
 The Role of Government 
 Key Stakeholders 
 Adoption 
 Balancing privacy/security/trust 
 Resilience 
 Economic Benefits 
 Technology and Interoperability 
 How existing standards fit in 
 

Elizabeth Garber – Whitepaper Co-Author


1:25-1:50
OIDF IoT Whitepaper Listening Session: “IoT &amp; Identity: First Thoughts on a Blueprint for How People and Things can Interoperate<br>
Most enterprises implementing use cases with connected devices follow proprietary approaches when interacting with people. This results in challenges when it comes to integrating different systems but also adds risk from a security perspective, efforts from a development perspective, and inconsistency from an end-user perspective. A blueprint for how people and things can interoperate has to outline ideas, paradigms, and enhancements to existing standards to provide guidance to architects, developers, and product owners. In this session, you’ll get insights into early thoughts on that topic, hear about challenges leading enterprises in this segment have today, and are invited to share your opinion, ideas, and concerns regarding IoT and Identity.

<p>The OpenC2 Architecture Specification describes the abstract architecture of OpenC2</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Architecture Specification Version 1.0 from the OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>Cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, less expensive to execute, dynamic and automated. The provision of cyber defense via statically configured products operating in isolation is untenable. Standardized interfaces, protocols and data models will facilitate the integration of the functional blocks within a system and between systems. Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable machine-to-machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation.</p>



<p>The OpenC2 Architecture Specification describes the abstract architecture of OpenC2 to define a common understanding of the messages and interactions for all bindings and serializations.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

 Exploiting the potential of the e-ID ecosystem 
<p>In chemistry, a reaction can be accelerated by adding a substance called a catalyst. The catalyst reduces the activation energy required for the reaction, which can then be sped up.</p>
<p>The addition of a catalyst to a chemical reaction can be considered the analogy to the introduction of the trust infrastructure and the government-issued verifiable ID card – the e-ID – into the ecosystem of Swiss society and economy. In our view, it can also be seen as a «response booster» to enhance the performance of economic growth in an increasingly digital world.</p>
<p>In June 2022, the Federal Council opened the consultation on the new e-ID (<a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/aktuell/mm.msg-id-89515.html">media release</a>). Its main difference from the previous one is the following three aspects:</p>
 
 The federal government is responsible for issuing the e-ID and operates the e-ID infrastructure. 
 Data protection plays a central role. 
 The e-ID serves as the cornerstone of an ecosystem of digital credentials that supports the issuance and use of government and private digital credentials of all kinds (see also the das digitalswitzerland <a href="https://digitalswitzerland.com/building-a-swiss-digital-trust-ecosystem/">white paper</a>, in which DIDAS was heavily involved). 
 
<p>This ecosystem has great potential in terms of digitization in Switzerland and will strongly influence the way we handle personal data and consume digital services and products in the future.</p>
 Making the e-ID ecosystem tangible with a real application 
<p>To make this ecosystem tangible, three members of DIDAS (SwissSign, cardossier and Adnovum) have built a mini-ecosystem as a PoC in collaboration with the canton of Aargau. This exemplary ecosystem consists of three use cases that build on each other and shed light on the issuance and use of digital credentials in the form of SSI-Verifiable Credentials (VC).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use case 1 – Issuing a basic identity or basic ID: In the first use case, users log in to the SwissID portal with their productive SwissID login. On the portal, users are visually guided – from the installation of a suitable wallet to the issuance and storage of the basic ID as a verifiable credential on the smartphone.</p>
<p>Use case 2 – Issuing a certificate of residence in the eGov portal: With the basic ID created in the first step, the user logs in to the eGov portal of the Canton of Aargau. The login is done by SSI and requires e-mail, last name and first name from the basic ID. The other data of the basic ID is not disclosed. The eGov portal can trust the data of the basic ID and verify it. The data is used to load a residential address for the person from the system. The user can then store the residential address as a verifiable credential in his or her mobile wallet. Upon completion of use case 2, the user has a basic ID and the residential address is stored in his or her wallet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use case 3 – Initiating a provisional traffic authorization for a vehicle: The registration of a car involves many players such as the policyholder, the insurance company, the garage and, of course, the road traffic authority (StVA). In addition, there are many formalities associated with it. The goal of this use case is to facilitate the registration of a vehicle by providing the cardossier platform with the identity and certificate of residence of the policyholder as verifiable credentials. cardossier then automatically carries out the further registration steps together with the relevant insurance company and the road traffic authority. In the process, the insurance company and the road traffic authority always receive the same and correct address information.</p>
      
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By implementing the mini-ecosystem and intensively testing the three use cases, stakeholders gained valuable insights into user interaction, governance, and technology. However, the initiative has primarily demonstrated how an ecosystem of digital credentials can function and bring sustainable added value to data protection and digitization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Expanding the scope of exploration 
<p>Similar to these three use cases, there are endless opportunities to build value-added digital services and products based on the e-ID ecosystem. However, they require an understanding of participation in an ecosystem with possibly distributed benefits versus existing centralized models, i.e. ecosystems characterized by the control of a value stream or the unique positioning of one or more intermediaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog article was written by Stéphane Mingot and Daniel Säuberli. We look forward to your comments and to continuing the dialogue around the topic.</p>

 Consultation for BGEID 
<p>The Federal Council <a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-89515.html">opened</a> consultation for the Federal Law on Electronic Proof of Identity and Other Electronic Evidence (BGEID) on June 29, 2022.</p>
<p>As with previous discussion <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/dam/bj/de/data/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id.pdf.download.pdf/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id-d.pdf">paper</a> “Target Image E-ID” from 2021, our members have taken a close look at both the preliminary draft of the federal law and the explanatory report.&nbsp; Our extensive commentary and observations has been submitted to Federal Council and the FDJP.</p>
 Summary of the Position Paper 
<p>The preliminary <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/dam/bj/de/data/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/vorentw.pdf">draft</a> of the federal law contains the much needed legal foundations, which are formulated in a fairly open manner and is therefore considered by our members to be very good. We are convinced that the proposal for the e-ID law represents a solid basis and sets the framework for a promising trust infrastructure in which a state-issued e-ID represents the core element. We welcome the creation of a legal framework for this trust infrastructure.</p>
<p>In ecosystems of Verifiable Credentials, the state can thus assume the role of enabler and pursue the goal of creating an attractive environment for a wide range of applications. However, a viable ecosystem of Verifiable Credentials can only be successfully designed, piloted and implemented together with the issuers, verifiers and holders of&nbsp; Verifiable Credentials.</p>
<p>We also recommend that the terms used in the ecosystem be defined uniformly and in line with international standards.</p>
<p>In the context of wider Verifiable Credentials, it is essential to define uniform standards as well as to allow for differences in sectoral governance in the ecosystem. For example, the same attributes should always be used for a residence confirmation, while additional attributes could be used in different sectors.</p>
<p>DIDAS looks forward to the next steps and recommends a priority treatment in the Federal Council. Furthermore, we recommend pushing for technical proof of concepts and minimal viable products (MVPs) involving all stakeholders and civil society in order to make the best use of the planned implementation timeline for the political decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, October 21, 2022  – Edge’s premier event, EdgeCon, made its triumphant return on October 13, 2022. Hosted on Edge member campus, Princeton University, EdgeCon Autumn 2022&nbsp; provided an opportunity to re-engage with the Edge member community, higher education leaders from throughout the region, and a variety of industry leading vendors who are helping institutions solve today’s biggest challenges. While the spirit of EdgeCon remained, the event format was reimagined as a single-day event that’s more accessible, streamlined to accommodate the busy schedules of Edge members, and budget conscious to attend for the Edge community.</p>
<p>Over 250 professionals from academic, healthcare, IT and government sectors gathered to discuss cutting-edge technology and surrounding issues, as well as gain insight on how to apply real-life solutions to their own institutions. With over 25 sponsors from across the technology spectrum supporting the event, <a href="https://njedge.net/edgecon-autumn-2022/">EdgeCon Autumn 2022</a> received impressive reviews, with one Vice President of Academic Affairs in attendance noting, “I thought the conference was brilliantly executed from start to finish!”&nbsp;</p>

<p>By: FIDO Staff</p>


 
 


<p>The final day of the <a href="http://www.authenticatecon.com/">Authenticate 2022</a> conference was packed with user stories, thought leadership and panel discussions about the challenges and opportunities for FIDO strong authentication today and in the years to come.</p>



<p>The first user story of the day was from global science and technology company EMD Group / Merck KGaA which is now using FIDO to help improve its own authentication system. Dennis Kniep, domain architecture for Identity and access management at the company explained that his team’s mission is to help secure the company where he sees FIDO as playing a major role.</p>



<p>A challenge that EMD Group / Merck KGaA faced with its implementation of FIDO is that there were a number of legacy applications and services that did not support modern web standards.</p>



<p>“We developed the detach authentication mechanism,” Kniep explained. “With that mechanism the users are able to authenticate with FIDO in a phishing resistant way, even if the user needs access to apps with legacy backends, meaning we can enforce FIDO.”</p>



<p>Equity and inclusion matter</p>


 
 


<p>A recurring theme through the Authenticate 2022 conference is the need for equity and inclusion.</p>



<p>One panel on the topic specifically looking at the issue of inclusiveness in authentication and identity systems. Jamie Danker, senior director of cybersecurity services at Venable LLP, commented that when solving a problem, the makeup of the people trying to solve a given problem will have an impact on the solution.</p>



<p>Danker noted that a recent equity and inclusion study completed by the U.S. government’s&nbsp; General Services Administration (GSA) provides some real empirical data on how remote identity proofing solutions will actually operate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Danker also mentioned the NIST digital identity guidelines, which are currently being updated to revision 4. She noted that NIST has been very clear that equity considerations are going to be part of that.</p>



<p>Security is more than just the web interface</p>



<p>FIDO strong authentication helps to provide authentication into many different types of systems, but it’s not a ubiquitous option for all types of access.</p>


 
 


<p>“Everybody’s talking about web and mobile, and nobody’s talking about the contact center,” John Poirier, Lead Director – EIS at CVS Health said.</p>



<p>Poirier explained that when a password doesn’t work, or a user can’t get access, they will call into a contact center for help. He emphasized that there is a need to make sure there are security policies, procedures and technology in place at contact centers, that secure access, without introducing too much friction.</p>



<p>The idea of extending strong authentication to all types of devices was also discussed by Chad Spensky, CEO of Allthenticate and his co-founder and COO, Rita Mounir.</p>



<p>“The FIDO protocol right now only talks to websites and computers,” Spensky said.</p>



<p>Spensky wants to help bring strong authentication to all types of devices and access ranging from cars, to office doors and everything in between.</p>



<p>Navigating the authentication landscape</p>



<p>In a thematic presentation, Pamela Dingle, director of identity standards at Microsoft, spoke like a pirate and warned about passengers falling off the boat.&nbsp;</p>


 
 


<p>The analogy of the boat is that of helping passengers safely get to their destination, which isn’t always an easy task. Dingle said that Microsoft blocks more than 1000 Password attacks every second, and outlined the multiple reasons why passwords are a weak link. She emphasized that users should wear a life jacket, which in the real world translates into user multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p>



<p>While there are risks with MFA, Dingle said it’s the right first step for many, until they are able to move to phishing resistant strong authentication with FIDO.</p>



<p>“Out of 10,000 compromised accounts, only one will be an MFA credential attack,” she said. “It’s really important to understand the difference in risk between being vulnerable to a password attack, and being vulnerable to an MFA bypass attack.”</p>



<p>That said, she noted that what makes phishing resistant credentials so great, is that they are not susceptible to exactly the same predictable behaviors that make MFA vulnerable. Dingle also noted that she’s very optimistic about the potential for passkeys.</p>



<p>“If we get it right. passkeys become the seat cushion that becomes a flotation device for our passengers,” she said.</p>



<p>Earning Trust in Identity at Scale</p>



<p>With one of the largest ecommerce&nbsp; and cloud platforms in existence Amazon has a real need for strong authentication and it is increasingly relying on FIDO for those needs.</p>



<p>Sarah Cecchetti, head of product for Amazon Cognito explained that identity is handled by the platform team within Amazon Web Services. She noted that identity needs to have a consistent security and usability bar for every service at AWS. To that end, AWS has built out a modular, but centralized approach that uses FIDO.</p>


 
 


<p>Arynn Crow, Senior Manager, User Authentication Product at AWS, said that her company has invested really heavily into FIDO2.</p>



<p>“We continue to invest because fundamentally we believe that FIDO supports greater flexibility,” Crow said. “We have fewer trade-offs between our user’s experience and their security.”</p>



<p>Usability is the key to strong authentication adoption</p>



<p>In a panel session on usability, a key theme that emerged is the foundational need for good usability in order for FIDO adoption to grow.</p>



<p>Judy Clare, vice president, product manager, digital authentication at JP Morgan Chase commented that it’s critical to put strong authentication messages and workflow in the right tone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The right wording and to make it clear, simple and understandable for the average user is very important so that you’re not ostracizing anybody by using all technical jargon,” Clare said.</p>



<p>The need for clear language was echoed by Sierre Wolfkostin, senior product designer at Duo Security. Wolfkostin said that it’s hard to adopt what you can’t understand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Getting to simple human language is really important,” Wolfkostin said.</p>



<p>Usability is also about making sure there is a vibrant ecosystem of vendors and technologies that can help businesses small and large to actually implement FIDO strong authentication in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the closing panel of the event, Christiaan Brand, product manager at Google commented that while well staffed organizations might be able to implement strong authentication and passkey options on their own, many other organizations will need help. It’s a situation much like any other enterprise technology where organizations make use of consultants and service providers to implement complex technology.</p>



<p>Bob Lord, senior technical advisor at CISA argued that the best thing to do is to just start with FIDO. He emphasized the organization should focus on what they can do, not what they can’t.</p>



<p>“I think there’s a lot of hesitation at starting,” Lord said. “I think a lot of misconceptions out there would go away if they were to just start the journey, they would find their misconceptions are wrong.”</p>



<p>Next year in San Diego</p>


 
 


<p>In the closing session, Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance highlighted the key themes of the event.</p>



<p>Those themes are that deployments are real and organization can and should start today. Usability was another strong recurring theme, as a key to helping to ensure adoption. The concept of security by community also resonated at the conference, with users learning from each other about lessons learned.</p>



<p>In the final analysis the Authenticate 2022 was a stellar success with 90 sessions, spread across three tracks and three days of content.</p>



<p>For next year’s event, Authenticate 2023 will be moving to San Diego.</p>

 Research in Decentralized Identity Yields Confidential Data Storage 


 
 


<p>NEW YORK, Oct. 18, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — The Self-Sovereign Foundation, a nonprofit focused on equitable solutions for decentralized identity, has unveiled its Self-Sovereign Database. This critically needed software component stores sensitive data in a provably tamper-proof way. We all need to store personal data, and we all know it is not appropriately protected: trade secrets, family pictures, customer information, and healthcare data. Digital identity is not just about passwordless login and a driver’s license — it’s about all data. Because very soon, all data will be verified and credentialed.</p>



<p>The Self-Sovereign Database is a personal, privacy-respecting database management system for storing, searching and retrieving personal data so securely that even the storage provider cannot verify the identity or access the information. The Self-Sovereign Database is the ultimate secret data vault, a database powered by self-sovereign identity and verified credentials where only the individual is in control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This breakthrough technology helps applications quickly achieve decentralization and data immutability without the slowness and expense of blockchain-based solutions while still being redundant, portable, and protected from breaches. The Self-Sovereign Database supports 256-bit AES encryption and optional FIPS security. The Foundation has started beta testing the integration of the Self-Sovereign Database with decentralized identity platforms and service providers and is seeking new partnerships. Currently supporting Microsoft Entra and EBSI, the database is W3C DID standard and interoperable.</p>



<p>About the Self-Sovereign Foundation</p>



<p>The Self-Sovereign Foundation is a nonprofit entity that empowers individuals with self-determination over personal data. The pillars of our Foundation are protecting confidentiality, ensuring accessibility, and equitable participation. Our mission is a future where users decide for themselves what information they share about themselves with different parties to preserve their privacy.

<p>By: FIDO Staff</p>


 
 


<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.authenticatecon.com/">Authenticate 2022</a>&nbsp;conference got underway on Oct. 17 with a stellar lineup of speakers that included enterprises, service providers and government agencies, all gathered to talk about the current and future state of strong authentication.</p>



<p>The opening session was led by FIDO Alliance Executive Director and CMO Andrew Shikiar who detailed the progress that has been made this past year. Among the highlights mentioned by Shikiar was the launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-certified-professional-program/">FIDO Certified Professional program</a>&nbsp;also got underway in 2022 providing a way for professionals to validate skills. There has also been work done to help with usability as well as adoption with initiatives designed to help accelerate broad deployment of FIDO strong authentication.</p>


 
 


<p>“Our mission is to reduce industry’s reliance on passwords and legacy multi factor authentication,” Shikiar said. “From day-one we’ve had this audacious goal of shifting away from centrally stored shared secrets to a model that is more possession based in nature and relies on common end user devices, that has been our guiding principle.”</p>



<p>Marcio Mello, head of product, PayPal identity platform, talked about how the online payment plans to leverage passkeys as a way to realize the promise of passwordless. Mello demonstrated workflows using passkeys showing how easy it is for a user to authenticate.</p>



<p>“I would say this is an inflection point in our decade-long commitment as an industry, to a passwordless world,” Mello said about passkeys.</p>



<p>NTT DOCOMO has been a leader both within and outside FIDO Alliance beginning with its Board appointment in 2015. DOCOMO has helped shape FIDO specifications and is the first mobile operator to deploy FIDO authentication at scale. Shikiar welcomed Koichi Moriyama, a Chief Security Architect at NTT DOCOMO, to the keynote stage where he announced DOCOMO’s intention to support passkeys for its millions of d ACCOUNT users. Moriyama said support would begin in early 2023.</p>



<p>U.S Government sees FIDO as the gold standard for MFA</p>


 
 


<p>The U.S. government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is taking a very active interest in strong authentication.</p>



<p>“We’ve known for decades that passwords are a weak link in cybersecurity and that the extra layer of protection provided by multi factor authentication prevents cyber attacks,” CISA Director, Jen Easterly said. “Yet only a small percentage of people are using it.”</p>



<p>Easterly emphasized that CISA is aggressively pursuing multiple initiatives to help spur adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and more specifically FIDO standards-based strong authentication.</p>


 
 


<p>“We’re using this opportunity to shine the spotlight on FIDO as the gold standard for MFA and the only widely available phishing resistant authentication method.”</p>



<p>Bob Lord, senior technical advisor, cybersecurity division at CISA, told the Authenticate 2022 audience that it is a weird thing that the technology industry has normalized the idea that the burden of staying safe is placed on those organizations that are least able to understand things like threat landscapes.</p>



<p>“We see far too many organizations failing in part because they have no idea they need to do this,” Lord said about strong authentication and FIDO adoption. “And that’s because they don’t have something that is nudging them in the right direction.”</p>



<p>Both Lord and Easterly advocated for technology vendors to make it easier for users to have strong authentication and provide security by default.</p>



<p>“Security features our customer rights, they’re not luxury goods,” Lord said.</p>



<p>FIDO Authentication has social impact</p>


 
 


<p>Jonathan Bellack, senior director, identity and counter-abuse technology at Google outlined some of the challenges that Google has seen for users adopting MFA and passwordless security.</p>



<p>“Our user research has shown at least from a consumer point of view, users don’t draw a distinction between any of the words we use in the industry like security, privacy, abuse as it all just kind of fits into this great amorphous blob of safety,” Bellack said.</p>


 
 


<p>He noted that consumers have very little time and they just want to know if they can do whatever task they want or need to complete online. To that end, Bellack detailed multiple efforts that Google has underway to embed security in a way that doesn’t introduce friction.</p>



<p>Christopher Harrell, CTO at Yubico, explained during his session how the use of FIDO authentication is being used by organizations around the world to help protect freedom and privacy. Yubico is working with the Freedom of the Press Foundation and Operation Safe Escape among other organizations. The company has donated over 20,000 keys to support many different government agencies in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do hope that the war ends soon but in the interim, we hope that we can help protect infrastructure from cyber attacks,” Harrell said.</p>



<p>FIDO users detail adoption challenges and opportunities</p>


 
 


<p>A key part of the program for Authenticate 2022 are user stories and there were plenty to be told on the first day of the conference.</p>



<p>Ian Glazer, SVP product management at Salesforce, described the highs and the lows of his company’s MFA adoption efforts. Salesforce decided in the fall of 2019 that it wanted to achieve 100% adoption of MFA across its services and it’s a journey the company has been on ever since.</p>



<p>Salesforce’s path toward 100% MFA adoption involved both technical considerations as well as a massive effort to engage with users, which led to solid results. Glazer noted that at the end of Salesforce’s fiscal year approximately 80% of its monthly active users were using MFA or SSO. While 80% is a noticeable achievement, it’s not the 100% goal that Salesforce has set. Glazer emphasized that the pursuit of the 100% adoption figure forces his team to continue to innovate and find ways to push adoption.</p>



<p>Salesforce has noticed multiple benefits from MFA adoption so far, including cost reduction and security improvements.</p>


 
 


<p>“Because we adopted MFA, we have seen a dramatic reduction in account takeovers,” Glazer said.</p>



<p>Microsoft is also pushing hard for broad adoption as it aims to enable a passwordless experience for its users. Scott Bingham, Senior Program Manager in Identity, and Emily Houlihan, Senior Product Manager at Microsoft, explained in their session what lessons have learned so far on their passwordless journey.</p>



<p>Bingham said that Microsoft has spent years rolling out support for temporary one time passwords, security keys, authenticator apps and Windows Hello as different password replacement offerings. Microsoft is increasingly moving toward eliminating passwords entirely.</p>



<p>“People want passwordless,” Bingham said. “Security is important, but user experience is critical and helps to drive demand.”</p>


 
 


<p>USAA, which provides financial services to members of the U.S. military and veterans, is also adopting FIDO and MFA to help secure its users. Dereck Henson, technical security architect at USAA, provided a series of key lessons learned during his session.</p>



<p>His first lesson learned is that it’s a good idea to default to strong authentication from the start.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We found that it’s a whole lot easier to start someone in an MFA, highly secured program, rather than to convince them to change their mind later,” Henson said.</p>



<p>Another key lesson that USAA has learned is that when it comes to a passwordless approach, being entirely passive and not showing users that authentication in place, is not a winning scenario. Henson said that USAA members were calling in saying they had been members for decades and couldn’t believe they could just log in with a fingerprint. To that end, USAA has had to add some interstitial screens to its authentication workflow that tell users their access is being secured.</p>



<p>“So not only do you have to be secure, you have to actually look secure,” he said.</p>



<p>Financial service giant Citi has also embraced the FIDO strong authentication approach. Matthew Nunn, Director, Secure Authentication Architecture &amp; Technology Engineering at Citi, did not mince words in his session about why there is a need to move away from passwords.</p>


 
 


<p>Nunn said that there really isn’t a meaningful way to make passwords more secure.</p>



<p>“The reason you’re doing passwords and we’ve been doing it for so long is because we are held hostage to the keyboard being the interface to use in order to interact with the system,” Nunn said.</p>



<p>He added that with passwordless, users are no longer held hostage and there is the ability to take advantage of capabilities in devices to authenticate, instead of users needing to regurgitate a password.</p>



<p>Day 2 of Authenticate 2022 is looking to be another packed day full of insightful content and discussion, with sessions on biometrics, consumer authentication habits, FIDO initiatives and more user sessions.Want to attend the next two days of Authenticate 2022?

<p>By: FIDO Staff</p>



<p>The second day of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.authenticatecon.com/">Authenticate 2022</a>&nbsp;conference had a mix of topics and speakers that spanned multiple facets of the authentication world including payment security, biometrics, national identity and design systems.</p>



<p>The day got started with a keynote from Doug Fisher, senior director at Visa, who discussed the current state of the global payments system and the challenges it faces. Fisher noted that while ecommerce fraud remains a pervasive risk, strong online authentication is helpful to help reduce that fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A challenge for stronger forms of authentication for ecommerce is often that it introduces more friction into the consumer buying process, which can lead to shopping cart abandonment. To help solve that issue, Fisher explained that the FIDO Alliance, EMVCo and the W3C have been working together to help improve interoperability in a bid to reduce payment authentication friction. The joint effort had led to the Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) standard that is currently in development</p>



<p>“SPC is a web standard currently in development that is built on WebAuthn to support streamlined authentication during a paymen</p>



<p>t transaction,” Fisher said. “SPC and FIDO go together like peanut butter and jelly.”</p>



<p>The perils of MFA</p>



<p>Not all multi-factor authentication (MFA) technologies are equal was the primary message in a session led by Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4.</p>


 
 


<p>Grimes outlined a litany of MFA bypass techniques that could potentially enable attackers to exploit vulnerable users. He emphasized however that FIDO based strong authentication is unlike MFA in that it can help to eliminate many of the man-in-the-middle attacks that enable bypassing techniques.</p>



<p>“MFA attacks have been around for decades but it certainly is going mainstream this year,” Grimes said.</p>



<p>The risks of non-FIDO MFA is top of mind for Heikki Palm Henriksen, CTO of BankID.</p>


 
 


<p>Henriksen’s organization provides a digital identification that is widely used in Norway. BankID started to look at FIDO in 2020 and discovered the insightful white papers produced by the alliance which helped Henriksen and his team to choose FIDO and begin implementation.</p>



<p>“We realized that FIDO2 was the best solution to modernize BankID to reach our goals,” Henriksen said.</p>



<p>Biometric considerations for FIDO</p>


 
 


<p>Strong authentication can make use of biometrics such as a fingerprint reader or facial recognition system, as an authenticator.</p>



<p>Biometric systems however are not universally without fault or bias, which is an issue that was discussed by Stephanie Schuckers, director, Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) at Clarkson University.</p>



<p>“When we talk about bias related to biometrics, what we’re really talking about is variability in performance due to demographics or demographic differentials,” she said.</p>



<p>Shuckers emphasized that bias relates to the specific technology implementation being used, not the whole field of biometric recognition. Through testing and certification, it is possible to better understand and reduce the risk of potential bias.</p>



<p>Greg Cannon, principal AI/ML standards at Amazon joined Schuckers for a panel session, emphasizing that the goal is to help eliminate passwords and biometrics is a great technology for doing that.</p>



<p>To help illustrate the point that biometrics spoofing is a concern that testing can help to solve, Shuckers brought some props on stage, including a mask of her own face, which apparently did not fool the facial detection system on her phone.</p>



<p>Consumer authentication habits</p>



<p>Understanding how users view authentication is an important aspect of understanding what needs to be done to help improve adoption.</p>


 
 


<p>The FIDO Alliance conducts an annual survey that looks at consumer habits for trends and adoption of authentication technologies. Megan Shamas, senior director of marketing at FIDO Alliance, said that the 2022 survey shows users are in some respects entering their passwords less than prior years, though the data is far from being definitive.</p>



<p>Perception of biometrics is also re-assuring as a potential way to help eliminate the use of passwords.</p>



<p>“We have actually been very pleased with consumer sentiment towards biometrics,” Shamas said. “In fact, a lot of consumers that we surveyed find it to be the most secure way to log in.”</p>



<p>Helping to reduce remote authentication fraud</p>


 
 


<p>Marianne Crowe, vice president, secure payments innovation and research at Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, used her time on stage to ask for more cooperation across the authentication ecosystem to help secure against fraud.</p>



<p>Crowe noted that there is consumer fatigue with passwords and many users will just reuse the same passwords on multiple sites which is an unsafe practice. MFA is helpful, but she noted that it is often inconsistent today in how it is presented to consumers.</p>



<p>“We’ve got to try to increase implementation and adoption of MFA even in industries and businesses that aren’t required to do it,” Crowe said.</p>



<p>Design system comes to FIDO</p>



<p>One of the ways consistency can come to authentication and specifically to FIDO based strong authentication is with the use of a design system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations can now benefit from the FIDO design system at&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/design-system">fidoalliance.org/design-system</a>&nbsp;that provides principles, patterns and reusable components.</p>


 
 


<p>“Our intention for putting all this together is to make FIDO deployments simpler and faster for product designers, for project managers, product managers and engineers,” Kevin Goldman, chief experience officer at Trusona, said. “Our intention is to fill the gaps that they might have around authentication in their own design systems.”</p>



<p>The final day of Authenticate 2022 is looking to be another day loaded with useful content, thoughtful discussion, more user stories and best practices to help organizations move to the passwordless future.Want to attend the final day of Authenticate 2022?

 A simple moderation process <p>We’ve been moderators in various communities across the web and IRL. Great moderators interest themselves for healthy, positive, vibrant Community of Practice. After all, being a moderator is an important community role. It influences the culture within a community!</p><p>In this post, we generalise our facilitation approach in online Communities of Practice (and share some classic gifs). We follow these steps to find pockets of activity and be responsive to community members.</p><a href="https://whimsical.com/moderator-8oUgMCEHwqMRKf7rWhG2KT">How to become a KBW moderator</a> 0. Schedule time for moderation <p>We’ve often come across organisations or projects that try to do community moderation on the fly. Others say “everyone on Team X is a moderator”, but don’t allow for time to actually do the moderation. Lots of people think that moderation is something that just “happens”. It’s not, moderation needs designated time. Schedule at least a half an hour each week to run through your moderation process. Your community will be a lot more engaged for&nbsp;it!</p> 1. Check for new introductions <p>Every community should have a place for people to introduce themselves. Whether a forum thread or an #introduction Slack channel, this space helps community members get to know each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Provide a prompt to help people introduce themselves. In the Keep Badges Weird community, we ask people to tell the community why they’ve joined and a “weird” tidbit or fact. We check for new introductions and reply to people once they’ve written about themselves. The “weird” tidbit provides for some very interesting initial conversations. Oh, and we issue a badge once people have introduced themselves too!</p> 2. Check for new&nbsp;members <p>The introduction thread or channel is also a great place to keep track of new members who have joined the community. Depending on where your community is organised, you might also have the ability to see when people join or sign up. The Keep Badges Weird community is on the <a href="https://www.participate.com/">Participate platform</a>, so moderators can easily see when new folks have joined. We’ve set our notifications to let us&nbsp;know!</p><p>Whenever a new member joins your community, take a moment to reach out and welcome them. We send direct messages and ask people to introduce themselves. We’ve written about how important personal invitations are in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/quick-wins-to-improve-your-open-source-communitys-architecture-of-participation-9d0e6c8d60fe">quick wins to improve participation</a>.</p> 3. Check for comments and&nbsp;shares <p>Discussions and comment threads might be a bit more sporadic then introductions. Check your community forum and channels for any new discussions, questions or comments. If you have ways for people to submit resources or ideas, you’ll want to check those&nbsp;too!</p><p>Use “follow” or “track” functions to allow you to watch discussions so that you don’t miss new messages. People need timely and relevant feedback. It can be disheartening if someone doesn’t receive an answer. Great moderators do their best to make sure that conversations keep&nbsp;moving.</p> 4. Check for event&nbsp;updates <p>A successful community will have regular events and activities. Get into a habit to make sure the community events calendar is up-to-date. Activities grow as communities do! Setting the habit in the beginning means you’ll have updated information when a lot more of it is flowing at you. It seems simple, but outdated links or text often make it impossible for people to take part in&nbsp;events.</p> 5. Post regularly <p>There are a lot of different types of content and one or another might work better for your community. Experiment with various formats and ask people for feedback. Share different kinds of information and share early and often. Make a schedule, though, and post on a regular basis. People will get used to seeing moderator posts, and they’ll know that there is momentum in the community.</p><p>Moderation is both a science and an art. There are practical tactics and processes you can use to increase participation. There are empathetic behaviours need to help community members feel like they belong. Both are essential for building communities.

<p>Kia ora e te whānau<br><br>As signalled in last month’s newsletter,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/10/DINZ-Submission_OPC-Consultation-on-Biometrics_4-October-2022-1.pdf">DINZ’s submission</a>&nbsp;to<a href="https://privacy.org.nz/news/consultations/use-of-biometric-information-in-aotearoa-new-zealand/">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/assets/New-order/News/Consultations/Privacy-regulation-of-biometrics-in-Aotearoa-New-Zealand.pdf">the Office of the Privacy Commissioner’s consultation paper on Biometrics&nbsp;</a>did proceed to plan, and we were grateful to receive OPC’s thanks and acknowledgement of the work put in by our special interest group of DINZ members. Read and note our conclusions as to the adequacy of the Privacy Act in the field of biometrics, the challenge of the limited scope of OPC’s mandate and the need for more structured guidance and targeted compliance before defaulting to all-encompassing legislative intervention – perhaps preemptively.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As biometrics continues to dominate domestic headlines in the context of law enforcement, I am reminded of Ann Cavoukian’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf">7 principles of Privacy by Design</a>, notably Principle 4; ‘Full Functionality — Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum. Privacy by Design seeks to accommodate all legitimate interests and objectives in a positive-sum “win-win” manner, not through a dated, zero-sum approach, where unnecessary trade-offs are made. Privacy by Design avoids the pretense of false dichotomies, such as privacy vs. security, demonstrating that it is possible to have both’. Let’s be honest. It’s not always easy to achieve, but if a combination of actions and processes that derive from the 7 principles (or others such as those IPPs in the Privacy Act) can be agreed upon and transparently operated, the right balance can be found. That is what we expectantly hope for as the parties work it out – as I’m confident they will.<br><br>The other great piece of mahi emerging from DINZ over the past month is this&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/10/DINZ-Inclusive-and-Ethical-Use-of-Digital-Identity-1.pdf">Research and Discussion Paper</a>&nbsp;produced by the leads of the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/inclusive-and-ethical-uses-of-digital-identity/">Inclusive and Ethical Uses of Digital Identity working group</a>. Its purpose is to set a baseline from which the real mahi of this member group can build from. The topic area has a range of interwoven themes involving policy, society and culture and the group is keen to target one or more aspects where the development of good practice can positively impact outcomes. If it was easy other groups would have resolved it by now! So please&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/10/DINZ-Inclusive-and-Ethical-Use-of-Digital-Identity-1.pdf">read the paper</a>&nbsp;and feed back your comments and interest in participating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As with all significant mahi produced in the past year, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/submissions/">Our Work</a>&nbsp;on our website and browse.<br><br>Lastly, watch out for a slew of Event announcements coming soon. The report that integrates DINZ’s general public and business attitudinal research results into the landscape in which digital identity operates in Aotearoa, is nearly complete.

<p>FIDO Alliance’s second annual Online Authentication Barometer reveals the habits, trends and adoption of authentication technologies</p>



<p>Summary of key findings:</p>



  Entering passwords has dropped globally&nbsp;– by 5% – 9% across all use-cases tracked, as people adopt more convenient ways of logging in.  Yet passwords are still the most-used authentication method and they are proving costly to service providers&nbsp;– 59% of people gave up on accessing online services and 43% abandoned purchases in a given month.  The use of SMS OTPs has increased globally&nbsp;–&nbsp;by 1% – 4% as it is increasingly offered by service providers as a multi-factor authentication method.  Businesses need a way to offer people the convenience they want without sacrificing security&nbsp;– passkeys is one new approach and is on the radars of 48% of 18-34 year-olds.  The metaverse has gained traction yet phishable authentication dominates despite security concerns&nbsp;– 61% of metaverse users are concerned over their security and privacy yet 38% use a password.  



<p>SEATTLE, WA, October 18, 2022&nbsp;— The&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a>&nbsp;today published its second annual&nbsp;<a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Authenticate-2022-Barometer-Report.pdf">Online Authentication Barometer</a>, which gathers insights into the state of online authentication in 10 countries across the globe. New to the Barometer this year, the FIDO Alliance has begun tracking authentication in the metaverse, and plans to incorporate utilization of technologies like passkeys in future editions of the report.</p>



<p>Key findings</p>



<p>The 2022 Online Authentication Barometer has identified that entering passwords online has dropped by 5% – 9% across all five major use-cases that it tracks – including accessing financial services, work computers and accounts, social media, streaming services, and smart home devices – compared to last year.</p>



<p>Despite this, passwords remain the dominant form of online authentication and cause major issues for people and businesses. For example, 70% of people had to recover a password at least once in a given month. Service providers and retailers also were impacted, with 59% of people giving up on accessing online services in a given month and 43% abandoning purchases because they couldn’t remember their password.</p>



<p>Data from the Barometer also suggests these issues with remembering and entering passwords are leading more people to stay logged into accounts, rising by 5% – 11% across all use-cases, as people opt for greater convenience. Other notable trends include multi-factor authentication through SMS One-Time Passcodes (OTPs) rising between 1% – 4% across all use-cases, as this legacy form of second-factor authentication is increasingly offered by service providers to rapidly improve consumer security and to meet regulatory requirements.</p>



<p>“This year’s Barometer data reveals that people see entering passwords as a pain and avoid it when they can,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “Service providers realize the inconvenience and security issues with passwords and are offering more ways to authenticate such as cookies to stay logged in and/or legacy MFA like SMS OTPs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar added: “However, these attempts at convenience and security are still based on outdated and phishable authentication technologies that everyone needs to move away from if we are ever going to stop the constant onslaught of data breaches. Organizations should all have implementation of modern, phishing-resistant authentication on their roadmaps, whether it is via on-device biometrics, FIDO security keys or passkeys.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tracking emerging technologies</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance’s Online Authentication Barometer is designed to track habits, trends and adoption across key use-cases, including new technologies and use-cases as they are adopted. This year, it began tracking the metaverse as one of its key online use-cases. The Barometer also sampled early insights into passkeys, which are FIDO credentials designed to replace passwords that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps.</p>



<p>Almost a third of people (31%) have logged into the metaverse recently, with 61% concerned over their security and privacy. Despite this, phishable authentication methods dominate with 38% of people logging in with passwords, 24% using password plus OTPs, and 21% remaining logged in. Other, more secure, possession-based methods like biometrics (26%) and physical security keys (16%) are also prevalent.</p>



<p>Passkeys, which provide secure and convenient passwordless sign-ins to online services, appear to&nbsp;</p>



<p>have a high level of awareness, despite only being announced this year. The data shows that 39% of people are familiar with the concept of passkeys – and this is especially high among 18-34 year-olds at 48%. FIDO’s Online Authentication Barometer will track the adoption of passkeys in next year’s report and determine how far this early awareness translates into usage.</p>



<p>Ends</p>



<p>Notes to editors:</p>



  Research for the FIDO Alliance’s Online Authentication Barometer was conducted by Sapio Research among 10,044 consumers across the UK, France, Germany, US, Australia, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, India and China.

Service providers and retailers also were impacted, with 59% of people giving up on accessing online services in a given month and 43% abandoning purchases because they couldn’t remember their password.</p>



<p>Data from the Barometer also suggests these issues with remembering and entering passwords are leading more people to stay logged into accounts, rising by 5% – 11% across all use-cases, as people opt for greater convenience. Other notable trends include multi-factor authentication through SMS One-Time Passcodes (OTPs) rising between 1% – 4% across all use-cases, as this legacy form of second-factor authentication is increasingly offered by service providers to rapidly improve consumer security and to meet regulatory requirements.</p>



<p>“This year’s Barometer data reveals that people see entering passwords as a pain and avoid it when they can,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “Service providers realize the inconvenience and security issues with passwords and are offering more ways to authenticate such as cookies to stay logged in and/or legacy MFA like SMS OTPs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar added: “However, these attempts at convenience and security are still based on outdated and phishable authentication technologies that everyone needs to move away from if we are ever going to stop the constant onslaught of data breaches. Organizations should all have implementation of modern, phishing-resistant authentication on their roadmaps, whether it is via on-device biometrics, FIDO security keys or passkeys.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tracking emerging technologies</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance’s Online Authentication Barometer is designed to track habits, trends and adoption across key use-cases, including new technologies and use-cases as they are adopted. This year, it began tracking the metaverse as one of its key online use-cases. The Barometer also sampled early insights into passkeys, which are FIDO credentials designed to replace passwords that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps.</p>



<p>Almost a third of people (31%) have logged into the metaverse recently, with 61% concerned over their security and privacy. Despite this, phishable authentication methods dominate with 38% of people logging in with passwords, 24% using password plus OTPs, and 21% remaining logged in. Other, more secure, possession-based methods like biometrics (26%) and physical security keys (16%) are also prevalent.</p>



<p>Passkeys, which provide secure and convenient passwordless sign-ins to online services, appear to&nbsp;</p>



<p>have a high level of awareness, despite only being announced this year. The data shows that 39% of people are familiar with the concept of passkeys – and this is especially high among 18-34 year-olds at 48%. FIDO’s Online Authentication Barometer will track the adoption of passkeys in next year’s report and determine how far this early awareness translates into usage.</p>

<p>FIDO Alliance’s second annual Online Authentication Barometer reveals the habits, trends and adoption of authentication technologies</p>



<p>Summary of key findings:</p>



  Entering passwords has dropped globally – by 5% – 9% across all use-cases tracked, as people adopt more convenient ways of logging in.  Yet passwords are still the most-used authentication method and they are proving costly to service providers – 59% of people gave up on accessing online services and 43% abandoned purchases in a given month.  The use of SMS OTPs has increased globally – by 1% – 4% as it is increasingly offered by service providers as a multi-factor authentication method.  Businesses need a way to offer people the convenience they want without sacrificing security – passkeys is one new approach and is on the radars of 48% of 18-34 year-olds.  The metaverse has gained traction yet phishable authentication dominates despite security concerns – 61% of metaverse users are concerned over their security and privacy yet 38% use a password.  



<p>SEATTLE, WA, October 18, 2022 — The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> today published its second annual <a href="http://fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Authenticate-2022-Barometer-Report.pdf">Online Authentication Barometer</a>, which gathers insights into the state of online authentication in 10 countries across the globe. New to the Barometer this year, the FIDO Alliance has begun tracking authentication in the metaverse, and plans to incorporate utilization of technologies like passkeys in future editions of the report.</p>



<p>Key findings</p>



<p>The 2022 Online Authentication Barometer has identified that entering passwords online has dropped by 5% – 9% across all five major use-cases that it tracks – including accessing financial services, work computers and accounts, social media, streaming services, and smart home devices – compared to last year.</p>



<p>Despite this, passwords remain the dominant form of online authentication and cause major issues for people and businesses. For example, 70% of people had to recover a password at least once in a given month. Service providers and retailers also were impacted, with 59% of people giving up on accessing online services in a given month and 43% abandoning purchases because they couldn’t remember their password.</p>



<p>Data from the Barometer also suggests these issues with remembering and entering passwords are leading more people to stay logged into accounts, rising by 5% – 11% across all use-cases, as people opt for greater convenience. Other notable trends include multi-factor authentication through SMS One-Time Passcodes (OTPs) rising between 1% – 4% across all use-cases, as this legacy form of second-factor authentication is increasingly offered by service providers to rapidly improve consumer security and to meet regulatory requirements.</p>

<p>Key Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing Standards Put to the Test</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, USA, 18 October, 2022 – The OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti">Cyber Threat Intelligence Technical Committee</a> (CTI TC) conducted its first STIX 2.1 and TAXII 2.1 PlugFest, hosted by Peraton. Members of the CTI TC confirmed the multi-vendor interoperability of their CTI tools and verified their compliance with the STIX 2.1 and TAXII 2.1 Interoperability Test Documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2021/06/23/stix-v2-1-and-taxii-v2-1-oasis-standards-are-published/">STIX and TAXII standards</a> are widely used to prevent and defend against cyberattacks by enabling threat intelligence to be analyzed and shared among trusted partners and communities. The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti-interoperability">CTI TC Interoperability Subcommittee</a> (SC) helps guide adherence to CTI TC-promulgated standards and interoperability between CTI TC standards-based implementations, while encouraging standards maturity throughout the industry.</p>



<p>“The PlugFest was a collaborative, hybrid experience with both in-person and virtual attendees. It was a successful event, with levels of interoperability achieved among the participants,” said CTI TC Interoperability SC co-chair, Kartikey Desai, of MITRE. “Participants shared ideas about user interfaces and features while planning future opportunities for more efficient data creation and processing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This event brings visibility to the growing list of organizations that support interoperability adoption,” said Marlon Taylor of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (DHS CISA), who co-chairs the Interoperability SC with Desai. “We encourage any organization involved in CTI to collaborate with us and demonstrate their support for STIX and TAXII at future PlugFest events.”</p>



<p>“We have always given great importance to STIX2/TAXII2 interoperability testing and are fortunate to have participated in many PlugFest events over the years, ever since the very first PlugFest in 2018,” said Koji Yamada, Research Manager at Fujitsu System Integration Laboratories LTD. “In this year’s PlugFest, although we passed most interoperability tests, we have identified areas for future improvement. We strongly encourage all software vendors that use STIX 2.1 and TAXII 2.1 standards to participate in future PlugFest interoperability events.”</p>



<p>“Participation in PlugFest events shows vendor commitment to STIX and TAXII interoperability compliance,” said Marlon Taylor. “Standardizing the promotion of STIX and TAXII compliance would ease consumer evaluation of interoperable STIX and TAXII products.”</p>



<p>OASIS and the CTI TC’s Interoperability Subcommittee commends all participants for a successful event and is grateful to Peraton for hosting the PlugFest at their facility outside Washington, DC.</p>



<p>Any organization that is developing STIX 2.1/TAXII 2.1 capabilities is encouraged to get involved. Organizations interested in participating in the OASIS CTI TC Interoperability Subcommittee and future events should contact <a href="mailto:communications@oasis-open.org">communications@oasis-open.org</a>.</p>



<p>About STIX 2.1 and TAXII 2.1</p>



<p>Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) v2.1 and Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII) v2.1 are widely used to prevent and defend against cyberattacks by enabling threat intelligence to be analyzed and shared among trusted partners and communities. The STIX standard defines a JSON-based language for sharing structured threat intelligence in a consistent, machine-readable manner, allowing organizations to better protect against, detect, and respond to cyber threats. STIX v2.1 adds new objects and capabilities, enabling it to better describe the cyber threats we confront today, as well as future-proofing STIX via STIX Extensions. As a result, STIX v2.1 creates a solid and stable foundation for vendors and consumers alike to exchange actionable CTI.</p>



<p>The TAXII standard defines a transport protocol which supports the exchange of STIX data over Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). TAXII enables machine-to-machine sharing of CTI by defining an API that supports common sharing models used by industry and Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs).</p>

  <p>Geneva, Switzerland, October 2022&nbsp;<br></p><p>After releasing the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/dde-launch">Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) v1.0</a> architecture in July 2022, the Human Colossus Foundation announces the release of Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA). OCA enables “Objectual Integrity”, an essential DDE Principle of the DDE Trust Infrastructure’s Semantic Layer, by providing an interoperable solution for data capture and exchange, agnostic to existing data models and representation formats. The release includes the launch of the <a href="https://oca.colossi.network/">OCA website</a>, which hosts the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/s/HCF-Overlays-Capture-Architecture-OCA-v1.pdf">OCA v1.0 specification</a> and <a href="https://oca.colossi.network/ecosystem/tour.html">reference implementation</a>, and the announcement of the Decentralised Semantics Working Group (DSWG), the formal governing body for further developing the official OCA specification.</p><p>Paul Knowles, a Co-Founder and the Head of the Advisory Council of the Foundation, is the architect of an entirely new data domain, Decentralised Semantics. His conceptual modelling of this new domain led to the invention of OCA, which provides a data harmonisation solution within and across distributed data ecosystems to ensure the objectual integrity of any digital object and its relationships with other objects. OCA facilitates semantic interoperability and privacy-compliant data sharing throughout any DDE-compliant ecosystem, offering a comprehensive solution for defining deterministic metadata, structuring digital objects, and harmonising data payloads.</p><blockquote><p>"OCA is a core utility architecture for capturing the metadata necessary to interpret and preserve the meaning of inputted data. ‘Characters’ provide the essential elements required for written language in the physical world. In the digital world, stored sequences of bytes known as ‘data’ represent these elements. However, without a system of interpretation, data has no inherent morphological, definitional, or contextual meaning. OCA enables this interpretation by providing an architecture to capture the ‘metadata’, sets of data that provide meaning to any stored sequence of bytes. In addition, OCA introduces a comprehensive solution to support data validation, transformation, and presentation requirements throughout a data lifecycle.&nbsp;</p><p>Before co-founding the Human Colossus Foundation, my previous life was as a "data wrangler" in the pharmaceutical industry, repeatedly encountering data aggregation issues when working with supposedly "clean data" supplied by my colleagues in data management. So, after 20 years as a statistical programmer, I took the plunge and transitioned to the sharp end of data capture as a data architect. From that new vantage point, I gained valuable insights into the cause of many of the data aggregation issues I had encountered further upstream, which continued to cost the company millions of dollars daily. I also found that I was in an influential position to improve the company's internal semantic architectural design initiatives.</p><p>So, four years later, after bidding farewell to that esteemed position as a corporate data architect with nothing more than a conceptual draft of a layered architecture for data capture written in the back of my notebook, I'm excited to announce the rollout of OCA as a global solution for data harmonisation at scale. What a journey it has been. I look forward to our continued journey together to take OCA to the next level of technical maturity while helping many of you resolve data harmonisation issues with OCA and the supportive tooling we are developing at the Foundation."</p><p>- Paul Knowles, Co-Founder and the Head of the Advisory Council of the Foundation</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Decentralised Semantics and OCA</p><p>Data Semantics is the study of the meaning and use of data in any digital environment that focuses on how a data object represents a concept or object in the real world. Decentralised Semantics is an emergent domain that provides enhanced data modelling for an evolving data-agile economy comprising distributed data ecosystems where harmonisation between competing standards is essential for data object comprehension in any bilateral exchange.</p><p>This new data domain recognises the reality of standardisation complexities in an ever-evolving digital landscape of peer-to-peer interactions not addressed today; examples of gaps include inaccurate use of data due to its misinterpretation at the point of exchange. In other words, upstream data comprehension erodes without well-defined metadata at the start of the data lifecycle. Therefore, the harmonisation process must occur at the earliest stage of the life cycle, the point of initial data capture, where its contextual meaning is fresh and more manageable than further upstream.&nbsp;</p><p>It is critical to double down on investments in Decentralised Semantics, including supportive standards and tools, because by most estimates, unstructured data accounts for at least 80-90% of the digital data universe and current solutions often disregard the data harmonisation process, leaving no guarantee of the data's objectual integrity throughout a given lifecycle. We invented OCA to offer a comprehensive solution for data harmonisation at the Semantic Layer (Layer 1 in the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f2893465394d4b829661bc/1660062007339/HCF+DDE+Trust+Infrastructure+Stack+v1.0.0.pdf">DDE Trust Infrastructure Stack</a>) so that machines and people can precisely understand the intended use of accurate data in the correct context across distributed data ecosystems.</p><p></p><p>Explaining OCA through a Use Case 	</p><p>Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) marks a new paradigm shift in “Objectual Integrity”, with "Overlays" providing the necessary separation of granular tasks to enable seamless semantic interoperability across sectoral and jurisdictional boundaries. An "OCA bundle" consists of a "Capture Base" and "Overlays", which in amalgamation, represent a contextually-rich schema.</p>

<p>This separation of tasks into task-specific objects facilitates the core pillars of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">FAIR Guiding Principles</a>, where all objects should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) for machines and people. In addition, the granular separation of semantic “overlays'' enables distributed custodianship of specific objects within a bundle where the responsibility of separate tasks can reside with different actors without compromising the objectual integrity of the overall semantic structure. As a result, actors from various institutions can contribute to defining schemas for complex use cases, supply chains, and data flows supported by multi-stakeholder data governance administrations and frameworks.</p><p>Take Switzerland as an example, a quadrilingual country with German, French, Italian, and Romansh as its national languages and many other minority languages, such as English, becoming increasingly important. The Swiss Constitution Article 70 lets the sovereign cantons define their official language to preserve linguistic harmony in their jurisdiction. The Swiss federal government would enable a collaborative solution to internationalisation by using OCA to separate language-specific overlays from any capture bases and core language-agnostic overlays issued by the federal government. Different cantons will be able to control and maintain their sets of language-specific overlays depending on their primary spoken language. In other words, distributed custodianship of language-specific overlays would enable regional authorities to manage the official translation of any document issued by a national federal government into their region’s official language(s).</p>

   A Digital ID Handbook is a tool for anyone who is confronting a national digital ID system and in search of strategies for organising around it. 
The post Digital IDs rooted in justice – APGT and TER present A Digital ID Handbook for civil society first appeared on The Engine Room.

<p>A few months ago, we published the findings of our research on <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/community-call-digital-ids-rooted-in-justice/" title="">civil society advocacy on digital ID systems across the globe</a>. For this project, we spent a year working with a team of researchers in four countries (Indonesia, Jamaica, Pakistan, and Uganda), looking at how organised civil society actors seek to shape the design, implementation and oversight of digital ID systems, so as to mitigate or eliminate potential harms to vulnerable populations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of our main findings was the fact that, when it comes to digital ID systems, civil society actors have been pushed to work reactively, rather than proactively. We saw that groups were more often pushing for change within problematic proposals and systems, rather than being able to proactively advocate for a system that could meet the needs their communities actually face. In other words, civil society has been grappling with the impact and harms of digital ID systems as they are implemented, and not having the time or space to envision alternative frameworks for identification systems that put people’s needs and wants first. Throughout the research, justice was articulated by these actors as access – to better registration processes and to the services these IDs serve as barriers towards. And while access is crucial, as actors are reacting to material conditions on the ground, our research got us thinking that civil society, especially groups that represent and advocate for the most marginalised populations, could be leading the process of shaping digital ID systems that are rooted in justice for their contexts.</p>



<p>With that in mind, we partnered with <a href="https://www.peoplesguidetotech.com/" title="">A People’s Guide to Tech</a> to develop A Digital ID Handbook for civil society, a resource based on our research and APGT’s wealth of experience in popular education and in translating complex concepts into accessible information. </p>


 
<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/A-digital-ID-handbook-APGT-The-Engine-Room-2022.pdf"></a>A digital ID handbook: strategies for navigating electronic identification systems 


<p>In the handbook, you will find a primer on digital ID systems, along with activities to support civil society organisations in developing their advocacy strategies for dealing with digital ID implementation and to exercise their ability to visualise what digital ID systems grounded in justice could look like. We hope this resource will be useful to civil society organisations and activists interested in learning more about digital ID and designing their own strategies for addressing these systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The guide is available for download <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/A-digital-ID-handbook-APGT-The-Engine-Room-2022.pdf" title="here">here</a> and at <a href="https://www.peoplesguidetotech.com/" title="">peoplesguidetotech.org</a>.</p>

 From data to assets — gateway to the knowledge economy <p>The upcoming new version 6 of OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) is introducing a paradigm shift to the OriginTrail ecosystem and marks the beginning of a new era. Until now, OriginTrail network delivered key enhancements to the world of decentralized data (such as integrity, interoperability and interconnectedness). With the new version, we are making the leap from exchanging data to creating assets from the data. This is possible with features of discoverability, verifiability and ownership of assets on the DKG representing anything in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsCUigu39Hw">physical and digital&nbsp;world</a>.</p><p>The new paradigm enables anyone to create DKG assets and own their connected “real estate” in the global Web3 graph, enabling a plethora of applications previously impossible due to lack of true data ownership primitives on the internet. The new functionality takes nothing away from the original value propositions but rather upgrades them with ownership, the OriginTrail technology and TRAC tokenomics need to be upgraded as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Before jumping into the tokenomics, let’s take a closer look at what the core building blocks — DKG assets — are from the perspective of DKG and how they influence the TRAC tokenomics. Assets consist of 4 components implemented across two network&nbsp;layers:</p>  The DKG layer hosts the asset graph state (1) in semantic form (RDF), identified by a new Web3 primitive — the Uniform Asset Locator (UAL) (2). Similar to how Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) made it possible to reference an object (e.g. a website or document) in Web2, UALs make it possible to reference anything physical or digital, in Web3. UALs extend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">existing web URI standards</a>, revolutionizing URLs as their counterparts in Web2. A UAL also inherits capabilities described in the W3C recommendation on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). The UAL format (to be formally specified in further documents) therefore is in the following standardized form:<br> <br>dkg: [// DID] / UAI [“?” query] [“#” fragment]  The Blockchain layer is responsible for maintaining asset ownership record and asset graph state verifiability proofs. Information about ownership is kept in the form of an ERC 721 compatible Non Fungible Token (3). This allows us to tie DKG and blockchain layers even more closely together and enable ownership to be transferable in the form of NFT token transfer. State commit proofs (4) are used to verify that the asset graphs DKG nodes persist are available, haven’t been deleted or in any form tampered with, as well as enabling complex verifiable presentation implementations (according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a>).   Moving from data bundles to unique&nbsp;assets <p>The introduction of DKG assets is expected to induce an update of existing applications built on OriginTrail significantly, as previously bundled publishings (being just “data”) now get “unbundled” and packaged into unique assets, each published with their own asset graphs and UALs for referencing. In versions prior to v6, publishers would publish bundled “data dumps” in consolidated form actually containing information on sometimes hundreds or even thousands of actual physical objects — each of which in v6 is expected to become a uniquely published DKG asset with its own UAL as a verifiable, ownable identifier. Bundling can still be performed if needed by the asset publisher however — builders and developers now have more freedom to create different solutions on the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>Assets can be continuously updated by their owners with new (immutable) assertions, allowing assets to increase their asset graph and their value. Assets also act as building blocks — they can be connected to other assets, be indexed in various ways (for search) and extended in many ways to improve the discoverability of the&nbsp;asset.</p> DKG as a Multi-chain Decentralized Knowledge Graph <p>OriginTrail technology is a system of 3 logical layers. The top layer is the application layer where web and mobile applications reside with their interfaces, backends and connectors to the DKG. Sitting below the applications we find OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph as layer 2. It consists of the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN), a permissionless network of nodes that are maintaining a distributed knowledge graph of assets. Finally the consensus layer (layer 1) is implemented via blockchain enabling trusted interactions needed for the OriginTrail protocol. Since inception, the DKG was designed to enable multiple blockchains to support a single DKG. This design was for the first time implemented in 2021 when the DKG became multichain and leveraged the many efficiency gains this unlocked which led to over 10-fold jump in its adoption. After the initial Ethereum deployment, we have seen both Gnosis and Polygon blockchains get integrated with the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>After successfully obtaining <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/google-for-web3-specific-blockchain-origintrail-parachain-launches-today-heres-what-s-next-9a0d92bb72ef?source=collection_home---4------6-----------------------">the parachain slot on the Polkadot network earlier this year</a>, OriginTrail will now also receive a tailored blockchain layer network in the OriginTrail Parachain, allowing for yet another jump in its overall capabilities. This is particularly important for the OT-RFC-14 as the DKG v6 will have its inaugural launch on the OriginTrail Parachain. The OriginTrail Parachain and OriginTrail v6 DKG integration is effectively starting with the <a href="https://teleport.origintrail.io/">Teleporting process</a> to bring TRAC tokens from Ethereum to OriginTrail Parachain (explained in OT-RFC-12 and OT-RFC-13). The TRAC holders participating in the Teleport will also be the first to engage with the OriginTrail v6 and its new tokenomics presented below.</p> Guidelines to TRAC tokenomics <p>The OT-RFC-14 document is serving as a foundational piece upon which the first implementation of TRAC tokenomics in the v6 of OriginTrail DKG will be done. As with all TRAC tokenomics so far, the latest version is equally molded to support the adoption of the OriginTrail DKG, however this is the first time it takes full advantage of the upcoming OriginTrail DKG v6. When assessing the various aspects of TRAC tokenomics it’s important to keep a few high-level goals in mind, as they guide us to growing the ecosystem:</p>  Ease of use — asset publishers are the core users of the OriginTrail DKG and in order to allow them to engage with OriginTrail technology, it should be reasonably easy to&nbsp;use.  Cost efficiency — allow the market to achieve attractive prices by not wasting resources.  DKG node rewards — allow DKG nodes to get compensated for providing useful services to the network. By enabling an efficient market for the “supply side” of the DKG network, infrastructure runners can get fairly compensated.  Quality of service — ensure that applications querying the DKG (asset consumers) benefit from a high quality&nbsp;service.  Scalability of network activity — implement a system that has capacity to support the rising levels of adoption.  Decentralization — as a core consideration in any implementation and tokenomics decision, avoiding system control by any single&nbsp;party.   TRAC tokenomics stakeholders <p>The TRAC tokenomics stakeholders can be described through 4 system&nbsp;roles:</p>  DKG asset publishers are agents which create and manage knowledge graph entities (assets) by publishing asset graphs to the DKG according to the OriginTrail Protocol  DKG asset consumers are agents who discover, query and consume the DKG asset graphs created and owned by DKG asset publishers  DKG node runners, who run and maintain the DKG infrastructure nodes, providing the DKG&nbsp;services  TRAC Token holders, who participate in the ecosystem by providing economic support for system activities  <p>The roles indicated above however do not need to be distinct — one ecosystem actor can hold different roles at the same time. For example, DKG node runners are by definition also TRAC token holders as TRAC tokens are necessary for running DKG&nbsp;nodes.</p> DKG node&nbsp;services <p>The OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) natively operates on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN) which represents a permissionless decentralized system of nodes communicating according to OriginTrail protocol. Anyone with sufficient technical knowledge is able to run an OriginTrail DKG node and contribute to the system by doing so. By design, the DKG nodes receive compensation for the network services provided in the form of TRAC&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>The DKG nodes are able to perform various different activities, specified by OriginTrail core protocol operations or through extensions. On the network level we can categorize these activities into two&nbsp;groups:</p>  Publishing protocols, which introduce additional asset graphs into the DKG (equivalent to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_publishing">semantic web publishing</a>, or a database insert operations)  Querying protocols, which enable asset discovery through network queries (equivalent to database query operations)  <p>In OriginTrail v6 we distinguish two generic types of DKG network&nbsp;nodes:</p>  full or service nodes which provide network services implementing full DKG protocol choreographies. Full nodes persist the public DKG state, make it available and execute semantic queries, in return for getting compensated in TRAC&nbsp;tokens.  light nodes which do not provide network services, rather act as network gateways. They are not responsible for persisting the public DKG state as they do not have such capability (don’t respond to publish requests, therefore don’t qualify for rewards). Light nodes are analogous to the notion of light clients in blockchain networks, eliminating the need for gateways such as RPC services with having direct access to the DKG&nbsp;.  <p>Full DKG nodes implement services to facilitate the publishing and querying choreographies. Nodes can generally implement a variety of such protocols, building on the core components: assertions, shards and service agreements.</p><p>Assertions present graph data entries into the system. They constitute asset (data) graphs coupled with corresponding on-chain state commit proofs. In a general sense, assertions are “data building blocks’’ which represent asset graph state, search index entries or any such data structure implemented on the OriginTrail DKG. In OriginTrail v6 graph assertions are natively modeled in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/">RDF (Resource Description Framework)</a>, therefore all tooling of the Semantic Web stack is interoperable with OriginTrail on the core level. Assertions can be versioned, and are expected to be further aligned with standards and recommendations, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/07/rch-wg-charter/#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20RDF,defining%20RDF%20Dataset%20Canonicalization%20algorithms.">the latest initiative led by Phil Archer of&nbsp;GS1</a>.</p><p>Assertion shards or replicas represent DKG entries positioned in the DKG index space (the index space is formed by all full nodes in the network), centered around a replica key, hosted by a number of DKG nodes. Specific groups of nodes in a replica are subsets of the DKG index space node “neighborhoods” (similar to distributed database shard concept), formed according to service agreements facilitated by the protocol. At any moment, one full node hosts a number of logical shards, and due to node id difference (different positions in the index space), different nodes are intended to host different pieces of the DKG. This mechanism achieves a randomized, yet highly organized, distribution of shards and data over the decentralized network.</p><p>Service agreements are defined on assertion level and incentivise availability for a particular set of assertion shards over a period of time. When service agreements no longer require assertion replicas or expire, the assertion replicas availability is no longer incentivized. For ease of implementation, service agreements are defined in terms of space quants, represented in bytes, and time quants called&nbsp;epochs.</p><p>Full DKG nodes receive assertions from asset publishers, form shards in qualifying neighborhoods hosting assertion replicas, which make assertion graphs available for querying during the service period. For these services, (full) nodes receive compensation in TRAC tokens. “Light” nodes enable interacting with the DKG (publishing, querying) without the capability of providing above mentioned services.</p> Publishing protocol choreography <p>The publishing protocol choreography is a coordinated activity between the publishers and DKG nodes whose goal is to form service agreements and establish assertion replicas on the DKG. Due to the decentralized nature of the system, the DKG nodes receive compensation for their services according to their defined service asks, expressed in TRAC tokens required for kb-epoch units. Using the publishing choreography of the DKG one can publish various different data structures on the DKG (assets, index entries for keyword search, vector search in the future&nbsp;etc).</p><p>A publishing choreography initiates a service agreement and is successful if a service bid provided by the publisher satisfies the required service asks posted by DKG nodes for the assertion replication in the given neighborhood. Service asks are posted by DKG nodes on-chain and updated on a regular basis, forming the service&nbsp;price.</p><p>An asset publishing choreography consists of 4&nbsp;phases:</p>  Preparation phase: the asset publisher prepares an assertion in the format expected by the&nbsp;protocol  Feature phase: initiates the appropriate functionality of the desired feature (e.g. updating an asset state) on the blockchain  Store phase: invokes the store protocol to create an assertion replica on the&nbsp;DKG  Commit phase: used to finalize the choreography and initiate the service&nbsp;period   Service market mechanics <p>The DKG service market is formed between asset publishers &amp; consumers on the demand side, and DKG node runners on the supply side. As the DKG is a decentralized environment no entity controls the market and each participant in the DKG gets to act based on their economic preferences.</p><p>For ease of use in OriginTrail v6, the asset publisher client derives a suggested bid for a service based on the price (according to on-chain asks provided by DKG nodes). Once a publisher creates a bid for their asset on chain (feature phase) and successfully creates required assertion replicas on the DKG (store phase), the nodes from the assertion replica submit commit proofs to the blockchain (commit phase). Once the commit phase is completed, the publisher tokens are locked in the system (in the bid amount, to be collected by DKG nodes), the publishing choreography is completed and the service period&nbsp;starts.</p><p>Assertion replicas are hosted by groups of DKG nodes forming shards, based on the following 3 criteria in order of importance:</p>  Key-space proximity criteria: assertions need to be replicated to nodes and maintained in a specific “neighborhood” of the DKG index space, specifically around the key where an assertion is to be kept. Nodes form neighborhoods based on the XOR distance of the assertion key to the node IDs, similar to how distance is determined <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf">in Kademlia DHT</a>. This criteria needs to satisfy efficient data discovery in the decentralized network environment by deterministically locating assertion replicas in querying choreographies. Additionally, due to assertion keys being consistently hashed, assertion replicas are evenly and randomly distributed across the network key-space. A neighborhood is formed by the R2 number of nodes (neighborhood size) which is a protocol parameter.  Node compensation asks: once the appropriate neighborhood is determined (satisfying the first criterion), the second requirement is to ensure that there are enough nodes willing to provide the service in that neighborhood, indicated by their compensation ask. A bid satisfying a minimum number of R1 nodes (R1 being the minimum set of “willing” nodes within an R2 neighborhood, R1 &lt;= R2) is considered a valid bid in terms of the second criterion, where R1 is a protocol parameter.  Security signal criterion: after both previous criteria have been satisfied, finally R0 nodes get chosen (R0 being the minimum replication factor) out of the R1 set, based on the amount of provided TRAC token stake. A higher stake of TRAC tokens in the system indicates higher quality of service guarantees by nodes, as the stake represents a collateral guarantee for nodes providing expected services and acting according to service agreements.  <p>An illustration of the publishing choreography criteria with regards to R0, R1 and R2 is provided below as an example for R2 = 8 and R0 =&nbsp;3.</p> Service period <p>During the service period, nodes involved in the service agreement need to provide service proofs during each epoch of the service to the blockchain. Providing service proofs consists of answering randomly generated cryptographic challenges for hosted assertions and submitting appropriate answers to the blockchain for verification. Successful proof generation and submission to DKG smart contracts in the designated period of time guarantees that a node indeed hosts the assertions required by the service agreement. Once a successful proof submission is performed on a blockchain integrated with the DKG, a portion of the locked tokens (during the publishing choreography) is released and designated for the hosting&nbsp;node.</p><p>In case a service node fails to provide a proof in an epoch, replacement nodes from the candidate node group can replace it in the service group by submitting service proofs (in case they host the required assertions) during the replacement period. The same criteria (as indicated above) apply for the replacement process (self-healing). Therefore by design, the entire network neighborhood is incentivised to host assertions opportunistically in order to be able to perform “self-healing” of replicas.</p><p>In the case of a node failing to provide services (and submit proofs), it is subject to stake slashing. Slashing is no way intended to punish nodes for reasonable latency in submitting proofs (such as short downtimes for updates, or while under load) but rather acts as a deterrent to longer service outages. Slashing is implemented as a lockup system, where a designated percentage S (S being a protocol parameter, suggested value being 5%) is being locked from the available amount of stake for a period T (T also as protocol parameter, suggested value being 2 years). In this way the node’s stake isn’t lost or redestributed among other stakeholders (which could drive malicious targeting of nodes), but rather incapacitated to be utilised in network activities for a significant time&nbsp;period.</p><p>Additionally, node replacements are possible in case when new (full) nodes join the DKG network. Since new joining (full) nodes will inevitably increase the coverage of the DKG index key space and become part of neighborhoods adjacent to their Node IDs, in order to provide high quality discoverability services (via the querying choreography) new nodes are incentivised to provision assertion replicas expected in those neighborhoods. Therefore all DKG v6 nodes joining the network for the first time will perform an opportunistic synchronization sequence loading the assertions in their immediate neighborhoods, enlarging replicas and making assertions available, with the aim to compete for the available compensation via replacement. The DKG tokenomics are designed therefore to incentivise the maintaining of healthy assertion replicas even with network growth as neighborhoods are changing. Replacements due to better positioning in the DKG index key space (and not due to lack of proof submission) do not initiate stake slashing.</p> Querying protocol choreography <p>We consider querying protocols as any protocols that enable discovery and information retrieval from the DKG. They present coordinated activities between asset consumers and the DKG node runners, aimed at finding and querying assets on the DKG, by leveraging the core protocol querying choreography and the DKG&nbsp;index.</p><p>The querying choreography on the DKG directs a generic query (such as a request for an asset by its identifier — the UAL, a SPARQL query or similar) to one or more assertion shards, effectively querying the appropriate “neighborhood” as designated by the publishing choreography. The query routing is equivalent to the Kademlia protocol among full nodes of the DKG. Light clients are not part of the routing protocol, however can invoke queries and publish assets through the network. (It is the responsibility of clients to implement publishing and querying specifics on the application layer to utilize the DKG sharded nature when designing information retrieval systems).</p><p>An asset querying choreography consists of 4&nbsp;phases:</p>  Preparation phase: the asset consumer client prepares a query in some way (e.g. taking input from a search&nbsp;box)  Feature phase: initiates the query prepared in the previous phase on the DKG, on the appropriate DKG shard, and performs necessary URI resolution if&nbsp;needed  Verification phase: verifies the obtained results from the feature phase using on-chain verifiability proofs (verifying immutability, state consistency, issuer or&nbsp;other)  Presentation phase: presenting the query result to the client in requested form  <p>Note that no global SPARQL endpoint in the system exists, due to its decentralized nature. Each of the nodes can however freely decide to build and expose their own SPARQL endpoints, having all implications of such a decision in mind (e.g. availability). The DKG enables queries on its shards via asset graph traversal facilitated by UALs. DKG nodes also implement local graphs (for storing private asset assertions, in their local triple stores) for which they can perform local SPARQL queries of any sort, on both the local asset graph and the loaded assets from the public DKG. More information on querying capabilities will be provided in the official documentation.</p> DKG Node service&nbsp;market <p>Nodes providing services to the DKG network are subject to the market forces (supply and demand), driven by the choreographies explained above. With the updated implementation in version 6, it is expected that DKG node runners obtain an easier and clearer way of determining the optimal market value of compensation for their services, enabling them to achieve profitability easier. Nodes are expected to maintain their asks on-chain, enabling the asset publisher applications to obtain the current market price for DKG services.</p><p>In unison, the market becomes more efficient due to an improved ability of DKG node runners to differentiate their services based on service quality (through availability, throughput, capacity) and security (proxied through the amount of TRAC collateral posted).</p><p>We envision a set of tools to enable easy management of service parameters for DKG node runners to achieve the best possible market return. Such tools would indicate the fluctuations in supply and demand, for example indicating network load increase (due to higher demand) which would have an impact on the service price in the positive direction, until the service supply is increased (via additional nodes joining the network).</p> Tokenomics role in system&nbsp;security <p>In order to reach the necessary system security level the OriginTrail network requires all full nodes to post an amount of TRAC tokens as security deposit in the system. With the new implementation of tokenomics as proposed above, the stake provided by nodes has a function also in the publishing choreography, as described by the third criterion. As nodes compete in the market based on prices and deployed stake in the network, it is expected from nodes to attract a higher amount of stake (either by directly depositing more TRAC by the node runner, or accepting delegated TRAC from the community) to position themselves better in the market. Delegated node staking becomes one of the additional features in OriginTrail v6 and will allow TRAC token holders to participate even further in the TRAC economy by delegating their tokens to nodes they pick, being eligible for sharing the compensation for services by those nodes. This new component of the tokenomics not only introduces new ways for ecosystem stakeholders to participate, but also motivates them to act as “quality signal providers”, as token holders need to carefully assess who to delegate their TRAC to to minimize the probability of slashing. DKG node runners are expected to become further specialized in capabilities needed to provide a high quality service to the&nbsp;network.</p><p>As stake slashing needs to be a meaningful deterrent to potential service outages, given the proposed slashing implementation above, the minimum required amount of posted stake for a full node will be increased to 50 000 TRAC in order to be eligible for operation. Nodes can achieve this minimum both through direct staking or by collecting delegated TRAC tokens from the community. (Note: delegated TRAC tokens cannot be controlled by node runners, only by delegators). Being a stake delegator is therefore similar to the notion of <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking">nominators in the Polkadot&nbsp;network</a>.</p><p>Detailed delegation and staking mechanics are to be presented in the coming&nbsp;RFCs.</p> OriginTrail v6 scalability considerations <p>The implementation of OriginTrail v6 introduces, as already mentioned, the notion of full and light nodes. It also clearly separates the functionalities to be implemented by clients and network nodes (which were previously one monolithic structure).</p><p>The responsibility of the dkg-client is therefore to implement the preparation and feature phases of both publishing and querying choreographies. DKG nodes implement all the network communication related phases and incentivisation functionalities, however are “relieved” of e.g. the preparation phase complexities and load, which are moved towards the network “edge” (clients). With the separation of concerns between the clients and nodes, as well as the new implementations choreographies illustrated above the DKG implementation becomes far more scalable.</p><p>Furthermore, with the new indexing logic and deterministic shard resolution, the nodes need to communicate significantly less, making the load of publishing even less strenuous on nodes, making them able to run more operations at the same time than previously. In this way the ODN becomes “less chatty” and achieves an order of magnitude scalability improvement in the DKG layer&nbsp;2.</p><p>Another consideration in scalability is the OriginTrail Layer 1 (blockchain), which in the system illustrated above is expected to handle a number of transactions per specific epoch. The limit of scalability in terms of blockchain can be calculated by the following equation:</p><p>Number of assets secured on DKG in one epoch = Epoch_length * block_size / number of proof transactions in an&nbsp;epoch.</p><p>The epoch_length is a system parameter that, based on the equation above, essentially determines the number of assets that can be supported by one blockchain in OriginTrail layer 1. We conclude that architecturally the blockchain layer doesn’t present an immediate bottleneck for the growth of the DKG. Iterative deployments and optimizations on the blockchain level, such as through more efficient smart contract code, or direct implementation of components in Substrate, are also expected over the course of OriginTrail evolution.</p> Conclusion <p>This RFC presents the updates to the TRAC tokenomics in the sixth version of OriginTrail protocol with details of the proposed implementation and activities the system needs to incentivise, grouped around publishing and querying choreographies. It introduces all the system stakeholders, their roles and activities the network needs to support each of the functionalities required from a decentralized knowledge graph.

<p>In April we kicked off new <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/upcoming-community-call-new-research-biometrics-in-the-humanitarian-sector/" title="research on the use of biometrics within the Humanitarian sector">research on the use of biometrics within the Humanitarian sector</a>, in partnership with the Open Society Foundation’s migration initiative.</p>



<p>Following on from our previous <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Engine-Room-Oxfam-Biometrics-Review.pdf" title="">2018 report with Oxfam</a> that looked at the risks, harms and challenges of using biometric data for humanitarian purposes, this new research explores what’s changed (and what’s stayed the same) in the sector in the last four years, and takes a deeper look at organisational policies on biometrics, and the benefits risks and potential harms of using biometric systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we wrap up our research and writing, we are keen to share our initial findings and have a broader discussion about what changes are needed when it comes to the use of biometric technologies in the humanitarian sector.</p>



 Register for our second community call on 27 October, 9-10AM EST/ 3-4 PM CET 



<p>All are welcome! Whether you’re a practitioner, a civil society organisation working with impacted communities, or just keen to learn more, join us in our Community Call. Along with presenting our findings, we will create space for dialogue and reflection around the complexities of using biometric technologies within humanitarian contexts.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



 What will we be talking about? 



<p>Our focus in this call will be to think through what needs to change in order to encourage a more responsible use of biometrics within the humanitarian sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the key questions that will be guiding our discussions are:&nbsp;</p>



 
 How do we think about necessity when it comes to using biometric systems? (e.g how do we compare biometrics to alternatives, what kind of evidence exists on risks and benefits, and what kind of evidence is lacking?) 



 What sort of policy-making practices and standards are important for creating a more cohesive approach to biometric use? 



 What kind of changes need to take place within the larger humanitarian landscape to facilitate the responsible and thoughtful use of biometric systems? 
 



<p>You can find more background on our last community call and this project <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/upcoming-community-call-new-research-biometrics-in-the-humanitarian-sector/" title="">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See you on October 27!</p>

				 <p>Danube Tech&nbsp;is building the Universal DID Saas, a hosted platform that allows developers to create, update, resolve, and deactivate Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs), as well as to perform several other advanced DID-related operations.</p>
<p>This company has participated in two of the the eSSIF-Lab Open Calls_ the Business-oriented Open Call and the Infrastructured-oriented Open Call.</p>
<p>We’ve had the pleasure to interview,&nbsp;Markus Sabadello,&nbsp;Danube Tech CEO, who has talked to us about what they have been able to achieve so far in his company since its participation in eSSIF-Lab project and what goals they want to accomplish in the medium or long term.</p>
 1. Please introduce yourself and tell us what your company is about. 
<p>My name is Markus Sabadello, I have a relatively large background of working on decentralised identity ideas and technologies. At Danube Tech,&nbsp;we are working on open-source software and commercial products that make it easy for others to build decentralised identity applications and services.&nbsp;Our priorities lie in implementing lower-level infrastructure components in the area of Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). What makes us special is that we put a strong emphasis on interoperability.</p>
<p>To be specific, we try to build technical components that work with different decentralised identity networks, different credential and proof formats, and different protocols.&nbsp;We focus less on building a single, isolated product that we can sell, and more on being part of a larger community and collaborating with others.</p>
 2. What services or products do you offer? 
<p>On the open-source side, we offer Java libraries that implement DIDs, VCs, Linked Data Proofs, CBOR-LD, and others. These libraries are generic and can be used by developers to build higher-level applications and services. Work on these software libraries has been supported by an ESSIF-Lab IOC2 grant. Two additional open-source projects, which are closely related to this, are the Universal Resolver (see&nbsp;<a href="https://uniresolver.io/">https://uniresolver.io/</a>) and Universal Registrar (see&nbsp;<a href="https://uniregistrar.io/">https://uniregistrar.io/</a>). These projects are quite well-known in the decentralised identity community and have received many contributions. Together, these tools provide an abstraction layer on top of different decentralized identity networks, such as Sovrin, EBSI, IDunion, Indicio, ION, Cheqd, Veres One, and many more. We see this work as an important contribution to building a globally interoperable ecosystem, and to avoid fragmentation of different efforts. As I mentioned before, with our work we are primarily focusing on low-level, foundational infrastructure.</p>
<p>On the commercial side, we are building production-grade enterprise products around the open-source projects. This is sometimes called an “open core” model. The products we are building can be used by companies and governments that want to adopt DIDs, VCs, and related technologies. One of these products is a Software-as-a-Software (SaaS) offering called Godiddy (<a href="https://godiddy.com/">https://godiddy.com/</a>). This has been supported by an ESSIF-Lab Business Oriente Open Call grant and was originally called “Universal DID SaaS”. Godiddy is a hosted platform that makes it easy for developers and solution providers to work with DIDs.</p>
 3. What milestones have you achieved so far since your project launch? 
<p>In our eSSI-Lab IOC2 project, we managed to release “complete” versions of most of our open-source libraries, and to continuously maintain them, since some of the underlying standards are also still evolving. We actively maintain these libraries, since we use them in our own products, and many others in the decentralised identity community use them as well. We also frequently participate in community activities such as developing test suites, or participating in interoperability events (plugfests).</p>
<p>In our BOC1 project, we have by now launched our Godiddy service as a working product, and we have paying customers. We also continuously maintain and expand the functionality of this product, for example by adding support for additional decentralised identity networks.</p>
 4. What have you achieved with your idea thanks to eSSIF_Lab project? 
<p>As mentioned in the previous answer, we managed to significantly advance both our open-source libraries and our Godiddy product to the point where both are actively used by other members of the decentralised identity community, as well as by important customers who are building their own applications and services for solving real-life use cases. You could say that eSSIF-Lab has really helped our company to evolve from merely building experimental tools, to a serious and ambitious actor that plays its part within a larger ecosystem, and hopefully helps SSI become successful on a large scale. During eSSIF-Lab, we were able to expand our team and grow the company.</p>
<p>ESSIF-Lab has also helped us to generate additional visibility for our work. And of course another important benefit of eSSIF-Lab (besides the funding and visibility) was the interaction and collaboration with other eSSIF-Lab subgrantees, and the support of the eSSIF-Lab consortium itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. What are your goals for the middle/long-time future?  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>We believe that DIDs will become as important on the Internet as IP addresses or domain names are today. Our goal is to further improve and expand our products in this area of foundational decentralised identity infrastructure. We want to contribute to interoperability in a global ecosystem and avoid isolated solutions that don’t work with each other.&nbsp;</p> 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>We will continue to play an active role in standardization and community groups such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and Decentralised Identity Foundation (DIF), to make sure SSI is built on solid technical specifications. Our goal is also to further grow the company and become a leading provider of solutions for DID and VC technologies.</p>
 6. Any piece of advice for those who are looking for public funding? 
<p>I’m not an expert on this, but I would say:</p>
 
 Be optimistic&nbsp;– try again if an application doesn’t succeed at first, since rejection can happen for various reasons and doesn’t mean that your idea is bad. 
 Be honest&nbsp;– I have seen grant applications that contain outright lies, which is not fair towards the rest of the applicants, and ultimately not good for yourself. 
 Be grateful&nbsp;– I have heard people complain about the bureaucracy associated with public funding, but I think it’s not too much to ask to make an effort to get support for your project.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Mountain View, Calif., October 13, 2022- The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> today announced the latest addition to its range of certification programs to address the rising need for stronger, simpler online identity verification: the Document Authenticity (DocAuth) Certification Program. The program allows vendors to certify that their mobile document verification solutions accurately determine if a government-issued identity document is authentic, matches the presented user, and complies with the performance criteria set forth in FIDO Alliance’s Document Authenticity (DocAuth) Requirements. Multiple vendors have started the certification process and the first FIDO DocAuth Certified products are anticipated to be available in early 2023.</p>



<p>As high-value services increasingly move online – from banking applications to government services – demand is rising for more robust verification solutions to validate user identities remotely by leveraging trusted government-issued ID documents. Accurate remote identity verification is also critical at the point of account creation, prior to FIDO authentication, and during the account recovery process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DocAuth Certification Program provides a standard testing process for organizations to prove their products can validate different government-issued ID document types across multiple geographies, and that they are fit for commercial use. For service providers, the program provides a benchmark when evaluating multiple vendors to ensure they meet global performance standards and can assist in stopping bad actors from creating accounts using fake or stolen documentation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“FIDO Alliance was pleased to collaborate with our FIDO Accredited laboratory partners on this important program, as accurately verifying a user’s identity during initial account creation is a critical step in the overall integrity of the account – and also strengthens the security of subsequent FIDO-based sign-ins,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewshikiar/">Andrew Shikiar</a>, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “The launch of FIDO’s Document Authenticity Certification Program gives service providers a FIDO Certified mark to ensure the mobile document verification solutions they choose have met globally-recognized standards and can assist them in providing greater security across the entire account lifecycle. We look forward to seeing the first FIDO DocAuth Certified products early next year.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Program Details&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DocAuth Certification Program provides certification performance criteria for vendors, and sets test procedures that FIDO Accredited Laboratories use for evaluating mobile document verification solution capabilities. A full list of FIDO Accredited Document Authenticity Laboratories can be found <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/docauth">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program is open to vendors seeking certification for their mobile document verification solutions. Vendors who achieve certification receive a Document Authenticity Certificate, as well as granted use of the FIDO Certified mark, to demonstrate they have passed the well-defined testing administered by the FIDO Alliance and Accredited Laboratories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO Document Authenticity Certification is independent of other FIDO certification programs. There are no FIDO Certification prerequisites to apply for Document Authenticity Certification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance plans to expand its identity verification program in 2023 with the launch of a face verification certification, including performance criteria requirements that address liveness and selfie-match.</p>



<p>About the FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://www.fidoalliance.org/">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we’re raising awareness of the most frightening social engineering attacks and how we can banish these monsters to the past…</p>



<p>Megan Shamas, senior director of marketing, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Cybercriminals are like trick or treaters – knocking on doors and helping themselves to your freely-given credentials. Whether traditional phishing emails or more sophisticated deepfake-bolstered attacks, our digital lives and the proliferation of passwords are making us increasingly vulnerable to the cyber threat.</p>



<p>Awareness is a core part of FIDO Alliance’s mission to move the world away from passwords to simpler, stronger authentication. Standards and technology is just one half of solving cybersecurity challenges – we have a duty to educate and provide the best information and resources to help everyone make smart decisions in whatever online environment they’re in – whether you’re at work, studying, or in your personal life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why we love working with CISA and NCSAM and their efforts around Cybersecurity Awareness Month, as it gets to the ‘people’ part of cybersecurity. And undoubtedly, when we think of that ‘people’ part, phishing and social engineering attacks are top of the list.</p>



<p>To promote this year’s Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we’ve taken inspiration from the impending spooky season to unmask the scariest techniques and technologies criminals are using to steal your sweet candy credentials – and, how to stop them.</p>



<p>The Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing&nbsp;</p>


 
 


<p>The online world can be a great space for finding friends, work, and romance. But wolves can be lurking behind friendly chats and interactions. These types of attacks are quite sophisticated, and usually take place over an extended period while the attacker wins the trust of their unsuspecting victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plenty of Fish can quickly become Plenty of Phish, catching consumers when they have their guard down and least expect anything. The recent Netflix documentary ‘Tinder Swindler’ is a great example of how convincing and persistent these fraudsters can be. When forming relationships online, remember that those on the other end of apps might not always be who they seem before sharing any sensitive information that could help them take over your online accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Ghosts of Phishmas Past&nbsp;</p>


 
 


<p>An email from the bank wanting to confirm your details. A text from couriers asking you to reschedule your delivery. The cheery retailer message to say you’ve won $100 to spend if you register a new account.</p>



<p>You might think you’ve seen and heard it all before, but these older, tried and tested phishing techniques are haunting us and are still by far the most effective. Take the <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/royal-mail-delivery-text-scam-exposed-how-a-scammer-tried-to-take-4000-aZMlt5B41mXN">Royal Mail SMS scam</a> that blew up last Christmas time in the UK, or the recent global attack on <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/catches-of-the-month-phishing-scams-for-september-2022">Facebook Business/ad users</a>. An estimated <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/three-in-five-people-have-received-a-scam-delivery-text-in-the-last-year-aA3fF1B3qT81">three in five were targeted by fake delivery text messages</a> in 2021. As both the volume and quality of attacks continue to rise, the simplest of phishing and smishing could catch any of us out.</p>



 



<p>The Shapeshifter</p>


 
 


<p>You’ve no doubt seen funny viral videos of deepfakes, like Tom Cruise singing, or heard of the fake videos created of Ukranian President Zelensky earlier this year. But deepfake technology isn’t just limited to comedy and political attacks – this technology is becoming both more readily available and more convincing, bringing to the fore even more effective attacks on everyday consumers. Back in June, the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/29/fbi_deepfake_job_applicant_warning/">FBI even issued a warning to employers about fake employees using the technology to apply for jobs under false pretences</a> to defraud organisations.</p>



<p>Deepfake video and audio is now being used to bolster more standard phishing attacks and convince victims they’re engaging with those closest to them to pressure them into giving away sensitive information and details.</p>



<p>The Terminator</p>



<p>This is one type of social engineering attack that should send shivers down your spine. Recent advances in AI and machine learning are enabling attackers to automate highly targeted attacks – known as spear-phishing – by data scraping and integrating convincing details like name, date of birth and employer details, into attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By revealing just enough legitimate information, consumers are lured into a false sense of security and even more likely to share credentials. Now automated at an alarming rate and level of sophistication, this is one attack that will keep coming back… that is, if we don’t find a strong enough defence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boo, Passwords!</p>



<p>The only way we can truly protect ourselves from sharing our most precious credentials online is to not have credentials we can share in the first place. If passwords are like Halloween candy at our doors, moving to something we simply can’t share like FIDO cryptographic-based signs ins and on-device biometrics means even if you fall for the trick, fraudsters are going hungry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO authentication, created by global collaboration of the world’s biggest tech companies, numerous service providers and security stakeholders, is the only widely available phishing-resistant authentication method. Increasingly, governments like the US and the UK are citing FIDO as the ‘gold standard’ for organisations to implement and access robust cybersecurity. FIDO technology is readily available for companies big and small to implement and, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-implemented-fido2-and-zero-trust/">as Cloudflare’s recent thwarted cyberattacks shows</a>, it’s effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO technology is about to become more readily available and ubiquitous among consumers too. Earlier this year, the world’s biggest platforms – <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/">Apple, Google and Microsoft – committed to supporting our new security key standards, FIDO multi-device credentials, also known as ‘passkeys’</a>. This means, across our most favoured browsers and devices, we’ll soon be able to access FIDO-based passwordless sign-in technology with the same gestures we use every day on mobile devices, using biometrics or PIN.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we’re urging service providers to get phishing-resistant passwordless authentication on their roadmap so consumers can make the move to passwordless – or at the very least, using passwords less – so we can leave these social engineering monsters toothless.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Earlier this year we started a new <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-strengthening-our-digital-resilience/">project to examine and strengthen our digital resilience</a>, in an effort to further integrate social justice principles into our tech choices and practices and deepen our capacity to support our partners.</p>



<p>We use the term “digital resilience” to refer to a set of practices that enable an organisation to protect itself from — and respond to — digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of its people, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to ever-changing needs and contexts.</p>



<p>As part of this project, we have been <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/">reflecting on our own practices</a> in order to better understand our digital resilience needs and also mapping digital resilience issues that social justice organisations we work with are facing, as well as strategies to approach them.</p>



<p>For this mapping process, we are gathering data from our support programmes and research projects to identify common challenges our partners are grappling with, ranging from organisational security and technical concerns, to tool selection and values alignment, and accessibility issues. In this blog post, we share an overview of the main challenges we’ve mapped so far. Given the complex and intricate nature of digital resilience, many of the themes intersect with one another.</p>



 Tool selection: a balancing act 



<p>Tool selection, one of the most pressing challenges cited by organisations, involves two key aspects: 1) a practical aspect, related to selecting tools that meet organisational needs and technical capacities and 2) a principle aspect, related to ensuring the tools align with organisational values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, selecting the right tool is about simultaneously addressing technical needs and aligning with mission and advocacy goals. But addressing both can be difficult. Social justice organisations we work with mentioned limited knowledge about existing tools and an absence of internal expertise to support tool selection as some of the obstacles they face while trying to make tech decisions they feel confident about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Tech choices in low-tech environments 



<p>Tool selection can also be difficult when working in a low-tech or limited-connectivity context. For many social justice organisations — especially those in the Majority World — navigating between selecting tools according to values and facing context-specific limitations can be a delicate and demanding balancing act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organisations frequently ask us questions about managing data responsibly when working within a low-tech environment, or when there are limitations on tools due to organisational capacity. For example, some organisations that had chosen to work with open-source, privacy-respecting tools for video conferencing due to organisational security concerns ended up having to move back to proprietary platforms after facing severe connectivity issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their efforts to improve digital resilience, some of our partners frequently found themselves confronting hard decisions between ease of use and familiarity versus security and privacy concerns. Partners noted that, in choosing to continue to communicate sensitive information across social media platforms, they needed to prioritise convenience and accessibility. While many are interested in finding more secure ways to communicate, they fear that switching from popular platforms could decrease their impact and ability to communicate with audiences/partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making justice-focused tech decisions isn’t always a straightforward process, and it can take a lot of trial and error (like our colleague Steffania explained in this <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/">post about our new video conferencing tools</a>!) and many organisations described feeling frustrated and confused on how to move forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’d like support identifying tools that fit your needs, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">schedule a call with our team!</a> You can also take a look at <a href="https://alidade.tech/">Alidade</a>, an interactive tool that explains what to look for when using technology for social change.</p>



 Pathways to digital resilience: access to information&nbsp; 



<p>Being able to access knowledge about tech and data, including information about digital security, tool selection and responsible data is another important aspect of digital resilience we identified during this first phase of the project. Factors with a negative impact on digital resilience decision-making include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/takeaways-from-our-community-call-on-intersections-between-data-digital-rights-and-social-justice/">Barriers to information about tech and data</a>. 



 Lack of language diversity of existing resources for digital resilience.&nbsp; 



 Insufficient level of context-relevance of existing resources.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Even when organisations know where to find information to help them navigate conversations about digital resilience, most resources are published in English and aren’t necessarily focused on the realities of social justice organisations in resource-constrained environments.</p>



 Digital rights threats and their impact on civil society organisations&nbsp; 



<p>We also heard repeated concerns regarding government surveillance and internet shutdowns. These are key areas within the digital resilience conversation and they fundamentally influence the way organisations go about their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Internet shutdowns are <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/internet-shutdowns-and-elections-handbook/">“intentional disruptions of internet or electronic communications</a>, rendering them inaccessible or effectively unusable, for a specific population or within a location, often to exert control over the flow of information.” The <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/ending-internet-shutdowns-path-forward-report-special-rapporteur-rights-freedom">number of governments imposing internet shutdowns is growing and t</a>he practice is not limited to authoritarian regimes: it has been observed in <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/07/1095142">long-established democracies and more recent democracies</a> alike. At the same time, digital security is being increasingly criminalised and politicised by repressive states, with <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2022/04/2021-KeepItOn-Report-1.pdf">some countries also targeting internet shutdown circumvention tools</a>, such as browsers and tools based on Tor technology, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and proxies that use encryption.<br><br>Government surveillance is one <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/petition/targeted-surveillance-human-rights-defenders/">major cause for concern for human rights defenders</a> and civil society organisations, as <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/freedom-of-expression/">many states have been using technologies</a> to surveil: to read activists and journalists’ private emails and remotely turn on their computers’ camera or microphone to secretly record their activities. <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2021/06/Helpline-10000-cases-report.pdf">Governments around the world are investing in their capacity to silence dissent</a>, through tools for both mass and targeted surveillance.&nbsp;Journalists, workers for non-governmental organisations defending human rights, and <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/for-rights-defenders-cyber-is-the-new-battleground/">women’s rights organisations are particularly at risk of government surveillance</a>. In many countries, <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/disparate-impact-surveillance/?agreed=1">communities of colour are subject to disproportionate levels of surveillance.</a></p>



<p>These digital rights threats need to be taken into account when designing security support interventions, and when thinking about digital resilience of civil society organisations more broadly. Despite the level of concern, we heard that organisations found it difficult to plan for threats or predict impacts. Addressing concerns about government surveillance, for instance, could look very different from one organisation to the next, depending on what they do and where they’re based.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our team offers pro-bono support to social justice organisations interested in improving their digital resilience: <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">schedule a call with us to learn more!</a> And if you/your organisation are facing a digital security emergency, <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/help/">Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline</a> offers real-time, direct technical assistance and advice to civil society groups &amp; activists, media organisations, journalists &amp; bloggers, and human rights defenders.</p>



 Access to resources: digital resilience doesn’t just happen! 



<p>Many social justice organisations we work with face challenges related to digital security and tech infrastructure, and some are unable to fully address these <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/social-justice-digital-rights-during-covid-19-barriers-to-collaboration/">without access to dedicated funding, resources and relevant networks</a>. Through our work with social justice organisations, we’ve seen how difficult it can be for them to focus on digital resilience, since most are overworked and tending to pressing needs from the communities they serve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even when there are financial resources available, seeking out support (and information!) about&nbsp; digital security and tech infrastructure — from knowing how to find trusted support and networks in the first place, to being able to stay up to date with a shifting landscape for digital threats, to figuring out what tech is right for the organisation – is a process that can consume a significant amount of time, energy and resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">How to think about tech when you don’t have time to think about tech:</a> We know that rethinking an organisation’s use of tech and data does take quite a bit of time (and resources!). So we wrote a short blog post with ideas for low(ish) hanging fruits that organisations can start tackling to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">slowly improve their tech and data landscape</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/inclusive-and-ethical-uses-of-digital-identity/">Inclusive and Ethical Use of Digital Identity Working Group (IEUDI)</a> have written a research and discussion paper report looking into inclusivity and ethics in digital identity.</p>



<p>Purpose of this paper</p>



<p>The purpose of this paper is to research existing mahi in the areas of inclusivity and ethics in digital identity. Once we have this understanding, we can identify any gaps and consider how we might address them, consider developing a Code of Practice and make overall recommendations to the Executive Council for DINZ.</p>



<p>Paper Overview</p>



<p>The paper has looked at work happening in Aotearoa and Overseas.</p>



<p>The specific scope of this work is:</p>



  Help ensure inclusive, ethical and responsible use of digital identity technologies that enable equitable digital identity outcomes for all New Zealanders.  Build an understanding of the views and roles of relevant advocacy groups (for example but not limited to Citizens Advice Bureau, NZ Council for Civil Liberties etc) in the adoption of digital identity technologies – inclusive of and accessible&nbsp;to all – with optional alternatives, especially for public services.  Provide constructive forums for discourse with groups that are either clearly disadvantaged in relation to digital identity or have concerns about the potential future uses of digital identity.

<p>A useful way to think about the<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/"> DID standard</a> is as a mechanism to bootstrap trust in an identifier. Implementers can define DID Methods that define how to resolve a DID Document from a DID URL. The most widely used DID method today is the Key DID. </p><p>This method is extremely simple and doesn’t have some of the more advanced features, such as key rotation, that the DID standard enables. However, there are still big challenges with using DIDs. Privacy being a big one. A<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods"> wide range of different DID methods</a> that are not compatible is another. This article explores how to build a DID method that is both<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/upgradeable-decentralized-identity/"> composable</a> (i.e. it builds on existing DID methods) while also adding privacy.</p> 3ID and Its Limitations <p>While Ceramic supports multiple different DID methods, 3ID is the main DID method that leverages the network directly. 3ID has gone through two iterations so far. Let’s take a brief look at them, their limitations, and consider potential future iterations.</p> The Static 3IDv0 <p>The first iteration of 3ID kept things super simple and worked similarly to a Key DID in that it was immutable. However, it added some flexibility by allowing the use of a variety of different key types in one DID document. For example, a secp256k1 key for signature verification and a x25519 key for receiving encrypted messages. These keys were simply stored in an IPLD object, the CID of which is used as the DID<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#a-simple-example"> identifier</a>. To resolve a 3IDv0 one simply needs to resolve the IPLD object from its CID, e.g. using IPFS.</p><p>The main limitation of 3IDv0 was that it was not possible to do any sort of key rotation. Once the DID is created the public keys provided up front are the keys for this DID forever.</p> More Flexibility With 3IDv1 <p>The first version of 3ID was designed to enable key rotation and multi-account identity. By using the built-in conflict resolution of Ceramic’s streams, updating the DID document of a 3ID became straight forward. In this case, a<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/advanced/standards/stream-programs/tile-document/"> Tile stream type</a> represented the 3ID by storing the public keys in the JSON content of the Tile document. The StreamID of the Tile is then used as the DID identifier. By combining this updatable 3ID with another Ceramic stream type, caip10-links, multiple wallet accounts from different blockchains could be linked to a single 3ID.</p><p>While 3IDv1 is more flexible than its predecessor, there are still some significant limitations, primarily around privacy. All verification methods (e.g. public keys) in the DID document are public. There is no way to add a verification method that is unknown to the public observer. Furthermore, the caip10-links necessitated doxxing of the wallet account, creating a permanent link between the account and the 3ID, that even if removed would leave a trace in the caip10-link event log. Finally, UX for actually using a 3IDv1 was not optimal because the keys referenced in the DID Document were long lived. This led to weak security in a browser context and the reliance on an iframe for key management.</p> Desired Properties of 3IDv2 <p>One of the most difficult things to achieve in a publicly verifiable, permissionless system is privacy. This is true for blockchains, and it’s also true for data networks like Ceramic. In blockchains, zero-knowledge proofs are being utilized to provide various sorts of privacy enhancements. Could the 3ID DID method utilize zkp and other techniques to achieve greater privacy as well? First, let’s start by defining what functionality would be desired in a privacy-focused 3ID:</p>  Ability to add and remove verification methods without publicly disclosing their public keys  Selective disclosure of verification methods  Ability to generate a signature issued by the 3ID without revealing which verification method was invoked  Ability to privately graft (i.e. upgrade) existing DIDs to a 3ID (e.g. a caip10-link but private)  Selective disclosure of grafted DIDs   Primitives for Composable Identity <p>Let’s have a look at what primitives we have available to us, or can construct, in order to achieve the properties described above.</p> Generative DID Methods <p>A generative DID method can be defined as a DID where the DID Document can be statically generated from the DID URL. This means that there is no need to look up state from a blockchain or do any other sort of network requests. It also means that it’s not possible to update or remove the DID Document since it is deterministically generated from the DID URL. There are two prominent examples of generative DID methods:</p><p><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID Key</a> - every DID URL is a public key with an associated multicode to uniquely identify the key type. In order to generate the DID Document, the public key is simply translated into the appropriate verification method.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md">DID PKH</a> - short for public key hash, this method essentially makes all blockchain accounts into DIDs. This is achieved by relying on the CAIP-10 account ID standard to identify a specific account on a specific blockchain. The DID URL gets translated to the DID Document using the special blockchain account verification method, which also relies on CAIP-10.</p><p>The stream type caip10-link in Ceramic was created before DID PKH existed in order to have a simple stream type controlled by a blockchain account. This functionality can now easily be replaced by any stream type, such as Tile Document or Model Instance Document by using DID PKH.</p> Object-Capabilities <p>Signing every data transaction with your DID PKH (e.g. your crypto wallet) makes for less than ideal UX. In order to address this problem, object-capabilities (OCAP) and session keys can be used. The<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/capability-based-data-security-on-ceramic/"> article on CACAO</a> explains how this works in detail, but for context let’s have a look at how OCAPs can be used.</p>  A session key (DID Key) is randomly generated  An authorization message (e.g.<a href="https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361"> SIWE</a>) is generated which contains the DID Key URL and an array of resources being authorized  A signature request over this message is sent to the wallet (DID PKH)  The message + signature can now be used as an OCAP, that together with the session key, can be used to invoke actions on the authorized resources  <p>Important to note that these OCAPs can also be chained, e.g. Key A → Key B → Key C, where → implies a delegation.</p> Revocation Registry <p>Delegation using capabilities is powerful, but we don’t necessarily want delegations to be valid forever. A possible mitigation is to add an expiry time to the capability as it is issued. Time based revocation is simple but still quite limited and in the case of a compromised key, damage can still be caused before the capability expires. We need a way to check if a particular capability has been revoked by the issuer. Ideally without leaking information about which capabilities have existed over time—here a revocation registry can be useful. The capability itself can include a caveat that states that it is only valid if and only if the capability has not been added to the revocation registry.</p><p>On Ceramic the revocation registry could be implemented as follows:</p>  An event stream is created where revocation events can be published  The revocation event is a multihash of the CID of the capability (an extra hash is added for privacy)  Once a revocation event has been anchored it is considered valid and is enforceable starting from the anchor timestamp  When a capability is issued it contains a caveat that references the revocation registry using its StreamID  When the capability is verified, the revocation registry must be loaded from the Ceramic network; if the capability was revoked before it was invoked it is considered invalid  <p>The lookup time of this revocation registry would be O(n). However, a Ceramic node could build a merkle tree where OCAP hashes are keys and revocation times are values to reduce lookup time to O(log n). In theory this could also make the revocations verifiable on-chain.</p> Private Capability Invocation <p>When a capability is invoked to perform some action it will generally be publicly disclosed. Up until the point of invocation it can be kept in secret, but if we want our system to remain publicly verifiable an observer must be able to validate the full delegation chain—from the owner of the resource to the key that performed the invocation. A keen reader might, however, realize that we don’t actually need to disclose the delegation chain if we use a ZKP to hide certain information.</p><p>publicInputs = (rootDID, sessionKey, ocapHashes, resources, actions)</p><p>privateInputs = (ocapChain)</p><p>The ZKP from above can be verified to ensure that the session key is indeed authorized to take certain actions on the given resources. The revocation registry can be referenced to make sure none of the capabilities are revoked since the ocapHashes are part of the public input.</p><p>Note that by including the ocapHashes in the public input some metadata is leaked. An observer will be able to see which capabilities have been frequently used, but they won’t learn anything about the content of the capability. A possible improvement could be to include the entire revocation registry stream in the public input. An outside observer could simply compare the included registry with a registry loaded locally. As long as the action performed by the invoker was anchored before any change to the registry was anchored the entire capability chain could still be considered valid. This means of course that the ZKP would need to be regenerated every time the revocation registry is updated.</p> 3IDv2: Composable Identity <p>Combining the primitives above, we can create a composable DID method where verification methods can be added privately using capabilities and revoked using the revocation registry. Similarly to 3IDv0 the first verification method would be added to the initial (public) state of the DID document. After this point, adding a verification method is actually done by using a capability that gives the delegate DID full control to take any action on behalf of the 3ID.</p><p>A cool feature is that the revocation registry includes timestamp information (from Ceramic anchors) so that we can see when revocations happen. This makes it easy to validate signatures done in the past, since we can see that the signature was done by the verification method before it was revoked. However, in the case of a delegation chain this might not be enough. Imagine we have Key A delegating to Key B at time T0; then at time T1, Key A gets revoked. From the perspective of the 3ID, Key B should still be valid since it was added by a verification method that was valid at the time. In order to solve this dilemma we can simply add a timestamp for when Key B was added in the revocation registry. This would allow us to keep using Key B even if Key A is revoked.</p> Grafting DIDs <p>There is a need to publicly or privately link existing DIDs, such as PKH DIDs, to a 3ID. This can now be done rather simply in Ceramic by creating a deterministic stream that is controlled by the DID in question and include an attestation that this DID is grafted to a particular 3ID. The attestation could be public or encrypted. If it is encrypted it could be selectively disclosed to any third party. For example, to check if an ethereum address (PKH DID) has been grafted to a 3ID, one would simply load the Ceramic stream and check the content of the resolved document. For a private link, a decryption key for the encrypted link would also be required to read to which DID the link points to.</p> Implementation <p>An implementation of 3IDv2 might seem daunting at first. It’s worth noting that it can be done in stages, since each primitive builds upon the previous ones. A prototype could easily be built with only support for capabilities for adding new verification methods. The revocation registry could be built after adding the ability to actually do proper key management and would result in a usable version of the system. Finally, private capability invocation could be added on top, providing a layer of privacy when actually using the identity.</p>

<p>Earlier this year we started a new <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-strengthening-our-digital-resilience/">project to examine and strengthen our digital resilience</a>. Through this work we hope to further integrate social justice principles into our tech choices and practices and deepen our capacity to support our partners&nbsp;</p>



<p>After conducting a deeper needs assessment within the team, the first set of changes we made focused on our video conferencing infrastructure. In this blog post, we’re sharing some reflections about the new tools our team is testing out and how our experience has been so far.</p>



<p>We are using the term “digital resilience” to refer to a set of practices that support the ability of an organisation to protect itself from — and respond to — digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of its members/individuals, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to the ever-changing needs and contexts of the organisation and its members. </p>



 Deciding which video conferencing tools fit our needs and values 



<p>At The Engine Room, we aim for a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/technology-in-the-service-of-justice/">justice-based approach to our technical choices</a>. This means we prioritise choosing technology solutions that intentionally weave anti-oppression strategies into all stages of their creation, maintenance and uptake. As a remote organisation, video conferencing is integral to our day-to-day operations. After conducting a deeper needs assessment within the team, it became clear that adopting tools that are privacy-respecting and strengthen our organisational security was a priority for us. For this reason, we decided to set up our own instances of <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/">BigBlueButton</a> (BBB) and <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">Jitsi Meet</a>. Both tools are encrypted, open source, and incorporate privacy by design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BigBlueButton is an open source online learning and video conferencing platform.All traffic from the users’ web browsers to the server goes over standard security protocols when audio, video or screens are being shared.</p>



<p>BBB is<a href="https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/#designed-for-online-learning"> designed specifically for educational applications</a>, with features like whiteboards, break-out rooms, and polling. It also <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/integrations/">integrates</a> with various learning management systems (e.g. Canvas, Moodle). Everything happens in users’ web browsers, so there’s no need for any additional software.BigBlueButton users don’t need to create an account to join a call: all they need is the meeting link, which can be opened with a browser. Access to <a href="https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/greenlight/gl-overview.html#manage-access">meetings can be limited through a code</a> and joining the room can be dependent on moderator approval.</p>



<p>To use <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/teachers/features/">all the functionalities of the tool</a> it is necessary to have a server to install it on. BBB’s website offers the possibility of <a href="https://demo.bigbluebutton.org/gl/signup">creating an account to access a “demo” version of the tool.</a> Using this version you can make calls of up to 60 minutes.</p>
 



 
 Jitsi Meet 



<p>Jitsi Meet (also referred to as meet.jit.si) is a free and open source video conference service maintained by parent company <a href="https://www.8x8.com/">8×8</a>. By default, Jitsi Meet provides transport-layer encryption between the browser and the Jitsi Meet server of your choice; an end-to-end encryption feature is also available.</p>



<p>Jitsi Meet users don’t need to create an account to join a call: all they need is the meeting link, which can be opened with a browser or through Jitsi’s mobile app.</p>



<p>Meetings can also be password-protected.</p>



<p>Jitsi Meet offers the option of self-hosting and there is a <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">public version</a> of the tool for free use.</p>
 
 



<p>Some of the factors that we took into account while selecting video conferencing tools are included in the list below (which takes inspiration from many resources, such as this “<a href="https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/resource-publication/guide-secure-group-chat-and-conferencing-tools">Guide to Secure Group Chat and Conferencing Tools</a>”):&nbsp;</p>



 
 Maturity and maintenance: We took into account how mature the platforms are, including the amount of time they’ve been running for and whether or not they are still being actively developed. We also considered the existence of active communities of developers and users for both tools. 



 Privacy: A variety of factors went into consideration: whether or not user data is shared or sold to third parties, if the tools provide encryption (and what type of encryption: end-to-end or to-server), if it’s possible to self-host, what data is stored on platforms’ servers and what data platforms’ owners have access to, if users need to install a dedicated app or software and what data this app or software would have access to. 



 Reputation: We prioritised tools that are used and respected by social justice organisations and peers we work with, as well as recommended by security experts.&nbsp; 



 Ownership: We considered whether tools were open source and if the companies provided the source code openly, as well as the history of development and ownership of the platform and potential security challenges (including how owners and developers reacted to those challenges). 



 Features and affordances: We mapped the platforms according to how well their features would respond to our needs: easiness to connect to these platforms, usage of tools for internal and external calls and more.&nbsp; 



 Associated costs: We also considered the costs related to each of the tools, including potential subscription fees, learning and implementing, possible IT support needed and hosting costs 
 



 A brief overview of our experience so far 



  
<p>Hosting and infrastructure details<br>– For BigBlueButton, we hired <a href="https://maadix.net/">Maadix</a>‘s hosting service, who are maintaining both the tool and the servers where it’s hosted. We use a <a href="https://maadix.net/en/big-blue-button-privacy-security-optimizations">version customised by Maadix with performance and privacy improvements.</a><br>– For Jitsi Meet, we are using the <a href="https://open.greenhost.net/greenhost/cloud-init/-/tree/main/jitsimeet">pre-installed stable version</a> that <a href="https://greenhost.net/">Greenhost</a> – with whom we have been already working – offers to their clients.</p>
  



<p>After implementation, we asked our team to use BigBlueButton and Jitsi Meet as much as possible. After two months of piloting the tools, we conducted an internal survey and received mostly positive feedback—overall the team appreciated using tools that are aligned with our organisational values. We also identified areas for improvement, which we will work on over the next few months, including user friendliness and video instability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s important to note that while we try to default to using our own internal platforms, there are occasions where we have a need for features that these platforms do not yet have. For example, we often use webinar registration pages and waiting rooms to ensure that our community calls are safe for participants; however, BigBlueButton and Jitsi Meet do not currently possess these features. Additionally, although both platforms aim to be low resource, they often struggle in low bandwidth situations. Lastly, there’s the learning curve of the team for adapting new tools. We often crave for the familiar when it’s not immediately clear how to perform a certain task. We recognize that adapting to the workflow of these tools will take time as is the case with most technological changes.</p>



<p>Here is a summary of some of the benefits and challenges of installing and maintaining these tools on our own servers.&nbsp;</p>



 
 
 Advantages 



 
 Authonomy: More control over the tools we use, since we are responsible for the installation and can check all code that runs in the application. 



 Values: Tools that are aligned with our values and principles. 



 Transparency: Transparency of the open software code—we can inspect every line of code used to build the tools. 



 Security:&nbsp; With open source tools, more people are inspecting the code, which enables more issues to be found – and fixed. Vulnerabilities are fixed much faster and updates are more frequent.&nbsp; 



 Cost: Open-source software is very often free or cheaper than proprietary software. Therefore, we save on licensing and maintenance fees.&nbsp; 



 Open source ecosystem: We are contributing to a community of developers committed to making the internet a fairer place. 



 Customisation and Flexibility: Using services customised for our use and having exclusive domains. 
 
 



 
 Challenges 



 
 Resources: Self-hosted tools require more maintenance time and investment in servers. 



 Tech expertise: Self-hosted tools require knowledge and availability (internal or external) to troubleshoot issues the team or our partners experience. 



 Documentation: Using tools that are less widespread or familiar demands an effort to produce technical and user-facing documentation. For example, we developed internal user guides for both platforms containing FAQs, and we also created an external guide that explains our decisions behind specific platform use in community calls. 



 Adapting to new tools: Functionality is not always the same between tools and even when it is, the user experience may differ. Adopting new tools can take time (as we wrote in <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/adopting-new-tech-how-to-give-your-team-the-best-chances-of-success/">this blog post</a>) and can impact the day-to-day work of the organisation. 



 Stability and availability: Ensuring that self-hosted tools are stable and have high availability (or the ability of a system to operate continuously without failing) is a challenge. Constant monitoring,&nbsp; maintenance, and server redundancy (storing information in more than one server) are steps required to make sure information can be restored in case of problems. 
 
 
 



<p>This overview represents a snapshot of where we currently are in our journey with these tools: these observations will likely evolve and change over time, as we work on this project and mature our own digital resilience practices.</p>



 Next steps 



<p>During this process, we were reminded of how adopting free and open-source software tools (and self-hosting them!) is a process that takes quite some time and planning, but that ultimately contributes greatly to our digital resilience. Over the next months, we will continue to work on our video conferencing tools, including improving on the tools’ overall performance and stability, refining user documentation and addressing connectivity issues.</p>



<p>If your organisation is interested in going through a similar process, we’d be happy to support you (even if your end result is different!). <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">Schedule a call with us</a>!</p>

<p>Background:</p>



<p>From the beginning we have asked that you consider electing a diverse group of members who reflect the diversity of the community we seek to support. We ask that you do so again this year.  The power of that diversity continues to shine through in the new working groups this year, especially as we consider the importance of Te Tiriti, equity and inclusion in a well-functioning digital identity ecosystem.</p>



<p>The Council has identified a number of areas where diversity, as well as expertise in the digital identity space, might help us better serve the community. Nominations from those organisations involved in kaupapa Māori, civil liberties and business and service sectors are especially encouraged. We also encourage suggestions from young people within your organisations, as the viewpoint of young people is extremely essential and relevant to the work we perform. As an NZTech Association, Digital Identity NZ adopts its Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy which you can read <a href="https://nztech.org.nz/about/board-diversity-inclusion-policy/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Once elected in December, one of the first responsibilities of the new Council will be to elect a new chair for the EC Council or consider re-electing the current chair. The current chair is Paul Platen (SSS – Security Specialists), supported by deputy chair (and past-chair) Ben Tairea (Āhau). Both are excellent kaiārahi (guides/counsellors/leaders) currently and serving their terms on the Executive Council through to the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2023 is set to be another pivotal year for digital identity with the delayed introduction of the Digital Identity Bill and further development of the ecosystem. We look forward to stellar nominations to identify, explore and pursue the best opportunities for Digital Identity NZ to make a positive difference for people in 2023 and beyond.</p>

 Firm Foundations 

<p>Much of our work in Q3 has been forward-thinking, focused on creating the next generation of specifications for blockchain interoperability.</p>

<p>Hello to the Identity Community. Being able to create the next generation of specifications depends on having a wide-spanning community, and we’ve been thrilled to see the Blockchain Commons community continue to grow. That includes not just cryptocurrency nowadays, but also digital identity thanks to sustaining sponsor Proxy. We also reached out to more digital-identity companies at this year’s Rebooting the Web of Trust event, and hope to see that pay out in the near future.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/tQ9SPek0mnI"></a></p>

<p>Gordian Envelope. Our specification work is intended to build firm foundations. Our newest foundational work of this sort has been on Gordian Envelope, a new sort of “Smart Container” that can be used to hold secrets and metadata of an arbitrary size and that can be opened by a variety of “permits”, including SSKR shares and public-key cryptography keypairs. Extensive <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/tree/master/Docs">docs</a> are now available as part of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents">BCSwiftSecureCompanents package</a>.

The appendix of the Gordian Envelope docs contains our first <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/blob/master/Docs/09-A-ALGORITHMS.md">MVA ALgorithm Suite</a>. This refers to the algorithmic suite we’ve decided to use in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0deyIHXukk&amp;t=7s">Minimal Viable Architecture</a>: effectively a future-proofed Minimal Viable Product. It overviews current cryptographic algorithms and discusses our decisions about which to use. Gordian Envelope uses BLAKE3, IETF ChaChaPoly, the secp256k1 curve, and more. Our Appendix talks about why we think they’re the best practices for this project.</p>

<p>Collaborative Seed Recovery. This new foundational work is largely in service to Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR): we intend it to add independence, resilience, and openness to seed storage by allowing digital-asset holders to shard their seed and then store it with a variety of different steward services, making recovery painless and resilient. We are currently working with a companies such as Bitmark, Foundation, and Proxy in regular biweekly meetings to make CSR a reality this fall. For more, please see our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/CSR.md">CSR Overview</a>. Our Gordian Envelope videos also lay out the whole foundation, so take a look at the combined <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aciTNh402Co&amp;list=PLCkrqxOY1Fbp-P1Yv-7gmu75i2QS2Z6vk">CSR playlist</a>.</p>

<p>CSR Use Cases. Why is CSR needed? We’ve written several sequences of <a href="https://hackmd.io/ZbRiwvUfQSy-1RKM15bM8Q#CSR-Focused-Use-Cases">progressive use cases</a> in a preliminary document that discusses options both for CSR and its 2023 successor, Collaborative Key Management (CKM). It covers everything from simple protection of keys to future possibilities where no one actually holds a complete seed, despite its keys being in active use.</p>

 Community Events 

<p>Preventing vendor lock-in via interoperability has been a Blockchain Commons goal from the beginning, but that requires bringing together multiple parties to buy into interoperable specifications. The growth of Blockchain Commons’ community of developers, sponsors, and other interested parties in 2022 has truly made that possible, with those parties coming together in community events such as the biweekly CSR meetings and others.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/"></a></p>

<p>Silicon Salon 2. Our other ongoing get-together this year has been the <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salon</a>, where we’ve facilitated wallet makers and semiconductor makers talking about the creation of the next generation of silicon design that is specialized for cryptography. Our <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/">second Silicon Salon</a> was held on September 14th. Presenters included Bunnie Studios, Cramium Labs, Proxy Labs, Foundation, and the VLS team.</p>

<p>RWOT11. Blockchain Commons got its start with <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, where Christopher Allen first brought community members together to support the future of decentralized and self-sovereign technologies. Unfortunately, Rebooting the Web of Trust went on hiatus shortly after the foundation of Blockchain Commons, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it was back <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague">this September</a>.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons submitted two papers for RWOT11, to bring some of our topics into the conversation in the Netherlands: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/collaborative-seed-recovery-csr.md">an introduction to CSR</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/elision-redaction-correlation-smart-documents.md">Elision, Redaction, and Non-Correlation in Smart Documents</a>. The elision topic paper led to a discussion of <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/selective-correlation.md">Selection Disclosure</a> that we’re looking forward to finishing in the coming months. We also participated in an article on <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/identity-threats.md">Identity Threats</a>, which returns to some of our early identity work in the field!</p>

<p>Congrats to DIDs. We can’t talk about RWOT without congratulating everyone who worked on turning <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/specifications/DIDs-Ratified/">DIDs into a standard</a>. This has been a long-running goal for both RWOT and Blockchain Commons, so we were thrilled to see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> become a W3C Recommendation this July.</p>

 New &amp; Updated Projects 

<p>We have also continued work on some of our smaller projects:</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit/master/static/images/spotbit-screen.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Beancount. Beancount is a <a href="https://github.com/beancount/beancount">simple program</a> that allows double-entry accounting from text files. Because of its textual foundation, it’s very convenient to use in conjunction with command-line Bitcoin tools. As it happens, this type of tool is also crucial to Bitcoin because of regulatory decisions in the US treating Bitcoin as property, not currency, meaning that capital gains need to be calculated for every transaction(!). This requires careful accounting of your Bitcoin, and to support that, we’ve updated our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit">SpotBit server</a> to also include a script called <code>beancounter.py</code> that will take a descriptor, look up historical prices via SpotBit, and thus provide all of the data an accountant will need to properly report Bitcoin purchases, sales, and usages. We’ve iterated the software a few times during the quarter, and think we might have a final version; watch for some documentation on the process in the coming quarter.</p>

<p>SpotBit. We’ve actually had a few recent updates to SpotBit, primarily to improve the look, feel, and design of its <a href="https://spotbit.info/spotbit/">webpages</a>. Thanks to 2022 interns who supported in this upgrade.</p>

 Advocacy 

<p>The work that Blockchain Commons does on specifications, leading to libraries and reference apps, is bottom-up: we work with developers to incorporate specifications that meet our vision of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. However, we also do top-down work, where we advocate for this vision to lawmakers, agencies, and other organizations.</p>

<p>Law &amp; Advocacy Repo. To better highlight this work, which was also well-supported by our 2022 interns, we’ve added a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/law-and-advocacy">Law &amp; Advocacy repo</a> to GitHub, to report out much of our work. It includes a list of <a href="https://hackmd.io/Eat2gnYqT56HQStI63JCNg">Terminology &amp; Definitions</a> produced by this year’s interns, and links to other work.</p>

<p>Private Key Disclosure. That work includes our new article advocating for <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Private-Key-Disclosure/">protection for private keys in courts</a>, which was published by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/saving-bitcoin-private-keys-from-courts">Bitcoin Magazine</a>. In recent years, courts have begun to request private keys as part of pre-trial discovery motions. It’s dangerous and unnecessary and it needs to end, as is now being considered in Wyoming, where Christopher Allen continues to give regular testimony. Fortunately, the proposed law in Wyoming to protect private keys from disclosure has recently passed a select committee and moved on to others. It still has a ways to go though!</p>

 Web Site Updates 

<p>Blockchain Commons’ third birthday passed without mention this Spring. But, that span of time since our foundation is probably why we’ve been doing a bit of work cleaning up our web presence, to make sure it accurately reflects where we are today!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com"></a></p>

<p>About Page. Didn’t even know that Blockchain Commons had a birthday? It’s referenced on our brand-new <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/about.html">About Page</a> which also highlights our three principals: Founder &amp; Executive Director Christopher Allen; Lead Researcher Wolf McNally; and Lead Tech Writer Shannon Appelcline.</p>

<p>Vision Page. We’ve long known the goal of Blockchain Commons: to make it possible for people to control their own assets and information on the internet, using the decentralized power of blockchain technology. We slightly revised how we write about that vision this quarter. Our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html">newest statement</a> combines two previous statements to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Blockchain Commons advocates for the creation of open, interoperable, secure &amp; compassionate digital infrastructure to enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Projects Page. You may also want to take a look at our updated <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/projects.html">Projects Page</a>. We’ve done a lot of different work over the last three and a half years. Our updated projects page now highlights what we consider most important to our vision, beginning with the Gordian System.</p>

<p>Airgapped Community. Though we continue to believe strongly in partitioning services to encourage the Gordian Principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness, that’s today much bigger than the airgaps that we were considering several years ago. As a result, we’ve transformed the Airgapped Wallet Community into the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community">Gordian Developer Community</a>. We choose the name “Gordian Developer Community” for this update because the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian">Gordian System</a> today incorporates all of our developer-focused work, from Principles and Architecture to Specifications and Libraries, plus the Apps that demonstrate them. We look forward to talking with airgapped-wallet developers and those working on other partitioning techniques alike!</p>

 Doc Updates 

<p>As part of our web updating, we’ve also done some work on our docs.</p>

<p>Revised Gordian Page. How does the whole Gordian system fit together, from our air-gap and tor-gap overview to specifications such as Gordian Envelope? Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#readme">updated Gordian page</a> walks through the whole system from top to bottom, including new pages on topics such as the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Architecture.md">Gordian Architecture</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Roles.md">Gordian Architecture Roles</a></p>

<p>New Test Vectors. We’ve also produced some new test vectors, to help people who are implementing our specifications. These include <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-test-vector.md#256-bit-seed">SSKR test vectors based on 256-bit seeds</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/crypto-seed-test-vectors.md">crypto-seed test vectors for both 128-bit and 256-bit seeds</a>.</p>

 Final Notes 

<p>Thank you as always for your support for Blockchain Commons. In 2022, we have truly become the commons that we imagined. Moving forward, we will continue to build firm foundations with our big focus on the architectural and reference work needed to release CSR by the end of the year.</p>

<p>If you’re not already a sponsor of our work, you can become one through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">GitHub</a>. Now that we’re back from RWOT11 in the Netherlands, we’re looking forward to continuing to advance our work!</p>

<p>This year, with support from Sigrid Rausing Trust, we deepened our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/supporting-organisations-to-navigate-digital-transitions/" title="offer of support to activists, collectives and movements">offer of support to activists, collectives and movements</a> – particularly those who serve marginalised communities – that are facing challenges incorporating technologies in their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through our work, we see that <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/" title="working with tech and data isn’t a simple process">working with tech and data isn’t a simple process</a> for many social justice organisations and that many of our partners share similar concerns. So we decided to compile some of the key questions we get asked in a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/faq-frequently-asked-questions-about-tech-data/">new FAQ</a> (Frequently Asked Questions), currently available in <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/faq-frequently-asked-questions-about-tech-data/">English</a>, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/faq-preguntas-frecuentes-sobre-tecnologia-y-datos/">Spanish</a> and <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/faq-perguntas-frequentes-dados-e-tecnologia/" title="Portuguese">Portuguese</a> (and soon in French).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this FAQ, we’re answering questions such as:</p>



 
 How can organisations start using more tech/data in their work? 



 How can organisations decide which tools to use? 



 What can be done to make sure staff is safe when using tech and data? 



 And many more!

<p>Antes de iniciarmos, o que queremos dizer com dados? E tecnologia? Provavelmente você está usando os dois!<br><br>Definimos ‘dados’ como informações que precisam ser processadas, organizadas e estruturadas para que possam ser utilizadas. Em outras palavras, com dados estamos nos referindo às informações que você possui, como os detalhes sobre as comunidades com as quais trabalha, resultados de pesquisas que fez, endereços de e-mail e informações de contato de apoiadores e assim por diante.<br><br>Entendemos ‘tecnologia’ como as ferramentas, os sistemas, métodos e processos que capitalizam o poder computacional para gerenciar, analisar e comunicar informações. Para isso, quando falamos em tecnologia, queremos dizer ferramentas digitais, em termos gerais. Qualquer coisa, desde plataformas de e-mail e apps de mensagens até hosts de sites, plataformas de newsletters por e-mail, CRMs, bancos de dados, processos algorítmicos e mais.</p>

 Primeiros passos – entendendo a visão geral sobre tecnologia e dados 



 P1: Organizações parceiras parecem estar usando mais tecnologia/dados. Também deveríamos buscar usar mais tecnologia/dados em nosso trabalho?  



<p>A resposta para isso realmente depende do contexto. A tecnologia pode lhe auxiliar a organizar tarefas e operações diárias, permitir comunicação mais segura, coletar e gerenciar informações, cortar gastos e liberar orçamento, entre outras possibilidades. Mas, se usada de maneira ineficaz ou sem estratégia, a tecnologia também pode comprometer a sua capacidade de realizar o seu trabalho com segurança e eficácia.</p>



<p>Por exemplo, se sua organização estiver coletando relatos em primeira mão de violações aos direitos humanos em áreas com pouca conectividade à internet/rede móvel, a adoção de uma ferramenta de coleta de dados que necessite de conexão com a internet dificultará o seu trabalho e impactará negativamente a sua capacidade de cumprir a sua missão.</p>



<p>Se usada sem estratégia, a tecnologia também pode lhe expor e expor as pessoas com quem você trabalha a novas vulnerabilidades e novos riscos. Por exemplo, se você está em um contexto em que a monitoração da sociedade civil pelo governo é comum e está usando ferramentas que não protejam suas comunicações de maneira adequada, isso pode comprometer o seu trabalho e a sua segurança.</p>



<p>Para ter certeza de que você usará a tecnologia estrategicamente e com responsabilidade, separe um tempo para pensar a respeito de como implantar uma nova tecnologia ou coletar mais dados poderia fortalecer ou enfraquecer o seu trabalho. Antes de adotar quaisquer novas ferramentas ou plataformas, tente fortalecer a sua capacidade interna, conectar-se com outras organizações que você respeita.</p>

 P2: Como eu e minha equipe podemos aprender mais sobre tecnologia e como ela é relevante para o nosso trabalho?&nbsp; 



<p>Tecnologias digitais evoluem rapidamente, assim como debates e conversas sobre os potenciais benefícios e malefícios de se usar ferramentas e plataformas específicas. Quando tentamos aprender mais sobre tecnologia, achamos que o mais útil é focar em duas coisas:</p>



 
 Trabalhar para <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/" title="">desenvolver a intuição técnica da equipe de maneira lenta e incremental</a>, fazendo com que seja uma prioridade para toda a equipe tanto quanto possível (em vez de trabalho de uma única pessoa). 



 Em vez de buscar por <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/understanding-people-before-creating-new-tech/" title="">ferramentas novinhas em folha</a>, tente antes identificar como a tecnologia e os dados podem <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reconnecting-with-your-purpose-reaching-for-impact/" title="">fortalecer o seu trabalho principal</a>. 
 



<p>Quando o assunto são novas ferramentas e aplicações, há muita informação online que pode ser tentadora – mas pode ser difícil identificar o que é relevante para você e o que não é.</p>



<p>Para entender as informações relacionadas à tecnologia com mais facilidade, comece com o desafio que você está tentando entender ou resolver primeiro. Ademais, se puder, busque organizações parceiras que pensem de maneira similar e que possam estar em contextos parecidos ou ter missões semelhantes às suas e aprenda mais sobre quais ferramentas estão usando (e quais foram seus sucessos e desafios!).</p>

 P3: Minha organização acredita que é o momento de começarmos a usar mais tecnologia e dados no nosso trabalho. Por onde começamos?&nbsp; 



<p>Primeiro, tenha uma visão geral clara do que vocês já estão usando! A maioria das organizações já estão usando pelo menos algum tipo de tecnologia e dados para lhes auxiliar no trabalho – desde ferramentas do cotidiano, como e-mail e mensagens instantâneas, até ferramentas de CRM e bancos de dados. Abaixo, trouxemos uma pequena lista de perguntas que podem servir como um exercício inicial para mapear as maneiras que você está usando tecnologia e dados em seu trabalho.</p>



<p>Nota: algumas das informações que você vai reunir como parte deste exercício de mapeamento podem ser sensíveis; antes de começar, garanta que suas notas estão armazenadas em um local seguro e são compartilhadas apenas com pessoas que precisam acessá-las.</p>



 
 Quais ferramentas você usa atualmente para seu trabalho?&nbsp;
 
 Quais plataformas/ferramentas você e sua equipe usam para se comunicar? Dentre elas, podem estar e-mail, mensagens instantâneas, mídias sociais, SMS e sites, para listar algumas. 



 Como você armazena e gerencia seus arquivos e documentos? Quais plataformas você usa? Todos na sua equipe usam as mesmas plataformas? 



 Você está trabalhando em campanhas públicas ou faz parte de esforços coletivos com outras organizações? Se sim, quais ferramentas usa para ativismo, organização e manter a comunidade? 



 Está trabalhando com algum banco de dados ou plataforma de pesquisa? 
 
 
 



<p></p>



 
 Como você está usando os dados?
 
 Que tipo de dados/informações você coleta ou gera no cotidiano? Pense sobre seus fluxos de trabalho individuais e coletivos e liste os momentos em que você coleta ou gera dados. Por exemplo, coletar informações de contatos das pessoas que você entrevistou, conversar por e-mail ou WhatsApp, tomar notas de entrevistas ou reuniões ou realizar pesquisas com comunidades. 



 Onde você armazena os dados? Considere os dados que você já tem e liste todos os lugares onde estão (garanta que está incluindo todos os lugares remotos – e-mails, documentos compartilhados e assim por diante). 



 Onde e como você compartilha os dados? Pense sobre as vezes em que você precisa compartilhar os dados: quando isso normalmente acontece, com quem você compartilha essas informações e quais ferramentas utiliza? Por exemplo, você pode enviar planilhas ou PDFs por e-mail, compartilhar documentos e atas de reuniões pelo Google Docs ou compartilhar senhas através de um aplicativo de mensagens. 
 
 
 



<p>Essas são perguntas iniciais e exploratórias. Para uma versão completa deste exercício de mapeamento, veja <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">Becoming RAD!</a> (publicado em 2021) ou <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">entre</a> em contato com a nossa equipe.</p>



<p>Por fim, adotar novas ferramentas leva tempo e necessita de recursos. Garanta que você e sua equipe terão espaços dedicados para aprender novas ferramentas, praticar comportamentos e se atualizar com os novos dados sendo utilizados.</p>

 P4: Como posso garantir que as ferramentas tecnológicas e os dados que estamos usando são realmente úteis para o nosso trabalho? 



<p>Em nosso trabalho de apoio a organizações da sociedade civil, frequentemente nos deparamos com <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">suposições de que dig</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/" title="">i</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">tal sign</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/" title="">i</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">fica melhor</a> e que qualquer solução tecnológica levará a maior eficiência, eficácia e impacto.</p>



<p>Mas nem sempre é assim. Quando estamos trabalhando mais intensamente com um parceiro, frequentemente começamos com uma avaliação de como seu uso de tecnologia e dados são mapeados para seu trabalho e contexto. Isso pode nos ajudar a entender como, ou mesmo se, a forma com que usam a tecnologia está fortalecendo seu trabalho.</p>



<p>Depois de mapear quais ferramentas a organização está usando e quais dados são coletados, armazenados e compartilhados, vamos a uma segunda rodada de perguntas: quão útil tudo isso é (ou quão útil poderia ser) no contexto do seu trabalho:</p>



 
 Qual é o principal problema social ou político no qual você está trabalhando? 



 O seu uso de tecnologia e dados está lhe auxiliando a lidar com esse problema? Se sim, como? Se não, por que você acha que isso está acontecendo? 



 Seu uso cotidiano de tecnologia e dados está lhe auxiliando a se conectar com indivíduos ou instituições importantes para o seu trabalho? 



 A forma como você usa tecnologia e dados está impactando sua carga de trabalho? Está fazendo seu trabalho mais fácil ou está criando cargas insustentáveis de trabalho para a equipe? Você gosta de usar ferramentas organizacionais?

 Tomando decisões – certificando-se de que os dados e a tecnologia que você usa estão de acordo com seus valores e sua missão  



 P5. Como tomamos decisões acerca de adotar novas ferramentas e/ou coletar dados?&nbsp; 



<p>Há muito a se pensar na hora de escolher uma ferramenta, e há muitas opções por aí – incluindo várias que você talvez ainda não conheça. Então, como começar a reduzir (ou expandir) as suas opções?</p>



<p>Em 2017, com base em uma pesquisa que fizemos sobre escolha de ferramentas em organizações da sociedade civil, criamos um <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/alidade-interactive-guide-for-finding-technology-tools/" title="">guia interativo para escolha de ferramentas chamado Alidade</a>, que guia as organizações da sociedade civil por meio de perguntas que podem ajudá-las a decidir que tipo de ferramenta tecnológica seria adequada para seu projeto ou suas necessidades organizacionais. Recomendamos que você teste!</p>



<p>Em geral, quando organizações estão buscando novas ferramentas tecnológicas, achamos que as seguintes diretrizes são úteis:</p>



 
 Pesquise as pessoas, o problema e, depois, a tecnologia. Analise o problema geral para o qual você acha que alguma ferramenta tecnológica poderia ser útil. Pense no seu público-alvo. Faça uma pesquisa e considere opções diferentes em relação a quais opções tecnológicas estão disponíveis. 



 Pense duas vezes antes de criar. Pesquise por ferramentas já existentes que possam fazer o que você precisa. Criar uma ferramenta totalmente nova pode ser mais complexo e arriscado. 



 Obtenha uma segunda opinião. Outra pessoa provavelmente já tentou uma abordagem parecida antes de você. Encontre essa pessoa e peça conselhos a ela. 



 Sempre faça testes. Teste pelo menos duas ferramentas, com as pessoas que você quer que as usem, antes de escolher. O teste destaca problemas logo no início. Também levanta questões que você nunca imaginou que teria. 



 Esteja preparado para o fracasso. Você não vai acertar de primeira. Tenha orçamento separado e se planeje para fazer ajustes regulares à ferramenta ao longo do projeto. 



 Reflita sobre o que você está fazendo. Tenha sempre em mente o que está e o que não está funcionando. Aplique o que você aprender ao trabalho da sua organização e compartilhe com outras organizações. 
 



<p>Certifique-se de que as ferramentas que você escolher também se adequam às suas necessidades de segurança. Quando estiver avaliando a segurança de uma ferramenta, considere o seguinte:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Qual é a política de privacidade da ferramenta? Que tipo de dados a ferramenta coleta e com quem esses dados são compartilhados? Quem tem acesso a quaisquer dados armazenados na ferramenta? 



 A abordagem da ferramenta em relação à privacidade e segurança é bem documentada? O que você consegue descobrir sobre os registros de privacidade e segurança da ferramenta? 
 



<p>Documente e discuta suas descobertas com seus colegas antes de tomar a decisão final a respeito de uma ferramenta.</p>



<p>Perguntas relacionadas: <br>– <a title="">Deveríamos buscar usar mais tecnologia/dados em nosso trabalho?</a><br>– <a title="">Como eu e minha equipe podemos aprender mais sobre tecnologia e como ela é relevante para o nosso trabalho?</a> </p>

 P6: Minha organização quer integrar novas tecnologias, mas ainda não encontramos a ferramenta certa. Deveríamos criar nós mesmos uma ferramenta? 



<p>Se você está familiarizado com o nosso trabalho, provavelmente sabe que muitas vezes defendemos a adaptação de ferramentas existentes para suas necessidades quando possível (chamamos isso de “reutilização de ferramenta”).</p>



<p>Nossa pesquisa nessa área ao longo dos últimos anos mostrou que reutilizar e adaptar ferramentas existentes pode ter muitas vantagens, como uso mais eficiente de recursos financeiros e aumento do acesso ao suporte para a implementação e manutenção.</p>



<p>Criar uma ferramenta do zero, por outro lado, pode ser um processo custoso e longo que pode levar à frustração: já vimos como ferramentas podem acabar sendo ineficazes ou pouco usadas, ter um custo alto inesperado ou demandar muitos recursos para serem mantidas ou atualizadas.</p>



<p>Mas se simplesmente não consegue encontrar a funcionalidade que a sua organização está buscando e você está considerando criar uma nova ferramenta, aqui estão algumas questões sobre as quais refletir:</p>



 
 Há uma necessidade real e identificável para esta ferramenta? Ela lhe aproximará dos seus objetivos de longo prazo? Criar uma ferramenta responderia a uma necessidade intensa que surgiu no seu trabalho ou a ideia surgiu por outros motivos? 



 Você tem os recursos necessários para criar a ferramenta, mantê-la a longo prazo e fornecer suporte constante para as pessoas que continuarão a usá-la? 



 Qual é a sua visão para a ferramenta no longo prazo? As necessidades ou problemas que a ferramenta está sendo construída para atender e resolver podem evoluir ao longo do tempo?

 P7. Como posso usar tecnologia/dados se meu acesso à internet ou à eletricidade não é confiável? 



<p>Se você tem dificuldades com acesso intermitente à internet, considere adotar ferramentas que permitam que você trabalhe tanto online como offline. Com o Google Docs, por exemplo, você pode <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375012?hl=pt-BR&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">permitir o acesso offline aos documentos</a>. Isso vai permitir que você continue seu trabalho offline e depois sincronize os documentos quando a conexão voltar. Algumas ferramentas de coleta e gerenciamento de dados, como <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">Kobo ToolBox</a>, também permitem que você colete dados nos dispositivos quando não tem conexão e depois faça o upload dos dados no servidor quando a rede estiver disponível. Para reuniões online em cenários e configurações de baixa conectividade, <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> é uma opção gratuita, leve e de código aberto para ligações apenas de áudio.</p>



<p>Se o orçamento da sua organização permitir, também recomendamos investir em uma conexão de backup; por exemplo, uma conexão de rede móvel à qual conectar seus aparelhos quando sua conexão de banda larga não estiver disponível.</p>



<p>Há duas formas de fazer isso: usar um modem de internet móvel ou usar um smartphone dedicado para criar um ponto de acesso ao qual outros aparelhos podem se conectar e compartilhar a conexão móvel. Aqui está um tutorial rápido de <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-android-phone-as-a-portable-wi-fi-hotspot-2377915">como criar um ponto de acesso móvel em um smartphone Android</a>. Você pode limitar a quantidade de dados usados ao compartilhar a senha de acesso apenas com aparelhos ou usuários essenciais.</p>



<p>Em casos em que a conexão à internet e/ou à eletricidade é intermitente e você está trabalhando online, certifique-se de que está salvando seu trabalho com a maior frequência possível para minimizar os riscos de perder trabalho.</p>



<p>Se por quedas de energia com frequência, adquirir um gerador como backup pode ser uma opção interessante, desde que você tenha os recursos organizacionais para isso.</p>

<p></p>



 P8. Como trabalho com pessoas desenvolvedoras e/ou especialistas em tecnologia? 



<p>Há muitos tipos diferentes de profissionais com os quais você pode trabalhar. Tipos comuns de profissões que interagem com tecnologia ou dados incluem:</p>



 
 Design de user experience (UX): Trabalha tanto com clientes (neste caso, é você!) como usuários para criar um produto que satisfaça necessidades diversas e seja fácil de entender e operar. 



 Design gráfico: Cuida dos elementos visuais que um site, ferramenta, app ou publicação usam e é responsável por criar a identidade visual (ou branding). Frequentemente trabalha junto com o UX designer para garantir que a identidade visual também funciona bem para as pessoas que são usuárias. 



 Ilustração: Cria ilustrações, ícones, infográficos e mais, que vão compor a estrutura maior que o designer gráfico e o UX designer criaram. 



 Desenvolvimento front-end:&nbsp; Implementa o design em um site, ferramenta ou app. Em particular, é capaz de programar os aspectos que os usuários vão ver e com os quais vão interagir. 



 Desenvolvimento back-end: Desenvolve e conecta um banco de dados ao front-end (as partes do site, app ou ferramenta que um usuário pode ver) e faz todas as tarefas não visíveis que preencherão o front-end com conteúdo dinâmico. 



 Análise/Ciência de dados: Extrai padrões de grandes volumes de dados. Também pode estar equipado com as ferramentas e o conhecimento necessários para criar visualizações de dados a fim de comunicar padrões importantes. 



 Sysadmin/DevOps: Mantém os servidores onde ficam o site, as ferramentas ou apps. Frequentemente é responsável por coordenar a identificação e solução de problemas se as usuárias encontrarem bugs ou erros. 
 



<p>Às vezes, as funções podem se justapor: por exemplo, você pode contratar uma pessoa que lidera o design e desenvolvimento de um site, ou uma pessoa desenvolvedora que é capaz de trabalhar tanto em front-end como em back-end.</p>



<p>Antes de contratar desenvolvedores e especialistas em tecnologia, é útil:</p>



 
 Ter clareza do porquê você quer criar ou adaptar novas ferramentas. 



 Identificar os recursos que você tem e dos quais vai precisar. 



 Lembrar-se de se planejar para manutenção a longo prazo. 
 



<p>No início de seu trabalho juntos, é importante estabelecer pontos em comum e uma terminologia compartilhada a respeito das necessidades e expectativas. Recomendamos criar um Termo de Referência&nbsp; para documentar e compartilhar necessidades e exigências do projeto. O Termo de Referência deve abordar, no mínimo:</p>



 
 O orçamento disponível para o projeto&nbsp; 



 O prazo necessário 



 Seus objetivos 



 Suas expectativas em relação ao parceiro externo 



 Quaisquer informações adicionais 
 



<p>Vocês também devem chegar a um acordo em relação a ferramentas, canais de comunicação, funções e responsabilidades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tudo isso pode contribuir muito para o sucesso do projeto desde o início. Algumas coisas que você deve fazer ao trabalhar com consultores, uma vez que o trabalho está em andamento, são:</p>



 
 Focar na clareza dos objetivos, grandes processos e marcos organizacionais para melhor apoiar a equipe/o projeto. 



 Fornecer feedback relevante e em tempo hábil. 



 Dar espaço ao e ter respeito pela expertise do consultor. 



 Tentar ser responsivo com as comunicações.

 P9. Minha organização faz muito de seu trabalho online, mas nossa colaboração nem sempre corre tão bem. Como podemos fazer para que a colaboração online funcione melhor para nós? 



<p>Sabemos em primeira mão que, quando se trata de colaborar online, encontrar a maneira certa de se comunicar é essencial – tanto para que o trabalho corra bem como para o bem-estar geral.</p>



<p>Idealmente, sua equipe terá uma seleção de ferramentas ou canais para usar (por exemplo, um mix de apps de chat, e-mail e ferramentas de gerenciamento de projetos seguros), mas é importante que cada um deles tenha uma função clara.</p>



<p>Com frequência, as organizações com quem trabalhamos&nbsp; usam tantas ferramentas diferentes que se sentem sobrecarregados toda vez que precisam compartilhar um documento, ideia ou mensagem. Se este for o caso da sua organização, separe um tempo para listar rapidamente todas as ferramentas diferentes que as pessoas usam para se comunicar – a lista pode incluir apps como Signal e WhatsApp, plataformas de mensagens como Slack e Mattermost, CRMs online como Salesforce, ferramentas VOIP como Skype, Zoom ou Jitsi Meet, e ferramentas colaborativas como Trello, Air Table, Asana e outras. Talvez você também use mensagens SMS ou ligações por telefone.</p>



<p>Quando tiver essa lista em mãos, sugerimos que se reúna com as pessoas com as quais você mais colabora e entrem em um acordo para tentar usar menos ferramentas. Dê um propósito específico a cada ferramenta: por exemplo, talvez e-mail seja para mensagens mais longas e que não sejam tão urgentes, ou para compartilhar documentos, enquanto programas de mensagens são para questões urgentes ou conversas casuais.</p>



<p>Quando tiver identificado algumas coisas que funcionam, documente! O registro garantirá que todos estão na mesma página e será uma ótima referência para pessoas novas que entrarem na equipe ou simplesmente para servir de lembrete dos processos/projetos.</p>

 Segurança e cuidado em foco 



 P10: Como posso garantir que toda minha equipe está usando as ferramentas (ou processos de dados) que escolhemos? 



<p>Mesmo quando estamos animados com uma nova ferramenta ou processo tecnológico para usar dados, de fato adotar novos modos de trabalho é difícil. Ao mesmo tempo, garantir que estamos usando as ferramentas acordadas (e seus protocolos e segurança ou proteção relevantes) é uma maneira importante através da qual podemos praticar o cuidado um com o outro nas organizações.</p>



<p>Um passo a ser tomado para ajudar todos a adotar uma nova forma de trabalho é garantir que a nova ferramenta ou o novo protocolo respondam a uma necessidade concreta e que todos saibam qual ela é. Isso significa que todos sabem que, ao se esforçar para aprender a usar a nova ferramenta, estarão mais próximos da solução de um problema que vêm enfrentando.</p>



<p>Ao mesmo tempo, é importante gerenciar as expectativas – as mudanças podem ser sentidas pouco a pouco, ao longo do tempo, conforme mais pessoas usam uma ferramenta ou um protocolo e se familiarizam com ela/ele. Isso faz parte do processo.</p>



<p>E, porque é um processo, é bom dar espaço e tempo para aprendizado, adaptação e discussão quando uma nova ferramenta é selecionada. Dependendo do que mais estiver acontecendo, as capacidades para aprender algo novo podem variar entre as equipes, e dar espaço pode ser a melhor forma de reconhecer isso.</p>



<p>Por fim, ouvir as experiências das pessoas que estão usando a nova ferramenta pode lhe ajudar a identificar maneiras que você pode ajustar a própria ferramenta, se for possível, ou ajustar como ela vem sendo aplicada.&nbsp;</p>

 P11: O que podemos fazer para manter as pessoas em segurança quando começarmos a usar diferentes ferramentas tecnológicas e práticas de dados? 



<p>Muitas das pessoas com quem conversamos estão curiosas a respeito de como podem incorporar a segurança e o cuidado em todo o trabalho que fazem – especialmente quando se trata de novas iniciativas tecnológicas e de dados. Ao vermos nos noticiários, nas nossas comunidades e em nossas próprias experiências situações como vazamentos de dados e ferramentas hackeadas, pode parecer desafiador adotar ferramentas ou processos tecnológicos com segurança.</p>



<p>Uma abordagem que pode auxiliar a fornecer uma base é a de Responsible Data (ou “dados responsáveis”, em uma tradução livre): a ideia de que compartilhamos um “dever coletivo de prestar contas das consequências não intencionais de trabalhar com dados”.</p>



<p>Algumas áreas a serem exploradas e que estão sob o guarda-chuva dos dados responsáveis são:</p>



 
 Práticas como minimização de dados (apenas coletar os dados que você precisa). 



 Conceitos como consentimento (certificar-se de que as pessoas são capazes de concordar de maneira livre, específica, informada e revogável com como seus dados serão usados). 



 Espaços relacionados, como segurança organizacional (uma rica área de prática em torno da definição de protocolos que podem auxiliar a criar segurança de dados/informações e bem-estar físico e segurança).&nbsp; 
 



<p>Se você não está familiarizado com esses tipos de práticas, há alguns recursos que podem ajudar – desde guias online até suporte do praticante.</p>



<p>Escolher ferramentas que priorizem sua segurança pode ser outro passo a ser dado. Com frequência, essas ferramentas não são tão utilizadas como suas contrapartes menos seguras, então essa pode ser uma oportunidade para consultar colegas com pensamento similar ou contatar um especialista em tecnologia externo em quem você confie. Algumas dessas ferramentas podem incluir:</p>



 
 Gerenciadores de senhas: Criar senhas fortes e exclusivas é uma parte fundamental ao usar a tecnologia com mais segurança. Gerenciadores de senha podem tanto acompanhar suas senhas usadas como ajudá-lo a criar senhas fortes. <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords" title="">Saiba</a> mais aqui. 



 Ferramentas de comunicação mais seguras: Muitas das mensagens que enviamos digitalmente não são criptografadas, o que significa que, se alguém tentar interceptá-las, poderia ler o conteúdo. Ferramentas de comunicação mais seguras oferecem criptografia, tornando mais difícil que pessoas leiam o conteúdo de suas mensagens. Você pode <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/resources-key-considerations/#securityfeatures" title="">aprender mais aqui</a>, ou entrar em contato conosco para auxílio a respeito de adoção de novas ferramentas. 



 Redes privadas virtuais: Uma VPN (virtual private network, em inglês) é uma ferramenta que pode ajudar a proteger sua atividade na web contra vigilância na rede de internet que você está usando. Escolher a VPN certa – e conhecer suas limitações – é crucial, e depende do contexto no qual você está inserido (em qual país está, qual VPN escolheu etc.). Ao mesmo tempo, escolher a VPN certa para a sua situação pode ser complexo, então <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you" title="">se informe mais aqui</a> e não hesite em entrar em contato conosco para obter ajuda. 
 



<p>Sempre tenha em mente que segurança é uma mistura tanto de ferramentas como de práticas. É importante ter as ferramentas corretas, mas é igualmente importante usá-las do jeito correto e construir práticas internas fortes quando o assunto for segurança em geral, levando em consideração segurança física e psicológica também.</p>

 Exploraciones iniciales – pantallazo inicial del panorama tecnológico y de datos 



 P1: Nuestros pares parecen estar usando más tecnología/datos, ¿deberíamos considerar incrementar su uso también en nuestro trabajo? 



<p>La respuesta aquí realmente dependerá del contexto. La tecnología puede ayudarte a organizar el trabajo y las tareas diarias, permitir una comunicación más segura, recopilar y administrar información, y reducir costos y liberar recursos, entre otras cosas. Pero si la tecnología se usa de manera ineficaz o no estratégica, también puede comprometer tu capacidad para hacer el trabajo de manera segura y efectiva.</p>



<p>Por ejemplo, si tu organización está recopilando relatos de primera mano sobre violaciones de derechos humanos en áreas con poca conectividad a Internet/móvil, la adopción de una herramienta de recopilación de datos que requiera una conexión a Internet dificultará tu trabajo y afectará negativamente la capacidad para cumplir tu misión.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Usada de manera no estratégica, la tecnología también puede exponerte a ti y a tus colegas, a nuevas vulnerabilidades y riesgos. Por ejemplo, si te encuentras en un contexto donde la vigilancia gubernamental de la sociedad civil es común, y estás utilizando herramientas que no protegen adecuadamente tus comunicaciones, eso puede comprometer tu trabajo y seguridad.</p>



<p>Para asegurarte de usar la tecnología de manera estratégica y responsable, tómate un tiempo para pensar sobre el modo en que adoptar nuevas tecnologías o recopilar más datos podría fortalecer o debilitar tu trabajo. Antes de adoptar cualquier herramienta o plataforma nueva, intenta desarrollar tu capacidad interna, ponte en contacto con colegas u otras organizaciones que respetes.</p>

 P2: ¿Cómo podemos mi equipo y yo aprender más sobre tecnología y cómo ese aprendizaje es relevante para nuestro trabajo?  



<p>Las tecnologías digitales evolucionan rápidamente, al igual que los debates y las conversaciones sobre los posibles beneficios y efectos nocivos del uso de herramientas y plataformas específicas. Cuando tratamos de aprender más sobre tecnología, encontramos que es más útil enfocarse en dos aspectos:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Trabajar para <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">desarrollar la intuición técnica del personal de manera paulatina y progresiva</a> (inglés), y convertir ese objetivo en una prioridad de todo el equipo tanto como sea posible (a diferencia de un trabajo de una sola persona). 



 En lugar de buscar <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/understanding-people-before-creating-new-tech/">herramientas da moda</a> (inglés), primero tratar de identificar cómo la tecnología y los datos podría <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reconnecting-with-your-purpose-reaching-for-impact/">fortalecer tu trabajo principal</a> (inglés). 
 



<p>Cuando se trata de nuevas herramientas y aplicaciones, hay mucha información en línea que puede ser atractiva, pero puede ser difícil identificar qué es relevante para ti y qué no.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Para entender más fácilmente la información relacionada con la tecnología, comienza primero con el problema que estás tratando de comprender o abordar. Además, si puedes, comunícate con profesionales de ideas afines que puedan tener contextos o misiones similares a los tuyos y aprende más sobre las herramientas que están usando (¡y cuáles han sido sus éxitos y fracasos!).</p>

 P3: Mi organización cree que es hora de comenzar a usar más tecnología y datos en nuestro trabajo. ¿Dónde empezamos?  



<p>¡Primero consigue una perspectiva general clara de lo que ya estás usando! La mayoría de las organizaciones ya están utilizando al menos algo de tecnología y datos para respaldar su trabajo, desde herramientas cotidianas como el correo electrónico o la mensajería instantánea, hasta herramientas y bases de datos de CRM. A continuación, encontrarás una breve lista de preguntas que pueden servir como ejercicio inicial para mapear las formas en que estás utilizando la tecnología y los datos en tu trabajo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nota: parte de la información recopilada mediante este ejercicio de mapeo puede ser confidencial: antes de comenzar, asegúrate de guardar tus notas en un lugar seguro y de compartirlas solo con las personas que necesitan acceso a ellas.</p>



 
 ¿Qué herramientas utilizas actualmente para tu trabajo?
 
 ¿Qué plataformas/herramientas usan tú y tu equipo en sus comunicaciones? Estas podrían incluir correo electrónico, mensajería instantánea, redes sociales, SMS y sitios web, por nombrar algunos. 



 ¿Cómo almacenas y administras tus archivos y documentos? ¿Qué plataformas usas? ¿Todo el&nbsp; equipo usa las mismas plataformas? 



 ¿Estás trabajando en campañas públicas o trabajas en equipo con otras organizaciones? En caso afirmativo, ¿qué herramientas utilizas para el activismo, la organización y la construcción de la comunidad? 



 ¿Estás trabajando con alguna base de datos o plataforma de investigación? 
 
 
 



<p></p>



 
 ¿Cómo estás usando los datos?
 
 ¿Qué tipo de datos/información recopilas o generas día a día? Piensa en tus flujos de trabajo individuales y colectivos y enumera los momentos en los que recopilas o generas datos. Por ejemplo, recopilar información de contacto de las personas que ha entrevistado, tener conversaciones por correo electrónico o Whatsapp, tomar notas de entrevistas o reuniones, o realizar encuestas con las comunidades. 



 ¿Dónde almacenas los datos? Considera los datos que tienes actualmente y enumera todos los lugares en los que están (asegúrate de incluir todas sus ubicaciones remotas: correos electrónicos, documentos compartidos, etc.). 



 ¿Cuándo y cómo compartes los datos? Piensa en los momentos en los que necesitas compartir datos: ¿cuándo suele suceder, con quién los comparte y qué herramientas utilizas? Por ejemplo, puedes enviar hojas de cálculo o archivos PDF por correo electrónico, compartir documentos y actas de reuniones a través de Google Docs o compartir contraseñas a través de una aplicación de mensajería.&nbsp;

 P4: ¿Cómo puedo asegurarme de que las herramientas tecnológicas y los datos que usamos sean realmente útiles para nuestro trabajo?  



<p>En nuestro trabajo de apoyo a las organizaciones de la sociedad civil, a menudo nos enfrentamos a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">presunciones acerca de lo digital siempre es mejor</a> (inglés), y que cualquier solución tecnológica conducirá a una mayor eficiencia, efectividad e impacto.</p>



<p>Pero este no es siempre el caso. Cuando trabajamos con un socio de manera más cercana, a menudo comenzamos a evaluar cómo su uso de datos y tecnología actualmente se relacionan con su trabajo y contexto. Esto puede ayudarnos a descubrir cómo, o incluso si, la forma en que usan la tecnología está fortaleciendo su trabajo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Después de mapear qué herramientas está utilizando la organización y qué datos recopila, almacena y comparte, pasamos a una segunda capa de preguntas: ¿Qué tan útil es todo esto (o qué tan útil podría ser) en el contexto de tu trabajo?:&nbsp;</p>



 
 ¿Cuál es el problema social o político central en el que estás trabajando?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 ¿El uso de tecnología y datos te permite abordar mejor ese problema? Si es así, ¿cómo? Si no, ¿por qué crees que eso podría estar sucediendo? 



 ¿El uso diario de tecnología y datos te ayudan a conectarte con personas u organizaciones importantes para tu trabajo? 



 ¿La forma en que usas la tecnología y los datos está afectando tu carga de trabajo? ¿Está facilitando tu trabajo o la carga de trabajo está siendo insostenible para el equipo? ¿Te gusta usar tus herramientas de organización?

 Tomar decisiones – asegurándote de que los datos y la tecnología que usas coincidan con tus valores y misión 



 P5. ¿Cómo tomamos decisiones sobre la adopción de nuevas herramientas y/o la recopilación de datos?  



<p>Hay muchos aspectos a considerar al seleccionar una herramienta, y existen diversas opciones, incluso varias que quizás aún no conozcas. Entonces, ¿cómo empezar a reducir (o ampliar) tus opciones?</p>



<p>En el 2017, en base a nuestra investigación sobre la selección de herramientas en organizaciones de la sociedad civil, elaboramos un <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/alidade-interactive-guide-for-finding-technology-tools/">guía interactiva de selección de herramientas llamada Alidade</a> (Inglés), que por medio de preguntas puede ayudar a las organizaciones a decidir qué tipo de herramienta tecnológica mejor se adapta a sus necesidades. ¡Recomendamos probarla!.</p>



<p>En general, cuando las organizaciones buscan nuevas herramientas tecnológicas, hemos constatado que las siguientes pautas resultan beneficiosas:</p>



 
 Investigar a las personas, el problema y luego la tecnología. Analiza el problema general donde piensas que una herramienta tecnológica podría ser útil. Piensa en tu público objetivo. Investiga y examina las diferentes alternativas tecnológicas disponibles.&nbsp; 



 Pensar dos veces antes de construir. Busca herramientas ya existentes acordes a tus necesidades. Construir una herramienta completamente nueva puede ser complejo y arriesgado. 



 Conseguir una segunda opinión. Probablemente alguien más haya intentado un enfoque similar previamente. Encuentra a esa persona y pídele consejos. 



 Siempre hay que probar. Antes de elegir una prueba al menos dos herramientas, con las personas con las que quieres usarlas. Ponerlas a prueba permite detectar problemas. También te permite plantearte preguntas que no se te habían ocurrido. 



 Planificar por si falla. La primera vez puede que no salga bien. Prepara un plan y un presupuesto que te permita ir haciendo ajustes regulares a la herramienta a lo largo del proyecto. 



 Reflexionar sobre lo que estás haciendo. Sigue pensando en lo que funciona y lo que no funciona. Aplica ese aprendizaje al trabajo de tu organización y compártelo con otras organizaciones. 
 



<p>Asegúrate de que las herramientas que elijas también se adapten a tus necesidades de seguridad. Al evaluar la seguridad de una herramienta, considera lo siguiente:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 ¿Cuál es la política de privacidad de datos de la herramienta? ¿Qué tipo de datos recopila la herramienta y con quién se comparten esos datos? ¿Quién tiene acceso a los datos almacenados dentro de la herramienta? 



 ¿Está bien documentado el enfoque de privacidad y seguridad de la herramienta? ¿Qué puedes averiguar sobre el historial de privacidad y seguridad de la herramienta? 
 



<p>Documenta tus hallazgos y coméntalos con tus colegas antes de tomar una decisión final sobre una herramienta.</p>

 P6: Mi organización quiere integrar nuevas tecnologías, pero no hemos encontrado la herramienta adecuada. ¿Deberíamos construir una nueva herramienta? 



<p>Si estás familiarizado con nuestro trabajo, probablemente sepas que a menudo estamos a favor de adaptar las herramientas existentes a tus necesidades siempre que sea posible (llamamos a esto “reutilización de herramientas”).</p>



<p>Nuestra investigación en esta área en los últimos años ha demostrado que la reutilización y la adaptación de las herramientas existentes puede tener una serie de ventajas, como el uso más eficiente de los recursos financieros y el aumento del acceso al apoyo en la implementación y el mantenimiento.</p>



<p>Desarrollar una herramienta desde cero, por otro lado, este puede ser un proceso prolongado y costoso, con resultados decepcionantes: hemos visto cómo las herramientas pueden terminar siendo ineficaces o poco utilizadas, resultar inesperadamente onerosas o requerir para su mantenimiento y actualización del empleo intensivo de recursos.</p>



<p>Pero si la funcionalidad que tu organización está buscando no está disponible y, estás considerando construir una nueva herramienta, aquí hay algunas preguntas para reflexionar al respecto:</p>



 
 ¿Existe una necesidad real e identificable de esta herramienta? ¿Esto te acercará más a tus objetivos a largo plazo? ¿La construcción de una herramienta respondería a una fuerte necesidad que ha surgido durante tu trabajo, o la idea tuvo otro origen? 



 ¿Cuentas con los recursos necesarios para construir la herramienta, mantenerla a largo plazo y brindar apoyo continuo a quienes la utilizarán? 



 ¿Cuál es tu visión para la herramienta a largo plazo? ¿Podrían las necesidades o problemas que se está construyendo la herramienta para abordar potencialmente evolucionar con el tiempo?

 P7. ¿Cómo puedo usar tecnología/datos si mi acceso a Internet o a la electricidad no es confiable?  



<p>Si tienes problemas de acceso intermitente a Internet, considera la adopción de herramientas que te posibiliten trabajar tanto en línea como sin conexión. En Google Docs, por ejemplo, puedes <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6388102?hl=es">habilitar el acceso offline a los documentos</a> . Esto te permitirá continuar trabajando sin conexión y luego sincronizar los documentos una vez que se restablezca la conectividad. Algunas herramientas de recopilación y gestión de datos, como <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">Kobo ToolBox</a>, te permite recopilar datos en dispositivos cuando no tienes conexión, y luego cargar datos al servidor una vez que la red esté disponible. Para reuniones en línea en entornos de baja conectividad, <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> es una opción gratuita, de código abierto y liviana para llamadas de solo audio.</p>



<p>Si el presupuesto de tu organización lo permite, también recomendamos invertir en una conexión de respaldo: por ejemplo, una conexión de red móvil para conectar sus dispositivos cuando su conexión de banda ancha no esté disponible.</p>



<p>Hay dos formas de hacerlo: usando un módem de Internet móvil o un teléfono inteligente para crear un punto de acceso móvil donde otros dispositivos pueden conectarse y compartir la conectividad móvil. Aquí hay un breve tutorial sobre <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-android-phone-as-a-portable-wi-fi-hotspot-2377915">Cómo crear un punto de acceso móvil en un teléfono inteligente Android</a> (Inglés). Puedes reducir el consumo de datos compartiendo la contraseña de acceso solo con dispositivos y personas imprescindibles.</p>



<p>En los casos en que la conexión a Internet y/o la electricidad sean intermitentes y estés trabajando en línea, asegúrate de guardar tu trabajo con la mayor frecuencia posible para minimizar el riesgo de perderlo.</p>



<p>Si con frecuencia sufres cortes de electricidad, adquirir un generador de respaldo puede ser una opción útil, siempre que tu organización cuente con los recursos para hacerlo.</p>

 P8. ¿Cómo trabajar con personas desarrolladoras y/o expertas en temas de tecnología? 



<p>Hay muchos tipos diferentes de profesionales con los que puedes trabajar. Entre las profesiones que interactúan con mayor frecuencia con tecnología y datos se encuentran:</p>



 
 Diseño de experiencia de usuario (UX): Trabaja tanto con clientes (¡en este caso, contigo!) como con usuarios para diseñar un producto que satisfaga múltiples necesidades y sea fácil de entender y operar.&nbsp; 



 Diseño visual o gráfico: Supervisa los elementos gráficos que utilizará un sitio web, una herramienta, una aplicación o una publicación, y es responsable de diseñar la identidad visual (o la marca). A menudo trabajan con la persona encargada de diseño de UX para asegurarse de que la identidad visual también funcione bien para las personas usuarias. 



 Ilustración: Crea ilustraciones, íconos, infografías, etc., que vivirán dentro de la estructura más grande que han creado el diseñador visual y el diseñador UX. 



 Desarrollo Frontend: Implementa el diseño en un sitio web, herramienta o aplicación. En particular, es capaz de codificar los aspectos que los usuarios verán y con los que interactuarán. 



 Desarrollo Backend: Desarrolla y conecta una base de datos al frontend (las partes del sitio web, la aplicación o la herramienta que un usuario puede ver) y realiza todas las tareas no visibles que llenarán el frontend con contenido dinámico. 



 Análisis de datos: Extrae patrones de grandes volúmenes de datos. También pueden estar equipados con las herramientas y el conocimiento para crear visualizaciones de datos para comunicar patrones importantes. 



 Sysadmin/DevOps: Mantiene los servidores donde vive el sitio web, la herramienta o la aplicación. A menudo son responsables de coordinar el procedimiento necesario para resolver problemas cuando los usuarios detectan errores o fallos. 
 



<p>A veces, los roles pueden superponerse: por ejemplo, puedes contratar a una persona que lidere el diseño y desarrollo de un sitio web, o una persona desarrolladora que sea capaz de trabajar tanto en el frontend como en el backend.</p>



<p>Antes de contratar personas desarrolladoras y tecnólogas externas, es útil que:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Seas claro acerca de por qué deseas crear o adoptar nuevas herramientas. 



 Identifiques los recursos que tienes y los que necesitarás. 



 Te acuerdes de planificar el mantenimiento a largo plazo. 
 



<p>Cuando comiencen a trabajar juntos es importante establecer puntos de coincidencia y una terminología compartida acerca de las necesidades y expectativas. Recomendamos redactar los TdR (Términos de Referencia) para documentar y compartir las necesidades y requisitos del proyecto. Los TdR deben cubrir como mínimo:</p>



 
 El presupuesto disponible del proyecto. 



 La línea de tiempo necesaria 



 Tus objetivos 



 Tus expectativas para el socio externo 



 Cualquier información adicional 
 



<p>También deben ponerse de acuerdo en lo referido a herramientas, canales de comunicación, roles y responsabilidades.</p>



<p>Todo esto puede contribuir en gran medida al éxito del proyecto desde el principio. Algunos items de la lista de tareas del trabajo con consultores una vez que el proceso está en marcha son:</p>



 
 Concéntrate en la claridad de los objetivos organizacionales, los grandes procesos y los hitos para apoyar mejor al equipo/proyecto. 



 Brinda retroalimentación relevante y oportuna. 



 Proporciona espacio y muestra respeto por la experiencia del consultor. 



 Trata de mantener una comunicación frecuente.

 P9. Mi organización hace mucho de nuestro trabajo en línea, pero nuestra colaboración no siempre funciona tan bien. ¿Cómo podemos hacer que la colaboración en línea funcione mejor? 



<p>Sabemos de primera mano que cuando se trata de colaborar en línea, encontrar la forma correcta de comunicarse es esencial, tanto para trabajar sin problemas como para el bienestar general.</p>



<p>Idealmente, tu equipo tendrá una selección de herramientas o canales para usar (por ejemplo, una combinación de aplicaciones de chat seguras, correo electrónico y herramientas de gestión de proyectos), pero es importante que cada uno de estos tenga una función clara.</p>



<p>A menudo, nuestros socios usan tantas herramientas diferentes que se sienten abrumados cada vez que necesitan compartir un documento, una idea o un mensaje. Si este es el caso de tu organización, destina un tiempo para anotar rápidamente todas las diversas herramientas que usan para comunicarse; la lista podría incluir aplicaciones como Signal y Whatsapp, plataformas de mensajería como Slack y Mattermost, CRM en línea como Salesforce, herramientas de VOIP como Skype, Zoom o Jitsi Meet, y herramientas de colaboración como Trello, Airtable, Asana y otras. Quizás también usan mensajes SMS y llamadas telefónicas.</p>



<p>Una vez que tengas esta lista, te sugerimos que te reúnas con tus colegas, o con las personas con las que colaboras más a menudo, para de manera consensuada intentar usar menos herramientas. Asigna a cada herramienta un propósito específico: por ejemplo, tal vez el correo electrónico sea para mensajes más largos que no sean sensibles al tiempo o para compartir documentos, mientras que los programas de mensajería son solo para preguntas urgentes o conversaciones amistosas.</p>



<p>Una vez que hayas identificado algunas cosas que funcionan, ¡documenta los aprendizajes! La documentación asegurará que todos estén en la misma página y que sea una gran referencia para cualquier persona nueva que se una al equipo o para permanecer consciente de los procesos/proyectos.</p>

 Centrar esfuerzos en torno a la seguridad y el cuidado 



 P10: ¿Cómo puedo asegurarme de que todo mi equipo esté utilizando las herramientas (o procesos de datos) que hemos elegido? 



<p>Incluso cuando estamos entusiasmados con una nueva herramienta tecnológica o un proceso para el uso de datos, es difícil adoptar nuevas formas de trabajar. Al mismo tiempo, asegurarnos de que estamos utilizando las herramientas que acordamos usar (y sus protocolos de seguridad o protección relevantes) es una manera importante de poner en práctica el cuidado mutuo en las organizaciones.</p>



<p>Una medida para ayudarnos mutuamente en la adopción de una nueva forma de trabajar es asegurarnos de que la nueva herramienta o protocolo responda a una necesidad concreta y que todos sepan cuál es esa necesidad. Esto significa que todos saben que el esfuerzo que realizan para aprender a usar la nueva herramienta, los acercará a encontrar una solución a un problema que venían enfrentando.</p>



<p>Al mismo tiempo, es importante gestionar las expectativas: los cambios posiblemente se empiecen a notar poco a poco, con el tiempo, a medida que más personas usan una herramienta o protocolo y se familiarizan con él. Eso es parte del proceso.</p>



<p>Y, como es un proceso, es bueno dejar espacio y tiempo para el aprendizaje, la adaptación y el debate cuando se implementa una nueva herramienta. Dependiendo de qué más esté pasando, las capacidades para aprender algo nuevo pueden variar entre los equipos, y dar espacio puede ser la mejor manera de reconocer esto.</p>



<p>Finalmente, escuchar las experiencias de aquellas personas que usan la nueva herramienta pueden ayudarte a detectar eventuales ajustes que quieras hacer en la herramienta como tal o en el modo en que se utiliza.&nbsp;</p>

 P11: ¿Qué podemos hacer para mantener a las personas más seguras cuando comenzamos a usar diferentes herramientas tecnológicas y prácticas de datos? 



<p>Muchas de las personas con las que hablamos tienen curiosidad sobre cómo incorporar la seguridad y el cuidado en todo el trabajo que realizan, especialmente cuando se trata de nuevas iniciativas de tecnología y datos. Cuando en las noticias, en nuestras comunidades y por experiencias personales nos enteramos de casos de fugas de datos y de hackeos a herramientas,&nbsp; incorporar de manera segura herramientas o procesos tecnológicos puede resultar una tarea ardua.</p>



<p>Un enfoque que puede contribuir a la construcción de una base adecuada es el de Datos Responsables (Responsible Data): la idea de que compartimos un “deber colectivo de dar cuenta de las consecuencias no deseadas de trabajar con datos.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Algunas áreas para explorar que caen bajo el paraguas de Datos Responsables son:</p>



 
 Prácticas como la minimización de datos (solo recopilar los datos necesarios). 



 Conceptos como el consentimiento (asegurando que las personas puedan aceptar cómo se utilizarán sus datos de una manera libremente dada, específica, informada y revocable). 



 Espacios relacionados como la <a href="https://wiki.orgsec.community/">seguridad organizacional</a> (un área rica de práctica en torno al establecimiento de protocolos que pueden ayudar a construir seguridad de datos/información y bienestar físico y seguridad). 
 



<p>Si no estás familiarizado con este tipo de prácticas, existen recursos que pueden ayudarte, desde guías en línea hasta apoyo para profesionales.</p>



<p>Seleccionar herramientas que prioricen tu seguridad puede ser otro paso a seguir. A menudo, estas herramientas no se usan tanto como sus contrapartes menos seguras, por lo que esta podría ser una oportunidad para consultar con colegas de ideas afines o para contactar a una consultoría tecnológica externa de tu confianza. Algunas de estas herramientas podrían incluir:</p>



 
 Gestores de contraseñas: Crear contraseñas fuertes y únicas es una parte fundamental del uso de la tecnología de manera más segura. Los administradores de contraseñas pueden realizar un seguimiento de tus contraseñas y ayudarte a crear buenas contraseñas.&nbsp; <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords">Aprende más aquí</a> (Inglés). 



 Herramientas de comunicación más seguras: Muchos mensajes que enviamos digitalmente no están encriptados, lo que significa que si alguien los interceptara, podría leer el contenido. Las herramientas de comunicaciones más seguras ofrecen cifrado, lo que dificulta que las personas lean el contenido de tus mensajes. Puedes&nbsp; <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/resources-key-considerations/#securityfeatures">aprender más aquí</a> (Inglés), o puedes <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">comunicarte con The Engine Room</a> para obtener ayuda sobre la adopción de nuevas herramientas. 



 Redes privadas virtuales: Una VPN (red virtual privada) es una herramienta que puede ayudar a proteger tu actividad web de la vigilancia en la red de Internet que estás utilizando. Elegir la VPN correcta, y conocer sus limitaciones, es crucial y depende del contexto en el que te encuentres (en qué país estés, qué VPN elijas, etc.). Al mismo tiempo, elegir la VPN adecuada para tu situación puede ser complejo, así que puedes <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you">conseguir información aquí</a> y no dudes en <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">comunicarte con The Engine Room</a> para obtener apoyo.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Siempre ten en cuenta que la seguridad es una combinación de herramientas y prácticas. Así como contar con las herramientas adecuadas es importante, usarlas de la manera correcta y desarrollar prácticas internas sólidas en torno a la seguridad en general, teniendo en cuenta la seguridad física y psicológica también lo es.</p>

<p>When people talk about “killer apps,” they usually talk about a single monetization opportunity along the line of Web2 applications. The biggest drawback when it comes to Web2 is that a handful of companies hold an overwhelming majority of power and control over the internet which makes it very difficult for established organizations and newcomers alike to compete in that market. </p>
<p>MOBI and our partners are building a “killer technology” by using new global web standards to enable trusted, direct connections between parties; creating an even playing field for connected mobility and smart city applications. We call this the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/web3-infrastructure/">MOBI Technology Stack</a> (<a href="https://dlt.mobi/citopia/">Citopia</a> and the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/">ITN</a>), a Web3-enabled cooperative infrastructure enabling ecosystem stakeholders to:</p>

<p>The TRAC token is the utility token of the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph that is getting deployed on Polkadot through the OriginTrail dedicated Parachain. Becoming a token spanning both Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystems has enormous potential, particularly in the benefits offered by the latest generation of blockchain features in Polkadot, such as native cross-chain interoperability and extensibility beyond the VM&nbsp;level.</p><p>The aim of this RFC is to outline the details of different approaches to technical deployment of the TRAC token on the OriginTrail Parachain and collect feedback from the OriginTrail community.</p> TRAC as a multi-chain token <p>Since its inception in January 2018, the TRAC token has been deployed as an ERC20 standardized token on the Ethereum mainnet blockchain as a limited supply, non-inflationary utility token fueling the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). Exactly 500 million TRAC have been created at the token generation event. Since then, the TRAC token has become crucial in enabling a variety of solutions used by notable global organizations as their data footprint constantly increases on the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>As a two layer system, OriginTrail has always been based on two tokens — the TRAC token as the utility token of the OriginTrail DKG (Layer 2), and the gas token of the underlying blockchain used such as ETH, Matic and xDAI (Layer&nbsp;1).</p><p>Earlier this year the OriginTrail community provided strong support for the launch of <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/">OriginTrail specific blockchain on Polkadot — the OriginTrail Parachain</a>, with its native OriginTrail Parachain token (OTP) providing blockchain utility on layer 1. Additionally, apart from OTP providing “gas” utility, its tokenomics are designed to directly incentivize network activity in the OriginTrail ecosystem. More information on the interplay between OriginTrail DKG and blockchain layers <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper">can be found in the whitepaper</a>, while detailed OTP tokenomics will be the subject of a separate&nbsp;RFC.</p> TRAC token deployment on&nbsp;Polkadot <p>With the launch of the OriginTrail Parachain, a highly scalable layer 1 blockchain tailored to the DKG has been successfully added to the OriginTrail ecosystem. This comes with the added benefit of native interoperability with the entire Polkadot ecosystem and any network adopting Polkadot’s communication standards.</p><p>Since the TRAC token is an Ethereum ERC20 token with significant adoption, it’s important to carefully consider its implementation in the new Polkadot ecosystem. In the previous request for comments <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges%20(v2).pdf">OT-RFC-12 OriginTrail Parachain Bridges</a>, the use of a third party bridge was deemed unsafe and a final decision alongside the community was made to teleport TRAC using the pre-audited SFC smart contract.</p><p>Polkadot enables advanced blockchain functionalities and customizability, and with the launch of OriginTrail Parachain the OriginTrail ecosystem became a direct beneficiary of features such&nbsp;as:</p>  Cross-chain message passing via XCM enabling Parachains to send arbitrary messages between each other in a trustless manner using the Polkadot Relay chain. This not only enables easy token transfers, but also execution of any arbitrary logic between chains. This opens up room for many integrations across the ecosystem, e.g. a transaction on the OriginTrail Parachain could execute a token swap on the Acala parachain or extend assets available on Moonbeam. More information on XCM <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm">can be found&nbsp;here</a>.  Secure bridging between Parachains via the Relay chain, as well as strong, trustless bridges to other ecosystems built as parachains rather than multi-sig driven implementations, which have seen numerous hacks in the previous year. The OT-RFC-12 focuses specifically on this issue and the transitioning TRAC safely to the OriginTrail Parachain.  Extensibility through “pallets”, enabling forkless upgrades directly on chain level (as opposed to being confined to the EVM environment and needing to fork the entire chain), allowing customizations and advanced features tailored to the use case of every parachain. Many pallets already exist for features such as governance, staking,&nbsp;etc.  <p>More information on Polkadot features and implementation details can be found <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/getting-started">here</a>. With this RFC we present two distinct approaches of TRAC token implementation on the OriginTrail Parachain (and therefore, Polkadot).</p> OriginTrail Parachain TRAC Deployment requirements <p>The end goal of TRAC token deployment on the OriginTrail Parachain is to achieve the following requirements:</p>  R1 — Human centric approach: appropriate measures and planning has to be undertaken to maximize the ease of use and create a simple user experience of TRAC in order to not hinder the value propositions of the OriginTrail ecosystem.  R2 — Maximized security: special care must be taken to remove any unnecessary complexities and potential points of failure to ensure the TRAC token economy is robust and remains decentralized. This includes both the technical decisions and implementations, as well as decision making in an open, public discourse (such as through the OriginTrail RFCs).  R3 — Native Polkadot interoperability: ability to utilize TRAC token across the universe of Polkadot parachains and ecosystem tools (such as wallets), leveraging the innovations and value generated by the Polkadot ecosystem. This requires native Substrate integration through relevant pallets (such as the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-integrate-assets">Assets&nbsp;pallet</a>).  R4 — Retained Ethereum compatibility: TRAC on the OriginTrail Parachain should remain compatible with existing Ethereum infrastructure and tooling, retaining its standard ERC20 form. To achieve this in the context of the Substrate runtime, a set of precompile contracts need to be deployed on the OriginTrail Parachain (to reach the EVM2.0 deployment).  R5 — Effective time of deployment: The time resources required for TRAC implementation to provide utility (in the context of achieving above requirements) should be reasonably low (and thus effective).  <p>In both proposed approaches, each of the above requirements will be graded with NOT SATISFIED, EVENTUALLY SATISFIED, PARTIALLY SATISFIED or FULLY SATISFIED.</p> Approach #1: Evolutionary deployment (from EVM1.0 to&nbsp;EVM2.0) <p>This approach would entail a transition from TRAC initially getting deployed as ERC20 token on the OriginTrail Parachain (indicated in scheme below as “Temp TRAC”), to reaching a Polkadot native TRAC deployment (“Full TRAC”) in the next step. This initial TRAC token would operate as a standard ERC20 token in the current EVM 1.0 environment on the OriginTrail Parachain (satisfying R4). However in such an environment, the token would not benefit from the additional features available from Polkadot technology (R3), and therefore would require a future token migration to a fully implemented TRAC in the EVM 2.0 environment on the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>The main advantage of such an approach would be the immediate availability of TRAC on OriginTrail Parachain as no updates to the current Parachain codebase are necessary (OriginTrail Parachain 1.0.x codebase versions). The main disadvantage of the approach is the need to perform a token migration once all features necessary for the Parachain native implementation have been put in place (1.1.x codebase versions). There are two general approaches to such token migration, both introducing a new set of challenges:</p>  User-performed migration (open ended): token holders would “swap” between the initial and fully fledged TRAC token versions through a “one-way bridge” contract, which would be responsible for minting “full TRAC” tokens. While satisfying criterion R4, this approach most likely leads to an “open ended migration” (both token implementations “living” on the OriginTrail Parachain for an undetermined period of time) as users could decide not to migrate for whatever reason, which is problematic in terms of Polkadot compatibility requirement (R3). Additionally, this approach requires significant adaptations to the implementation of OriginTrail DKG nodes which will have to manage working with both tokens simultaneously. The core developers assess this as the least favorable option with regards to time resource expenditure (criterion R5). Finally, the existence of two implementations for the same token would likely cause user experience hurdles for less tech-savvy users (e.g. asset publishers), creating problems in terms of requirement R1 and likely R2 due to additional complexity.  Developer-performed migration (close ended): in this option the core developers would retain the capability of “freezing” the “Temp TRAC” token contract implementation for a small amount of time in order to perform a “snapshot migration” from one contract to another (temp TRAC to full TRAC). This option removes some of the downsides of having two simultaneously living TRAC token implementations on the OriginTrail Parachain, however for the cost of necessarily pausing the operations of the entire TRAC economy on the OriginTrail Parachain for the amount of time needed for migration. This particular approach would still require careful planning and execution from the entire ecosystem involved in the TRAC economy on the OriginTrail Parachain. It is estimated that this migration approach would require significant time expenditure from all actors in the community and is negatively assessed in the context of criterion R5, based on the experience in previous token staking and teleporting activities. Moreover, the pausing capability introduces a problematic component into the token implementation due to enabling additional powerful token control capability on the smart contract level (potential single point of failure), problematic in context of requirement R2 for the period of time until the migration to a native Polkadot implementation (full TRAC). Finally, even with developer lead initiative in this approach, it would still require effort and caution from the TRAC community which is not favorable in the context of requirement R1.  Approach #1: TRAC token migration path from EVM1.0 to EVM2.0 (1a involving the “Bridge” contract, 1b performing a snapshot transition)<p>Approach #1 in terms of defined criteria then can be assessed in the following way:</p>  R1 — Human centric approach — grade: PARTIALLY SATISFIED — as both approach #1a and #1b introduce the need to manage two implementations of the same token and require additional activity from all end users of the OriginTrail Parachain, especially in approach #1a which doesn’t have a time constraint on the token migration. Given that OriginTrail Parachain is a new environment (with new tools, such as wallets) the community is slowly getting accustomed to, having any additional friction is seen as problematic.  R2 — Maximized security — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — While significant measures need to be taken to ensure safe transition between two token implementations, the approach does satisfy the security requirements as the process can be entirely based on smart contracts. However, additional steps and complexity inherently do add an additional risk component in the&nbsp;process.  R3 — Native Polkadot interoperability — grade: EVENTUALLY SATISFIED — with the evolutionary approach TRAC would start as a “non-native” Polkadot asset. The additional features provided by Polkadot would only be available post-migration.  R4 — Retained Ethereum compatibility — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — in both approach #1a and #1b TRAC starts as an ERC20-compatible token.  R5 — Effective time of deployment — grade: PARTIALLY SATISFIED — in order to reach the fully deployed state of TRAC on Polkadot, a significant time investment would be required to plan and execute the migration activities in detail, both by the core developers as well as by the OriginTrail community (estimated at several months). The partially satisfied grading of the requirements stems from the fact that it allows immediate deployment of the (non-Polkadot) version of TRAC tokens as no additional updates to the OriginTrail Parachain are&nbsp;needed.   Approach #2: Direct Polkadot-native deployment (EVM 2.0&nbsp;only) <p>The second approach would be to avoid the deployment of the TRAC token contract in the EVM1.0 environment (Parachain version 1.0.x) entirely, and proceed to direct Polkadot native deployment of TRAC tokens. With such an approach, the TRAC token would from the get-go have all of the benefits offered by Polkadot (as listed above) and would minimize the necessary coordination required by the migration activities detailed in approach #1, all of which would benefit from a better user experience and less friction.</p>Approach #2: TRAC token immediate deployment to EVM2.0 Parachain environment<p>This approach is favorable with regards to all requirements presented above:</p>  R1 — Human centric approach — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — since only one TRAC token deployment would ever exist on the OriginTrail Parachain there would be no migrations or potentially difficult operations the TRAC community would need to&nbsp;perform.  R2 — Maximized security — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — higher security is achieved through minimizing complexity and need of coordination (compared to approach&nbsp;#1).  R3 — Native Polkadot interoperability — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — advanced Polkadot features will be available immediately from the moment of token deployment, as the token will be deployed as a Polkadot&nbsp;asset.  R4 — Retained Ethereum compatibility — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — the TRAC token implementation will be performed in such a way that, apart from being a Polkadot asset from the Substrate perspective, it will remain an ERC20 standardized token from the EVM perspective.  R5 — Effective time of deployment — grade: PARTIALLY SATISFIED — even though approach 2 is not entailing the immediate deployment of TRAC on the OriginTrail Parachain, we estimate that significantly lower amount of resources are required for a fully fledged TRAC implementation in approach #2 (compared to approach #1), from both the development team and the TRAC community, due to no migration activities and code adaptations required from the DKG node side. The estimated deployment time is under 1&nbsp;month.  <p>Due to the dynamics presented above, approach #2 is the preferred option of the core development team.</p> Bridging TRAC to other ecosystems <p>Due to Polkadot’s native interoperability features, once implemented, the TRAC token will be available to the entirety of Polkadot and its parachains, as the Relay chain acts as a de facto bridge between Polkadot parachains. This will open up new opportunities for both the token holders as well as builders in the ecosystem to deploy OriginTrail in ways previously not&nbsp;seen.</p><p>The implementation of trustless bridges to other blockchain ecosystems is an ongoing effort of multiple teams and has been discussed in the previous OT-RFC-12. The necessary preparation and discussions with ecosystem developers and Parity have been ongoing in anticipation of the bridge deployment between Ethereum and Polkadot, as indicated in the scheme&nbsp;above.</p> Conclusion <p>This RFC presents the requirements and approaches to implementing the TRAC token on the OriginTrail Parachain, including the details of their execution according to the requirements. As core developers we invite the wider OriginTrail community to provide feedback and comments in the dedicated discussion on the OriginTrail RFC repository.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">OriginTrail Twitter</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain">OriginTrail Parachain Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-13-trac-token-deployment-on-polkadot-c709347583cc">OT-RFC-13 TRAC Token deployment on Polkadot</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), the research and development arm of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, today announced the launch of a program that seeks to engineer novel artificial intelligence technologies capable of attributing authorship and protecting authors’ privacy (Linguistic Fingerprint Technology).</p>



<p>The Human Interpretable Attribution of Text Using Underlying Structure (HIATUS) program represents the Intelligence Community’s latest research effort to advance human language technology. The resulting innovations could have far-reaching impacts, with the potential to counter foreign malign influence activities; identify counterintelligence risks; and help safeguard authors who could be endangered if their writing is connected to them.</p>



<p>The program’s goals are to create technologies that:<br></p>



  Perform multilingual authorship attribution by identifying stylistic features — such as word choice, sentence phrasing, organization of information — that help determine who authored a given text.  Protect the author’s privacy by modifying linguistic patterns that indicate the author’s identity.  Implement explainable AI techniques that provide novice users an understanding, trust, and verification as to why a particular text is attributable to a specific author or why a particular revision will preserve an author’s privacy.  



<p>“Each of the selected performers brings a unique, novel, and compelling approach to the HIATUS challenge,” said program manager Dr. Tim McKinnon. “We have a strong chance of meeting our goals, delivering much-needed capabilities to the Intelligence Community, and substantially expanding our understanding of variation in human language using the latest advances in computational linguistics and deep learning.”</p>



<p>Through a competitive Broad Agency Announcement, IARPA awarded HIATUS research contracts to the following lead organizations, which together bring more than 20 academic institutions, non-profits, and businesses into the program:<br></p>



  Charles River Analytics, Inc.  Leidos, Inc.  Raytheon BBN  SRI International  University of Pennsylvania  University of Southern California  



<p>The HIATUS test and evaluation team consists of Lawrence Livermore National Labs, Pacific Northwest National Labs, and the University of Maryland Applied Research Laboratory for Intelligence and Security.</p>



<p>IARPA invests in high-risk, high-payoff research programs to tackle some of the most difficult challenges of the agencies and disciplines in the Intelligence Community.
