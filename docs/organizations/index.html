 A Brief History of zk-SNARKs 



 zk-SNARKs, an acronym for Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, are a form of cryptographic proof that allows one party to prove to another that they know the value of a specific piece of information, without revealing the information itself or requiring any interaction between the prover and the verifier.

 A Brief History of zk-SNARKs 



<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zk-snarks-practical-applications/">zk-SNARKs</a>, an acronym for Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, are a form of cryptographic proof that allows one party to prove to another that they know the value of a specific piece of information, without revealing the information itself or requiring any interaction between the prover and the verifier.</p>



<p>The roots of zk-SNARKs can be traced back to the early 1980s when the concept of zero-knowledge proofs was first introduced by Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff. This revolutionary concept proposed the idea of proving knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself.</p>



<p>In the ensuing years, researchers worked to improve the efficiency and practicality of zero-knowledge proofs, leading to the development of non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs in the 1990s, a variant which did not require back-and-forth communication between the prover and the verifier.</p>



<p>The term “zk-SNARKs” itself was introduced in a 2012 paper by Nir Bitansky, Ran Canetti, Alessandro Chiesa, and Eran Tromer. This marked a major milestone in the development of practical zero-knowledge proofs, making them significantly more efficient and thus more suitable for use in <a href="https://lionsgate.io/main/">real-world applications</a>.</p>



 zk-SNARKs and Cryptocurrencies 



<p>The introduction of zk-SNARKs has had a profound impact on the world of cryptocurrencies. The most notable implementation of zk-SNARKs in cryptocurrency is in Zcash, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that was launched in 2016.</p>



<p>Zcash uses zk-SNARKs to provide enhanced privacy to its users. With zk-SNARKs, Zcash transactions can remain fully encrypted while still being verified as valid under the network’s consensus rules. This is a significant departure from Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, where transaction details are transparent and visible to all network participants.</p>



<p>In addition to Zcash, several other cryptocurrencies have integrated zk-SNARKs into their protocol to improve privacy, efficiency, and scalability. Ethereum, for instance, has incorporated zk-SNARKs into its protocol to enhance transaction privacy and improve scalability. zk-SNARKs are used in Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solutions, like zk-Rollups, which bundle multiple transactions into a single proof that can be verified quickly.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Horizen (formerly known as ZenCash) also uses zk-SNARKs to enable private transactions. Similarly, Coda Protocol (now Mina Protocol), uses zk-SNARKs to keep the blockchain size constant, ensuring high scalability.</p>



<p>While it’s difficult to give an exact number of cryptocurrencies using zk-SNARKs, as of 2023, it’s estimated that dozens of projects use some form of zero-knowledge proofs, with many specifically choosing zk-SNARKs due to their efficiency and non-interactivity.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>zk-SNARKs represent a powerful tool in the realm of digital privacy and have already seen significant adoption within the cryptocurrency sector. As privacy and scalability continue to be pressing issues in the blockchain space, it’s likely that zk-SNARKs and related technologies will only grow in importance. Despite the technical complexity, the promise of efficient, non-interactive proofs of knowledge that maintain user privacy is a compelling proposition for many in the digital world.</p>

<p>In today’s interconnected world, the concept of digital identity is becoming increasingly significant. One revolutionary approach that is gaining traction is Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs), a cornerstone of decentralised identity technology. In this context, we’re going to focus on one key aspect of DIDs – DID Delegation.</p>
 What are Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)? 
<p>To understand DID Delegation, we first need to grasp the concept of DIDs. DIDs are globally unique identifiers that are created, read, updated, and deactivated by their owner without requiring a central registry or authority. They are typically associated with a set of cryptographic keys, allowing the owner to prove control over the DID.</p>
 What is DID Delegation? 
<p>DID Delegation is a concept that allows the owner of a DID to delegate certain rights or capabilities to another entity. This delegation is done in a cryptographically secure and verifiable manner. It’s like handing over a digital power of attorney, where the delegator assigns some of their authority to another party, known as the delegatee. In the W3C DID Core Specification DID Delegation is described as:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <code>capabilityDelegation</code> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verification-relationship">verification relationship</a> is used to specify a mechanism that might be used by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects">DID subject</a> to delegate a cryptographic capability to another party, such as delegating the authority to access a specific HTTP API to a subordinate.</p></blockquote>
 Why is DID Delegation Important? 
<p>DID Delegation is crucial for several reasons:</p>
 
 Flexibility: Delegation allows DID owners to flexibly manage their digital identities. They can delegate specific tasks to other parties without giving up total control. 
 Scalability: DID owners can delegate responsibilities to multiple parties, making it easier to manage larger systems and networks. 
 Security: Delegation maintains security by ensuring only authorised parties can perform specific tasks. The delegator can also revoke access if necessary, maintaining control over their digital identity. 
 Privacy: DID Delegation can help enhance privacy by enabling the delegator to limit the information shared with the delegatee to only what is necessary to perform the delegated task. 
 
 How Does DID Delegation Work? 
<p>DID Delegation involves a few key steps and are described below using the <a href="https://github.com/OwnYourData/oydid/tree/main/cli">command line utility <code>oydid</code></a>:</p>
 
 Creating a Delegation Record: The delegatee creates a delegation proof using their private key and publishes it in the DID Log. This entry in the log record includes the public key and explicitly states the rights or capabilities to be delegated.
 oydid delegate --doc-enc z6M... did:oyd:zQm... 
<p>Note: the response of the command is the log reference (hash value) of the newly created records</p> 
 Confirming the Delegation Proof: While the first step only publishes a delegation record (that can be done by anyone) the DID owner needs in the next step to confirm / sign the delegation record for inclusion
 echo '["log-reference"]' | oydid confirm did:oyd:zQm... 
<p>Note: the input is an array of log-references to be included&nbsp;</p> 
 Using the Delegation: The delegatee can now act on behalf of the delegator within the bounds of the delegated rights. When they perform an action, they provide the delegation proof, which can be verified using the delegator’s public key. To retrieve all currently active public keys you can use the following command:
 oydid pubkeys did:oyd:zQm... 
<p>Examples for the use of delegation in the did:oyd method infrastructure are retrieving Verifiable Credentials from the online wallet or updating a DID Document itself.</p> 
 
<p>Here is an example DID Document with delegation information (for <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:oyd:zQmRTHTMPvbaEuvSDfsZZhWkMdaJNS2Zzy73sg3g4BzJo95"><code>did:oyd:zQmRTHTMPvbaEuvSDfsZZhWkMdaJNS2Zzy73sg3g4BzJo95</code></a>):</p>

<p>Why is participating in open standards essential?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the most common question I am being asked. The answer is quite simple: do you want to help write the rules of the game, or do you stand back and let the market and your competitors do it for you?</p>



<p>Here the metaphor refers to shaping the market, industry norms, and regulatory environment in which your company operates.</p>



<p>Here are several reasons why this can be beneficial:</p>



<p>Influence over Market Conditions: If you’re actively setting industry standards or influencing regulations, you can shape these to align with your business strategy.</p>



<p>Competitive Advantage: By helping to create the rules, you’re likely to have a deep understanding of them and can therefore design your business strategies to leverage them effectively.</p>



<p>Predictability: Being involved in rule-making can provide insights into future changes, allowing you to anticipate and prepare for them rather than react.</p>



<p>Reputation and Trust: Businesses shaping industry norms and regulations can enhance their reputation.</p>



<p>Innovation: In many cases, regulation can spur innovation. By being part of the rule-setting process, a company can better understand where opportunities for innovation might lie.</p>



<p>As with any open standard, this opportunity comes with responsibility. We must create fair, sustainable, and beneficial rules for all stakeholders and our global community.</p>

<p>By Harm Jan van Burg, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>My role as a Senior Policy Advisor on International Standards at OASIS Open often takes me to various conferences and meetings around the world. These days, many are conducted remotely, but sometimes it helps to be in the same room as your colleagues. This week, I’ve had the honor to help lead <a href="https://unece.org/info/events/event/371951"></a>the third working meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) <a href="https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/ToSTraceability">Team of Specialists (ToS) on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Traceability of Sustainable Value Chains in the Circular Economy</a>.</p>



<p>The conference (at UNECE’s historic and gorgeous Palais des Nations headquarters in Geneva) is attended by ESG experts from all corners of the globe. Government representatives, trade associations, industry professionals, and other international organizations were all present, demonstrating the significance of the topic at hand. I had the privilege of serving as vice-chair and moderator of a session on ESG traceability in supply chains.</p>



      



<p>During the meeting, I emphasized the importance of integrating ESG reporting and monitoring into existing industry practices. Our goal was to ensure that these new requirements, which serve important goals. wouldn’t create additional reporting burdens but instead become a natural part of existing trade and transactional frameworks. We also stressed the need for transparency and responsiveness to evolving customer demands regarding circularity efforts. By aligning these practices with established reporting mechanisms, we can achieve more effective and efficient traceability in supply chains. The work we do here is essential for shaping the future of ESG traceability and contributing to a more sustainable and circular economy.</p>



<p>One aspect that made this particular meeting unique was the way I chose to travel. I decided to make the journey south from my home in the Netherlands to the meeting in Geneva in my campervan. Not only is this a more sustainable choice, but it also provided me with a cost-effective solution in the notoriously expensive Swiss city. It has been quite an adventure, so far, navigating the roads and having my own office on wheels.</p>

<p>Verifiable credentials (VCs) are digital credentials that enable individuals to prove their identity and qualifications in a secure and tamper-proof way. VCs can be used in a variety of real-life scenarios, from representing a driver’s license and enabling secure access to your medical records to verifying college and university degrees and academic achievements.</p>



<p>Many industries, such as financial services, healthcare, transport, IoT, government, and education are beginning to adopt VCs to manage a sizable amount of sensitive and confidential information about their clients, including financial and personal data. But companies are just beginning to investigate what is required to comply with various regulations and standards to protect their clients’ information and maintain their trust. By adopting a standard for VCs, companies can streamline their processes for verifying clients’ identities and credentials, reducing the risk of fraud and identity theft.</p>

<p>Author: Mélissa M’Raidi-Kechichian. Additional contributions made by members of DIACC’s Outreach Expert Committee.</p>


 
 
 
<p>Digital identity aims to make our life easier, avoid long waiting lines to prove who we are, and access online spaces in a secure way while safeguarding our personal data. It also enables organizations to establish their online identity and protect users against online threats. Falling under the umbrella of the broad tech ecosystem, digital identity is evolving along with the responsible tech movement, itself growing and already impacting Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance, as seen in the principles of the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence and the EU AI ACT. According to the US based think tank dedicated to grow the responsible tech ecosystem <a href="https://alltechishuman.org/what-is-responsible-technology">All Tech Is Human</a>, responsible tech is ensuring that technology is aligned with the public interest, concerned with reducing the harms of technology, and promotes diversity in its space. The responsible tech movement may not be a framework but rather a school of thoughts, it brought many practitioners to wonder about the question of responsible tech practices regarding users’ data privacy.</p>
 



  
  
 
 


<p>Along these lines, a growing number of citizens (i.e., users), became aware of how precious and sensitive their personal data is, how it is being used, for better (easier and faster access to bureaucracy) and for worse (the centralization of individual identifiers in insecure and opaque systems, data shared without consent with data brokers, or fuelling Weapons of Math Destruction*, for instance), especially thanks to the work of scholars and data activists. The latest shed light on the social implications of AI in a vulgarized and accessible way. Scholars and activists explained the risks of technology and lack of regulations over personal data in plain English and by using relatable use cases, through <a href="https://alltechishuman.org/all-tech-is-human-blog/responsible-tech-documentaries">documentaries</a> and workshops.<br><br>The concept of “good” digital identity aligns with DIACC’s mission to provide the framework to develop a robust, secure, scalable, and privacy enhancing digital identification and authentication ecosystem for Canadians, but is yet to be defined and standardized by this industry. Building on Kim Cameron’s digital identity work legacy, better known as the <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">Laws of Identity</a>, this blog aims to explore the possibilities and meanings behind the concept of “good digital identity”.</p>


 
 
  
  



 
<p>“Good” is an adjective that seems to carry a subjective meaning depending on the point of view of a practitioner (or user, for that matter). Since the term has not yet been defined and standardized by the digital identity industry, we are interpreting the word good as a digital identity practice that is beneficial for most and does not harm or disadvantage any users. Before getting into the principles of good digital identity, let’s note that “consent” is a recurring term in this blog piece. In this case, consent refers to the clear and informed decision of a user to permit access to their data to a third party. This consent should not be transferred from one third party to another without the knowledge and consent of a user.</p>
 
 
 


<p>Principles. </p>



<p>The first principle of good digital identity is privacy, and gathers the first 3 laws of Kim Cameron on identity. Users should have control and consent over how their data is being used, and minimize data sharing to the minimum required to access a service depending on the context of use.</p>



<p>Interoperability, which echoes law 5 of Kim Cameron, should be a core component of good digital identity. Users should be able to choose between different providers of digital identity solutions, and these distinct entities should be able to trust each other in a common framework.</p>



<p>Digital identity should have a social and collective benefit rather than a solely individual benefit. Therefore, digital identity must be inclusive and serve traditionally marginalized communities that have been excoded** rather than encoded in digital “solutions” in the past. That means moving consciously and with care rather than moving fast and breaking things, until or alongside a legal framework that guarantees protection of users’ rights, integrity, and privacy.</p>



<p>Digital identity should be optional, as an alternative to traditional identity verification, until the widespread use of digital identity is proven efficient, safe, and secure for every user so that our traditional identity verification process gradually falls into disuse on its own. It is important to recognize that a number of people are worried about digital identity, what it means for them, and what it implies. In some cases, it is due to personal experiences as minorities (in the Canadian context, an example would be Indigenous communities specifically, who have a record of having been the victim of crimes committed by public entities), in others it is due to disinformation and unfounded narratives, or even lack of accessible public resources about digital identity. One might argue that it would be an avoidable financial cost if the traditional methods had a sunset date, rather than to invest in maintaining both processes. However, users should be left with a choice regarding digital identity.</p>



<p>Digital identity should be understood by any user, regardless of their background, in order for them to make informed decisions and consent, meaning that resources to understand digital identity and how it impacts a user must be available in plain English and use relatable use cases as examples. Explainability not only empowers users, it also gives less space for speculations that feed disinformation.</p>



<p>Fairness and trust should be the red line guiding good digital identity. Fairness and trust come from acknowledging and fixing mistakes. To do so, good digital identity should have a mechanism that bridges the gap between users and providers in order for users to share feedback and adapt its practices when needed and avoid ongoing unnecessary harm that have historically correlated with the implementation of a new technology.</p>



<p>Good digital identity should promote transparent data processes, storing, and use. Transparency allows for greater accountability and therefore also aligns with fairness and trust.</p>



<p>Scalability was previously formulated by Kim Cameron in his seventh law of identity. Good digital identity should allow users to share only the desired and necessary parts of their identity, and therefore be scalable across contexts and needs, i.e., following data minimization principles.</p>



<p>Regularly auditing digital identity solutions should be part of good digital identity practices. These audits should be comprehensive but also meaningful and relevant for the users.</p>



<p>Take Aways</p>



<p>In this blog, we explored what the concept of good digital identity could mean, following principles that would lead to a practice that is beneficial for most and does not harm or disadvantage any user. However, the concept of good digital identity should be collectively defined by practitioners in the field in order to standardize and adopt a definition. Beyond actionable principles, good digital identity should also promote a culture where a diversity of voices participates, and where users’ consent, choice, and control over their personal data prevails.<br><br>Definitions</p>



 
 * Weapons of Math Destruction is a term coined by data scientist Cathy O’Neil in her book “Weapons of Math Destruction: how Big Data increases inequality and threatens democracy”. The term describes mathematical models (algorithms) that attempt to quantify human traits and characteristics and have an opaque data sourcing and processing that, as a consequence, leave big scale damages on one or several communities. 



 ** Excoded is a term coined by Dr. Joy Buolamwini, MIT, in her work conducted at <a href="https://www.ajl.org/about">The Algorithmic Justice League</a> that she founded, that refers to the minorities excluded from the data that composes the code of models powering technologies. The excoded are usually the most negatively impacted from said technologies.

 Implementing Safe on dedicated Energy Web infrastructure simplifies the process of creating, configuring, and managing smart contract accounts on the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain <p>Over the last several years, <a href="https://docs.safe.global/">Safe</a> has emerged as the leading open-source tool for generating and interacting with customizable smart contract accounts on Ethereum-based blockchains. Within the Energy Web ecosystem, Safe has been primarily used to create multi-signature wallets and build custom transaction workflows. <br>Up until recently Safe was available as-a-Service under the global Safe web application (which is integrated with over a dozen blockchains). To simplify adoption for our members, Energy Web has been working behind the scenes to configure and deploy a separate version with default integration to the Energy Web Chain and Volta test networks. Today we’re pleased to announce that Energy Web Safe is now available at <a href="https://gnosis-safe.energyweb.org/welcome">https://gnosis-safe.energyweb.org/welcome</a>.</p><p>For users with existing Safe account(s), there are no impacts to account configuration or functionality.

<p><a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/x/kp7QB">Cardea</a>, a complete open-source verifiable credential ecosystem for sharing health information in a way that preserves patient privacy, has been accepted as a <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/participate/labs">Hyperledger Lab</a>.</p>



<p>Cardea emerged from a project to <a href="https://youtu.be/iTp8-MqL-Kw">share proof</a> of Covid 19 test status for entry to Aruba. Developed by <a href="https://indicio.tech">Indicio</a>, a leading developer of privacy-first decentralized identity and verification solutions, for <a href="https://www.sita.aero/">SITA</a>, the leading global supplier of IT to the air transport sector, the solution went on to win an <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-award-ceremony">EIC</a> and <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/events/supernova/2022">SuperNova</a> award for advancing decentralized identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cardea contains all of the necessary components to issue, share, and verify a variety of health information using decentralized identifiers, a mobile application, and a distributed ledger. The unique parts of the codebase were built on Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries and originally donated by SITA as the Cardea Project to Linux Foundation Public Health, where it was further developed to address the broader need for a complete open source solution for sharing health data in a privacy-preserving and secure way. (Read <a href="https://cardea.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cardea-White-Paper-V1.0.pdf">this white paper</a> for a deep dive into how Cardea works and some of the initial use cases.)</p>



<p>_____<br><br>Be sure not to miss our <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings">next meeting</a> on 5/11/2023 at 12 noon Eastern Time featuring <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-samis-31190a/">Sarah Samis</a>, VP of Public health Products and Platforms of GCOM, on vital records!<br>_____</p>



<p>Preserving privacy is a critical need both for digital health credentials and travel passes. A recent poll from IATA highlighted that 78% of passengers who took part in the survey will only use a travel health credential app if they have full control over their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data privacy and security are equally critical in healthcare. In 2021, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/03/31/2413675/0/en/Largest-Healthcare-Data-Breaches-Reported-in-February-2022-Confirms-Need-for-Network-Security-Based-on-Zero-Trust-Microsegmentation.html">93% of healthcare organizations experienced a data breach, while 57% of healthcare organizations have had more than five breaches</a>. By using a decentralized approach we are putting control of the end user’s data back into their own hands to store locally on their own verifiable credentials, reducing both the impact of these breaches and the incentive for bad actor’s to attempt them.</p>



<p>By becoming a Hyperledger Lab, Cardea aims to empower public health authorities to design, build, and deploy open-source, privacy-first, and simple-to-use digital health solutions. With this technology, the community can work together to reopen economies without people having to give up their privacy.</p>



<p>“With the migration of Cardea to Hyperledger,” says Heather Dahl, Indicio’s CEO&nbsp; “Indicio has taken the lead on privacy-first decentralized identity technology. And as a Public Benefit Corporation, we believe that open sourcing decentralized identity technology through Hyperledger Foundation will lay the foundation for a better, fairer world to come.”</p>

<p>About a year ago, we started a three-year project to examine and strengthen our own digital resilience and, in doing so, increase our capacity to support others. Since then, we’ve been <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/building-digital-resilience-is-an-ongoing-effort/" title="">reflecting about digital resilience</a>, making <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/" title="">changes to our tech infrastructure</a>, and <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/mapping-digital-resilience-challenges-in-social-justice-organisations-learnings-from-our-partners/" title="">supporting several partners</a> as they strengthen their own systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing I’ve noticed while talking to partners about digital resilience is that the term “digital resilience” can sound really appealing to some social justice organisations; while seeming a little too jargon-y, unattainable and even unclear to others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital resilience” has many definitions (including our own current <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-strengthening-our-digital-resilience/" title="">working definition:</a> “a set of practices that support the ability of an organisation to protect itself from – and respond to – digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of its members/individuals, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to the ever-changing needs and contexts of the organisation and its members.”), but the term doesn’t necessarily spark a crystal clear image for those who hear it for the first time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing what digital resilience looks like can be an important step for groups who want to strengthen their tech infrastructures. More than a jargon-y definition, digital resilience should be an achievable reality for social justice organisations.</p>



<p>So, in order to help make digital resilience a little more tangible, I asked my coworkers to tell me what came to their minds when they thought about it. Here’s what they had to say:</p>



<p>For Cathy and Lesedi, digital resilience involved having a plan for when things don’t go as planned:</p>



 
 

 



 
<p></p>



<p>“Digital resilience is knowing what to do next in case systems fail. It’s investing in our future selves while going about our day to day now.”</p>



<p>Cathy, Tech Lead</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p></p>



<p>“I see digital resilience as a dynamic process, in which organisations and individuals collaborate to create robust action plans: after identifying vulnerabilities, developing holistic strategies to address them.”</p>



<p>Lesedi, Technical Engagement Coordinator</p>
 
 



<p>Olivia talked about the ongoing process of choosing tools and practices that support safety and wellbeing:</p>



 
 

 



 
<p></p>



<p>“I see digital resilience as a process of continually strengthening online tools (and access to these tools) and digital security practices to stay safe online”</p>



<p>Olivia, Research &amp; Engagement Assistant</p>
 
 



<p>Laura emphasised how digital resilience is about building processes and culture within an organisation, focusing on increasing protection from risks and making values-aligned tech decisions:&nbsp;</p>



 
 

 



 
<p>“When I think of digital resilience, I think about building the processes and culture that enable an organisation to: anticipate risks, work more smoothly with technology, and align technology choices more closely with their values. It’s about weaving in holistic ways of using – and sometimes not using – digital technologies in the process of doing our work.”</p>



<p>Laura, Co-deputy Director</p>
 
 



<p>For Quito, digital resilience is about working your way towards being more adaptable and responsive to challenges:</p>



 
 

 



 
<p></p>



<p>“Digital resilience is about building the muscle of digital security, responsible data practices and broad-based digital literacy to be able to respond to a changing landscape of digital challenges.”</p>



<p>Quito, Research Manager</p>
 
 



<p>Lesedi and Steffania highlighted the importance of building sustainable infrastructures and engaging in long term thinking:&nbsp;</p>



 
 

 



 
<p></p>



<p>“For me, digital resilience is about having a proactive and adaptive approach to digital security. This includes learning from past experiences and anticipating future challenges in order to protect ourselves and build robust, sustainable infrastructures in the long term”.</p>



<p>Lesedi, Technical Engagement Coordinator</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p></p>



<p>“Digital Resilience to me is the ability to prepare for unexpected events in the present and in the future. It is the “behind the scenes” work that allows the digital day to day to run smoothly. It’s the ability to navigate through digital challenges in a smooth, informed and prepared way.”</p>



<p>Steffania, Resilient IT Infrastructure Manager&nbsp;</p>
 
 



 Reflecting about what digital resilience looks like to you 



<p>After reading what my coworkers had to say about digital resilience, you might be curious about what that would look like for your organisation. Reflecting about your tech infrastructure can be a good place to start.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can start with questions about the tools you use:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Are they aligned with your values?&nbsp; 



 Are they supporting you in doing your work,or are they creating more challenges for your team?&nbsp; 



 Are they the most appropriate options for keeping you, your team and the people you work with safe?&nbsp; 
 



<p>Other steps organisations can take to strengthen digital resilience include learning about <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/civil-society-digital-security-new-research/" title="">why digital security matters to your work</a>, adopting internal <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">policies for data retention, archival and deletion</a>, shifting to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/">privacy-</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/" title="">respecting</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/"> tools</a>, figuring out how to stay online through emergencies, getting more familiar with <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/takeaways-from-our-community-call-on-responsible-data-for-social-justice-organisations/" title="">responsible data</a>, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, building up your digital resilience can be a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/building-digital-resilience-is-an-ongoing-effort/" title="">messy process</a> – but <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/bringing-political-values-into-practical-tech-decisions-learnings-from-our-partnership-with-frida/" title="">so worth it</a>!

<p>Verifiable credentials can revolutionize how we store and share personal information. This technology promises greater privacy, security, and convenience in many contexts by enabling individuals to control their data. However, as with any new technology, there are significant challenges to be addressed by developers, implementers, and adopters if society is to realize its potential fully.</p>



<p>The comments and findings presented in this report reflect interviews conducted with representative organizations concerning the level of interest in using verifiable credentials in their respective organizations and industry sectors as part of their identity management offerings.

Such an increase in membership means we have a greater impact both within our own field and beyond. Community members are collaborating on projects and initiatives that have helped to advance our shared goals. We’ve also been able to raise our profile through events, community calls, and other forms of outreach. We feel that we are part of something bigger than ourselves, and that our collective efforts are making a meaningful difference in the&nbsp;world.</p> Increased participation cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>We’ve also seen an 11% increase in “active” engagement. The engagement activities we look at are whether or not people have introduced themselves, starting or commenting on posts, or attendance in community calls. More people are engaging and more people are engaging in multiple&nbsp;ways.</p><p>Our concerted effort to reach out to individuals and groups who had expressed interest in our community but had not yet become fully engaged has paid off. We have worked to have more structured opportunities for people and our pointed cadence has help us mature as a community. Our goal is always a more vibrant and dynamic community, with a wider range of perspectives and experiences represented.</p> Improved governance and decision-making cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>A key aspect of community maturity is the ability to make decisions and govern ourselves in a way that is transparent, inclusive, and responsive to the needs of all members. We’ve held off on establishing a more formal governance structure, choosing instead to work collectively, mostly in our monthly community call.

<p>OpenID Foundation is pleased to announce that the first set of FAPI 2.0 self-certifications have been published and can now be viewed on the <a href="https://openid.net/certification/#FAPI2">Certification Listings</a>.</p>
<p>We congratulate Authlete, Cloudentity, ConnectID, Ping Identity, and Raidiam for achieving compliance with the current FAPI 2.0 certifications and for being thought leaders on the leading edge of this important work. We are grateful to ConnectID in Australia who adopted FAPI 2.0 for their ecosystem and funded the FAPI 2.0 conformance test suite development, as noted in <a href="https://openid.net/2023/03/21/fapi-2-conformance-tests-available/">our announcement</a>. We expect further announcements of FAPI 2.0 adoption and additional certifications later in the year.</p>
<p>We also thank all these members and the FAPI Working Group for their valuable feedback on the FAPI 2.0 specifications and the certification tests. The conformance tests and certification programme are a vital part of ensuring interoperable, secure Open Banking and Open Data ecosystems.</p>
<p>The FAPI 2.0 specification has been through formal security analysis by the University of Stuttgart as <a href="https://openid.net/2022/12/19/fapi-2-0-announcement/">previously announced</a>. The Foundation encourages existing and future implementers to consider their adoption plans for FAPI 2.0 now as the current Implementor’s Draft 2.0 is mature and stable, and Implementor’s Draft’s are commonly selected by public and private entities to implement against. The working group expects the specification advance to Final before the end of the year.</p>

<p>In IDunion we develop concepts for wallet security with verifiable credentials. In the PDF below, you will learn about the three pillars of wallet security, the attestation process and trust model, and much more.</p>

<p>The three pillars of wallet security are:</p>

<p>1. Integrity of the Credential</p>

<p>2. Authenticity of the Holder</p>

<p>3. Authenticity of the Wallet</p>

<p>These pillars are important because they ensure that the credentials issued by an issuer are secure and cannot be tampered with, that the holder is who they claim to be and can prove it, and that the wallet itself is authentic and trustworthy. By maintaining these three pillars, trust can be established in the SSI triangle between the verifier, issuer, and holder/wallet.</p>

<p>More security-relevant use cases demand new requirements for trust in the holder/wallet relationship. One example of such a use case could be a situation where a holder is required to present their credentials to access sensitive information or perform a critical action, such as accessing medical records or transferring large sums of money.</p>

<p>In these cases, it is important to ensure that the holder’s authentication is strong enough to meet the requirements of the regulated use case and that their wallet is authentic and trustworthy.</p>

<p>This document was created by Paul Bastian from Bundesdruckerei in the context of developing a secure attestation service based on OpenID4VC flows. This flow was tested and presented at the Internet Identity Workshop with the Lissi Wallet.</p>

<p>We are pleased to include some late breaking additions to a revision 1.1 of this whitepaper shortly!</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased announce the final publication of the white paper on “Government-Issued Identity Credentials and the Privacy Landscape,” published here (<a href="https://openid.net/Government-issued-Digital-Credentials-and-the-Privacy-Landscape-Final">https://openid.net/Government-issued-Digital-Credentials-and-the-Privacy-Landscape-Final</a>). The Foundation joins with five other non-profits (the Kantara Initiative, ID4Africa, Open Identity Exchange, Secure Identity Alliance, Better Identity Coalition, and the Trust Over IP Foundation) along with a wide range of experts from civil society, government, and the private sector for this thorough assessment of the global privacy landscape in the context of government-issued digital identity credentials.</p>
<p>This paper is an especially timely as governments around the world seek to scale their existing digital identity credential implementations, or chart a path to deliver new digital identity credential programs. It seeks to offer a balanced, global view of privacy concerns by exploring laws, implementations, gaps, and tradeoffs facing the people developing these new ecosystems. It builds on the thoughtful work of other studies and concludes with tangible recommendations in three areas:</p>
 
 
 The Basics of Security and Privacy 
 Addressing Ongoing Concerns 
 Getting Ahead of Emerging Concerns 
 
 
<p>Beyond identifying issues, the contributors to this paper seek to point our concrete areas that will inform how to build more privacy preserving ecosystems, and what issues the community needs to continue working on together. This is a final paper, but&nbsp;&nbsp;those interested in taking part in future discussions and papers on this topic are welcome to share your interest to <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to lead editor Heather Flanagan, who has distilled a complex and rapidly changing domain space for the benefit of lay people and experts alike.</p>

<p>Andrew Shikiar, FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CMO</p>



<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-password/">Google announced support for simple and secure sign-ins with passkeys</a> for all Google Account users. This is a huge milestone in our journey towards a passwordless future. Why?</p>



<p>It’s been only a year since Apple, Google and Microsoft announced their commitment to passkeys with plans to expand support for a common passwordless sign-in standard created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium. Since then, Apple and Google have readied their operating systems for service providers to enable sign-ins with passkeys that sync across devices; Windows 10 and 11 have long supported device-bound passkeys in Windows Hello – and passkeys from iOS or Android devices can also be used to sign into sites in Chrome or Edge on Windows.</p>



<p>Additionally, service providers like PayPal, Yahoo! Japan, NTT DOCOMO, CVS Health, Shopify, Mercari, Kayak, SK Telecom and more are committed to or already providing passkey sign-ins. Google now joins them, and will serve as a great way for large swathes of consumers to become familiar with passkeys, while also helping accelerate deployments from other service providers.</p>



<p>Consumer Readiness On the Rise<br>The growing number of service providers supporting passkeys matches a growth in consumer awareness and readiness.</p>



<p>According to a new survey released today by FIDO Alliance, over 57% of U.S. consumers said they are interested in using passkeys to replace passwords, compared with 39% who said they were familiar with the concept of passkeys in FIDO’s <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/barometer-2022/">2022 Online Authentication Barometer,</a> released in October 2022.</p>



<p>Recovering or resetting passwords is one of the many hassles that consumers face. Only 9% of those surveyed report that they never need to recover their password – with 13% having to recover passwords daily or several times per week and nearly 60% reporting several password resets per quarter.&nbsp; It is little wonder then that 29% of consumers prefer signing in with biometrics (e.g. fingerprint or face scan) versus 19% who prefer to enter a password manually.</p>



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys are resistant</a> to threats of phishing, credential stuffing and other remote attacks often used to take over online accounts. Based on the survey, approximately 65% of people who prefer to use biometrics to sign in would be interested in using a passkey and nearly half (45%) of people who prefer to use passwords to sign in would be interested in using a passkey. This is another clear signal telling us that consumers want less friction and greater ease of signing into their online accounts.</p>



<p>Passwords Create More Friction for Online Transactions</p>



<p>Consumers are tired of the hassle and complexity of passwords and are ready to embrace passkey sign-ins, which enable them to access online services simply and securely. Passkeys can help reduce shopping cart abandonment and turn the tide against the ongoing plague of data breaches and identity theft.</p>



<p>In addition to security implications, passwords continue to be costly for online retailers – according to the survey, nearly 60% of consumers said they have abandoned their carts due to a forgotten password in the past six months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simply put, passkeys stand to dramatically improve consumers’ online shopping experiences – as well as their service providers’ bottom lines.</p>



<p>Perceived Password Risk<br>Despite the large number of breaches and warnings, many consumers maintain poor password hygiene, unmoved by the risks passwords pose to their digital lives. According to the survey, 70% of people use passwords that are at least one year old. Despite the known risks of phishing attacks and other security breaches, the survey shows that 21% of respondents believe entering their password manually is the most secure authentication method.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly 60% said they would not pay for increased security measures or official verification on social media platforms. Earlier this year, Twitter warned users they would lose the ability to secure access to their account via text message two-factor authentication unless they pay to subscribe to Twitter Blue. It seems clear from this data that consumers would naturally look to passkeys as a seamless and secure alternative.</p>



<p>To review the FIDO Alliance’s full survey results, click <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/research-findings-consumers-are-ready-to-embrace-new-authentication-methods/">here</a>.</p>



<p>What’s next?<br>Both the data and the increasing number of organizations rolling out passkeys shows that the future of authentication is here. But this does not mean the work is done. The FIDO Alliance and its members continue to iterate to improve the experience of passkeys.

Defamation campaigns. Doxxing.</p><p>These are just some of the threats journalists face in their day to day, especially women and journalists of color who are disproportionately targeted for their work. Online harassment remains one of the largest threats to world press freedom, with 73% of women journalists worldwide experiencing online violence in their course of work, <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unescos-global-survey-online-violence-against-women-journalists?TSPD_101_R0=080713870fab2000cebe8667e99a2979fc19b93b58b373fc77c69ded596f1527bfb7d18430e7dd3d087d106cc51430006e57bd6929665b27b4aea72ae8d136bd810b56d8454e9655add857ae7d41bef1bc5e69af718262623fe125321b82bc1b">according to UNESCO and ICFJ</a>. To combat this issue and preserve press freedom around the world, it is crucial to increase safety measures for journalists in online&nbsp;spaces.</p><p>In her work as a 2022–2023 RSM Assembly Fellow with the Institute for Rebooting Social Media at the Berkman Klein Center, journalist and press freedom defender <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/elodie-vialle">Elodie Vialle</a> proposed creating an escalation channel within social media platforms to better support journalists and human rights defenders harassed online. While social media platforms do have features like “reporting” and “blocking,” Vialle’s proposed system would provide customized support in emergencies and situations of severe online abuse such as doxxing or coordinated attacks. The “Escalation Channel 2.0” would act as customer service for journalists and human rights defenders, making targeted, trauma-informed support more accessible to journalists around the world with a focus on protecting marginalized voices.</p><p>“What I felt in my own experience is the feeling of being powerless when your peer journalists reach out to you being traumatized, facing a situation that no one can help with or that no one is listening to. I wanted to listen to them, and I wanted to find a solution,” Vialle said when I asked her about what led to the creation of Escalation Channel&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>As we talked, I thought about my own experiences as a young woman of color, GenZ journalist, and a student press freedom activist. Malicious online comments about my age, race, and gender are not unique to me, as these proliferate for young women and journalists of color everywhere. Online harassment is creating a chilling effect on free speech, not just through censorship but also through self-censorship.</p><p>I sat down with Vialle to further discuss her proposal, her work preserving press freedom online, and challenges with press freedom around the&nbsp;world.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/ja/@joeldevriend?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Joël de Vriend</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>Pratika Katiyar: How do you approach women, people of color, or younger, student journalists facing harassment? These are three different groups who receive uneven support and attention when it comes to harassment online. Do you find that focusing on women or other marginalized groups is effective?</p><p>Vialle: Women and marginalized groups are <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/5/2/mr-musk-we-need-twitter-guardrails-that-protect-lives-and-free">becoming deplatformed</a> because of online harassment. And, we have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">research in the US</a> showing that journalists of color are particularly targeted. Trying to build solutions to tackle this issue is a way to better enhance diversity. There’s a lot of interest in promoting diversity, but actually, it’s only a layer of communication if you don’t create the conditions to make sure that people can work safely within the newsroom. So acknowledging that women and marginalized groups are disproportionately targeted by online harassment, newsrooms that are committed to work on enhancing diversity can put in place better safety measures.</p><blockquote>There’s a lot of interest in promoting diversity, but actually, it’s only a layer of communication if you don’t create the conditions to make sure that people can work safely within the newsroom.</blockquote><p>Katiyar: In your presentation, you briefly discussed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/19/student-journalist-harass-arizona/">Taylor Lorenz’s article on how online groups and mobs are coming for student journalists</a>, who already don’t have a lot of protections. Aspiring journalists or younger, GenZ journalists are dropping out of the journalism industry in large numbers because of both online harassment and the tumultuous nature of the media industry right now. How can solutions combating online harassment help bring some younger journalists back into the field or encourage them to continue pursuing journalism?</p><p>Vialle: We cannot do our work as journalists without being on Twitter or on Facebook. We have to be visible and engage with our readers. As journalists, this is a tool we have to use for our work. I cannot just stop tweeting; freelancers need to be visible. The same goes for young journalists entering the field; they need their work to be&nbsp;visible.</p><p>I spoke with student journalists in the US facing death threats, and they didn’t have any idea how to deal with that. There’s two layers of action here. One is institutions. The institution or organization has to set up and implement safety protocols and training. And as always, we acknowledge that newsrooms today are struggling to survive, and that it is difficult to implement additional costs. So when we have these discussions about safety, we really want to acknowledge the limited [financial] constraints for student newspapers too. In universities, building connections between the existing support helplines to get access to therapists or getting a special connection with safety hotlines for students in journalism, because we do know that they face a higher level of risk. Students can also learn how to better protect themselves <a href="https://onlineharassmentfieldmanual.pen.org/?_gl=1*1jm7o6p*_ga*NDg3NDgzMDIwLjE2Nzc3Njc3MTI.*_ga_0RQGYGDH22*MTY4MjYyMTY5OS4zNC4wLjE2ODI2MjE2OTkuNjAuMC4w">using PEN America’s resources</a>.</p><p>Katiyar: There is a lot going in terms of press freedom around the world. The recent arrest of WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich in Russia is an example of a physical violation of press freedom, but there’s also a lot of online censorship in countries like India, where the government is blocking access to information. Additionally, in the United States, there’s so many news outlets shutting down or laying off staff, with BuzzFeed News being one of them recently. The landscape for the future of journalism looks very uncertain right now. What challenges do you anticipate in preserving press freedom around the world right now, and is there any&nbsp;hope?</p><p>Vialle: Today, journalists are facing, I will say, a new array of threats, between arbitrary detention, physical attacks, arrest, murder, online harassment, intimidation, and defamation campaigns. The situation is really bad for the journalism field. The fact that in democracies now, we are facing threats that are similar to the one we’re used to in authoritarian regimes, that’s also a signal that things are going&nbsp;badly.</p><blockquote>The fact that in democracies now, we are facing threats that are similar to the one we’re used to in authoritarian regimes, that’s also a signal that things are going&nbsp;badly.</blockquote><p>The rise of disinformation and the lack of trust in the media normalizes attacks against journalists. All these narratives developed by governments and enemies of the free press, trying to use journalists as scapegoats, leads to direct physical attacks. I observed this in France because we had some protests, of course during COVID. The rise of disinformation led to attacks on journalists and attempts to censor content. A <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news-powerful-and-privileged-how-misrepresentation-and-underrepresentation-disadvantaged">Reuters Institute report </a>saw that there’s a lot of disinformation that exploits the fact that underrepresented communities don’t feel served, they don’t feel represented well in the media&nbsp;outlets.</p><p>I want to give you a sign of hope though. We’ve mentioned the social media platforms relating to my project. These platforms are being used to amplify online abuse and gender-based violence, but but they can be a part of the solution as well, <a href="https://pen.org/report/no-excuse-for-abuse/">if they implement features to mitigate the impact of online abuse</a> and <a href="https://rebootingsocialmedia.org/2022/12/01/from-emergency-to-prevention-protecting-journalists-from-online-abuse/">proactively work with civil society on code signing solutions</a></p><p>Katiyar: Thank you for that answer and for your time&nbsp;today.</p><p>The theme for World Press Freedom Day 2023 is “Freedom of expression as a driver for all other human rights.” When freedom of expression is suppressed, access to information and all other human rights are put at risk. It is more important than ever to ideate and implement sociotechnical solutions to better support journalists who are attacked and abused online beyond the traditional methods within social media platforms. That rings especially true with the recent layoffs of trust and safety roles in the tech industry, specifically at Twitter, a platform known extensively for the presence of journalists.</p><p>Centers like Berkman Klein showcase how to best combat this pervasive issue: by putting practitioners — civil society folks, technologists — and academics together. But more attention needs to be paid to including young journalists. GenZ is chronically online, and solutions to combat online harassment should start at the university/journalism school level. That includes advocating for classes on online safety, working on public policy efforts in conjunction with social media companies to educate GenZ on online abuse, and pressing news organizations and journalists to prioritize hiring young journalists of color. Newsrooms highlight their innovation and diversity efforts, but those efforts cannot succeed if journalists are currently under threat and if the next generation is dropping out of the industry altogether.</p><p>Pratika Katiyar is a research assistant at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University, a student at Northeastern University, and a board member for the Student Press Law Center, a nonprofit that defends students’ press freedom rights.

<p>AMD, Dell, Google, Intel, Marvell, Red Hat, and Others Aim to Provide Orchestrated and Scalable Solutions for Large Data Center Operations and Vendors</p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 3 May 2023 — Members of OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, are working together to define a standard Network Data-Plane Function PCIe device (peripheral component interconnect express). The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/idpf">Infrastructure Data-Plane Function (IDPF) Technical Committee</a> (TC) will establish a high-throughput, low overhead operation and develop a standard interface that allows for scalable provisioning and orchestration. The IDPF TC will deliver the specification and a general model of a networking device attached to a PCIe, in which the software can work towards this device, regardless of who makes the underlying hardware.</p>



<p>The TC’s work will address the needs of both large data center operators (especially public cloud service providers) and vendors of host-attached networking devices such as network interface cards (NICs) and accelerators. The IDPF multi-vendor standard device will allow operators and vendors to be more efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As the network evolves, we need to define standard interfaces that scale to provide the performance, the advanced features, and the hardware assists needed by highly distributed applications. The OASIS IDPF TC was formed to meet those goals,” said IDPF TC co-chair, Anjali Singhai Jain of Intel. “A standard such as this would help the customer pick from a wider set of network accelerator providers; the providers would benefit from a broader customer base; and everyone would benefit from software reuse.”</p>



<p>“With IDPF, we hope to break new ground in a standard defining a virtual network device with modern hardware speeds and features. High performance is the device’s marquee feature; it runs on the ethernet, and will eventually run on remote direct memory access (RDMA),” said IDPF co-chair, Michael Tsirkin of Red Hat. “It’s designed to run on several operating systems, or on a virtual machine in the same way you could run it on a bare metal system. In all cases, you’re going to be working to the same model, and you will be able to compose it and do the virtualization in any way that you see fit for your particular implementation.”</p>



<p>Vendors will be able to avoid per-customer customization while still allowing feature extensibility and differentiation. Datacenter operators will have a scalable solution that can be orchestrated as a generic good, avoiding the need for per-supplier customization and constraints. Tenants will be able to get high-throughput, feature-rich networking connectivity over standard transports while being decoupled from data center operator concerns and constraints.</p>



<p>Participation in the OASIS IDPF TC is open to all through <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/OASIS-OPEN-MEMBERSHIP-AGREEMENT_TC-2023.pdf">membership in OASIS</a>. Networking software architects and implementers; operating systems device driver writers; PCIe network cards, infrastructure processing units, and accelerator vendors; original equipment manufacturers and original system/software vendors; operating systems vendors; data center operators; and others impacted by this work are invited to join the group.</p>



<p>Support for the IDPF Technical Committee</p>



<p>AMD<br>“We are passionate about solving the most difficult challenges faced by customers in the cloud through the inherent flexibility of data center processors, adaptive SoCs, SmartNICs, FPGAs and DPUs.

<p>Michael Pytel has years of experience in the manufacturing world from developing wheelchairs, greeting cards, shoes, poultry and meat products, and even rockets. Through all of this, he felt like there wasn't a lot of innovation in warehouses. His aim to change that is by building a platform that uses machine learning and AI from the ground up, rather than antiquated warehouse management systems that were built 15, 20 years ago. So what are these cutting-edge technologies that Michael has created and how do they lead to efficiency and success?</p> <p>Michael Pytel, Co-Founder &amp; CTO at Fulfilld, explains the importance of technology in the warehouse for mapping products, eliminating fork truck traffic, and how it all leads to success.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Key takeaways:</p>     <p>An optimized warehouse is one that focuses on reducing waste. Wasteful time, wasteful travel, wasted movements, and focusing on where you want employees to feel engaged and successful in the day. Fulfilld is focused on creating technology to structure the ballet in the warehouse where movement is optimized and there is no wasted travel.</p>     <p>Fulfilld is focused on creating a ‘digital twin’ for mapping out products in the warehouse. They take the CAD drawing of a manufacturing space, of a warehouse space, and load it into a computer model, and essentially generate their own version of Google Maps. It can create routes for employees to optimize their travel on a forklift or on foot.</p>     <p>Transparency creates efficiency. By having something be visible, you can optimize more! Fulfilld’s technology has given customers the ability to see where their order is in the process so they aren’t constantly wondering when it’s going to ship. This creates a great consumer experience.</p>     <p> </p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p>Our website - <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1 US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with guest:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelpytel/">Michael Pytel’s LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This month we kicked off our collaboration with the Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (<a href="https://cipesa.org/" title="">CIPESA</a>), a Uganda based organisation working on inclusive and effective use of information and communications technologies across Africa. Through our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/" title="">Matchbox Programme</a>, we will provide intensive support to CIPESA’s team for a period of six to eight months.&nbsp;</p>



 Get to know CIPESA: defending digital rights in East and Southern Africa 



<p>CIPESA was founded in 2004, in response to the findings of the <a href="https://www.comminit.com/dfid/content/louder-voices-strengthening-developing-country-participation-international-ict-decision-" title="">Louder Voices Report </a>for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development" title="">DFiD</a>, which cited the lack of easy, affordable and timely access to information about ICT-related issues and processes as key barriers to effective and inclusive ICT policy making in Africa. Since then, the organisation has been working to defend and expand the digital civic space to enable the protection and promotion of human rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among other initiatives, CIPESA&nbsp;has tracked the <a href="https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1656407/Tracking-Covid-19-and-Digital-Rights-in-Africa/" title="">impact of Covid-19 on digital rights in Africa</a>, contributed towards the development of the <a href="https://africaninternetrights.org/" title="">African Declaration on Internet Rights and Freedoms</a>, initiated the Africa Digital Rights Fund (ADRF), documented digital rights trends, and created the Forum on Internet Freedom in Africa (<a href="https://cipesa.org/service/forum-on-internet-freedom-in-africa/" title="">FIFAfrica</a>).</p>



<p>Learn more about their work on <a href="https://cipesa.org/" title="">their website</a> and social media channels (they’re on <a href="https://twitter.com/cipesaug" title="">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/collaboration-on-international-ict-policy-for-east-and-southern-africa-cipesa/?viewAsMember=true" title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cipesaug" title="">Facebook</a>).</p>



 Robust digital infrastructures and responsible data 



<p>Our work with CIPESA will be focused on strengthening their internal digital infrastructure and communications systems, which will include exploring self-hosted tools and adopting new strategies to mitigate potential security risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will also support CIPESA in implementing responsible data practices in their work, to support their organisational data management.</p>

<p>FIDO Alliance at Identity Management Day 2023</p>



<p>Everyone agrees it’s time to kill the password to better the overall identity ecosystem, but the question of “with what” makes things a bit trickier. FIDO Authentication standards are touted by the public and private sectors as the best tools to get us there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This presentation will help you to understand the importance of the authentication piece of the identity puzzle, find out about the latest trends and standards for simpler and stronger authentication, and learn what we all need to do to reduce the world’s reliance on passwords on a global scale.</p>

<p>Gitcoin Grants Beta Round kicked off last week, providing an opportunity for developers and creators to raise funds for their projects by connecting with potential donors. The platform has been instrumental in supporting open-source projects and fostering innovation in the Web3 ecosystem over its past grants rounds, with over<a href="https://impact.gitcoin.co/?ref=blog.ceramic.network"> $50,000,000</a> donated toward public goods.</p><p>Gitcoin created <a href="https://passport.gitcoin.co/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Passport</a> in 2021—a reputation system integrated with <a href="https://docs.passport.gitcoin.co/get-started/how-it-works?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>—to ensure that each vote cast during the Gitcoin Grants rounds are linked to a unique human. Since then, the use cases have expanded to help a plurality of communities better detect when a wallet is linked to a unique human. Gitcoin Passport offers critical scoring mechanisms to keep Web3 communities safe from malicious actors. So far, Gitcoin Passport has been used in conjunction with a number of other data science analyses to prevent<a href="https://impact.gitcoin.co/?ref=blog.ceramic.network"> $3M</a> of fraud during the grants rounds.</p><p>As part of Gitcoin's efforts to decentralize and democratize the grant funding process, they are transitioning from a centralized grants platform to a decentralized protocol—<a href="https://gitcoin.co/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Gitcoin Allo</a>. This protocol and the accompanying dApps in Gitcoin’s Grants Stack will enable multiple grants rounds to run concurrently on-chain, empowering any community to permissionlessly coordinate its own grants program and create a more inclusive and community-driven funding ecosystem.</p><p>We're excited to see how developers leverage the decentralized Grants Stack, with tools like Gitcoin Passport, to launch and manage their own projects. Passport enables developers to verify the 'unique humanity' of a wallet that wants to access an application or project. The data collected is intended for broad interoperability for any system that wishes to issue or consume VCs to establish the unique humanity of an individual through their direct ownership of multiple accounts (Twitter, BrightID) or Web3 assets (ENS).</p><p>To determine who gets access to a developer's application, the new and improved Passport Scorer App gives users a 'Unique Humanity Score'. Developers can check out this<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bfkalDSvRDc&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network"> starter video</a> to integrate it into their application—helping to increase the trustworthiness of Web3 and onboard more users. Developers can also check out <a>ComposeDB on Ceramic</a> if they're just getting started building a decentralized application. </p><p>The<a href="https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-the-gitcoin-grants-beta-round?utm_campaign=Grants%20Program&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=255538070&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_6byUvX4Uqt99PsSYDsrM9PhCqGFLGkT4S4rcFWpWHzJjiv2_hzapREw5faI5eEL996_g2_KbL7TlgPuSnLZRAANZnSw&amp;utm_content=255538070&amp;utm_source=hs_email"> Gitcoin Grants Beta Round</a> runs from April 25th to May 9th, you can read more about quadratic funding and sybil resistance with Passport on Ceramic<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/gitcoin-builds-passport-on-ceramic/"> here</a>.</p>

<p>The RSA Conference&nbsp;further proved that passwords are a problem. The solution, we’re told, lies in using Passkeys, or cryptographic credentials that securely authenticate individuals without usernames or passwords and have multi-factor authentication (MFA) built-in. Several sessions at RSAC focused on the benefit of Passkeys, while also taking a look at the&nbsp;challenges still ahead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In our “post”-pandemic world, marked by climate crisis, inflation and threats of recession, the desire to do more with less seems reasonable – admirable, even.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within the humanitarian sector, recent data <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2022/12/01/financing-appeals-OCHA-global-humanitarian-overview" title="">from the UN</a> and the <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/red-cross-says-dramatic-budget-shortfall-looming-5fade615" title="">ICRC shows</a> that available funding falls far short of what’s actually needed to meet existing and expected crises, and the needs are growing. An estimated 339 million people will require some form of humanitarian aid in 2023, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/dec/01/one-in-23-people-will-require-humanitarian-relief-in-2023-un-warns" title="">according to the UN</a>, who are also <a href="https://www.wfpusa.org/articles/global-food-crisis-10-countries-suffering-the-most-from-hunger/" title="">calling the current global food crisis</a> the “largest in modern history.” Impacts from the climate crisis, ongoing international conflicts, national violence and human rights violations have driven forcible displacement, with <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/insights/explainers/100-million-forcibly-displaced.html" title="">over 100 million people</a> forced to leave their homes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, here, where the need to do more with less is urgent, we’ve seen a lot of hope that emerging technologies can make for <a href="https://www.mercycorps.org/blog/tech-humanitarian-aid" title="">“smarter and faster” disaster response,</a> create <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/digital-promise-frontline-practice-new-and-emerging-technologies-humanitarian-action" title="">greater impact with fewer resources</a>, and even <a href="https://centre.humdata.org/predictive-analytics/" title="">anticipate crises before they strike</a>. In some cases, as we found in our 2021 research on the <a href="https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/Predictive-Analytics-Working-Paper.pdf" title="">use of predictive analytics</a>, there is emerging evidence of these benefits. However, it is not straightforward; nor are benefits guaranteed.</p>



 We need more evidence on the realised benefits of emerging tech 



<p>Over the decade that The Engine Room has been providing support and conducting research, we’ve explored this question of how, in practice, different digital technologies can augment the work of humanitarian organisations.</p>



<p>We examined the potential of <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Engine-Room-Oxfam-Biometrics-Review.pdf" title="">biometric technology use in aid</a> – resulting in Oxfam choosing to enter a temporary moratorium on adopting the technology in order to take more time to understand potential risks. We’ve documented the lived experiences of different impacted communities and refugee populations as they engage with the <a href="https://digitalid.theengineroom.org/" title="">digital ID systems</a> needed to access aid and government benefits. We’ve taken deep dives on <a href="https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/Predictive-Analytics-Working-Paper.pdf" title="">predictive analytics</a>, socially assistive robotics and chatbots (forthcoming). We’ve developed ethical frameworks for engaging in technological innovation, documented efforts to deeply ingrain responsible data practices into workflows, and <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/tools-for-ethical-decision-making-with-geo-located-data/" title="">built actionable tools for ethical decision-making</a>.</p>



<p>Our findings paint emerging technologies’ impact as mixed at best – clear-cut cases of benefits “outweighing” harms are few and there’s a clear need for a more accurate accounting of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/opinion/data-humanitarian-aid.html" title="">benefits of these systems versus the costs to fundamental rights</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research we’ve done, instead, highlights the need to approach each situation holistically, considering sustainability needs, staff and resource constraints, localisation, root-level problems and integration with existing efforts. Each wave of shiny new technology brings additional cost and complexity – more efficiency or improved outcomes are never guaranteed.</p>



 What can we do?&nbsp; 



<p>We’ve found that adopting an emerging technology, adapting it to a unique and quickly evolving context and implementing safeguards requires serious time, financial and human resource costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their quest for efficiency, then, humanitarians may end up investing a great deal of resources into sometimes unproven solutions without a clear return on investment, redirecting attention and resources from other (perhaps less technologically “cutting edge”) programming that’s more time-tested. Though these costs are not a reason in and of themselves to avoid adopting a new technology, they do point to a need for more research about the actual impacts these technologies have, especially as weighed against the costs and risks.</p>



<p>Learning from our research, several trends emerge. These point to key considerations to keep in mind to ensure tech interventions meet short-term real needs in a sustainable manner. Among other things, we’ve seen:</p>



 
 It’s always worth digging deeper into the problem that one is trying to address with technical solutions. Tech interventions can masquerade as solutions to root-level problems, while actually being a band-aid. Often, the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/innovation-is-not-for-free/" title="">lowest-resource, highest-impact solution</a> is not high-tech. 
 



<p></p>



 
 There’s a need to be realistic about the upfront and ongoing human resource cost of adopting a new digital technology or digital process. As would be the case with any new intervention, time and resources are needed for learning, adaptation, iteration and ongoing maintenance. Though we’ve seen this generally recognised on a conceptual level, we’ve heard from practitioners that actual allotment of resources are typically undercounted. In particular, resources tend to be scarce around data protection/digital risk mitigation and ensuring that <a href="https://hhi.harvard.edu/sites/hwpi.harvard.edu/files/humanitarianinitiative/files/digitalcasestudy_5_digitalliteracy_final.pdf?m=1672678941" title="">frontline staff have access to resources</a> and time to learn new skills or adopt new policies. 
 



<p></p>



 
 We must account for the likelihood of new digital technologies actually adding inefficiencies into project resourcing and planning. As part of our forthcoming research on chatbot use in humanitarian contexts, interviewees shared multiple instances where the new technology had increased both start-up costs and ongoing work (e.g. by introducing a need to review all of the chatbots’ interactions to spot cases that were improperly addressed). 
 



<p></p>



 
 We must be clear-eyed about the costs of working with third parties, as there may be a mismatch of incentives, expectations and standards that jeopardises long-term sustainability or success. For example, in the case of the <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IRC_Report_R2_WebSpreads.pdf" title="">IRC partnering with mobile networks across several countries to provide digital cash aid</a>, a commonality across the challenges documented was a misalignment of practices and incentives between the IRC and mobile network operators. These challenges often resulted in delays and reduction in impact.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



 
 As with all new interventions, new digital technologies must be integrated into existing processes. As we saw in our forthcoming research on chatbot use, new technologies can&nbsp; perform badly when understood as a replacement for other forms of engagement, programming or communication. Instead, they should generally be seen as a complementary component of a larger ecosystem of tools. 
 



<p>Keep an eye on our blog for our forthcoming research and more cross-project findings at this intersection. As always, we would love to hear your ideas, research and comments!</p>

<p>A new analysis by password manager NordPass stresses that major companies open themselves up to security risks by using passwords that lack creativity. While password trends slightly vary each year across different audiences, the general take is that people continuously fail with their password management, and the world desperately needs to switch to new online authentication solutions such as passkeys. Various progressive businesses such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, PayPal, KAYAK and eBay have already adopted passkey technology and are offering their users password-less logins. It is thought that in no time at all, other online companies will start following this trend.</p>

		<p>How Institutions Can Take the Lead on their Digital Education Future</p>
<p>Long before remote learning became part of the norm amid the higher education community, many institutions were seeking solutions to expand their digital education capabilities. For several years, Online Program Managers (OPMs) have provided a suite of services, including course design and technology solutions, marketing and enrollment services, and academic coaching. This industry has grown substantially since the early 2000’s and quickly expanded during the pandemic when colleges and universities needed to bring their courses and services online quickly. Unfortunately, the digital learning options provided by OPMs are often costly and cannot be customized to meet the unique needs of each institution. Plus, many organizations have made investments in their own digital learning capabilities in recent years and no longer wish to outsource their online program management. Add in tightening federal guidelines and regulations on OPM providers, and we are seeing greater opportunities to foster successful home-grown digital learning programs.</p>
<p>Origin and Growth of OPMs</p>
<p>Outsourcing online program management and recruitment to OPMs often does not require upfront costs, but their educational and backend services are in exchange for 40-60 percent of student tuition payments. “The U.S. law bars colleges that receive financial aid from giving incentive-based compensation, which includes commissions or bonuses to companies or employees that recruit and enroll students into their programs,” explains Edge Chief Digital Learning Officer, Josh Gaul. “The Education Department considers tuition sharing to be incentive compensation, however, agency guidance released in 2011 allows OPMs that provide recruiting services to have such arrangements with colleges if they meet certain criteria. Without this loophole, OPMs would have a hard time existing at the current way they are built.”</p>
<p>In addition to the services they provide, many OPMs offer the upfront capital necessary to launch an online program. “After the OPM has built the program and an institution begins receiving student enrollments, they will take a percentage of those dollars as part of a revenue sharing agreement,” says Gaul. “In the beginning stages, OPMs faced the uphill battle of providing online students with services on par with what they receive on campus, so they had several risks to consider. Twenty years ago, launching an online program was expensive, with all the instructional, technology, and marketing costs associated with this endeavor. From an educational standpoint, many institutions were also concerned if the online education program would be on par with a traditional campus experience. In addition, an online program raised a host of operational questions and concerns. How is this program managed? How does it compare with in-person classes? For faculty that teach online, do they get paid the same amount for teaching in person? How does load look for faculty in terms of teaching online courses versus in-person courses? How does IT manage online programs versus in-person classroom digital technology?”</p>
<p>When online programs were beginning to expand in the early 2000’s, many institutions were also concerned of how this would affect their reputation. “Many people perceived online education as second rate,” says Gaul. “There was a worry that key constituencies, alumni, foundations, and hiring corporations would see an entry into the online world as a symptom of institutional weakness. Thankfully, these unknowns are not as mysterious today. While the OPM pitch was appealing over two decades ago, they have become a larger part of the problem, rather than the solution.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“Edge does not take a dollar from your tuition and all intellectual property and content that we create in collaboration with you is yours to keep, reuse, and repurpose however you want to in the future. Many institutions have similar needs, but we can customize your solutions based on your organization’s culture and unique processes, and our goal is to provide the services you need at as low a cost as possible. OPMs will continue to face regulatory risk and evolving federal rules, while Edge, being a non-profit organization, is solely focused on serving the needs of its member institutions.”</p>

		<p>Drawbacks of OPMs</p>
<p>Using an OPM partner can offer benefits, but with the evolution of the online education space, the challenges have begun to outweigh the advantages. “The cost of technology and services to build and run an impressive online program have dropped, but OPMs still expect schools to part with a huge percentage of their tuition,” explains Gaul. “High tuition is a critical problem in higher education and OPMs are adding to this issue. If you work with a traditional OPM, your students will pay $20,000 to $40,000 in loan repayments just to cover its profit. This is becoming increasingly hard to justify imposing that burden on your students and that cost locks you into a long-term competitive disadvantage and could cause your rankings to potentially drop.”</p>
<p>“Schools that find ways to go online at lower costs will be able to reduce their tuition costs and invest more in compelling programs and great staff and faculty,” continues Gaul. “Typically, an OPM’s contract with a college or university allows it to continue sharing tuition revenue for several years, even after the relationship ends. These long-term restrictive contracts can be very difficult to terminate and can extend between five and ten years with limited remediation options for institutions if enrollment objectives are not met. Many traditional OPMs also operate in a silo, so when they build an online program, they are not incorporating input and involvement from faculty and other departments. Instead of moving towards a more agile future, the OPM structure reinforces rigidity and does not support the high-flex models that are becoming increasingly popular among current and prospective students.”</p>
<p>Among the drawbacks of outsourcing an online program management to an OPM is the increased risk. “A traditional OPM invests its marketing dollars where it can make the greatest return, typically the programs are the least selective and most expensive,” says Gaul. “If an OPM discovers they can steer a student elsewhere with less expense or more revenue, your enrollment can suffer. Given that online programs are increasingly core to institutional missions, working with an OPM can mean adding an existential risk. A more subtle risk is when a traditional OPM represents schools in different parts of the country and will steer students in each region to their nearest client. This cuts the OPM’s marketing costs, while making it impossible for you to grow your school’s reach geographically or demographically.”</p>
<p>Due to the nature of revenue sharing contracts, there is no incentive to share the OPM’s strategies and data, particularly in marketing admissions. “There is a complete lack of transparency around what tactics are driving performance,” says Gaul. “This prevents a school from learning the operational analytical nuances of operating at scale and understanding why certain decisions are made and what is effectively attracting students to the institution. In addition, OPMs typically focus their efforts on the specific programmatic offerings with the highest profit margin and are highly selective in what they’re willing to support—which often does not align with an institution’s mission and individual needs. OPMs also may not align with a school’s culture. Some OPMs’ tactics taken on behalf of an institution may be seen as aggressive or not in line with the school’s ethos. Furthermore, some strategies can be in direct competition with tactics the institution is already employing to recruit students from non OPM-supported programs.”</p>
<p>Without access to the strategies and technology benefits, many institutions can be left without the capabilities, expertise in recruiting pipeline, as well as the data and insights into what worked and what it took to launch their online programs and grow their enrollments. “In a revenue shared agreement with an OPM, the company often has ultimate decision-making authority on non-academic processes,” shares Gaul. “This can cause friction with faculty and leave schools with no way to intervene and lead to less revenue generation over the long term.”</p>
<p>Launching Sustainable Online Programming</p>
<p>Since no one knows an institution and its business objectives better than its own organization, setting up and running a program management system in house without third party support can be an appealing prospect. “There are obvious benefits of saving money and retaining full control of developing your online program, but not every school has the resources, whether it is human, time, or financial to organically create and maintain online programs,” says Gaul. “Not everyone has a fleet of faculty and staff, instructional designers and technologists, enrollment management, and recruiters who are all working together toward a common goal with no delineation and no other responsibilities on their plate. This is why OPMs have had such success. Unfortunately, this is not a true partnership and you’re unable to gain access to a fully scalable system wherein you only pay for the services, features, and functionalities that you need.”</p>
<p>To help institutions launch and maintain sustainable online programming, Edge can support a successful shift away from OPMs. “Our team of expert instructional designers understand the methodologies, rubrics, and standards that go into creating high-quality curriculum rooted in industry best practices and research,” says Gaul. “This includes understanding compliance and instructional design and helping you grow your own methods and vision, not offering a cookie-cutter solution. Teaching and learning online is far different from traditional classroom learning and we help support your institution through faculty and student development. We can prepare your staff and students for this challenge through engaging student-centered experiences built to encourage online presence and active learning methodologies. Working in collaboration with your leadership, faculty, and current employees, we can help you scale up and build out more detailed programs that can be self-paced and supplement your current training.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Accelerating Digital Learning Efforts</p>
<p>Edge’s Digital Learning &amp; Collaboration solutions also include course and curriculum evaluation services to ensure courses meet all the standards for technology-enhanced education. “These assessments offer risk management and quality assurance for your online program,” says Gaul. “Through EdgeLearn, you can also receive learning space design assessments to evaluate and analyze campus learning spaces. Every face-to-face classroom now has an online or digital component, and we can offer assessments and project management services to help your institution build and support 21st century classroom spaces that meet your academic goals and technology strategies. When you partner with Edge, we work with facilities, academic affairs, IT, and enrollment management to determine the best use of the classroom space and how it fits into the larger infrastructure of the organization. Our goal is to find solutions that best fit into your current processes and procedures and find ways to improve quality and efficiency.”</p>

		<p>When Brandon Wagner joined The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) as a systems administrator in 2017, cloud technology was only beginning to be incorporated into their IT strategy. Two years later, the need to move more systems to the cloud became necessary. “Cloud migration began as one-off projects, but then the pandemic happened and our Basic Data Infrastructure (BDI) at the time was no longer sufficient for our engineering groups,” explains Wagner. “We needed an environment that could handle heavier processing, including graphical processing. As we explored our options, we decided on Amazon AppStream 2.0, and I was tasked with heading up this transition. I earned the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification and part of my current role as Cloud Operations Manager is managing the services we provide within AWS.”</p>
<p>Connectivity and Network Infrastructure</p>
<p>Cloud migration is an ever-evolving journey for many institutions and TCNJ continues to expand its strategies for leveraging the cloud for technology applications. “Originally, we were running all of our applications on-premises,” says Wagner. “Now we use Amazon Route 53 for our external Domain Name System (DNS) which responds to user requests for both AWS-hosted and local resources. When we expanded to AppStream for our engineers, it was to give them the necessary GPU availability to do modeling as well as other tasks that require a more powerful system. We expanded AppStream with additional fleets for special courses, and we also have a campus-wide deployment that has general applications available for students, faculty, and staff. Our team also deployed a storage gateway that we have linked to some of our Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets to conduct important backups. This high-speed, web-based service allows for online backup and archiving of our critical data and applications.”</p>
<p>Using S3 can offer a variety of benefits, including being highly scalable, highly available, secure, cost-effective, and provides unlimited storage capabilities. “Choosing to use S3 has provided cost optimization and many options for redundancy as well as storage object lock,” says Wagner. “In our Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) environment, we have additional domain controllers, so we’ve expanded our network and our Active Directory (AD) infrastructure out to Amazon. In the event campus is closed or in-person classes are suspended, we can maintain functionality within AppStream and offer single sign-on capabilities.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“We’ve deployed our direct connects through EdgeNet, which has increased our speed substantially,” continues Wagner. “This is used for our workspaces, AppStream, and we’re currently working towards using this for S3 and other Amazon public services. Once we’ve established these routes, we’ll be able to access&nbsp; many Amazon services over the direct connect and can move even further with systems like Amazon FSx, which allow you to run high-performance file systems in the cloud and support a wide range of capabilities. Edge provides our internet connection, Dark Fiber, and direct connects. My networking team has been very happy with the internet service and support provided by Edge. Our questions are answered quickly and correctly, and the partnership has helped make our cloud transition very successful.”</p>
<p>Creating a Flexible and Focused Strategy</p>
<p>Migrating to the cloud is often a multi-layered process and can happen in phases, as the needs of an institution and its initiatives evolve. “Our goal was never to lift and shift our entire environment,” shares Wagner. “We do rely on systems and applications on-premises, and I don’t see that changing in the near future. Many organizations may look at cloud migration as an all-or-nothing process, but we’ve always tackled this transition with a piecemeal approach. If there is a need to fill, we analyze the costs and performance, and if it makes sense, we move that existing or new service to the cloud. By taking things one step at a time, approaching cloud migration slowly, deliberately, and exploring the costs closely, I think you can optimize costs and prevent runaway spending.”</p>
<p>AppStream allows secure access to applications and desktops from any location and allows an institution to deliver online learning. “Our AppStream deployments were very beneficial by providing the infinitely scalable resources of Amazon,” explains Wagner. “When the pandemic first hit, we couldn’t have predicted how many people would be needing to access applications. But by having the flexibility provided by AppStream, we could rapidly and dynamically scale higher. After extending our network to Amazon, applications that run in EC2 are essentially just virtual machines (VM) that act the same as they would on-premises.”</p>
<p>“Our scanning tools continue to scan and patch the systems that are running in EC2. Amazon has their best practices clearly defined and they consistently make improvements to these standards,” continues Wagner. “I’ve worked with many representatives from AWS to discuss best practices, ask them about the nuance in the networking, and receive recommendations for optimizing security. Combined with the expertise and experience of our own security team, we’re able to ensure a secure environment.”</p>

		<p>Overcoming Challenges of Cloud Migration</p>
<p>Shifting systems to the cloud can prove challenging, especially without a strong, well-planned migration strategy and the commitment of the entire organization. “Getting all necessary teams on the same page and distributing relevant information to everyone is essential,” says Wagner. “You must connect your enterprise infrastructure group, security and networking team, and enterprise app stakeholders to ensure your migration goes smoothly. Also, though Amazon support is very responsive, you do not have the same amount of visibility as you do when you’re dealing with on-premises networks or systems, so some of the challenges that can arise&nbsp; are not having hardware or software accessibility.”</p>
<p>Successful cloud adoption requires thorough planning and creating a roadmap to incrementally accomplish an organization’s goals. “Before you get started, it’s important to do the research and conduct detailed prep work,” says Wagner. “Talking to the teams at Edge and Amazon has been extremely helpful to gather information and provide insight into successful strategies. If you’re just starting out, instead of moving everything to the cloud at once, I think looking at it as a stepped process can be beneficial and more cost-effective. Concentrate on what you need in the cloud and what needs to be redundant. Taking on too much at once can easily lead to failure, so taking a step back and deciding where to focus can make your migration more successful and will allow you to stay aligned with your mission, budget, and future plans for expansion.”</p>

		<p>In an age of digital transformation, more and more institutions of higher education continue to incorporate new technology, migrate to cloud-based solutions, and expand their online learning curricula. With these growing changes, the need for bolstered practices around student privacy and data security has become paramount. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) is a federal law that requires financial institutions to have information security and privacy provisions that protect consumer financial data. This Act has recently been amended to strengthen data security requirements for nonbank financial institutions, including colleges and universities that provide financial aid to students.</p>
<p>Dr. Dawn Dunkerley, Edge’s Principal Virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO), says following security standards addressed in the GLBA is important and any necessary changes were required to be completed by June 9, 2023. “Throughout my years of experience in supporting higher education, I’ve seen the letters that are sent out that indicate if your organization is not in compliance. They state that if you do not make updates to your security practices, the ability to process financial aid will be terminated. Many of the GLBA provisions are also current or anticipated insurance carrier requirements, so GLBA compliance oftentimes aligns with maintaining a good standing with your insurance carrier.”</p>
<p>The GLBA has two components, the Privacy Rule and the Safeguards Rule. Under the Privacy Rule, institutions are required to ensure confidentiality of Nonpublic Personal Information and comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). As part of the recent amendments, the Safeguards Rule outlines several key elements that must be included in an institution’s information security program.</p>
<p>Key Changes Affecting Institutions</p>
<p>By complying with the GLBA, organizations lower their risk of reputational damage and penalties for unauthorized sharing or loss of student data. According to the Safeguards Rule, colleges and universities must secure and ensure the confidentiality of private and financial information by adhering to the following provisions.</p>
<p>Designate an individual who is responsible for implementing an information security program. According to the new amendment, a single qualified individual must have the sole responsibility of overseeing and enforcing an institution’s information security program. “The definition of ‘qualified’ has not been specified, but there are no particular requirements for education, experience, or certificates for this role,” explains Dunkerley. “This person is often the IT director or chief information officer who has the ability to enforce these safeguards.”</p>
<p>Integrate risk assessment into information security programs. The Safeguard Rule states that the individual assigned to implement their organization’s information security program must submit annual risk assessments in writing. “Assessments must include criteria to assess the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer information,” shares Dunkerley. “Customer information defined in the updated GLBA goes beyond financial information like credit card and bank account details. This can also include personal health and personal identifiable information, so I encourage institutions to explore what systems might include this information. Risk assessments are now required to be in writing and must describe how identified risks will either be accepted or mitigated. When Edge conducts risk assessments for example, we look at the risks to customer information and identify the impact. For instance, does the risk have a confidentiality impact? This means that if an organization had a data breach of sensitive information, would this cause harm to the customer and cause harm to the institution?”</p>
<p>“Risk will never be zero,” continues Dunkerley, “But once we’ve applied controls, we’re accepting a level of risk and trying to mitigate it further. We must remember that risk assessments need to be reviewed and updated at least annually. If an institution changes systems or implements a new strategy, they must understand how their risks have changed and reassess the controls associated with them. Risk assessments are living documents and must grow and change as our environment changes.”</p>

		<p>“Implementing multi-factor authentication can be time consuming and expensive, but now there is a mandate that requires this security measure to be put in place,” says Dunkerley. “We’re also seeing some insurance carriers not renewing policies unless and institution has MFA. In regards to inventorying and classifying data according to sensitivity, each organization must know the location and sensitivity of their data, especially to effectively create access controls for customer information. Not every faculty member needs to have access to every piece of student information, and not all staff members need to have access to financial aid or the human resources information.&nbsp; We must take the principles of least privilege and apply access controls to include physical storage.”</p>
<p>“If your institution has a room where they house servers and store information, there must be physical controls on those doors to limit access,” continues Dunkerley. “The security control, encryption of customer information in transit, refers to the data flowing between an institution and external entities and having encrypted connections. Customer information at rest, meaning it’s not being processed or transmitted, must also be encrypted in an organization’s internal systems. Institutions must also use a secure change management process for both adding new software and making changes within their environment. If they are adding a new system into the environment, for example, they must make sure they have reviewed that system and the security associated with a new piece of software. Again, each institution must know and have inventoried the location of their data; understand what is on their network; and have controls in place that protect sensitive information.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Logging and system monitoring practices allows an organization to review logs and monitor traffic in and out of their network. “If someone breaches or attempts to breach your institution, you need to have a system in place that alerts you. Edge has been working with organizations to implement these measures, including annual penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. Vulnerability assessments differ from vulnerability scans, where external scans should be conducted at least monthly, and assessments are much larger and encompass the actual vulnerabilities associated with an organization. Edge conducts these assessments quite regularly and they include a closer look at people, processes, and technology, including documentation requirements and network traffic, not just a vulnerability scan.”</p>
<p>As part of the newly revised GLBA, institutions must also have requirements outlined for disposing of customer information. “We must consider what we do with information after a student graduates, or if a student steps away from school for a few years and then comes back,” says Dunkerley. “This requirement is causing a lot of challenges in higher education, because in many cases, there are policies stating not to get rid of that information. The GLBA document indicates that if you are not going to dispose of this information, you must have procedures in place that protect this information and policy details that explain the reasoning for keeping this information past the stated time frame.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ongoing security training for personnel. GLBA already requires security training for staff, but the new provision adds that training be continually updated to include relevant and timely information. “If you do not have a training and awareness program in place, you must now train your personnel at least on an annual basis,” explains Dunkerley. “Sometimes getting leadership and faculty and staff on board with this training can be challenging, but by providing sufficient training, an institution can address relevant security risks and ensure they have the most up-to-date knowledge necessary to successfully maintain their information security program.”</p>
<p>Oversight of service providers. Institutions must now “periodically assess” their service providers on an ongoing basis based on the risk they present and the continued adequacy of their safety measures. “When assessing new service providers that are brought on board, an organization must ensure the contracts have the same level of safeguards for the customer information they will be storing and processing,” says Dunkerley. “An institution must also periodically assess the risk being brought to them. Has the service provider had a breach in the past? If so, did they follow their requirement to alert us? To follow best practices, I would suggest these assessments be conducted at least quarterly.”</p>
<p>Tapping into Security Expertise</p>
<p>Many institutions seek to create a holistic security approach, but have difficulty finding expertise that aligns with their needs and budget. Edge offers security services to IT leaders that can help them set programmatic goals, identify and address vulnerabilities, and improve security outcomes. Depending on an organization’s current security profile and risk management needs, Edge’s team of vCISOs can help guide the improvement of cybersecurity planning, integrate proactive assessment and remediation practices, and ensure an institution meets GLBA compliance requirements.</p>

		<p>Facilitating Connections</p>
<p>EdgeNet’s direct connection to AWS can help speed migrations to the Cloud, allow a smooth and efficient flow of research data, and deliver a secure transit of data connections. To minimize service disruptions, all traffic entering the Edge network is monitored and any issues are mitigated to ensure the EdgeNet core and all connected members remain protected.</p>
<p>The transition from a commodity internet provider to EdgeNet and the network’s advanced layer 3 service capability allow for member-to-member connectivity and will support institutions like FDU and Rutgers as they continue to grow and enhance their education and research initiatives. In addition to meeting the growing data and network demands of students and faculty, the need for high-speed research and collaboration continues to rise across the higher education community. Having a network that facilitates these national and global connections will be an essential factor in driving innovation and discovery forward and giving current and incoming students a superior educational experience.</p>

		<p>Even before the frequency of remote and hy-flex learning greatly increased, many institutions were trying to keep pace with students’ growing technology requirements and network demands. From computers, smartphones, and iPads to gaming systems and video streaming, campuses can quickly be overloaded with the number of students and faculty connecting their devices to the network. In an Educause 2022 Students and Technology Report, unstable internet connections were among the top technology challenges stated by college students, with 35 percent saying this issue caused them stress. With these quickly expanding needs, existing networks may struggle to meet the demand of increasingly mobile students and staff.</p>
<p>Among the institutions facing this challenge was Edge member, Fairleigh Dickinson University (FDU). Having a greater number of students and staff looking to connect to their network for both personal and educational use, FDU knew they had to revisit their current technology strategy and determine how to update the approach to address both present and future needs. “We wanted to enable our students and staff to use technology, collaborate with other universities, and utilize external services at higher data rates,” explains Michael Reekie, Director of Networking, FDU. “We also wished to alleviate any of the bottlenecks in our current environment that could potentially slow down the user experience.”</p>
<p>Fairleigh Dickinson University</p>
<p>As FDU began to explore solutions to better manage network traffic and plan for the future, they first looked at installing traffic shapers at the Internet edge. This bandwidth management technique can be very useful in decreasing congestion, however, the cost and maintenance of these devices can be expensive, especially as bandwidth increases. Instead, FDU chose to upgrade their connection to the Edge optical fiber network, EdgeNet, from 2x 10 Gbps to 2x 100 Gbps—making them the first institution in New Jersey to connect to EdgeNet at this advanced speed. “We found that increasing our bandwidth and installing faster Internet edge routers and firewalls would be a more cost-effective investment and could provide a better user experience for our students and faculty,” says Reekie.</p>
<p>“Along with updating our core, we also upgraded our wireless and Internet edge to meet the upcoming demands of the new wireless capabilities,” Reekie continues. “Making the jump to 2x 100 Gbps will help us meet our bandwidth requirements over the next several years, and with Edge as an existing partner, it was a very easy transition to upgrade our existing connections, while still allowing a highly available networking experience. Edge was able to provide bandwidth to us at a better cost and value than installing technologies that would shape the use of Internet traffic.”</p>
<p>With a focus on promoting student and faculty success and opening the door to more future-forward opportunities, Neal Sturm, Vice President and Chief Information Officer, FDU, says they are committed to providing a superior level of network accessibility and connectivity. “This recent upgrade has not only created a more cost-efficient operating model, but will also help enhance the educational experience and better accommodate incoming students as the University continues to grow in the coming years.”</p>

<p>Similarly to FDU, Rutgers University began to explore solutions for increasing their bandwidth capacity to better meet student and staff needs and improve the overall user experience. Over the past several years, Rutgers and Edge have been well partnered with network services and collocate in data centers located in Philadelphia and Newark. Edge also provides the University with their guest wireless network Internet service. As part of their traffic optimization strategy, Rutgers chose to receive internet services directly from Edge, and at the end of 2022, Rutgers became the second institution in New Jersey to connect to EdgeNet network services at an advanced speed of 100 Gbps.</p>
<p>Despite initial supply chain issues, Edge helped Rutgers secure the hardware for the upgrade and successfully completed the migration in less than four months. “Edge has been our trusted partner for over two decades,” shares Adrienne Esposito, Director of Network Operations and Architecture, Rutgers University. “It was an easy decision to move one of our commodity internet 100Gb links to Edge. The cutover was seamless, and the move resulted in annual savings.” Through this network enhancement, Rutgers not only benefits from a reliable peering infrastructure with reduced latency that optimizes network performance, but they can also leverage the peering connection to Internet2 and a direct connection to the AWS cloud infrastructure.</p>

		<p>Facilitating Connections</p>
<p>EdgeNet’s direct connection to AWS can help speed migrations to the Cloud, allow a smooth and efficient flow of research data, and deliver a secure transit of data connections. To minimize service disruptions, all traffic entering the Edge network is monitored and any issues are mitigated to ensure the EdgeNet core and all connected members remain protected.</p>
<p>The transition from a commodity internet provider to EdgeNet and the network’s advanced layer 3 service capability allow for member-to-member connectivity and will support institutions like FDU and Rutgers as they continue to grow and enhance their education and research initiatives. In addition to meeting the growing data and network demands of students and faculty, the need for high-speed research and collaboration continues to rise across the higher education community. Having a network that facilitates these national and global connections will be an essential factor in driving innovation and discovery forward and giving current and incoming students a superior educational experience.</p>

		<p>Helping to Advance Research, Education, and Economic Development</p>
<p>Dating back to 1997,&nbsp;NJEdge.net, Inc., commonly referred to as Edge, has had a mission to serve as a valued and trusted partner to its members through secure high-performance optical infrastructure, network services, technology solutions, and expert support, training, and industry insight. That original mission continues to drive Edge to this very day. Over the years, Edge has grown its member community to include institutions of higher education, K-12 school districts, libraries, state and local government agencies, and healthcare facilities. As a nonprofit member-based research and education network, Edge spans New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, and New York, and looks to empower organizations with the tools and services they need on their digital transformation journeys.</p>
<p>Enhancing Connectivity</p>
<p>Edge’s origin story begins in 1994 when the New Jersey President’s Council was established by statute with the mission of statewide planning for higher education including research on higher education issues. Later in 1997, the Higher Education Technology Infrastructure Fund was enacted, creating a capital bond initiative to help New Jersey colleges and universities develop the integrated technology infrastructure important to increasing their effectiveness and efficiency, educational opportunities, and workforce training. The law established a fund with the New Jersey Educational Facilities Authority to build that infrastructure both within and among institutions and to help enhance connectivity with libraries and elementary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>Within the same year, the Commission on Higher Education convened its technology task force looking to the new millennium and New Jersey’s plan for higher education. The task force was integral in developing the state’s $50 million higher education technology infrastructure fund, setting aside $5 million for interconnectivity. A total of $45 million was committed to enhance individual campus infrastructure and required a dollar-for-dollar match. The funds for interconnectivity also required a combined institutional match by the members and were targeted to support the creation of a single broadband network utility to support the collaborative efforts of colleges and universities in the state.</p>
<p>After the taskforce completed its work, a technology advisory committee was established to assist the Commission and President’s Council in developing a statewide network and governing structure.&nbsp; As part of that effort, the New Jersey President’s Council commissioned a study by consulting firm Walsh Lowe to explore the need for a statewide higher education network. The study revealed that there are many benefits to this network and that establishing connectivity could bring the state into parity with over thirty other states in establishing research and education networks and connecting higher education to the Internet and the national research and education network, Internet2.</p>
<p>Supporting a Collaborative Community</p>
<p>In 2000, the network government structure was established with the President’s Council executive board serving as the board of directors for this not-for-profit corporation named NJEdge.net. The consortium, NJEdge, was developed as part of the state plan for higher education to provide collaborative resources and networked information services to its members and affiliates in support of education, research and development, outreach and public service, and economic development throughout the state. In providing a statewide network infrastructure, NJEdge began to establish standards for interoperability, achieved economies of scale, and supported new and emerging technology that could enable inter institutional collaboration among its member community. Over the years, the leadership structure has changed, including adding a board of trustees to provide leadership and oversight to the organization. In 2015, an amendment to the statutes codified NJEdge as a lead agency or contracting unit for the purposes of procuring technology on behalf of the members. One of the original requirements for institutional participation in the technology infrastructure fund was the commitment to support NJEdge through network connectivity.</p>
<p>Looking to create a collaborative national research platform where institutions could access advanced computing resources, leading-edge technology, and research training and partnerships, NJEdge created the research as a service (RaaS) solution, EdgeDiscovery, in 2019. This technology-based research and discovery framework also aimed to help member institutions fulfill prerequisites to attracting grants from preeminent research funding entities. In particular, the platform aimed to help more institutions in the community gain access to data and research tools and help under-resourced organizations who would otherwise be unable to invest in next generation research infrastructure. Combining a NJEdge research network DMZ with an optimized technology stack residing on their backbone, EdgeDiscovery is outfitted with hardware and software components which enable researchers to streamline their research projects, schedule compute cycles, and access applications, analytics tools, and storage resources.</p>
<p>NJEdge, now known as Edge, celebrated 20 years in 2020 and currently supports 46 connected members in higher education and research, K-12 districts, healthcare, and municipal governments. Since the beginning, Edge’s strategy has been to create network connections that drive additional value, lower costs, and support an institution’s capabilities, while offering technology solutions that help advance research, education, and economic development.</p>
<p>Designing a High-Performance Network</p>
<p>To deliver an exceptional connectivity experience to its members, Edge created the optical fiber network, EdgeNet, a purpose-built solution specifically designed for higher education in New Jersey. EdgeNet was designed to support 100 percent of member demand, so unlike traditional Internet service providers (ISP), Edge never oversubscribes the network where one member’s traffic competes for bandwidth with another member. More specifically, 80 percent of Edge member’s external traffic is exchanged to be private peering relationships as opposed to traversing the unsecure and best effort public internet.&nbsp; Within this 80 percent, there is access to critical cloud services providers, such as Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google, and Apple.</p>
<p>Designed with redundant nodes and Internet transit providers distributed throughout the state of New Jersey, the network minimizes service interruptions by never relying on any one service provider; delivering a highly survivable, highly available networking experience to connected members. This original design, and all subsequent iterations, has been driven by member input and to help institutions be better equipped to meet their changing needs. Specifically, many institutions needed redundancy in both the network architecture and member connectivity to effectively meet the needs of their students, faculty, and staff. In recent years, esports peering was added to support member organizations as they build and expand world-class esports programs to attract and retain students interested in this field.</p>
<p>Along with celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2020, Edge also extended their backbone footprint into two new points of presence at Princeton University, with added path redundancy to enhance the redundancy to the network. In addition, Edge expanded their capability and capacity for research computing by creating a dedicated research network segment within EdgeNet. The foundation of this Internet2 GigaPOP created a research network that is physically and logically separated from the production network that members use to get to the Internet. As a major interconnection point with Internet2, members can connect with both national and international research assets. During this same year, a new feature was added to EdgeNet where members can access real-time network utilization reporting that shows an organization’s own network connections to the Edge network. This allows an institution to proactively monitor the network and troubleshoot any issues more efficiently.</p>

		<p>During the pandemic when remote work and learning became a necessity, Edge established local broadband peering with major residential providers to improve the student and employee experience. The most recently added cloud connectivity supports members’ needs for digital transformation by deploying cloud infrastructure and software as a service capabilities with major cloud providers. This addition allows members to leverage Edge connections to move data center services into the Cloud, access all major cloud providers without additional access costs, and benefit from a shared services model that helps to reduce expenses.</p>
<p>With network engineers who have decades of experience building wide area network solutions that support members’ needs, Edge continues to expand the features and capabilities that EdgeNet has offered to help institutions meet their evolving needs and step into the future with confidence.</p>
<p>Expanding Solutions and Services</p>
<p>To ease the burden of the procurement process and speed members’ time to implementation and innovation, Edge launched EdgeMarket in 2021. Delivering the latest technologies at an affordable price, EdgeMarket was designed to be a solutions and service “easy button” that gives members access to the latest technology solutions. The cooperative pricing system delivers consortium purchasing agreements and helps minimize the time and resources spent researching, analyzing, and procuring essential tools. With solutions designed to support an entire digital ecosystem, EdgeMarket allows members to take advantage of existing contracts and strategic partnerships to speed the procurement process and shorten the time to implementation for advanced technology solutions.</p>
<p>Throughout Edge’s evolution, the consortium has expanded to not only deliver optimum value to members through network connectivity and technology procurement, but also by meeting the growing needs of its member institutions in the areas of digital transformation, cybersecurity, educational and digital learning technologies, cloud computing, research community engagement, and professional managed services. Edge also hosts signature events, like its annual conference EdgeCon, to allow community thought leaders, industry partners, and solution providers to learn, connect, and problem solve together.</p>
<p>Enabling opportunities for collaboration and technology transformation have always remained at the heart of the Edge consortium, even as the challenges of the pandemic quickly shifted priorities for many member institutions. Amid a rapidly-changing landscape, Edge further broadened organizational capacity to assist institutions with technology solutions and services related to digital transformation and helped them continue to meet the needs of their students, faculty, and staff.</p>
<p>The world has greatly changed in the last several years, where digital learning and collaboration has solidified its position in our everyday lives and classrooms have evolved in many new and exciting directions. In 2022, many member institutions looked to Edge for instructional design support, digital transformation strategies, and subject matter expertise in the development of new courses and programs.

		<p>Transferring from a community college to a four-year college or university can be an exciting experience, but for some students, making sure they are following all the necessary steps can feel overwhelming. To take the guesswork out of transferring, the New Jersey Statewide Transfer Initiative (NJ Transfer) was created to be a go-to resource for course equivalencies, recommended coursework, and later, transcript evaluations. “When our web presence was launched in 2001, the site was created to help students, faculty, staff, and parents in the state to explore course equivalencies between community colleges and four-year institutions,” explains Théa Olsen, Executive Director, NJ Transfer. “Over the years, NJ Transfer’s website has become an even greater source of information, including transfer-specific recruitment events, as well as direct links to general information about an institution, links to their application, and transfer-specific points of contact. Students can begin the process at NJ Transfer, rather than having to start at several individual institutions’ websites to find the same information.”</p>
<p>Having that point of contact and/or knowing the specific department to reach out to allows students to establish their first relationship with the institution and have a support system they can count on throughout their undergraduate years. “NJ Transfer not only offers a database of course equivalencies for the participating four years, but also hosts transfer programs that list out the recommended coursework for the first two years of study for any of their degree programs that accept transfer applicants,” says Olsen. “Students can take advantage of our transcript evaluations which provide a course-by-course evaluation. This tool can apply the results to the Transfer Programs to show the recommended courses that have been completed and how many are left outstanding. By using our website and working with their academic advisor, community college students can confidently register for their upcoming terms and make well-laid plans to achieve their academic goals fulfilling both their current degree requirements and the recommended coursework of the transfer program they hope to apply to.”</p>
<p>Creating a Positive User Experience</p>
<p>To deliver the most up-to-date and accurate information to users, NJ Transfer depends on long-standing data maintenance processes that operate and interact with key points of contact at each of the 43 participating institutions. “Every institution reports on a monthly or annual basis to ensure that all data is reviewed and changes are being reported,” explains Olsen. “When we call it the New Jersey Statewide Transfer Initiative, it truly is that. Keeping our system current and accurate to ensure students are receiving the information that they need is a statewide effort.”</p>
<p>“Specifically, we have the public-facing website, NJtransfer.org, and an admin site we log into to make necessary edits to the web pages, however NJ Transfer also has two more user facing systems,” continues Olsen. “Our WebAdmin system is built to allow the two-year account holders to submit new and revised courses, as well as maintain their syllabi, and conversely, the four-year account holders have access to the newly submitted courses so they can review and award them transfer credit. Once reviewed and approved, the information will be publicly accessible on the NJtransfer.org site. In addition, we manage an Electronic Transcript System where the two-year institutions can send their transcripts via our electronic data interchange (EDI) and the four-year institutions will receive the transcripts with the traditional data points. In addition NJ Transfer’s service provides a document that includes a column containing the course equivalencies based on when the student took the course, the grade they earned, and what our data shows as awarded based on that information.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>In recent months, Olsen says she has made several changes that have greatly improved both their internal workload and the user experience for the staff who engage in the website and handle data maintenance at their institutions. “To help reduce the time between when changes are happening at the campuses and when these revisions are being reported to us, we now manage these processes via a Google Drive per institution; which has significantly cut down on our email volume. This approach provides a history of requests and confirms the changes were made, and also allows for a smoother transition when a staff member may leave and a new hire steps into the role. We have streamlined our procedures so each NJ Transfer team member handles different processes or pieces of the processes to ensure things are completed in a timely manner. This also helps our team of three people to balance our workloads, keep all of the pieces moving in the background, and have the opportunity to participate in any large projects that may come our way.”</p>
<p>NJ Transfer maintains a large database dating back twenty years, and while managing data of that size can prove challenging, Olsen says relationship management is key to turning any challenges into opportunities. “Making sure we have well-developed, consistent channels of communication and relationships with staff members across the 43 institutions is essential. I cannot speak highly enough of the people we partner with at the two- and four-year institutions who work diligently with students every day. Our goal is to make the volume of work they do more manageable and allow them to help students more efficiently. A crucial part of our job is being able to see patterns and identify pitfalls when working on large data sets and evaluating our business practices. Along with our existing annual operations calendar, we’ve needed to build processes around bulk updates and decide how to delegate these updates appropriately across the team to ensure we are delivering a positive customer experience and making the updates in a timely manner.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Helping Students Make Confident Decisions</p>
<p>Through NJ Transfer’s evolution, new features and tools continue to be added to help users access the information they need to support their path in pursuing their higher education. “Over the years we have added tutorials under our Help drop down menu that give an overview of the website and specific instructions for using the various tools and resources found on NJ Transfer,” says Olsen. “We also added a staff and faculty drop down where those users can easily access the information they need from a single location. In 2022, we implemented additional changes that were geared toward improving the experience and workload of the staff user, to enhance their evaluation turnaround time and ultimately provide students with the information they need more quickly. When we change something or add a new feature, we do it with the student and staff users in mind, to either directly and positively impact the student user or positively impact staff user. This helps them work smarter, not harder, which in turn indirectly, but positively, impacts the students.”</p>

		<p>Over the last two years, Olsen has provided workshops that train staff on the site and help ensure they feel confident about how to use all the tools and resources. “Going forward, I would like to expand the audience of these workshops to include guidance counselors who work directly with high school juniors and seniors, and their parents. They are all involved in the decision-making process and helping students understand how to use NJ Transfer’s academic planning tools. Using these tools as early as possible will help students use the website more effectively, work with their advisor, and feel confident in their registration decisions. We want all students to feel empowered in their transfer experience.”</p>
<p>In looking ahead, Olsen says they will continue to enhance the tools and resources available through NJ Transfer to help more students on their academic journey. “In recent years, college enrollment has been impacted, not only in New Jersey, but across the country. There is definitely a spotlight on transfer students, including traditional populations, but also adult learners. My goal is to help every partner at each participating institution and as many staff as possible in the K-12 secondary education institutions understand the value of NJ Transfer and how to use this resource to help students make informed decisions. We want more students and parents to see community college as a realistic path to expand their horizons and earn their associate’s and bachelor’s degrees. NJ Transfer is not just a place to find course equivalencies, but is truly an academic planning tool that allows students to maximize their transfer credits, keep them on track to achieve their dreams, and make the most of their higher education experience.”</p>

		<p>Community colleges are instrumental in strengthening their local communities, providing valuable opportunities for students to access skills training, prepare for the workforce, and gain an entry point into higher education. Dedicated to helping maximize the reach and success of New Jersey’s community colleges, Edge was invited to speak to the Vice Presidents of Academic Affairs from several community colleges in the region. Josh Gaul, Chief Digital Learning Officer, Edge, shared insight into current educational technology and digital learning trends, microlearning and gamification, augmented reality and virtual reality (AV/VR), and building a more flexible learning environment for students. “Along with exploring digital learning trends, our overarching focus was to discuss how to create a connective tissue between all community colleges that supports each other’s academic missions,” explains Gaul. “You can only introduce these instructional and educational technology solutions if there is foundational learning theory to build upon. Before allocating any funds to the implementation of any new technology, we want to help institutions put a plan in place that outlines how these solutions will be used and how they can provide the most benefit to their students.”</p>
<p>Digital Learning Trends</p>
<p>As institutions of higher learning look to creatively blend in-person and online education and find ways to effectively reach more students, many are looking at current digital learning trends and how they can help boost engagement in students, while also expanding teaching opportunities. “In this digital age, attention spans have greatly decreased,” says Gaul. “Trends like microlearning deliver content in small, easily digestible sections where students can focus on better understanding and retaining the information. Adding gamification can also promote student engagement, help clarify information, and enhance overall comprehension of the material. Game-based learning provides a “paper trail” for students to review what they have learned and can incentivize completing each section with reward badges or other recognition or motivation. Many workforce development and competency-based learning models already use this method and this technology can be effectively incorporated into the higher education space.”</p>
<p>To provide a more diverse group of students with access to educational opportunities, assistive and adaptive technologies can help students with disabilities to be fully included in the classroom experience. “In both the physical and digital classroom, following the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) guidelines optimizes learning experiences for all students,” explains Gaul. “In addition, implementing the UDL framework allows each department within your institutions to ensure they are compliant with civil rights laws enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Assistive technologies include video captioning, transcripts, alternative keyboards, and voice recognition software. To help institutions assess their courses for accessibility compliance, Edge provides Accessibility Compliance Support Services for Digital Learning and can provide a comprehensive or in-depth scan of an institution’s digital properties.”</p>
<p>Along with accessibility, mobility and flexibility are also important components of a digital learning strategy. “eLearning apps were the top downloaded category in 2021,” says Gaul. “In addition to being accessible to a greater spectrum of students, online learning must be able to be viewed through mobile devices. One of the greatest benefits of digital learning is expanding the opportunities for students to learn at their own pace and create a personal path to success. Edge understands how integrating high-quality digital and online learning is vital to the future of higher education and can help institutions evolve in an increasingly competitive marketplace.”</p>
<p>Among the most attention-grabbing trends is incorporating virtual reality elements to enhance course content. “AR/VR immerses learners in different realities and provides a low-risk simulated learning environment to gain new skills and expand their understanding,” explains Gaul. “In the education space, VR can allow avatars to connect with peers and instructors in virtual meeting rooms and AR is very effective in corporate training to share important information with employees. While these technologies can be very beneficial, they can also be expensive and building the business plan can be time-consuming. Instead of picking and choosing technologies based on the latest trends, a better approach is creating a strategy that incorporates an intentional use of technology that can evolve and grow with an institution and the needs of their students and staff. Edge can help an institution have these important conversations and determine what type of organization they’re striving to become and the steps required to reach this goal.”</p>

		<p>As online learning becomes further integrated into the education space and institutions look to create more engaging, user-friendly online experiences for their students, web accessibility will continue to be an essential part of a technology-enhanced education. Publishing an accessible website means that people with disabilities have the same access to digital, online content as people without disabilities. Without a web design that is mindful of students with diverse abilities, the site can end up creating barriers that exclude people from using the webpage or technology or accessing needed information. Following the Universal Design of Learning (UDL) guidelines offers a framework to optimize teaching and learning opportunities and create meaningful educational experiences for all students.</p>
<p>Providing Equal Learning Opportunities&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 mandated that people with disabilities must be allowed comparable educational opportunities as their nondisabled peers. As technology continued to advance, the ADA revised this mandate to include web accessibility. Properly designed websites include features like alternative text for images, keyboard input, and transcripts for audio.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) promotes a high degree of usability for people with disabilities by developing accessibility guidelines for web content and applications, browsers, and authoring tools. The W3C web standards focus on four main areas: Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG), User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG), Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA), and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). “The ATAG web standard ensures that authoring tools are accessible, so people with disabilities can create web content and authors can create more accessibility web content,” explains Josh Gaul, Associate Vice President &amp; Chief Digital Learning Officer. “If your institution uses Microsoft PowerPoint to create presentations or Articulate 360 to develop online courses, for example, ATAG ensures these tools meet any type of accessibility needs of the users and developers.”</p>
<p>“UAAG explains how to make user agents accessible to people with disabilities,” continues Gaul. “This includes a browser, a browser extension, a media player like a YouTube video player, a screen reader like Kindle, and any other applications that can render web content. The third standard, WAI-ARIA, defines a way to make web content and applications more accessible to people with disabilities. Specifically, it helps with creating dynamic, interactive content developed with HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.”</p>
<p>The fourth web standard, WCAG, makes web content more accessible by including text, sounds, images, and dynamic content. “The WCAG guidelines are developed through the W3C processes in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world with a goal of providing a single, shared standard for web content accessibility,” explains Gaul. “There are four main components of accessibility that spell the word ‘pour.’ P stands for Perceivable, where users must be able to process the information they are viewing on the screen, understand the flow of information, and where to start and where to finish. Next is Operable, meaning the website’s controls, buttons, and navigation can be used by anybody, regardless of approach to use. For students who cannot use their hands or limbs, for example, they must have access to assistive technology like keyboards, screen readers, or voice recognition.”</p>
<p>The third guiding principle is ensuring content is Understandable. “Content and functionality must have clear, concise language that uses an appropriate voice and tone for the audience,” says Gaul. “If you’re reading a page and there is an arrow at the bottom, but no indication that it’s a button to move to the next page, that is not considered understandable. The last principle is Robust, which means users can pick their own mix of technologies to interact with websites, multimedia, and online documents. Students may sometimes prefer to access a website or class content in a different way. They may not always be looking at your class on their laptop, but are using an iPad or other device. Students need to be able to choose their own mix of technologies to access the content you’re delivering.”</p>
<p>“One of the best ways to create content that meets accessibility standards is to follow UDL Guidelines,” Gaul continues. “This framework guides the design of learning experiences to proactively meet the needs of all learners. When you use UDL, you assume that barriers to learning are not the student, but the design of the environment. UDL is based on brain science and evidence-based education practices and leverages the power of digital technology. Instead of trying to undo the advances that digital technology provides to the learning experience, we must find ways to utilize technology to make education accessible for all users.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>Since accessibility is a shared responsibility, Gaul says an important step is building enthusiasm for accessibility throughout your institution. “This goal does not just fall onto the instructional designers, the IT team, or the Office of Disability Services—this is everyone’s responsibility. Stakeholders, faculty, adjuncts, and anyone touching the student experience needs to be held accountable for upholding the accessibility practices. The third step is creating a plan to develop clear goals moving forward. You must determine how you will monitor accessibility, how you will flag issues, what are the ways that you can control the process and procedures for creating content. It’s important to have an approval process in place that doesn’t create a log jam in your creation of courses.”</p>

		<p>Addressing the “Why” of Learning</p>
<p>Accommodating the needs and abilities of all learners is essential to eliminating barriers for students and creating an inclusive learning environment. “Learning may look different in every classroom, but there are some commonalities,” says Gaul. “Common elements of UDL include providing flexible ways to present information, offering multiple ways for students to demonstrate their skills and knowledge, and allowing students to engage in course activities in different ways, like group work and individual study options.”</p>
<p>To help create inclusive educational experiences, the UDL Guidelines are divided into three categories: Engagement, Representation, and Action &amp; Expression. “Engagement focuses on the ‘Why’ of learning,” explains Gaul. “An institution should provide options for recruiting interest. This information is not intended to engage a learner’s cognition, but optimizes individual choice and autonomy. The student needs to be able to decide between the content they want to take in without the restriction of the information being accessible or not. Everything needs to be looked at the same level, where information is equally engaging and equally of interest.”</p>
<p>Learning experiences should also provide options for sustaining effort and persistence, making measurable goals and objectives, and building ways for students to engage with one another to help them effectively learn and understand the course content. “Falling under the Engagement category is self-regulation; being able to strategically modulate one’s emotional reactions or states in order to be more effective at coping and engaging with your environment,” shares Gaul. “This can be accomplished by offering students self-assessments and giving them places to reflect on the content that they’re learning.”</p>
<p>Understanding the “What” of Learning</p>
<p>To help support resourceful and knowledgeable learners, the UDL Guidelines includes the category Representation. “Institutions must ensure that key information is equally perceptible to all learners,” says Gaul. “This can be accomplished by providing the same information through different modalities and in a format that will allow for adjustability by the user. For students with sensory disabilities or learning disabilities, they may approach content differently. Language and symbols should have alternative representations provided, not only for accessibility but for clarity and comprehensibility across all learners. Most importantly, educators want to help students turn the course content into usable knowledge. Proper design and presentation of information can provide a strong foundation for all learners to access knowledge and develop new skills.”</p>
<p>Supporting the “How” of Learning</p>
<p>In following the UDL Guidelines, content should also provide multiple means of action and expression where learners can interact with materials and navigate a learning environment in different ways. “Properly designed curricular materials provide a seamless interface with common assistive technologies and offer a variety of methods for response and access to tools,” explains Gaul. “In referencing the arrow at the bottom of the screen to get to the next page, you should have multiple ways to get to the next page of content, including a mouse, keyboard, or voice commands. To level the playing field among learners, it’s important to provide alternative modalities for expression where learners can easily express knowledge, ideas, and concepts in the learning environment and communicate with the instructor and their peers in a variety of ways.”</p>
<p>To meet the guidelines for Action &amp; Expression, learning modules should also allow students to achieve a higher level of critical thinking. “By building activities into the course content, you allow students to set goals for themselves, conduct self-assessments, and apply their knowledge in new and unique ways,” says Gaul. “Students can build the scaffolding for their learning experiences and see where the flow of learning is taking them—helping them to analyze their own growth over time and how they can further build upon their progress.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Examining Web Accessibility</p>
<p>Applying the principles of UDL in the classroom goes beyond just being ethically responsible, incorporating these guidelines also meets federal laws recommending its use. “Over the past 10, 15, 20 years, we’ve seen the consequences of non-compliance,” says Gaul. “Disability rights advocates and the Office of Civil Rights have filed lawsuits against schools, departments, and even faculty members. From 2020 to 2021, there was a 14 percent increase in total website accessibility lawsuit filings in federal courts. This is something we all should be considering and exploring how we can improve accessibility and support a wide variety of learners. There are four big-picture steps to mitigate these issues and design accessible websites and online content. First is understanding the current state of accessibility at your institution. This step includes running scans of your current websites, reviewing your courses, looking at all the content that is publicly available to students and determining if they meet W3C accessibility standards. You want to make sure your universal design for learning approach is baked into your instructional design.”</p>
<p>Since accessibility is a shared responsibility, Gaul says an important step is building enthusiasm for accessibility throughout your institution. “This goal does not just fall onto the instructional designers, the IT team, or the Office of Disability Services—this is everyone’s responsibility. Stakeholders, faculty, adjuncts, and anyone touching the student experience needs to be held accountable for upholding the accessibility practices. The third step is creating a plan to develop clear goals moving forward. You must determine how you will monitor accessibility, how you will flag issues, what are the ways that you can control the process and procedures for creating content. It’s important to have an approval process in place that doesn’t create a log jam in your creation of courses.”</p>
<p>Lastly, Gaul says building an environment that supports accessibility and training people on the W3C standards and UDL principles are essential. “To be successful, every office in your organization should understand the need for accessibility. Every tool you use, whether it’s your learning management system (LMS), customer relationship management (CRM), or enterprise resource planning (ERP), each should meet accessibility standards. Every platform, hardware, software, and online tool needs to have a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT®) which is a document showing an institution’s efforts to meet accessibility standards.”</p>
<p>Improving Digital Accessibility</p>
<p>To help institutions ensure that the needs of differently abled members of their community are met on the web and in online or digitally-enabled learning environments, Edge provides Accessibility Compliance Support Services for Digital Learning. “One of our services through EdgeLearn centers around digital accessibility readiness,” says Gaul. “We can provide a scan of all of your institution’s digital properties on the web for accessibility compliance, including W3C standards. You can choose a full-site scan or a defined set of subpages. Additionally, we can provide an instructional design review of a random selection of online and digitally-enabled courses for accessibility compliance.”</p>
<p>Upon reviewing an institution’s digital accessibility, Edge will provide a detailed report of the findings including immediate suggestions for improvement and a long-term mediation roadmap. “We can help you identify the issues that can be addressed right now and then build a strategy around the systemic concerns and how to remedy them in the months ahead,” explains Gaul. “Edge also offers professional development and accessibility support services. We can create custom accessibility training for content for web owners, designers, and faculty to proactively build the capacities to support accessibility efforts internally at your institution. I’m working with the Center for Online Learning in their Office of Disability Services to build a three-pronged approach to meeting accessibility standards and helping faculty understand accessibility more clearly.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>In addition, Edge can help institutions create a model of accessibility management to strengthen policies, procedures, and governance and proactively ensure that the needs of differently abled members of an institutional community are being met. “Accessibility is not only about the law and being compliant, meeting these standards is about doing the right thing for your students,” says Gaul. “Ethically designing your website, publications, and courses allows every student to have a close-to-equal experience when attending your institution, whether they’re 22 years old or 75 years old; or are deaf, blind, or have cognitive disabilities. The sooner you make it a priority for your institution at a strategic level, the sooner you can be at the forefront and outshine the competition when it comes to making sure that your doors are open to any student who wants to pursue an education at your institution.”</p>

<p>A Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Trust Anchor is a trusted entity within an SSI ecosystem that is responsible for issuing and verifying digital credentials. In other words, a Trust Anchor acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that only legitimate and verified credentials are added to an individual’s digital identity.</p>



<p>To become an SSI Trusted Provider, a company must meet certain criteria set by the SSI ecosystem in which it operates. These criteria may include demonstrating expertise in the technology and processes involved in issuing and verifying digital credentials, complying with relevant data privacy and security regulations, and demonstrating a commitment to ethical and transparent business practices.</p>



<p>Becoming an SSI Trust-Anchor can generate revenue for a company in several ways. Firstly, as a Trust Anchor, the company can charge fees for issuing and verifying digital credentials on behalf of individuals and organizations. These fees can be based on a per-credential or per-user basis, depending on the Trust Anchor’s business model. Secondly, being a Trust Anchor can create new business opportunities for the company, such as providing consulting or training services to other organizations looking to become Trust Anchors. Finally, being a Trust Anchor can enhance the company’s reputation and visibility within the SSI ecosystem, which can lead to new partnerships, collaborations, and revenue-generating opportunities.</p>







 SSI Trust anchor companies 



<p>It is challenging to provide an accurate analysis of the earnings of SSI Trust Anchor companies as they are relatively new and not yet widely adopted. Additionally, as the SSI market is still in its early stages, there are only a few companies currently offering SSI Trust Anchor services.</p>



<p>However, here are some companies that can be considered as competitors in the SSI Trust Anchor market:</p>

<p>Guest blog by Mathieu Glaude</p>







<p>I had the good fortune of attending the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop 36</a> in Mountain View, California this week. This event has become a must-attend for me, as it always leaves me feeling both inspired and intellectually stimulated.</p>



<p>The conference brings together a diverse group of individuals working on various aspects of standards, technologies, business, legal, governance, and other facets required to improve how our digital identities are managed today. I feel fortunate to have been able to not only attend on behalf of Northern Block alongside my UX specialist colleague Ariane Bordeleau, but also to have had sponsor the conference alongside many great peers in the field (as you can see in the banner image above).</p>



<p>With over 150 different sessions held across three days, it’s impossible to attend them all, and sometimes tough decisions must be made when multiple interesting sessions coincide. While I can’t provide a comprehensive overview of everything that happened at the workshop, I wanted to share a summary from my perspective, focusing on the subjects that interest me the most:</p>



<p>So, here it is:</p>



 
 OpenID4VC has legs – OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC) has gained traction due to its pre-existing dependency on OAuth 2.0, which provides a sense of safety and security for this credential exchange protocol, primarily focused on personal identity. The majority of the corporate world has existing investments in systems that leverage OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, making it easier for them to use these protocols to adopt verifiable credentials for interacting with their customers and employees. OpenID4VC is a protocol to watch out for as it is agnostic to credential types, supporting various W3C credentials such as mobile driver’s licenses and more. It’s also been included in the EU’s wallet architecture reference framework as a must for credential issuers to use. If you’re interested in learning more about OpenID4VC, I recently recorded a podcast with one of the specification’s authors, which I believe you’ll find insightful. You can listen to it here: <a href="https://northernblock.io/open-id-4-vc-openid-for-verifiable-credentials/">https://northernblock.io/open-id-4-vc-openid-for-verifiable-credentials/</a>. On the Northern Block side, we have recently incorporated OpenID4VCI support into our AFJ mobile wallet, and we’re exploring how we can contribute towards the presentation side of the protocol. 
 



 
 Digital Trust in the Age of AI – During the second and third days of the event, there were multiple sessions discussing the intersection of AI and digital identity. One session that caught my attention was “Digital Trust in the Age of AI,” led by Wenjing Chu, co-chair of the Trust over IP’s <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=19657312">AI and Metaverse</a> Task Force and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">&nbsp;Trust Spanning Protocol</a> Task Force. The discussion highlighted the dilemma of content authentication, as voice, video, and biometric authentication are dead. A recent viral AI-generated song showcases how easy it is to now impersonate voices [<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ai-generated-drake-and-weeknd-song-yanked-from-streaming-after-umg-statement">https://www.thedailybeast.com/ai-generated-drake-and-weeknd-song-yanked-from-streaming-after-umg-statement</a>].&nbsp; If content authentication is dead, the challenge is now to determine whether the content comes from a trusted source. With the rise of AI-generated deep fakes and the potential for abuse of public identifiers such as email addresses and phone numbers, the need for private and specific identifiers for our different relationships is reinforced. The session also raised questions for me personally about whether AI might incentivize the privatization of data and hinder the open-source movement or protocol-client separation (example of Reddit here: [<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/reddit-will-start-charging-ai-models-learning-from-its-extremely-human-archives/">https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/reddit-will-start-charging-ai-models-learning-from-its-extremely-human-archives/</a>]). Large proprietary data owners could have new ways to monetize their datasets through AI systems, potentially leading to more closed platforms – the opposite of what we’re striving to achieve. It’s crucial to engage in conversations about AI’s rapid disruption and its impact on digital trust, as this will help us stay ahead of the curve. I plan to record a podcast with Wenjing on this topic soon, and I believe it will be an insightful discussion. 
 



 
 The SPAC Tradespace – During the three days of the event, Sam Smith led a series of sessions on Security, Privacy, Authenticity, and Confidentiality, highlighting the challenges in achieving all these simultaneously. These discussions are closely related to the ongoing work at the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force">Trust Over IP Foundation’s Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force.</a> The aim is to build a layer that enables trust tasks, such as credential exchanges, interactions with trust registries, and secure messaging, to occur between any two clients across the internet. To establish trusted connections, a trust layer is needed. In the world of Hyperledger, our version of this is the DIDComm protocol. However, DIDComm doesn’t encompass every element required as defined by the ToIP specs. These ongoing discussions are fascinating and essential, and Sam Smith’s sessions at the event contributed to advancing the dialogue on these critical issues. 
 



 
 Trust Registries are hot – There were numerous conversations surrounding trust registries. Building upon discussions from last fall’s IIW 35, the role of governance in establishing digital trust was a central theme. The trust registry space is witnessing significant activity and innovation. During the conference, I attended sessions that covered the <a href="https://identity.foundation/trust-establishment/">trust establishment specification</a> recently defined by DIF. There was also mention of the trust registry work happening at the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">Trust over IP Foundation’s Trust Registry Task Force</a>. Interesting conversations took place about how the Domain Name System (DNS) could facilitate the discovery of trust registries or even host them on DNS servers. Additionally, examples of hierarchical trust registries being implemented by organizations like the UN were discussed. A consensus on the best approach has yet to be reached – I also think there will be many valid implementations. Questions remain about using verifiable credentials to determine authority and the legitimacy of the credential issuer within a governance framework. At Northern Block, we are remaining abreast of all innovations happening in this space and have recently concluded a proof of concept alongside CIRA [<a href="https://www.loom.com/share/57db10ddc9f448bf8ff2fb7b10138283">https://www.loom.com/share/57db10ddc9f448bf8ff2fb7b10138283</a>]. Here are a couple other resources that you may find interesting: video demo of a UN Universal Postal Union use case we worked on: [<a href="https://youtu.be/8Lnx-PTzrK0">https://youtu.be/8Lnx-PTzrK0</a>], and a recent blog post: [<a href="https://northernblock.io/leveraging-dns-in-digital-trust-credential-exchanges-and-trust-registries/">https://northernblock.io/leveraging-dns-in-digital-trust-credential-exchanges-and-trust-registries/</a>] describing the work above I mentioned with CIRA. 
 



 
 Many KERI sessions – There were several discussions about KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) during the event, and one session I particularly enjoyed was “KERI for Dummies,” led by Timothy Ruff. The main objective of this session was to emphasize that KERI’s primary purpose is to ensure authenticity, rather than focusing on privacy or confidentiality. Authenticity in KERI centers on two main aspects: provenance and integrity. KERI allows for the authenticity of keys during rotations, maintaining the provenance and integrity of the keys. This enables continued authenticity between two endpoints interacting with each other, as they agree on a protocol to exchange keys instead of relying on a central place like a verifiable data registry.<br>&nbsp; 



 DNS for digital trust &amp; Creating a credential exchange protocol comparison matrix – During the event, I proposed two sessions. The first one, on the opening day, focused on using DNS for authenticating decentralized identifiers and discovering trust registries. You can find the link to the demo video showcasing our work and its integration into the Orbit enterprise during a credential assurance flow here (same link as above): [<a href="https://www.loom.com/share/57db10ddc9f448bf8ff2fb7b10138283">https://www.loom.com/share/57db10ddc9f448bf8ff2fb7b10138283</a>]. On the third day, I held a second session inspired by the credential profile comparison matrix created by some individuals over the past year, which is linked here: [<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z4cYfjbbE-rABcfC-xab8miocKLomivYMUFibOh9BVo/edit#gid=1590639334">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z4cYfjbbE-rABcfC-xab8miocKLomivYMUFibOh9BVo/edit#gid=1590639334</a>]. The goal was to explore the possibility of achieving similar outcomes with credential exchange protocols. This was a lively session and included a large group of people comparing credential exchange protocols such as Aries AIP 2.0, OpenID4VC, VC API, and ISO 18013-5. The session successfully kicked off the creation of a v1 table with criteria across both issuance and verification protocols. There was a consensus to continue working on this, as we believe it is an important exercise that will be valuable for implementers and decision-makers of digital identity systems. More on this to come!

<p>Two Project Specifications from Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration Open Project take next step towards OASIS Standard</p> 


<p>OASIS and the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration Open Project [1] are pleased to announce that OSLC Configuration Management V1.0 PS01 and OSLC Tracked Resource Set V3.0 PS02 are now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>Managing change and configuration in a complex systems development lifecycle is very difficult, especially in heterogeneous environments that include homegrown tools, open source projects, and commercial tools from different vendors. The OSLC initiative applies World Wide Web and Linked Data principles to enable interoperation of change, configuration, and asset management processes across a product’s entire application and product lifecycle.</p>



<p>Configuration Management Version 1.0 defines an RDF vocabulary and a set of REST APIs for managing versions and configurations of linked data resources from multiple domains.</p>



<p>Tracked Resource Set Version 3.0 allows a server to expose a set of resources in a way that allows clients to discover them, track additions to and removals from the set, and track state changes to the resources in the set. The protocol is suitable for dealing with sets containing a large number of resources, as well as highly active resource sets that undergo continual change.</p>



<p>Configuration Management received 3 Statements of Use from MID, SodiusWillert, and IBM.</p>



<p>Tracked Resource Set received 3 Statements of Use from IBM, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and SodiusWillert [3].</p>

 In the digital age, personal data has become one of the most valuable commodities. However, the traditional methods of managing digital identity have been fraught with challenges, such as data breaches, identity theft, and lack of privacy. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) offers a new approach to digital identity management, which gives individuals full control over their personal data.

<p>In the digital age, personal data has become one of the most valuable commodities. However, the traditional methods of managing digital identity have been fraught with challenges, such as data breaches, identity theft, and lack of privacy. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) offers a new approach to digital identity management, which gives individuals full control over their personal data. As such, it presents a unique business opportunity for companies that can provide a reliable and user-friendly SSI management solution. This essay explores the concept of SSI as a business opportunity and discusses some of the challenges and opportunities presented by this emerging trend.</p>



 What is Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)? 



<p>SSI is a decentralized and secure way of managing digital identity. In this approach, individuals control their digital identities and data, allowing them to share it with others securely. The concept of SSI is based on the principles of user-centricity, privacy, and security. It provides users with a private and secure digital identity that is not tied to any central authority or organization.</p>



<p>The traditional approach to digital identity management involves relying on third-party organizations, such as governments or social media platforms, to manage personal data. However, this approach has several drawbacks, such as lack of control, vulnerability to data breaches, and limited privacy. SSI offers a new way of managing digital identity, which gives individuals control over their data and the ability to share it securely.</p>



 Business Opportunities in SSI 



<p>The emergence of SSI presents several business opportunities for companies that can provide reliable and user-friendly SSI management solutions. The following are some of the potential business opportunities in SSI:</p>



 
 Identity Verification and Authentication 
 



<p>One of the main challenges of digital identity management is verifying and authenticating users’ identities. SSI provides a new way of verifying and authenticating user identities, which is more secure and reliable than traditional methods. Companies can offer identity verification and authentication services using SSI, which will enable them to create a secure and user-friendly identity management solution.</p>



 
 Data Storage and Management 
 



<p>SSI allows individuals to control their personal data and share it securely. Companies can offer data storage and management services using SSI, which will enable users to store and manage their personal data securely. This will create a new market for companies that can provide reliable and secure data storage and management solutions.</p>



 
 Digital Signatures 
 



<p>Digital signatures are becoming increasingly important in the digital age. SSI provides a secure way of creating and managing digital signatures, which is more reliable than traditional methods. Companies can offer digital signature services using SSI, which will enable users to sign documents securely and reliably.</p>



 
 Access Control 
 



<p>SSI allows individuals to control who has access to their personal data. Companies can offer access control services using SSI, which will enable users to control who has access to their personal data. This will create a new market for companies that can provide reliable and user-friendly access control solutions.</p>



<p>Challenges in SSI</p>



<p>While SSI presents several business opportunities, it also presents some challenges. The following are some of the challenges in SSI:</p>



 
 Lack of Standards 
 



<p>One of the main challenges of SSI is the lack of standards. Currently, there are no established standards for SSI, which makes it difficult to create interoperable and scalable solutions. This lack of standards also makes it difficult for companies to create reliable and user-friendly SSI management solutions.</p>



 
 User Adoption 
 



<p>Another challenge of SSI is user adoption. SSI is a new concept, and many users may not be familiar with it. As such, it may take some time for users to adopt SSI, which may slow down the growth of the market for SSI management solutions.</p>



 
 Technical Complexity 
 



<p>SSI is a technically complex concept, which may make it difficult for companies to create user-friendly solutions.</p>

<p>In January we launched the pilot of our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/applications-are-open-learn-how-to-bring-a-responsible-data-approach-to-your-work-with-our-cohort-learning-programme/" title="">new cohort learning programme</a>, designed to equip social justice leaders with the knowledge and tools needed for implementing responsible data.</p>



<p>We were delighted to receive many incredible applications from social justice organisations in nearly 30 countries! This resulted in a fantastic cohort of 10 practitioners based in Latin America, Africa, Europe, and Asia, working on sectors such as environmental law, LGBTQI+ rights, gender-based violence and more. Together, we’re working on strengthening their approach to tech and data.&nbsp;</p>







 What we’ve covered so far&nbsp; 



<p>We kicked off our collective learning by getting more familiar with the concept of Responsible Data: together we reviewed resources such as the introduction to the <a href="https://the-engine-room.github.io/responsible-data-handbook/chapters/chapter-00-introduction.html" title="">Responsible Data Handbook</a>, some <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/takeaways-from-our-community-call-on-responsible-data-for-social-justice-organisations/" title="">key RD lessons for social justice organisations</a> and principles that <a href="https://responsibledata.io/anniversary/what-do-responsible-data-and-acrobats-have-in-common/" title="">responsible data and acrobats have in common</a>.</p>



<p>In our second session, we focused on the relationship between power, justice and data. We looked at some of the ways that data plays a role in reproducing, replicating, and exacerbating power structures in our societies, and explored some frameworks that bring questions of power and justice to discussions about data, including <a href="https://responsibledata.io/what-is-responsible-data/" title="">relevant aspects of responsible data</a>, data justice (and its <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1606268" title="">various meanings and practices</a>), and <a href="https://responsibledata.io/anniversary/the-seven-principles-of-data-feminism/" title="">data feminism</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After collectively considering how elements from these approaches could be applied in participants’ contexts, our next step was figuring out <a href="https://www.im-portal.org/blogs/how-to-start-your-responsible-data-journey" title="">what responsible data would look like</a> for each organisation participating, including mapping out some of the main responsible data issues participants have, and identifying some of the ways they’re already applying RD principles in their work.</p>



 What’s next?&nbsp; 



<p>We still have a few more sessions to go before wrapping up our pilot and we’ll share more updates from those soon, including more resources and useful tools we’ve been using.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the end of this learning programme, we hope that members of the cohort will be able to apply responsible data principles to their own work, be able to identify and reject data practices that cause harm to the communities they serve, and continue to build connections with each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the programme is finalised, cohort learning participants will be connected to our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support" title="">Light Touch Support</a> programme to receive guidance for their organisation to strengthen a responsible data area of their choice. If you weren’t able to join our cohort learning programme but would like our support – <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support" title="">reach out</a>!</p>

 Energy Web’s IAM stack now supports SIWE authentication for all types of applications, enabling new use cases for developers. <p>At Energy Web we are strong believers that <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/identity-at-ew/self-sovereign-identity-introduction">self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a> is a key enabling technology for the global energy transition. Last year we took an initial step in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/unlocking-the-potential-of-self-sovereign-identity-for-enterprise-with-energy-web-switchboard-ab41499003a0">unlocking the potential for SSI within the energy sector</a> with the release of Switchboard, an enterprise identity and access management (IAM) solution.</p><p>Today we are pleased to announce the next step in our journey with the implementation of <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361#abstract">Sign In With Ethereum (SIWE)</a> in Energy Web’s IAM stack. SIWE is a <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/why-sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-2/">feature-rich, decentralized authentication mechanism</a> that enables users to log into any web application (not just blockchain-based dApps), set preferences, and manage sessions using their Ethereum address and private key instead of a username and password. Within the Energy Web ecosystem, SIWE offers another way to empower users with greater control over their digital identity and data while strengthening application security and improving user experiences.</p><p>SIWE is currently implemented in the <a href="https://switchboard-dev.energyweb.org/">Switchboard dev environment</a>, and will be released in <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/welcome">production Switchboard</a> in early May&nbsp;2023.</p><p>In this post we will explain why SIWE is being integrated into Switchboard, show how it works, and provide examples of use cases that SIWE unlocks for developers.</p> Why SIWE for&nbsp;EWC? <p>An application is only as useful as its ability to verify that users are who they claim to be (and thus grant access to the appropriate systems and accounts). As the sophistication, risks, and consequences of cyberattacks that exploit user credentials have increased, authentication mechanisms have evolved to augment or replace conventional passwords with more robust cryptographic signatures.</p><p>SIWE, which was originally <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361#abstract">proposed as a formal standard in 2021</a>, provides an <a href="https://docs.login.xyz/">open-source, standardized framework</a> to securely authenticate users with any web-based services using an existing Ethereum address and private key. Beyond simply enhancing security, SIWE also provides a much more feature-rich login experience by enabling users to set preferences, initiate and resume sessions across time, and log into multiple services with a single set of credentials — all of which are hallmarks of popular single-sign-on identity providers.</p><p>It has numerous benefits, including security and UX improvements, over other PKI based signatures, including:</p>  A standard human readable verifiable message to confirm signatures.  An EIP-standard message schema to incorporate all the information needed for a secure authentication.  Verification for domain and uri, this assures the authenticity of the requester / verifier. Users can validate the domain the transaction was initiated from and the URI to which the access would be provided to (redirection) upon signing for authentication / authorization.  Preventing replay attacks with a nonce, which could be a challenge from a server or a random&nbsp;token.  Sample SIWE&nbsp;Message<p>With all these benefits, SIWE was a logical upgrade for <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/unlocking-the-potential-of-self-sovereign-identity-for-enterprise-with-energy-web-switchboard-ab41499003a0">Energy Web’s Switchboard IAM solution</a>. Now any application using <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/welcome">Switchboard</a> (or the underlying <a href="https://github.com/energywebfoundation/passport-did-auth">passport-did-auth v2.0.0</a> repository) for authentication gets the benefits of SIWE. The diagram below explains how SIWE is currently implemented in Energy Web’s identity&nbsp;stack:</p> Lets see a quick demo to understand the&nbsp;flow <p>Note: The highlighted text from the first MetaMask pop-up for signing is the SIWE&nbsp;message.</p> How developers can use SIWE with Energy Web’s Solutions <p>SIWE offers a bridge to leverage Web3 authentication (i.e. signatures from Web3 wallets) in conventional Web2 applications and services. For application developers who want to offer users the option to login with an Energy Web account, SIWE now enables federated identity management via a single identity service that can be used across multiple services using OpenID Connect (OIDC) for user’s session management.</p><p>An example of implementing SIWE-OIDC is shown&nbsp;below:</p><p>Current scope for SIWE-OIDC</p><p>SpruceID has deployed an OpenID Connect Provider (OP) which has support for SIWE and is hosted under <a href="https://oidc.signinwithethereum.org/">https://oidc.signinwithethereum.org/</a>. This deployment is a DAO-governed OP supported by ENS DAO.To use the hosted OIDC server it is required to register the application as an OIDC client using the OIDC client registration of <a href="https://oidc.signinwithethereum.org/">https://oidc.signinwithethereum.org/</a>. Currently, no user interface for OIDC client registration is supported. For that reason, developers will need to use the REST&nbsp;API.</p>REST APIExample Response<p>A client can then be updated or deleted using the registration_client_uri with the registration_access_token as a Bearer token. The authentication could be similar to the following workflow:</p><p>Note: This flow is just a possible flow, it could be different for a different use case. In addition to the functionality already provided by SIWE, future extensions are possible such as support for Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials and support for EIP-712 (type structure data hashing and signing).</p><p>The Energy Web team regularly participates in open-source digital identity initiatives including the W3C Credentials Community Group and Open Wallet Foundation, and we’ll continue to support and adopt new features and frameworks as they become available.</p><p>About Energy&nbsp;Web</p><p>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>This Committee Note describes the use of information models (IMs) and contrasts them with other modeling approaches, such as Entity-Relationship models for databases, and knowledge models / ontologies.</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce publication of “Information Modeling with JADN Version 1.0,” a Committee Note from the members of the OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC [1].</p>



<p>Early in its work, the OASIS OpenC2 Technical Committee recognized that the OpenC2 Language needed to be defined in an implementation-independent manner in order to achieve the goals of being “agnostic of underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation”. In response, the TC created an information modeling language, JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN), to support the information modeling needed to define OpenC2 in that manner.</p>



<p>This Committee Note describes the use of IMs, explains how to construct IMs using JADN, and contrasts IMs with other modeling approaches, such as Entity-Relationship models for databases, and knowledge models / ontologies. Information models (IMs) are used to define and generate physical data models, validate information instances, and enable lossless translation across data formats.</p>



<p>JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) is a UML-based information modeling language that defines data structure independently of data format. While JADN was created to facilitate the development of OpenC2, it is an independent specification, and can be used for any information modeling application.</p>



<p>This Committee Note is available here:</p>



<p>Information Modeling with JADN Version 1.0<br>Committee Note 01<br>19 April 2023</p>

You can download the ZIP file here:<br><a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/imjadn/v1.0/cn01/imjadn-v1.0-cn01.zip">https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/imjadn/v1.0/cn01/imjadn-v1.0-cn01.zip</a></p>



<p>Members of the OpenC2 TC [1] approved this Committee Note by a Full Majority vote on 19 April 2023 as documented in the TC minutes [2], and it is now available online in the OASIS Library as referenced above.</p>

<p>This article describes the benefits of the OpenID4VC standard and provides insight into its development and incubation within the IDunion project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://openid.net/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>&nbsp;(OpenID4VC) is a suite of standards for issuing and using digital credentials in online scenarios. IDunion has tested the suite and contributed to its evolution since 2021. Today, the standards have already found their way into products on a global scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June 2022, the OpenID Connect Working Group as part of the OpenID Foundation published a&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/06/OIDF-Whitepaper_OpenID-for-Verifiable-Credentials-V2_2022-06-23.pdf">whitepaper detailing the usage of verifiable credentials in combination with the OpenID Connect</a>&nbsp;communication protocol. In the document, the lead editors Kristina Yasuda, Torsten Lodderstedt, David Chadwick, Kenichi Nakamura and Jo Vercammen describe how trust will shift with increased control for end users, by putting them in the centre of the exchange between the verifier and the credential issuer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The whitepaper further describes what use cases OpenID4VC can be used for, such as employee onboarding, entitlement management, driver licences (mDL) or SMART health cards. The variety of scenarios illustrate the flexibility regarding the used credential standards as well as the issuer-verifier relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benefits of using the OpenID4VC specification family as a credential transport protocol:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Existing mass adoption of the OpenID Connect Standard with existing Single sign-on solutions (“Sign in with … ”)&nbsp; 



 Developers of decentralised identity applications benefit from the proven simplicity and security of OAuth and OpenID&nbsp; 



 Implementation flexibility of other components including identifier types, credential formats, revocation schemes, crypto suites, trust mechanism etc.&nbsp; 



 Incubation in a well known and recognized standardisation organisation.&nbsp; 
 







<p>The first time an implementation of the standard was demonstrated to the public was in 2021 when yes.com and Lissi did a prototypical implementation to enable a passwordless authentication to Nextcloud with verifiable credentials and demonstrated it at the European Cloud Identity Conference 2021. The implementation is based on Hyperledger Indy, using Anoncreds within the Lissi Wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, gematik’s Futurelab built a prototype based on Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python, which they extended to support Verifiable Presentation Exchange over HTTP and OpenID for Verifiable Presentations. The concept was presented to the public in April 2022 at the Internet Identity Workshop. Their proof of concept uses W3C Verifiable Credentials and allows for multi-format credential requests, ultimately making it easier for Relying Parties to ask for a credential without being aware of the format it was issued in. Further the concept demonstrated holder binding using a JWS.</p>



<p>Torsten Lodderstedt from yes.com and Kristina Yasuda from Microsoft&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2021/09/OIDF_OIDC4SSI-Update_Kristina-Yasuda-Torsten-Lodderstedt.pdf">presented a summary of the standard</a>&nbsp;at the same Internet Identity Workshop in April 2022. Videos of a demonstration of the user flow (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDg2ma7TwWU">on device</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3VQE-vMnQ">cross device</a>) are also available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The implementation was done as part of the IDunion Research Project. We are especially proud that OpenID for Verifiable Credentials has found its way into the A<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">rchitecture Reference Framework (ARF)</a>&nbsp;as part of the revision of the eIDAS regulation to create a European digital identity ecosystem. Currently the IDunion partners are developing the Tech-Stack 2.0 including OpenID4VC as communication protocol and SD-JWT as credential format to ensure alignment with the eIDAS Regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About IDunion</p>



<p>The IDunion research project builds an ecosystem for trusted identity credentials. The project is fostered by the Ministry of Economics Affairs and Climate Action of Germany and comprises more than 60 organisations. Recently a European Cooperative (IDunion SCE) has been founded as a governance entity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About yes.com</p>



<p>yes.com operates an Open Banking Ecosystem, where bank customers can use their identity data and login credentials with their financial institution to authenticate, identify themselves with 3rd parties, digitally sign with Qualified Electronic Signatures according to eIDAS and pay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>About gematik</p>



<p>Gematik is the German national agency for the digitalisation of the healthcare system. It develops the concept for the telematics infrastructure as an all-encompassing and secure data room, setting the standards for the use of this data room, and coordinating its reliable operation and establishment in line with market requirements.</p>

<p>Interoperability is crucial for developing efficient, sustainable, secure, and useful identity ecosystems. Identity interoperability is the ability to share identity standards, frameworks, or protocols between identity systems or models to allow computer systems or software to exchange and use identity information within and across organizational, regional, and national boundaries. Assurance frameworks in particular, like the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> (PCTF), help to establish an expected baseline and frame of reference for both public and private sector digital identity capabilities while prioritizing user-centered design, privacy, security, and convenience of use.</p>

<p>By Duncan Sparrell, sFractal Consulting, OASIS Open Board Member</p> 


      



<p>There’s a <a href="https://youtu.be/S4PYI6TzqYk">great scene</a> at the end of Steven Spielberg’s extraterrestrial opus Close Encounters of the Third Kind (apologies: spoilers ahead), in which a team of human scientists initiate a dialogue with an alien ship via an amplified synthesizer and a board of lights. Two entirely different species bark and bellow at one another in sharp figures and dancing lights that no one seems to fully understand.</p>



<p>“It seems they’re trying to teach us a basic tonal vocabulary,” one of the scientists says.</p>



<p>Another guy offers simply, “It’s the first day of school, fellows.”</p>



<p>Sound familiar? Anyone who has ever tried to bridge the technical side of cybersecurity in a discussion with the business community might be able to relate to the conundrum of two wildly different groups trying desperately to speak one another’s language.</p>



<p>In the case of the Close Encounters parable, it’s worth entertaining the idea that you and I and everyone else working to standardize cybersecurity automation may be the aliens. Don’t believe me? Try saying this to a loved one over dinner: “CASP, STIX/TAXII, CACAO, OCA, PACE, CVE, SBOM, VEX, IOB, TAC, NIEM, STIX Shifter, Kestrel, OpenC2, OCSF, OXA, VSMI.”</p>



<p>Those of us who have devoted years of our professional lives to advancing cybersecurity automation are in the unfortunate position of imparting vital technical knowledge to essential stakeholders who may not speak our language.</p>



<p>The 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy spells it out in no uncertain terms: “By working in partnership with industry; civil society; and State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, we will rebalance the responsibility for cybersecurity to be more effective and more equitable.”</p>



<p>Put another way, it is now incumbent on the various tribes of cybersecurity stakeholders to pool their ideas and unite their efforts to build upon a shared vernacular.</p>



<p>The Need for Common Language</p>



<p>Divergent perspectives, objectives, and bodies of knowledge must be knit together. Our effectiveness and resilience as cybersecurity professionals depends on our ability to braid common truths, shared goals, and universal language together into a structural network of agreed upon practices and products that shield our digital world.</p>



<p>President Biden’s Executive Order 14028 gives a pithy cybersecurity principle for the macro level: “In the end, the trust we place in our digital infrastructure should be&nbsp;proportional to how trustworthy and transparent that infrastructure is, and to the consequences we will incur if&nbsp;that&nbsp;trust is misplaced.“</p>



<p>But the devil is in the details – and each tribe tends to dive into its own details which are incomprehensible to the other.</p>



<p>We’re back at the moment of musical contact in Close Encounters. Two of the most intrepid, visionary, and extremely capable communities can remain aloof behind privileged expertise. Or, we can step out of our respective domains of knowledge and make a concerted effort to see how the other half lives.</p>



<p>Technically-minded wizards of the cybersecurity world must go to great lengths to communicate our work in a way that retains its value without obstructing it within a veil of the obtuse. Metaphor, allusion, and analogy, though slippery, are powerful tools that can help us bridge immense divides. Even closer to home, we do well to unbury our heads from silos of specialization and cultivate a broader grasp of what our colleagues are proposing, testing, and adopting.</p>



<p>Big pictures painted in the language of broad strokes are not the only art we need to fine-hone. Sometimes simple business numbers do more to influence acquisition and implementation of cybersecurity technology than any dazzling technical brief could. I am confident that cybersecurity automation is a no-brainer cost/risk reduction if we just did the math and converted the sum to dollars. After all, wise expenditures are just good business and financial quantification is an almost monolithically important aspect of business decision making.</p>



<p>We Should Be Good at Influencing Industry With Quantified Risk Projections, but Somehow We Aren’t</p>



<p>When a new exploit or a staggering zero-day lurks around every corner, prognosticating on the future with anything approaching certainty feels like a foolish way to end up appearing short-sighted. Accordingly, we need to accustom ourselves to operating in a window of probabilities. “Could,” “might,” and “maybe” are powerful words when coupled with rate of response and financial liability figures.<br><br>Hubbard &amp; Seiersen’s cybersecurity Rosetta Stone for stakeholder communication takes inspiration from the exact other end of the cinematic universe as Close Encounters. Their approach borrows from the straightforward sports agent jargon of Jerry Maguire–cut the excuses and show them the money. A particularly sharp rhetorical buzzsaw from “<a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/how-to-measure-anything-in-cybersecurity-risk-douglas-w-hubbard/1122610668">How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk</a>” lays it all out: “there are plenty of fields with massive risk, minimal data, and profoundly chaotic actors that are regularly modeled using traditional mathematical methods.” What’s our excuse?</p>



<p>The Stakes Couldn’t Be Higher</p>



<p>Critical systems are woefully vulnerable even though we have the ability to reduce this risk. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab produced a study on cybersecurity that produced stunning results. Properly deployed cybersecurity automation can limit the scope of an exploit from weeks to minutes reducing damage by several orders of magnitude.</p>



<p>These numbers and the technology that produced them are only as valuable as our ability to communicate them. Without initiating a dialogue that challenges us to learn new modes of conversation, we risk remaining alien to one another and losing mightily in our potential to grow in support of one another.</p>



<p>For myself and many of my colleagues who have spent their entire careers grappling with huge challenges in the field of cybersecurity, it’s not the first day of school. Far from it. But we live in exciting times with unanticipated sea changes that require fresh thinking. I think we are up to the challenge if we work together and I couldn’t be more excited to embark on this journey with all of you to translate the alphabet soup of cybersecurity automation into quantitative business risk reduction.</p>

<p>During the first three months of this year, we had 13 partners in our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">Light Touch Support </a>(LiTS) Programme! We worked with organisations and individuals based in seven countries, all of whom are doing inspiring, impactful work in sectors such as civic tech, transparency and accountability, migrants rights, peacebuilding, and reproductive justice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Common needs that emerged across these conversations revolved around getting started on (and maintaining) responsible data journeys, and keeping communications channels safe.</p>



  
  
<p>What is LiTS? LiTS partnerships offer lightweight, pro bono support to organisations and individuals with questions about using data or technology in their social justice work. In each LiTS partnership, our goal is to help our partners clarify their vision and next steps, in order to move forward independently. Learn more <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">here</a>.</p>



 Best practices for working with health data 



<p>One of our goals for the year has been to increase our offer of support to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/are-you-working-at-the-intersection-of-health-and-social-justice/" title="">organisations working at the intersection of health and social justice</a>. In these first few months of 2023, we partnered with a number of organisations working on issues related to health and who were interested in strengthening the way they currently use data, but wanted to make sure they were doing it in responsible ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In particular, a trend we observed when working with these partners is that they’re keen to learn more about best practices for collecting data, how to manage the data they already have (including potentially sensitive data) and how to tell stories with it – and how to keep their communities safe while doing so, which is no simple feat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(If you’re working at the intersection of social justice and health and would like to get tech and data support from our team, we would love to work with you: <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">get in touch</a>!).</p>



 Responsible data: where to get started as a social justice organisation? 
  
  



<p>Another big theme that came up in our Light Touch Support this quarter was Responsible Data (RD). Most of our LiTS partners this quarter were looking to figure out <a href="https://www.im-portal.org/blogs/how-to-start-your-responsible-data-journey" title="">how to get started</a> with their responsible data journey; many had questions revolving around how to assess the potential risks and consequences of working with data.</p>



<p>For each LiTS partner who wanted to learn more about responsible data, we developed a set of tailored recommendations to address their questions. Some of the resources we shared most often include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 General resources focused on Responsible data – including information about the <a href="https://responsibledata.io/" title="">RD community site</a> and <a href="https://lists.theengineroom.org/lists/info/responsible_data" title="">community</a>, and tailored advice about data management practices (such as how to manage access and permissions for internal data storage). 



 <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/#:~:text=The%20process%20of%20becoming%20RAD,a%20life%20cycle%20of%20usefulness." title="">Becoming RAD</a>: a set of tipsheets on how to Retain, Archive and Dispose of data responsibly, available in English, French and Spanish. 



 Key resources such as <a href="https://merltech.org/resources/" title="">MERL Tech’s website</a> and Catherine d’Ignazio and Lauren Klein’s book, <a href="https://responsibledata.io/anniversary/the-seven-principles-of-data-feminism/" title="">Data Feminism</a>. 



 Resources and tools for data visualisation, such as <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/" title="">Tableau Public</a> and <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/" title="">Data Wrapper</a>. 
 



<p>We’ve also noticed the need for more resources about responsible data to be available in languages other than English. If you or your organisation don’t use English as your main language and you have thoughts about what type of resources would be useful for you, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/contact/" title="">we would love to hear from you</a>! In the meantime, our team is able to offer support in Portuguese and Spanish. Schedule a call below.</p>

 Figuring out how to communicate more securely&nbsp; 



<p>Many social justice organisations we support are based in contexts where some of the most common communication channels could potentially represent a vulnerability. With <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/join-us-a-conversation-about-digital-resilience-strategies-in-times-of-increasing-surveillance/" title="">government surveillance on the rise</a> in many countries, much of our work has been focused on supporting our partners in assessing how the tools they use can impact the safety of their teams and of the communities they work with. In other words, this past quarter we spent some time looking into the tools our partners used for everyday communication, such as messaging apps, emails services, phone applications.</p>



<p>Our support in this area ranged from sharing specific advice based on partners’ needs (such as targeted information about which alternative, privacy-respecting tools partners could adopt) to acting as a sounding board for big-picture thinking about our partners’ digital resilience as a whole.</p>



<p>If you want to learn more about this, you’re welcome to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">reach out to us</a> or join our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/join-us-a-conversation-about-digital-resilience-strategies-in-times-of-increasing-surveillance/">community call about digital resilience</a> and surveillance later this month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite exciting progress toward more secure and usable factors, the best MFA mechanism for consumers really isn’t MFA at all — it’s passkeys. Passkeys are a FIDO authenticator with the advantage of being backed up to the cloud, so if you lose your device or buy a new one, all you must do is sign into your iCloud or Google Play account to recover your passkeys. Passkeys use public key cryptography and device biometrics, making them resistant to many known attacks, and are easy for the user.</p>

<p>The OASIS Board of Directors comprises industry leaders who are integral to the organization's success. In our Q&amp;A, gain a better sense of who they are and why they serve the OASIS community.</p> 


<p></p>



      



<p>Meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/riedelinc/">Daniel Riedel</a>, an accomplished entrepreneur with extensive experience in technology, data protection, and cybersecurity. A longtime respected member of OASIS, Daniel has been a steadfast supporter of the organization’s standards and open source initiatives that make the world a safer place.&nbsp;Read more about Daniel’s intriguing journey from being an artist to working in cybersecurity.</p>



<p>Can you tell us about your background and what inspired you to join the OASIS Board?<br>I joined OASIS because I believe that standards are crucial for business and fostering collaboration, and I want to see how I can help OASIS thrive. Being seated next to my fellow board members makes me feel incredibly humble. Their pedigree, backgrounds, and technological achievements are simply astounding. I’m an entrepreneur and a futurist, and I’m also someone who’s very passionate about advances in cybersecurity. For those reasons, I wanted to offer my unique viewpoint to the board. When it comes to agility and figuring out how to accelerate the organization, those are my passions and those are the areas where I can contribute the most.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s your role on the board?&nbsp;<br>I’m treasurer of the OASIS Board, and in this role I keep an eye on the organization’s finances. In my experiences, I’ve served as the CEO of a company, I’ve reported to boards, and I’ve been in charge of a bottom line. My objective at OASIS is to use my experience as treasurer to assist our executive director and chief operating officer to assess our financial situation, come up with ideas to strengthen it, and then report that to the board. I’m here to be that conduit from a financial perspective. Audit, finance, compliance, and oversight are all part of being treasurer, but I’m also trying to see how we can improve the organization from a finance perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What types of skills and expertise do you bring to support the OASIS Board?<br>I’d describe myself as having an entrepreneurial spirit and the ability to think creatively outside the box. I have a passion for standards and open source communities, which are so important to the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I grew up around computers and began programming for the first time when I was eight years old on an Apple computer at the University of Oklahoma where my father taught. I went to school for illustration and fine art, because for me, computers were very logical and easy to navigate while fine art was a lifelong investigation into creativity and expression. I spent some time at California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB) as part of their multimedia program and I ended up starting my first company working with the National Science Foundation and the Monterey Bay Research Institute before I turned 21. I became very involved in my business, helping to solve a variety of issues in my community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do you hope to make an impact as a board member during your term?<br>I hope to help bring everyone together and to help accelerate the organization. I love what OASIS Open’s Executive Director, Francis Beland, is doing by looking at new markets. The Board has never been more important; its members are industry veterans and sages in technology who understand what a standard should be. What Francis is doing, which I think is really important, is going to the industries that need standards the most. Because of how quickly everything is developing and how AI is affecting every industry, data is becoming even more crucial. Data normalization is the key point for some of these industries to move faster. If you look at where some of our standards are today, SAML, MQTT, or STIX and TAXII, these are good examples of standards that allow us to communicate rapidly between organizations. The ability for us to reduce friction and have data interoperability will accelerate solutions to all of these issues, whether you’re looking at supply chain problems or environmental challenges. Fundamentally, if you look at how humans can thrive better in this world, we need to be able to communicate more effectively. When it comes to computing, data normalization and standards are among the most fundamental components. OASIS can provide this and serve as a catalyst to these industries.</p>



<p>A great challenge facing human kind is climate. We have to figure out how we stabilize this planet, and one of the ways to do that is to understand supply chain and friction points in that supply chain. We have to remember that some parts of the world might not have caught up to wherever we are in this modern era of technology, but there are repercussions for the rest of the globe. If you look at how we do manifests for shipping, some of it’s the same as it was in the 1930s or 1940s; the business hasn’t changed as technology has evolved. If you look at supply chain issues, those become big sticking points. When you reduce the friction, you accelerate our ability to fix that problem. That’s why when you look at climate, what we’re doing is so important. Climate affects all different countries, but getting countries to agree to things is probably the most challenging thing in the world. What’s great about standards is that there’s not a lot of emotion in it, which means that, in some cases, it’s going to be a lot easier to get folks to agree. However, humans are humans, they’re like cats, they like to all do their different things and that’s why they’re so awesome.</p>



<p>How did you first get involved with OASIS?<br>I first got involved with OASIS because of the work that my company was doing with the state of California for a project called CES-21 working with Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison. Our role was to try and help create a language that allowed us to do machine to machine automated threat response to cyber threats. The first challenge was for all machines to be able to identify the threat, agree on the threat, and then agree on the response. We knew that we needed a standard to do that. At that time, Richard Struse and multiple people from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had just started building the standards called STIX and TAXII. We jumped in to be a part of that collaboration and that is what brought me to OASIS.</p>



<p>What are your thoughts about the OASIS community, and what sets OASIS apart from other organizations?<br>I think it’s our focus on the mission of our organization and the community that we build. I think that OASIS is really good with human beings; standards can’t be created without human beings. The OASIS community has a warmth to it, and it’s the tone that we set when we build our Technical Committees (TCs) and the tone that we set with our people when we have conferences. It’s the tone that OASIS adopts that distinguishes us from other organizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What are some of the reasons companies, organizations, individuals bring their projects to OASIS?&nbsp;<br>We have a phenomenal history of establishing cross border ties with the ITU, the European Union, and countries all over the world. If you look at our roster, we are a very diverse global organization, and that’s one of our major powers. If you are an organization and you want to develop a global standard that thrives and is brought into the international community, I don’t think there’s another organization that can do it better. It’s one of the things that OASIS does exceptionally well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where do you see OASIS going in the future?&nbsp;<br>I think OASIS is going to help stabilize the planet in terms of cybersecurity, commerce, supply chain, and the environment. OASIS is capable of accomplishing that.</p>



<p>Can you tell us about any role models or mentors, or someone who has inspired you in your career?&nbsp;<br>I’ve had so many mentors in my life so far, I wish I could mention everyone’s name here because there’s not just one person. I would say that the most impactful people, besides my parents, are Gordon Freedman, Mercedes Deluca, Susan Manchester, Barak Berkowitz, Kaoru Hayashi, Jim Blom, Sarah Jane Terp, Rita Foster, and Pat Duggan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My friend Gordon Freedman, one of my mentors, produced the movie A Brief History of Time, the telling of Stephen Hawking’s book. I got to work with Hawking about a dozen times, and those were some of the most influential experiences I’ve ever had. He was brilliant and driven; he lived in a wheelchair, he could only write with his thumb, and he couldn’t feed himself. But he was full of life. Most people would end up in a pit of despair; he was one of the funniest people I’ve ever met. Steven taught me to love life and he taught me that, at the end of the day, if he’s able to do that, then I should have no bad days for the rest of my life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do you have an impact story they can tell me about with your work in open source or open standards?<br>There’s no quick way around a standard. During COVID, there was a project that tried to launch a standard around checking vaccination status in a secure way, however, it was supposed to be fully completed in three months. You can’t rush a standard. A standard is only, in part, the documentation that you create. What’s more important is the community that you build around that standard: the entrepreneurs, the technologists, the subject matter experts. It’s the people who come together and are compelled to have a conversation about how they’re going to represent their industry and how they’re going to share information in their industry. That’s the most valuable piece. When I consider the initiatives that Richard Struse and Trey Darley began at OASIS, I remember the magic of seeing the community come together, the products and the capabilities that were contributed, and the good that the standard accomplished by enabling a quicker response to cybersecurity threats. That was truly amazing and it was wonderful to be there and take part in it. Seeing the technology and innovation that was built around STIX and TAXII, OpenC2, and CACAO, and what those organizations were able to deliver was incredible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What trends or changes do you see in the industry that are most exciting or thought provoking? How can OASIS better position itself for what’s coming?<br>Everyone’s talking about ChatGPT and generative AI right now. Generative AI is moving very quickly and our ability to work with computers is only going to accelerate. The barrier between the human computing model is going to come crashing down as we’re able to have a natural conversation with a machine. The crux of that is going to be the data normalization that underpins this information flow. Generative AI environments are non-deterministic environments. In some cases there’s a lot of concern, and rightfully so, about the space. At the end of the day, machines need to know how to talk to other machines. The things that OASIS is doing – standards, open source technologies, and open source tools – will be fundamentally part of the accelerant going forward. As the world realizes that this is a crucial piece of how to work together, we’re going to see massive growth. Over the course of the next few years, whether it’s in mining, environmental systems, or another industry, everybody needs to be able to exchange data. You have to comprehend the nature of the data in order to do that. Generative AI can do a lot to simulate things, but at the end of the day, that data knowledge is going to be really important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What professional accomplishments are you proud of?&nbsp;<br>I would have to say&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?436330-1/hearing-focuses-energy-infrastructure-cybersecurity">testifying in front of the Senate</a>&nbsp;in 2017 at the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It was a hearing on the efforts to protect the nation’s energy providers from cybersecurity threats and I talked about STIX and TAXII as a part of my testimony. I’d never been more terrified my entire life, but I walked in there, and I rehearsed and tried to make sure I didn’t make a lot of mistakes. What they don’t tell you is when C-SPAN records that testimony, the camera is coming from the podium just below the Senators, that’s where the camera is aiming at you. So I was trying to make eye contact with the Senators and I was trying to read my paper and then go back and forth between them. Let’s just say, if you ever testify before the Senate, just look at the camera! The Senators get looked at all the time. Just look at the camera. I would say testifying in front of the Senate was an amazing experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of the day, though, I would actually say that the professional accomplishment that I am the proudest of is my network and the people I get to be around every day. I wake up and I’m really happy about whom I get to work with every day.</p>



<p>Best piece of advice you received so far in your career?<br>Your career is a marathon, not a sprint. Enjoy it. If you’re not enjoying your career, find a new one. If you wake up in the morning realizing this isn’t what you want to be doing, start trying to figure out how you can change that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s an interesting fact about you?<br>I was an art major. There is no difference between a painting, a business, or a project. It’s the visualization you have in your head and it’s what you’re thinking about at that moment in time. For me, when it comes to painting, I’m painting when I’m sleeping, I’m painting when I’m having breakfast, and I’m also painting when I’m at the canvas. And when I’m reviewing it the next day, it basically consumes my brain. But so do all the other projects that I’m working on, because I’m trying to visualize that project in the same sense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My first business was a graphic design company and we provided graphic design services to local Monterey Bay area businesses. The company grew and we began developing websites and software, working with the National Science Foundation, AT&amp;T, and Disney. From the launch of the design business, I became more involved with computers at a time when the web was just starting to come together. I loved art and computers, but back then, not just any computer could create art; you had to spend a lot of money on a computer that powerful. As part of working with NSF and CSUMB, we were allocated many Silicon Graphics machines. SGI did very well because they built the computers that made 3-D design possible for companies like Pixar. They couldn’t just use a normal computer to do that kind of animation and graphics. For me to run Photoshop, I had to find the most powerful, expensive computer and that’s when I became involved with Silicon Graphics. With Silicon Graphics, I was basically dealing with supercomputers, and I had the privilege of working on their computers, which had so much power. I even had to call Pacific Gas &amp; Electric to install more power to my house. With the graphics engines I was using, I needed to have the systems connected in order to render something. That’s when I started getting into computers, Unix, networking, and security. Back then I had a server in my garage that was hosted with a T1 and I learned the fundamentals like Secure Shell (SSH). It wasn’t as malicious as it is today, where people are defrauding companies and shutting down hospitals, which is why cybersecurity is so important from a geopolitical standpoint, but back then you still had to learn about it and you still had to understand it. And so that’s how I progressed from being an artist to working in cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Toronto, April 20, 2023 – The Digital Identity &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) has released the results of its 2022 Digital Identity Perspectives Research. The study provides insight into Canadians’ attitudes and perceptions toward digital identity, privacy, and their adoption of digital wallets.</p>



<p>The research reveals a strong majority of Canadians believe they should be able to control the data about them held and issued by both governments and the private sector. In addition, while most respondents are concerned about protecting their privacy, they feel only somewhat knowledgeable about the subject, presenting an opportunity for education and awareness.</p>



<p>“The results of our Digital Identity Perspectives Research provide valuable insights into the attitudes and perceptions of Canadians towards personal data control and privacy,” said Joni Brennan, President of DIACC. “We are committed to working in partnership with the public and private sectors to secure, trusted, and privacy-enhancing digital benefits for all Canadians.”</p>



<p>One notable finding is that caregivers are among the most interested in the benefits and adoption of digital identity to meet their dependents’ caregiving needs related to school and health records for example. The study also revealed that most Canadians are concerned about their personal information being available online, with concerns about identity theft and senior scams at the forefront.</p>



<p>When creating a digital identity framework, most respondents feel that collaboration between the public and private sectors is the best approach, with a slight preference for the private sector. This sentiment has increased from 65% in 2021 to 71% in 2022.</p>



<p>Regarding digital wallets, familiarity with the concept continues to grow, with 59% of respondents being familiar in 2022, compared to 54% in 2021. In addition, the use of digital wallets is also increasing, with 41% of respondents using one in 2022 compared to 38% in 2021. Apple Wallet’s use has increased from 17% in 2021 to 24% in 2022.</p>



<p>Finally, the study found that 2/3 of Canadians feel that the COVID-19 pandemic has made secure, trusted, privacy-enhancing digital identity and verification solutions more critical to help Canadians who chose to use this technology, transact safely online, virtually unchanged from 2021.</p>



<p>“The PCTF offers a practical tool for meeting Canadians’ transparency and personal data control demands. The PCTF sets the basis for digital trust, clearly defining the duty of care people and partners should expect when utilizing digital verification solutions,” said Dave Nikolejsin, Chair of the DIACC Board.</p>



<p>“The public and private sectors have a unique opportunity to put the PCTF into action to help Canadians secure personal data control, reducing the threat of fraud while also promoting economic growth opportunities. A safe and secure data environment benefits everyone,” said Ibrahim Gedeon, Board Member of DIACC and Chief Technology Officer for TELUS.</p>

<p>Findynet Cooperative conducted an SSI technology survey to guide the selection of technologies for Findynet Test Network. Based on the conclusions drawn from this technology survey, the Findynet Cooperative will build its test network on Hyperledger Indy.</p>
<p>During March 2023, Findynet Cooperative conducted a survey on technologies supporting Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). We reached out to esteemed experts and thought leaders and asked them, what technologies they would use if they were to build an SSI ecosystem. In particular, we wanted to focus on tried and tested technologies that are usable right now.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted by an on-line questionnaire and follow-up meetings. We received 15 responses by the end of March.</p>
<p>The results are published in the report <a href="https://findy.fi/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Findynet-Test-Network-Technology-Survey-Results.pdf">Findynet Test Network Technology Survey Results</a>.</p>

<p>Based on the conclusions drawn from this technology survey, the Findynet Cooperative will build its test network on Hyperledger Indy. The test network will serve as a sandbox for our cooperative members and other stakeholders to test various wallet implementations and develop test use cases. &nbsp;We will announce the availability of our Test Network during H1 of 2023.</p>
<p>Later in 2023, we will select a technology stack for our pilot network. The technology choices for the pilot network will be more forward-looking and also aim to define the architecture for the production network. Pilot and production networks may be built on different technologies than the first version of the test network.</p>
<p>We continue to evaluate other standards, protocols, and technologies for the services we are planning to offer in addition to the current Test Network.</p>

<p>The public-key cryptography standards maintained by the PKCS #11 Technical Committee is now out for a 60-day public review preceding the call for consent</p> 


<p>OASIS and the PKCS 11 TC [1] are pleased to announce that PKCS #11 Specification V3.1 and PKCS #11 Profiles V3.1 are now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>The documents describe the public-key cryptography standards maintained and enhanced by the OASIS PKCS 11 Technical Committee.</p>



<p>The Specification defines a platform-independent API to cryptographic tokens, such as hardware security modules and smart cards. The API itself is named “Cryptoki” (from “cryptographic token interface”) and pronounced “crypto-key”. The specification defines data types, functions and other basic components of the interface and also defines mechanisms that are anticipated for use with the current version of PKCS #11.</p>



<p>Profiles define the use of PKCS#11 data types, objects, functions and mechanisms within specific contexts of provider and consumer interaction. These profiles define a set of normative constraints for employing PKCS#11 within a particular environment or context of use.</p>



<p>The TC received 3 Statements of Use from from Utimaco, Information Security Corp (ISC), and Cryptsoft [3]</p>

 Our 2022 retrospective is up! <a href="https://2022.theengineroom.org/" title="">Read it here</a>. 



<p>Last year there was a lot to be celebrated at The Engine Room: We published path-breaking research at the intersection of climate justice and digital rights, dug deeper into our previous digital ID research and published findings on what digital IDs rooted in justice could look like, and published an online resource on tech tools for human rights documenters, in multiple languages.&nbsp;</p>







<p>We also moved forward in our journey towards our own increased digital resilience and that of our partners, continued to steward an engaged community of responsible data practitioners, and provided direct support to over 50 organisations from across the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To learn more about the work we did in 2022, our learnings from the year, and our plans for the future, head over to <a href="https://2022.theengineroom.org" title="">the retrospective</a> – you can also find out more about some of the inspiring organisations we worked with last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re an organisation working on issues related to furthering social justice, the retrospective might also give you some ideas on how we could support you with your own tech and data challenges!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Vishaal B. Bhuyan found himself with a seemingly insurmountable supply chain issue, he never expected his journey would lead to a revolutionary new approach to food safety. With the help of a synthetic biologist, they created traceable tags that not only allowed for better tracking&nbsp;but could also kill pathogens. But will this breakthrough technology be adopted?</p> <p>Vishaal B. Bhuyan, CEO of Aanika Biosciences, explains the importance of food safety, the potential that’s out there to enhance this safety, and more.</p> <p>Key takeaways:</p>    Food safety is not only important for people, but it’s vital for businesses. Vishaal says it’s important for companies to have insurance to cover incidents like this. In fact, a company he knows lost 30% of its top line revenue from this.   Aanika is creating cutting-edge technology to combat pathogens in food. They developed a probiotic microorganism that's been deactivated which contains a unique DNA sequence does things like addressing pathogen growth, killing pathogens, and many different secondary functions.   The value between biology and insurance is incredibly valuable. Aanika’s insurance program converts this thing that many people don't understand–but need–into a digestible narrative around cost savings.    <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p><a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1 US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>Connect with guest:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishaal-b-bhuyan-9053b0139/">Vishaal Bhuyan’s LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>If identity is the foundation of society, and the way in which we communicate shapes how our society operates, then I wonder how our society will change as our communication of identity changes?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some recent developments for identity communication are Decentralised Identifiers and Verificable Credentials (DID’s and VC’s), which make identity communication more efficient, accessible and effective (as most new technologies do). The use of DID’s and VC’s propose some new opportunities and challenges for us as an industry and a nation.</p>



<p>Earlier this month&nbsp;we had a great discussion about digital identity and what this means for Māori. And while we identified that Māori already have a long history of developed systems for communicating identity, there has been a need to develop new methods to communicate identity to different organisations and institutions for different purposes. Some examples of these being Tribal registries, Māori land court records, and Iwi or Hapū membership cards. This raises questions around whether Te Ao Māori will then adopt the use of DID’s and VC’s and how this technology could strengthen Māori identity and Tino Rangatiratanga.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also important for us as an industry and a nation to prepare for new identity issuers and credentials and ensure we avoid situations like this, where an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5419519">Indigenous grandfather and 12-year-old were handcuffed in front of a Vancouver bank after trying to open an account</a>.</p>

<p>Usernames and passwords have been the most common authentication method for digitally accessing an account. However, passwords are vulnerable to compromise through a variety of attack vectors.&nbsp;“Passwords are fundamentally flawed, because they can be hacked, forgotten, and stolen,” says Andrew Shikiar, executive director and chief marketing officer for the FIDO Alliance. “It’s also tough to enter passwords on keyboardless devices. Plus, more than 80% of data breaches can be tracked back to passwords.”</p>

<p>It’s nearly two decades since Bill Gates predicted the passing of the traditional username and password, warning that this archaic security combo simply wasn’t up to the task of keeping information safe and secure in the long term. Passwords will not be around forever and if we are ever to get serious about cyber security and <a href="https://www.comparethecloud.net/articles/the-value-of-colocation-data-centres-in-iot/">the protection of data</a>, we have to find another way. That’s one of the main reasons why passwordless authentication is gaining so much popularity as a more secure and convenient alternative to traditional passwords. And it seems the industry agrees. Tech giants Apple, Google, and Microsoft announced last May that they would support FIDO2 — authentication specifications based on public key cryptography and international standards — to enable passwordless authentication across devices.&nbsp;</p>

 Three lenses to improve your digital&nbsp;strategy <p>“You’ve got to have a system”, as they say. At WAO, we’ve got one that we often apply to strategy projects of all shapes and sizes. Especially digital ones. And it’s easy to remember! 3Ps: People. Process. Product*.</p><p>In practice, the 3Ps are a series of lenses we use with clients to ensure that we’re thinking through projects holistically. Below, we give an introduction on how to use it in practice.</p><p>*A note on the ordering — when we’re talking, we find it easier to say “People. Product. Process” rather than “People. Process. Product”, don’t you? But you can put them in any order, it’s up to&nbsp;you!</p> The Power of&nbsp;People <p>The foundation of any successful organisation is the people who are a part of it. When we talk about ‘People,’ we’re talking about the individuals who make up organisational teams, along with your stakeholders (such as your board), as well as the audience you serve. We also make sure to think about community members and volunteers who are furthering an organisation’s mission through their engagement. We place people at the heart of our approach to prioritise the building of meaningful relationships and also to promote diversity. After all, if we’re not working to strengthen connections and help people find purpose, what are we&nbsp;doing?</p><p>We find that people&nbsp;need:</p>  Common language — there are often too many buzzwords in business, so clear and effective communication ensures that everyone understands one another. Having a shared understanding of a problem or a solution starts with the language we use.&nbsp;Synergy!  Bias towards open — create a more inclusive and engaging environment by encouraging open communication and embracing diverse perspectives. That means not just letting your files languish in unshared folders and making sure people have an opportunity to engage with the&nbsp;work.  Established trust — improve decision-making by creating a positive working environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and supported. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">Nonviolent communication</a> strategies help here, even though the name is a bit&nbsp;weird.  <p>The anthropologist Margaret Mead is credited with&nbsp;saying:</p><blockquote>“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever&nbsp;has.”</blockquote><p>Behind every good project, initiative, and product are a group of talented people, working together. To harness the creativity and innovation of that group, we need to remember that they are humans with thoughts and feelings, as well as biases and complexities. Every group of people is different, so listening to the individuals you are working with and for is priority number&nbsp;one.</p> Streamlining Processes <p>By ‘Process,’ we mean the workflows and approaches that enable organisations to work effectively and sustainably. Efficient and well-structured processes play a crucial role in achieving an organisation’s strategic goals. It also leads to a more satisfying, productive, working environment.</p><p>We think that the following leads to better processes:</p>  Adaptability in teams — the world is always changing, so organisational processes should be flexible and adaptable enough to change with them, to respond to new opportunities and new people. Flexibility isn’t just for gymnasts.  Challenge assumptions — it’s important for us all to reassess our existing beliefs, assumptions, and practices so that we can identify areas for improvement and innovation. Just because you’re used to doing things one way doesn’t make it the best&nbsp;one.  Data driven decision making — while Gary from Marketing might have a great idea, what does the data say? Organisation should base decisions and strategies on objective data and evidence rather than relying on intuition or guesswork.  <p>A hugely important piece of developing effective processes is ensuring that they work for the people who will use them. More often than not, this includes documentation. Potentially boring? Yes. Skippable? No.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that you have to have rigid processes. In fact, adaptability is the key to all of this, and there should be an expectation that an organisation’s knowledge base is kept up-to-date by whoever used it&nbsp;last.</p> Embracing Innovative Products <p>The ‘Product’ component of our approach refers to the software platforms and tools we use and develop to support collaboration among internal and external stakeholders. You’re reading this on a screen thanks to several products. We use them all of the time, so it’s important to get the right&nbsp;ones.</p><p>The best products&nbsp;support:</p>  Iterative strategies — organisations have to evolve to keep pace with changing circumstances, so the tools you use should enable you to continuously improve processes and outcomes. If you feel like you’re having to fight your tools, then perhaps they’re no longer the best&nbsp;ones?  Distributed power / Autonomy — every tool has one or more ‘default’ ways of being used. So we should both use and make tools available that enable users to make decisions as independently as possible.  Learning by doing — the tools we use and develop should solve real-world problems rather than create new ones for users. I’m looking at you,&nbsp;Clippy.  <p>It should be fairly easy to find products that support processes that help people work well together. Sometimes, though, it involves taking multiple products and linking them together in new and interesting ways.</p><p>Although salespeople would like to tell you otherwise, there’s likely no ‘one platform to rule them all’, so we recommend making use of other techniques. You might like our <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop">Architecture of Participation</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/content-is-king-queen-and-everything-inbetween-3c2fc4b1e19c">System Ecosystem</a> tactics to help make sure your bases are&nbsp;covered.</p> Getting Started with this&nbsp;approach <p>If you want to use the ‘People, Product, Process’ approach within your organisation, consider the following steps:</p>  First, take a step back and have a good look at your organisation’s culture. Think about how you can improve things like people management, communication, and teamwork. This might involve taking your digital strategy out of the desk drawer. Or, indeed, writing&nbsp;one.  Next, check out your current processes and workflows. Find any points of friction and opportunities to make things smoother. A diagram might come in handy to visualise all the&nbsp;things.  Now it’s time to explore some tools and tech to help boost your team’s collaboration and productivity. Give them a test run and see which ones might work. Let other people try them&nbsp;out.  Following this, it’s all about crafting a plan to bring those changes and improvements to life. Make sure your team’s in the loop and excited about the process by being open and keeping them in the&nbsp;know.  Last but not least, keep an eye on how things are going with your new approach. Embrace the iterative mindset and tweak things as needed to keep things moving&nbsp;forward!   Conclusion <p>This approach provides a really simple but powerful series of lenses to unlock your digital strategy’s true potential. It’s designed to be a versatile approach, catering to organisations of all shapes and sizes.

   Surveillance of civil society is on the rise. It’s a major cause for concern for human rights defenders, social movements and civil society organisations. Governments have been using digital technologies to surveil activists, journalists, nongovernmental organisations and researchers in countries like Brazil, Morocco, Mexico, Colombia, the US and Spain, among others. This surveillance can be […]

<p>Surveillance of civil society is <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Helpline-10000-cases-report.pdf" title="">on the rise</a>. It’s a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/petition/targeted-surveillance-human-rights-defenders/" title="">major cause for concern</a> for human rights defenders, social movements and civil society organisations. Governments have been using digital technologies to <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/for-rights-defenders-cyber-is-the-new-battleground/" title="">surveil</a> activists, journalists, nongovernmental organisations and researchers in countries like <a href="https://www.uol.com.br/tilt/noticias/redacao/2021/12/07/apos-invasao-com-app-pegasus-e-ameacas-presidente-da-safernet-deixa-brasil.htm?cmpid=copiaecola" title="">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/03/morocco-western-sahara-activist-nso-pegasus/" title="">Morocco</a>, <a href="https://serendipia.digital/investigacion/el-ejercito-mexicano-espia-a-feministas/" title="">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://ifex.org/unnecessary-disproportionate-and-widespread-the-normalization-of-surveillance-in-colombia-and-latin-america/" title="">Colombia</a>, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/07/09/under-surveillance/" title="">the US</a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2020/7/31/the-illegal-surveillance-of-catalans-should-worry-all-europeans" title="">Spain</a>, among others. This surveillance can be even greater for <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/disparate-impact-surveillance/?agreed=1" title="">communities of colour</a> and <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/for-rights-defenders-cyber-is-the-new-battleground/" title="">women’s rights organisations</a>.</p>



<p>Surveillance is a critical threat to organisations and ecosystems’ digital resilience, as it can severely affect or obstruct their ability to communicate or organise themselves, and it can lead to harm to defenders and activists. In this community call, we’ll discuss how increasing communities’ <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/building-digital-resilience-is-an-ongoing-effort/" title="">abilities to protect themselves from digital security threats</a> is critical for sustainability and efforts around achieving social justice. We’ll also talk about the importance of ensuring individuals’ wellbeing, including the adoption of infrastructures that prepare for and respond to these threats.</p>



 Join our community call: Fighting surveillance, fostering digital resilience 



<p>Join us on 27 April, 4-5.30pm UTC to discuss how increasing surveillance across many countries impacts civil society organisations and what strategies can be adopted to strengthen digital resilience in these scenarios.</p>



<p></p>



<p>During the call, we will hear from Cathy Richards, from our team, who will share how to think holistically about the impact surveillance can have on an organisation’s operations from our lens of <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-strengthening-our-digital-resilience/" title="">digital resilience</a>. We’ll also be joined by Débora Calderón, regional advocacy coordinator at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.derechosdigitales.org/" title="">Derechos Digitales</a>, and Paul Aguilar, supervisor of the Digital Security program at <a href="https://socialtic.org/" title="">SocialTIC</a>, who will share their insights related to how surveillance has impacted civil society in Latin America and the Caribbean and talk about current strategies for resisting surveillance in their day to day work as well as through advocacy and organising. Our team will also share some of our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/mapping-digital-resilience-challenges-in-social-justice-organisations-learnings-from-our-partners/" title="">reflections</a> and <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/building-digital-resilience-is-an-ongoing-effort/" title="">strategies</a> from our work supporting social justice actors with their own digital resilience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anyone who is interested in taking part in this conversation is welcome! We’re interested in learning more about how you and your community are navigating increasing surveillance, including how you’ve been impacted by it, what you’re doing to protect yourself from it and what local efforts, grounded in communities, look like.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After you register, we will get in touch with you to send more information about how to join the call. This community call will be held in English, on 27th April, at 4-5.30pm UTC.&nbsp;</p>

 We’re Skeptical of UN-sponsored Guidance for Content Regulation <p>Jessica Fjeld and Sol&nbsp;Bensadon</p><p>An arm of the United Nations has taken up the challenges of content moderation, aiming for a <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/02/1133827">September 2023 release</a> of guidelines to help countries regulate online platforms while protecting free expression. A great idea, in principle, but the devil is in the details — or in this case, the devil is in the implementation of vague language about “protecting democracy” that’s as likely to be weaponized against dissidents in some contexts as it is to curtail election misinformation in&nbsp;others.</p><p><a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/brief">UNESCO</a> was created in 1945 with the mission of contributing to peace and security by promoting “international cooperation in education, sciences, culture, communication and information” and “knowledge sharing and the free flow of ideas, to accelerate mutual understanding and a more perfect knowledge of each other’s lives”. As part of this mission, UNESCO is now engaging in consultations with multiple stakeholders with the objective of developing global guidelines for the regulation of digital platforms. UNESCO has already circulated two drafts and the <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000384031.locale=en">second one</a> of these was discussed at the <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/internet-conference?hub=71542">Internet for Trust conference</a> that took place last month. UNESCO has nearly 200 member states, representing a great diversity of cultures, ideas, and governance models. They also represent the full spectrum of internet freedom — both the lowest-ranked (China) and the highest-ranked (Iceland) countries in the most recent <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-net/scores?sort=asc&amp;order=Total%20Score%20and%20Status">Freedom House Freedom on the Net report</a> are&nbsp;members.</p><p>The law and jurisprudence around free expression are characterized by basic tensions, which can never be resolved, but are managed through the three-part test of legality, proportionality, and necessity. It’s not an area where bright lines can be easily drawn. Most basically in the context of content moderation, protections for free expression require both leaving content up (to allow a range of views) and taking content down (to ensure an environment that does not drive away marginalized folks).</p><p>This comes to a very fine point when we consider that the aim of the UNESCO guidance: “to support the development and implementation of regulatory processes that guarantee freedom of expression and access to information while dealing with content that is illegal and content that risks significant harm to democracy and the enjoyment of human rights.” These categories simply are not coherent across the range of UNESCO’s member states, and it’s not clear that there is one policy framework that could achieve them and accord with International Human Rights Law (“IHRL”).</p><p>There is a large risk that the guidance document will be misused by authoritarian states to legitimize existing arbitrary restrictions on freedom of expression and to justify new ones — and we’re not the <a href="https://ijclinic.law.uci.edu/2023/02/21/unesco-guidelines-for-regulating-digital-platforms-a-rough-critique/">only</a> <a href="https://www.article19.org/resources/unesco-digital-platform-regulation-guidelines-risks-free-speech/">ones</a> to make this point. Consider a few examples, all UNESCO member countries:</p>  In 2020, Nicaragua passed the “Special Cybercrimes Law,” prescribing imprisonment for whoever disseminated “fake news” online that risked “economic stability, public health, national sovereignty or law and order.” This regulation, also known as the “gag law,” was used as a tool to silence dissenters. The gag law was first applied in January 2022, after the government had already imprisoned dozens of opposition members based on their social media activity in the context of the November 2021 general election.  In Vietnam, internet content advocating for human rights and democracy is actively censored. In other words, content that promotes “democracy and the enjoyment of human rights” is illegal. Under the 2018 Cybersecurity law, intermediaries are forced to regulate content in cooperation with the state, preventing the sharing of information that opposes the republic, threatens national security and the social order, or defies national traditions, among other broadly worded provisions” and deleting information after government requests.  Finally, how the government of the Philippines has treated Maria Ressa — a keynote speaker at the UNESCO conference — further illustrates the use of the legal system and the spread of disinformation online to silence criticism. There were at least ten criminal cases filed against Maria Ressa, three of which were under the Cybercrime law, which has been criticized as threatening free&nbsp;speech.  <p>In authoritarian states, the coherence between national law and IHRL is extremely limited: the imposition of an IHRL-based framework to produce the result of limiting domestically illegal content may well distort that framework beyond recognition. The current UNESCO guidance does not give us any insight into the application of the proposed schema in contexts where the state itself is the preeminent actor in the repression of free expression. It is not enough to simply note that the application of the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (“ICCPR”) the guidance document does not impact the ICCPR’s enforceability in these states and is highly unlikely to make changes on the ground. Moreover, even so-called “advanced democracies” have adopted or are considering restrictions on internet speech that many digital rights advocates find troubling — the UK’s Online Harms Bill is a good&nbsp;example.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s a way to avoid the worst manipulations of UNESCO’s work: require procedural guarantees, which would ensure that they can’t be used to whitewash repressive laws. The current draft already includes some such elements, such as the opposition to hostage laws2 and upload filters3 and the support for broad media literacy investments from both states and companies. However, we think additional, well-tailored measures will be&nbsp;needed.</p><p>A guarantee of anonymity is an essential protection for individuals’ free expression, especially but not only in repressive contexts. As the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/thematic-reports/ahrc2932-report-encryption-anonymity-and-human-rights-framework">United Nations suggested</a>, anonymity provides individuals “with a zone of privacy online to hold opinions and exercise freedom of expression without arbitrary and unlawful interference or attacks.” In addition, the guidelines should include robust whistleblower protections, mandating states to ensure that government and private-sector whistleblowers are protected from any form of retaliation, and to create internal safe channels for employees to report concerns and potential harmful choices. This is essential, considering the important role that whistleblowers have in revealing biased enforcement of the law and general misuse of regulation to restrict freedom of expression.</p><p>Finally, under IHRL, restrictions on freedom of expression need to be sufficiently precise to enable individuals to regulate their conduct accordingly. Were any state to adopt the broad and overbroad language of the guidelines, it would lack precision, as it is not clear, outside of certain edge cases, what constitutes “content that risks significant harm to democracy.” Especially in the context of authoritarian or non-democratic states, regulations with vague and overbroad language can be used to censor dissidents.</p><p>Careful attention must be paid to the language of the procedural protections incorporated into the guidelines. A good illustration of this point is transparency requirements: the same processes for review of corporate policy and decision-making that can allow countries with relatively free information environments to promote free expression, can be used in less free environments to tighten an authoritarian hold. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/research/lumen">Berkman Klein’s Lumen Database</a> has shed light on the global climate of online expression, censorship, and rights enforcement for 20 years. Our Lumen colleagues have thought long and hard about designing transparency for the possibility of misuse and abuse, and have been consulted on the design of the <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/transparency-initiatives-in-the-dsa-an-exciting-step-forward-in-transparency-reporting">new database contemplated by the EU Digital Services&nbsp;Act</a>.</p><p>Sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information or materials that a state might seek to persecute groups or individuals, should still be considered for inclusion in a transparency data corpus, and made available for study, with increased security, oversight, and control. In more open contexts, this can be achieved with levels of restricted access, allowing only accredited researchers, who agree to be bound by relevant strictures, to see data that has a high risk of misuse. It would take some creative thinking to establish a data governance plan that would facilitate research where the state itself is part of the threat&nbsp;model.</p><p>If UNESCO is serious about protecting — and not further threatening — free expression in platform regulation around the world, the range of stakeholders who are invested in internet freedom that were represented at February’s convening was a step in the right direction, but not a destination in itself. Between now and the guidelines’ launch, the organization should have a laser focus on the thorny challenges of defining procedural protections that will be effective even in the least protective regulatory environments.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/one-law-to-rule-them-all-705e8c776e38">One Law to Rule Them All</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Since the launch of Hyperledger Indy, a DLT purpose-built for decentralized identity, in 2017, Hyperledger Foundation has been a proud sponsor, attendee and contributor to the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/about/">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) community</a>. We continue that commitment in 2023 and welcome new and existing Hyperledger community members to join us at IIW. Not only is it a good event with great people, but it is an event/space/community where the work is getting done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“IIW is not the place where CEOs gather to spread their feathers and show off. That’s one reason it’s the most leveraged conference in the world. Actual work happens at IIW, and all of that work is toward starting and moving projects forward. It’s where fully constructive people and organizations such as Hyperledger Foundation come to roll up sleeves and get together with participants old and new, to make new connections and leave knowing more, doing more and working faster on stuff that matters.” — Kaliya Hamlin, Doc Searls and Phil Windley, IIW Organizers</p>



<p>Identity, privacy, anonymity and agency have been intrinsic concepts for the blockchain and decentralized technology ecosystem since the beginning. Even before Satoshi’s whitepaper was released, the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) was a twice-yearly “gathering of the clans” for the identity space. It has a long tradition of being where connections are made, projects are presented, code is shared, (vigorous) debate occurs, and people of varied and diverse skill sets who are passionate about these topics work to bring these solutions to life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hyperledger Foundation’s presence at IIW means that the projects that we believe are central to advancing decentralized identity — Hyperledger AnonCreds, Hyperledger Aries, and Hyperledger Indy — have the presence they need to receive the attention they deserve from the community. As Indicio relies on these Hyperledger projects we, as a longstanding attendee of IIW, are grateful for Hyperledger’s presence and support.” — Sam Curren, Senior Architect and Deputy CTO, Indicio</p>



<p>Hyperledger Foundation is a sponsor of IIW because it is a rallying point for the decentralized identity community, including those contributing to Hyperledger and other LF Identity projects as well as standards and technologies such as W3C Verifiable Credentials and DIF. We look forward to attending for a number of reasons, including:</p>



  Potential users of and prospective contributors to Hyperledger projects are at IIW, and we want to meet them.&nbsp;  Stephen Curran and Timo Glastra, new members of the Hyperledger Technical Oversight Committee, will be there talking about Hyperledger technologies and community.&nbsp;  Contributors and maintainers working on Hyperledger identity projects like Hyperledger Indy, Aries, Ursa and now Anoncreds are there to gather, share, hear feedback and work. This list includes Char Howland, Sam Curren, Berend Sliedrecht, and many others.&nbsp;  For the Linux Foundation, IIW is an open forum where other LF Digital Trust initiatives like Open Wallet Foundation, Decentralized Identity Foundation and Trust Over IP can cross-pollinate ideas, get direct feedback from the community, find consensus on direction and build relationships.&nbsp;  IIW is where members of the ecosystem gets to roll up their sleeves. One great example of this is the <a href="https://hackmd.io/@_NzO6WTHQNqQ7DdYbcc2RQ/rk3-9q713">DIDComm Connect-a-thon</a>.  The most engaged and vocal thinkers and doers in the identity space are at IIW, and it is a critical opportunity for the team to collaborate with them in person, gather their insights and work that feedback back into our community.  



<p>Hyperledger Foundation’s sponsorship of IIW takes different forms for every event, but we as a team feel supporting this community is critical to the identity ecosystem in general and Hyperledger identity projects. We are thrilled to fund the incredible work that goes into putting on each IIW, the community that emerges and the work that results.</p>



<p>Please join us April 18, 19 and 20 for IIW #36. Hyperledger community members save 20% using this <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-iiwxxxvi-36-2023a-tickets-505685758717?discount=HL_XXXVI_20">link</a>.</p>

<p>The mission of the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation is to define a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust that combines cryptographic assurance at the machine layer with human accountability at the business, legal, and social layers. Part of that mission is to define generally accepted requirements for standard roles that play a critical part in accountability in digital trust.</p>



<p>Today our Governance Stack Working Group is forming a task force to define standard requirements for issuers of verifiable credentials. While many schemes in the US, UK and Canada have focused on elements of identity credential issue and use, this will be the first effort to define what are standard requirements expected of issuers of verifiable credential to ensure that their processes are transparent, consistent and meeting the needs of relying parties and ecosystem owners.</p>



<p>While we have a core team of spirited technologists and governance architects assembled, we need more voices from the verifiable credentials community to broaden our perspectives and solidify our expected deliverables. This task force could produce artifacts that have global implications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need your voice!</p>



<p>Meetings plan to start on Wednesday April 12 at 7:00am PT/10:00am ET.</p>



<p>In order to actively participate, you need to be a member of the Trust Over IP Foundation and a member of the Governance Stack Working Group.</p>

Please read on for further&nbsp;details.</p> Decentralized Knowledge Graph&nbsp;updates <p>In 2022, the OriginTrail network underwent significant advancements with the launch of the DKG V6 — a vastly more performant and versatile next generation Internet engine that ushered in a new knowledge economy&nbsp;era.</p><p>The launch of V6 was <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/launching-the-origintrail-v6-stages-explained-3997797d44c0">divided into three stages</a>. The first stage involved the deployment of the V6 testnet, where developers could test and refine the new version before it was ready for public release. This stage was crucial in ensuring that V6 was stable and reliable before it was released to the broader&nbsp;network.</p><p>The second stage of the launch involved the release of the DKG V6 on the OriginTrail Parachain, where it was feature-locked and ready for full-scale deployment. This stage marked a significant milestone for the network, as it marked the completion of the development process and readiness of V6 for deployment. During this stage, V6 was feature-complete and ready for mass adoption by users and businesses.</p><p>Finally, the third and final stage involved the migration of the entire network to V6. This stage was carefully planned and executed to ensure a smooth transition from the old version to the new version. The migration process was designed to minimize any disruptions to the network’s operations and ensure that users could continue to access the network without any&nbsp;issues.</p><p>In July 2022, the OriginTrail team announced the completion of the second stage of the V6 launch. The new version had several key features, including an improved consensus mechanism that helped increase the network’s security and scalability. Additionally, the new smart contract layer allowed for more complex data processing and analysis, while the implementation of a decentralized identifier (DID) system enabled secure and verifiable data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>The launch of the DKG V6 led to significant growth and adoption of the OriginTrail network. The enhanced security and scalability features of V6 made it more attractive to individuals and businesses. The addition of the smart contract layer and DID system opened up new possibilities for data processing and analysis, allowing businesses to derive insights and value from their&nbsp;data.</p><p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1603766981416689664">successful launch event marked the release of the DKG V6</a> at the end of the year. At the event the team touched upon the global economy and trust challenges, and looked at how trusted knowledge will be grown within the OriginTrail ecosystem. At the event the team launched the newest version by creating the first asset on it and demonstrated the application of real world Knowledge Assets using the brand new Network Operating System (nOS) by igniting the creation of the first 40K Knowledge Assets on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Overall, the launch of the OriginTrail V6 was a significant milestone for the network. As the network continues to grow and evolve, it is expected that the V6 will play a crucial role in its ongoing success and development.</p> Polkadot integration updates <p>In 2022, the DKG-tailored blockchain, OriginTrail Parachian was launched. For this to happen, the team first released a new, <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1512523128387350534">comprehensive whitepaper</a> covering advancements to the OriginTrail ecosystem, specifically, those introduced by the OriginTrail Parachain. With the OriginTrail Parachain as a layer 1 network coming to life, the team also introduced a native OriginTrail Parachain token (OTP) — a utility asset that is not only used for blockchain gas fees and inclusive governance, but also enables a way to incentivise the growth of DKG&nbsp;usage.</p><p>To aid with contributions for the OriginTrail Parachain crowdloan, support was opened on platforms including Parallel, Bifrost, and Kraken. To support the success of the OriginTrail Parachain and the growth of the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph, it was announced that OTP (OriginTrail Parachain tokens) would be <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain/status/1526244450661326849">distributed to community members</a>. The distribution to both <a href="https://twitter.com/OriginTrailDev/status/1556679202409271296">v5 node runners</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain/status/1584910942470537216">TRAC token holders</a> was successfully completed.</p><p>The OriginTrail Parachain was officially confirmed as the winner of Polkadot’s 17th parachain auction on May 18th, 2022 and in early June OriginTrail successfully launched with its first genesis block being validated. This marked the beginning of a new era where AI-grade Knowledge Assets can be brought to Polkadot, and other Polkadot parachains can integrate the OriginTrail DKG with their blockchain networks.</p><p>A few months after the launch, Security Research Labs started executing their automated static and dynamic testing suite for the OriginTrail Parachain in an attempt to identify vulnerabilities with the implementation and we were happy to report that they completed the security review of the OriginTrail Parachain with no issues discovered. The number of blocks on the OriginTrail Parachain started growing fast and the year concluded with 1.4M blocks being validated.</p><p>In order to transfer TRAC tokens from the Ethereum blockchain to the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot, a “one-way Teleport” system was implemented, which was described in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-12-v2-teleporting-trac-to-the-origintrail-parachain-on-polkadot-de535a9d2693">RFC-12</a> with 15 teleport batches set in place. At the end of 2022 10th teleport batch was completed.</p><p>After the RFC-12, also the <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-13-trac-token-deployment-on-polkadot-c709347583cc">RFC-13</a> was published discussing the proposed implementation of the TRAC token on the OriginTrail Parachain, a move that could provide significant benefits to the OriginTrail ecosystem. This implementation would result in a number of important improvements, including enhanced security, reduced transaction fees, and improved scalability. In addition, the implementation would enable OriginTrail to take advantage of Polkadot’s cross-chain interoperability, allowing for seamless interaction with other blockchain networks.</p> Key ODN adoption&nbsp;metrics <p>Exciting developments took place in the OriginTrail Ecosystem during 2022, leading up to the highly anticipated release of the OriginTrail V6 at the end of the year, first implemented on the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot. OriginTrail V6 is a major upgrade to the way the DKG functions, introducing new primitives such as Knowledge Assets and UALs, and runs as a separate network alongside OriginTrail V5.</p><p>This requires a rethinking of how network activity and adoption are measured. Starting with 2023, some of the existing metrics will be retired and replaced with more relevant ones focusing on the OriginTrail V6, for example the number of Knowledge Assets on the OriginTrail DKG. As a result, the current metrics show a slowdown in activity on the OriginTrail V5 in the second half of 2022, as network activity transitions to the more powerful OriginTrail V6.</p> Total graph size&nbsp;(TGS) <p>Total Graph Size (TGS) is a fundamental metric developed to assess the expansion of the OriginTrail Decentralized Network. It quantifies the volume of knowledge accommodated by the Decentralized Knowledge Graph by integrating two crucial elements of a knowledge graph: data objects and their interconnections. In more precise terms, it combines the aggregate number of graph vertices (alternatively termed as graph cardinality or the order of the graph) and the complete number of graph edges (known in graph theory as graph size) of a decentralized graph. The term vertices encompass all the distinct objects appended to the graph (e.g., identifiers or specific details of supply chain events, products, attestations, locations, and certificates), while edges signify the connections among these&nbsp;objects.</p><p>In 2022 we observed a steep growth in TGS, with an increase from 116 million to over 248 million TGS mark. TGS is one of the metrics that remains relevant as we fully transition to OriginTrail V6, and we expect to see accelerated growth due to the enhancement in network efficiencies and expanded usability of the technology in a variety of industries.</p> Other metrics — New publishings on the&nbsp;DKG <p>The number of publishings on the V5 network experienced a decline during the latter part of 2022 as network activity transitions to the new and vastly more powerful OriginTrail V6. This metric will be retired starting 2023 and replaced by a more relevant one to measure activity on the OriginTrail V6.</p> Other metrics — TRAC&nbsp;Staked <p>Due to the OriginTrail V6 release and related winding down in activity on the V5 network, there was a decrease in total TRAC staked in 2022, starting the year at 11.42 million and ending at 4.04 million. However, with 100 million TRAC teleported to the OriginTrail Parachain and ready to power the V6 network with millions of Knowledge Assets, as well as the upcoming V6 staking capabilities, we expect this metric to increase significantly going&nbsp;forward.</p> Marketing &amp; communications  DKG version&nbsp;6 <p>The year began with the launch of stage 1 of the version 6 Decentralized Knowledge Graph Beta. Notably, V6 represents the biggest advancement to the network since its inception. This includes performative improvements as well as new, Web3-focussed, functionality which will enable the DKG to act as the central building block for all future Web3 activities.</p> OriginTrail on Twitter: "🔔ICYMI🔔 Stage 1 of v6 Beta has now officially been live for one week &amp; we couldn't be happier with how it's progressing.

The authors touched upon the launch of the OriginTrail Parachain and why this milestone is important for the expansion of the OriginTrail ecosystem, as well as enhanced network effects with the launch of OriginTrail V6. The network effects are formulated in Metcalfe’s Law, whose formulator is Trace Labs’ advisor Dr. Bob Metcalfe.</p><p>The OriginTrail team invited Dr. Bob Metcalfe to join us for the keynote speech at the Knowledge Graph Conference 2022 (KGC), the result of which were 2 articles published.

<p>The two companies will integrate their respective technologies and services to develop new products on the Rebuschain platform and the decentralized exchange Verto Trade launching in April 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schio, Italy: Today Rebuschain and Commercio.network announce a blockchain partnership. The two Blockchains based on the same Cøsmos technology, IBC and Bridge Ethereum, operate in the decentralized financial technology (DeFi) sector, and will collaborate to integrate their respective technologies and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rebuschain, uses a Native Token utility, $REBUS, to allow a channel of asset managers and other financial institutions to manage and sell DeFi instruments alongside their traditional instruments (TradFi), will make use of the technology and services of Commercio.network. In particular, Rebuschain will become a validator node of Commercio.network and will use the technology of Commercio.network to implement KYC, and notarization needed in the TradFi sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commercio.network, an eIDAS Compliant Blockchain that uses a Native Token utility, $COM to allow members of its network to sign and exchange documents with legal value, will take advantage of the Rebuschain technology. In particular, Commercio.network will become a Rebuschain validator and will use DeFi products Vertotrade.com, NFTID, and Rebus Vault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership envisages that both parties make themselves available to exchange information relating to their technologies available in their portfolio, in order to better understand their technical-commercial interaction and achieve common objectives. The partnership will aim to develop new DeFi and TradFi products and solutions on the Rebuschain platform and on the decentralized exchange Vertotrade.com, using the Commercio.network blockchain as a support infrastructure for the exchange of legally binding documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership represents an important step forward for both blockchains, which will be able to benefit from their respective technological skills and knowledge, opening up new business opportunities and consolidating their position on the market of Cøsmos, IBC and Bridge Ethereum technology and decentralized technologies.</p>

 eIDAS Architecture Reference Framework 1.0 
 Thoughts on ARF from DIDAS Technology Working 
<p>Earlier this year, the eIDAS Expert Group published the first version of the Architecture Reference Framework (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/93678">ARF</a>), which lays the foundation for the future European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet Infrastructure. For us at DIDAS, it represents a very exciting moment, as we are facing the final phase of the Swiss E-ID Law development and already work on pilots to explore and showcase what is possible.</p>
<p>We strive for the broadest interoperability between all European Digital Identity (and hopefully worldwide) initiatives. Beyond pure technical interoperability (e.g., at the protocol level), it’s crucially important to highlight potential differences in approaches to ensure that the ideas and principles that went into our input to the Swiss E-ID Law are also reflected in the eIDAS work.</p>
<p>After all, our raison d’être – and our responsibility – is to advocate for the advancement of digital processes in society while respecting the privacy and digital sovereignty of Swiss citizens.</p>
<p>First, we’d like to point the interested reader to the excellent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eu-wallet-depth-1-trusted-lists-andrew-tobin/">series</a> published by Andrew Tobin , where he goes in-depth into the ARF and highlights, in an easy-to-understand language, a few aspects that require special attention, e.g., the potential complexity of managing the ecosystem and ensuring trust at national levels, correlation of credentials’ usage, etc.</p>
<p>We also would like to thank the authors of the document for the demanding work that went into its creation. We believe that many good choices have been made. The proposed approach does pave the way to an exciting future where everyone can take full advantage of the continuously evolving digital services in a privacy-preserving manner and be in control of their data!</p>
<p>We realize that this is version 1.0 of a framework, and a lot of work went into making it acceptable for a variety of players.</p>
<p>In this Blog post, we’d like to share our view on some of the critical aspects of the ARF, considering both the technical and user-experience implications of the proposed Reference Framework.</p>
 The Trusts Lists – minimizing complexity. 
<p>Let us start by looking at a foundational topic: how will wallets and their users know if they are dealing with a trusted issuer or a verifier? This is where the so-called “Trust Lists” come into play. They are meant to be directories where wallets can look up a counterparty’s identifier and determine their status. The ARF proposes many lists, mainly to allow flexibility and accommodate the unique requirements of the member states.</p>
<p>This, however, will potentially lead to hundreds of them and will, arguably, make the overall system less secure and confusing. From our standpoint, a better approach would be to use credentials: each issuer and verifier must present a credential (e.g. EBSI <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSIDOC/Data+Models+and+Schemas">proposal</a>) , which will certify to the user’s wallet that they are authorized to issue or request a particular set of credentials with a known schema. This way, the system becomes much more manageable and resilient and is built of the same building blocks throughout. While, at the same time, allowing for regional variations.</p>
<p>An essential enabling factor for this is going to be a robust governance framework, which should regulate and enforce the rules for these credentials, including the attributes of the schemas.</p>
<p>The user wallet then will have a much easier job of “advising” its users of whether a specific data exchange is a good idea, promoting trust and improving overall usability and acceptance.</p>
 
Lose your phone, lose your wallet? 
<p>Another foundational aspect currently not well highlighted in the document is the topic of what happens in case of a lost wallet or a need to upgrade to a new phone. Both are related to the issue of cryptographic key lifecycle management. From our standpoint, this is both a technical and a user acceptance topic.</p>
<p>Without clear guidance on what happens when a user wants to either upgrade their phone or deactivate the wallet on a lost phone, it’s hard to imagine that a wide adoption will occur. A well-thought-through user experience is necessary here.</p>
<p>The ability to move data between devices is not only a user-experience topic. It is also a question of Data Self-Sovereignty, which is one of the fundaments <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SSI-principles-english.pdf">principles</a> of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and a real need, or even a right of today’s and future citizens.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, this can be enabled via known techniques where keys can be migrated between secure elements (e.g., cloning/backup procedure for HSMs). Or more modern, scalable approaches, e.g., W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> or <a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a> (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure), where key rotation is built-in, and a stable identifier is independent of the underlying key material.</p>
 Are PIDs complete? 
<p>Personal Identification Data (PID) is clearly a big focus of the current version of the framework. When we consider which attributes fall under the definition of PID, we see that name and date of birth are mandatory. The current address is, however, optional, and a photo is missing. The latter should be added to make a PID-carrying wallet an equivalent of a conventional ID card (user experience again).</p>
<p>When we return to the optionality of an address, we notice that it creates uncertainty. If a given use case requires an address (such as onboarding at a bank), then the verifier’s system cannot rely on PID to provide that information since it is optional. This means that a separate proof request (and a corresponding credential) will have to be made, complicating the system’s overall design.</p>
<p>A better way from our viewpoint would be to plan for a more fine-grained approach from the very beginning and allow additional, “high-resolution” PID credentials such as “Proof of Residence” (“Wohnsitzbestätigung”) to be provided at the ecosystem level from the start.</p>
<p>The beauty of an SSI ecosystem, after all, is that multiple credentials and their attributes can be combined for a particular use case. A highly desirable outcome!</p>
<p>With that in mind, we recommend that a mechanism be put in place to allow the ecosystem players to onboard new types of “PID” credentials and thus continuously expand the EUDI’s capabilities. A good example of this is an “Official Organizational Role” (OOR) credential that has been pioneered by <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">GLEIF</a> (Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation).</p>
 Privacy by Design? 
<p>This is perhaps one of the most significant areas of concern for us. The non-negotiable, essential requirement for an electronic identity/verifiable credentials solution is to ensure that the users can’t be tracked as they conduct their daily life.</p>
<p>For that to be true, two key assumptions must be guaranteed:<br>
• First, validity verification must occur without any data being leaked about the presenter or the circumstances of a credential’s usage.<br>
• Second, there should be no data in the credential itself or in the verification protocol, which allows to correlate the user across touch points.</p>
<p>ARF mentions the first aspect in the section on qualified verifiable credentials (aka QEAA). Still, it is missing from the sections that define PID Providers and non-qualified credentials’ issuers (EAA). We interpret that omission as a signal that both latter categories are not subject to this requirement. This is, in our opinion, an unacceptable proposition.</p>
<p>The second aspect is also not well represented in the document. The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">SD-JWT</a> and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">mDL</a>, the first couple of technologies proposed to carry verifiable credentials, can’t guarantee that the users won’t be correlated across their activities.</p>
<p>One of the good things about the framework is that it settles on OpenID Connect for <a href="https://openid.net/openid4vc/">Verifiable Presentations</a> as its primary enabling technology. A key feature of that specification is that it is agnostic to the format of a verifiable credential. So, more privacy-friendly credential technologies can be used.</p>
<p>As we think about alternative credential formats, we also need to consider the thorny question of revocations. It is unclear how revocations, beyond just a simple expiration mechanism, will be made functional under the framework. However, it is, without a doubt, a must-have feature for many use cases.</p>
<p>Scalable, privacy-preserving revocation mechanisms are notoriously difficult to implement. The momentum created by this much-needed EU-wide initiative gives us a chance, however, to accelerate and advance the research that has been taking place in the last few years. The rush to market and “pragmatic” conventional choices that can be made to enable it should be reconsidered. Our societies deserve a truly person-centric, privacy-preserving solution, which will finally help us to get rid of paper credentials and thus lay a solid foundation for truly seamless digitalization.</p>
<p>That is what SSI is all about, and that’s what we at DIDAS passionately strive to enable!</p>

<p>Policymakers, technologists, and privacy advocates are invited to offer their feedback on the new white paper, <a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/04/DRAFT-Government-issued-Digital-Credentials-and-the-Privacy-Landscape-publiccomment.pdf">“Government-issued Digital Credentials and the Privacy Landscape.”</a> This paper, published in part by the OpenID Foundation, Kantara Initiative, and the Secure Identity Alliance, and including contributions from several individuals, seeks to engage and inspire thought leaders from government, civil society, and standards and technology. You are encouraged to come together to discuss how to close the policy and protocol gaps between today’s disparate solutions and services and the vision of a privacy-preserving, globally viable privacy landscape.</p>
<p>The paper is a result of six months of due diligence that started with public listening sessions at Authenticate, the November 2022 OIDF workshop, and IIW IIWXXXV, and many interviews with active people in this space.</p>
<p>We start by examining a few of the influential regulations and standards in the privacy and digital credential space and a few areas in the works where government-issued digital credentials play a significant role in society. It continues by reviewing the core technologies that are in use by these credential systems.</p>
<p>The Gaps and Risks section highlights those uncomfortable limitations of the regulations and current technologies. Privacy-enhancing services require laws and technology to support each other, and understanding where each has limits may suggest areas requiring further work.</p>
<p>The remainder of the paper does just that by offering recommendations on where governments, civil society, and technologists may focus their efforts to bridge the gaps and grapple with the uncomfortable intersections of competing requirements. For example, considering new ways to enable consent, supporting systemic transparency for the individual, and encouraging greater support for advanced cryptographic algorithms.</p>
<p>Your feedback will help ensure this paper serves as a strong platform to inform further dialog with governments, civil society, and technologists.</p>
<p>The comment period will be open until 24 April 2023. You may submit your feedback to <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a>. Please reference specific line numbers for your proposed changes where appropriate.</p>
<p>We will share more on the final outcomes and recommendations at the <a href="https://openid.net/2023/03/17/registration-workshop-at-microsoft/">OpenID Foundation Workshop</a> (17 April 2023), <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5330/1">EIC</a> (11 May 2023) and <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv23/agenda/">Identiverse</a> (31 May 2023).<br>

<p>By: FIDO Staff</p>



<p>Passwords are everywhere with both enterprises and e-commerce organizations feeling the pain as much, if not more, than most.</p>


 
 


<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit: Authentication in Financial Services and Commerce on March 29, industry experts and practitioners outlined The FIDO Fit for Enterprise and Customer Sign-ins. Throughout the half-day event, the topic of passkeys was a primary theme, with speakers outlining how they work, where they fit in and why they are essential to helping the world move away from legacy passwords and less secure multi-factor authentication.</p>



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance opened the event with some insights on the many positive benefits that passkeys can bring to enterprise and commerce users. Those benefits include helping users to get online faster with higher levels of satisfaction. Passkeys may also be able to help improve the bottom line for e-commerce vendors as well.</p>



<p>“If you’re an e-commerce vendor, imagine reducing the shopping cart abandonment rate by even 10%,” Shikiar said. “Our data shows that 50% of consumers that had to abandon a purchase in the past six months did so because they forgot your password and that’s a huge opportunity cost.”</p>



<p>While FIDO authentication has been available for anyone to use for over a decade, Shikiar noted that there have been some adoption challenges. Passkeys are, in part, a solution to some of those adoption challenges. With passkeys, there is a more recognizable set of common terminology and the technology also provides a familiar flow for users that aims to reduce friction.</p>



<p>In the enterprise, Shikiar said that passkeys are a very natural fit for things like BYOD [Bring Your Own Device] authentication, allowing employees to sign in with apps on their phones.</p>



<p>“This is becoming more the norm than the exception, and passkeys are just a very natural fit for that environment,” Shikiar said.</p>



<p>The State of Authentication 2023&nbsp;</p>


 
 


<p>Make no mistake about it, there are a lot of problems with passwords. To add some metrics to the argument against passwords, Jay Roxe, CMO at HYPR provided some insights from his firm’s <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-security-report">State of Passwordless Security 2023 report</a>.</p>



<p>Roxe noted that one of the things that really jumped out to him was that three out of five of the organizations that HYPR talked to for the report, had an authentication related breach over the past year. He added that each of those organizations had nearly $3 million dollars in costs associated with those breaches on a 12 month basis. Financial Services was the most highly attacked industry vertical with 81% of financial services organizations having recorded some type of attack or breach related to authentication.</p>



<p>The HYPR report also attempted to discover why organizations will move to deploy strong authentication passwordless approaches. Roxe emphasized that it’s critical to have a good user interface and flow, otherwise the technology won’t get adopted. In fact the report found the top reason why organizations are looking to adopt passwordless is to improve the user experience.</p>



<p>“Until we nail that user experience, we’re fundamentally not going to be any better off than we are today,” Roxe said.</p>



<p>Passkeys 101</p>



<p>Among the most interactive sessions of the event was one on the basics of how passkeys work, which kept moderator Megan Shamas, senior director of marketing at the FIDO Alliance very busy handling questions from the engaged audience at the end of the session.</p>


 
 


<p>The session actually got started with Tim Cappalli, identity standards architect at Microsoft outlining the historical path of FIDO standards. The big milestones along the path include the debut of the U2F specifications in 2014, FIDO2 in 2017, WebAuthn in 2019 and just last year the emergence of passkeys.</p>



<p>“It has been a journey,” Cappalli said. “We think that in the last two to three years, we really have been moving towards the last step to moving people beyond passwords.”</p>



<p>Cappalli outlined how passkeys works and what the primary advantages are for the approach. He explained that a passkey is fundamentally a FIDO credential with some new properties. Among the properties highlighted by Cappalli are:</p>



 
 Autofill. With Autofill, much like the experience users have today with a password manager, a passkey can be automatically injected into an authentication flow into existing websites. 



 Cross Device Authentication. Instead of a credential being tethered strictly to a single device, passkeys enable a credential to be durable across environments, enabling a phone for example to be able to bootstrap another device or ecosystem. 
 



<p>Championing FIDO adoption at scale</p>


 
 


<p>Few professionals have had as much experience deploying FIDO at scale as Marcio Mello, who has led efforts at PayPal, Intuit and eBay.</p>



<p>Mello outlined in great detail the steps that organizations can and should take to support FIDO strong authentication. In his view, the benefits are obvious.</p>



<p>“As soon as we could, we started doing WebAuthn deployment at eBay and saw the benefits almost immediately,” Mello said.</p>



<p>For Mello, passkeys are the next massive step forward as it’s an approach that will reduce consumer friction and hopefully enable adoption at scale. It is fundamentally the ease of use that passkeys promise that is literally the key.</p>



<p>“Consumers expect to see and use a password,” he said. “Yes, everybody’s tired of them, but it’s like smoking, most smokers would like to stop but they can’t, sure they know it’s bad, but you need to have the motivation and a very low bar of ability to be able to drive a habit change.”</p>



<p>FIDO and Zero Trust</p>


 
 


<p>In the security world, zero trust is an increasingly common concept that advocates an approach where users and entities need to be constantly validated to limit risks.</p>



<p>For Kurt Johnson, chief strategy officer at Beyond Identity, there is a clear intersection between FIDO authentication and zero trust. After all, a core foundation of zero trust is the need to constantly authenticate users and if organization’s aren’t using strong authentication, that’s a weak link.</p>



<p>Johnson said that with zero trust there is a need to assess and establish a high level of trust in the user identity. That just can’t be done effectively through passwords and that’s where there is a need for FIDO Certified authentication, that’s unphishable.</p>



<p>Helping Amazon’s drive to be customer-obsessed</p>


 
 


<p>Amazon operates one of the world’s largest e-commerce sites and it’s also a strong advocate and supporter of the FIDO Alliance.</p>



<p>Yash Patodia, principal product manager, tech, world wide consumer at Amazon said that his team is always looking to improve usability. One of the efforts to improve has been a move to remove passwords wherever possible. Patodia said that Amazon uses FIDO security keys for its own internal security which has worked well.</p>



<p>While security keys have worked for Amazon’s own internal needs, he noted that they can be difficult for consumers to adopt. That’s one of the many reasons why he’s particularly excited about passkeys.</p>



<p>“I think it’s a great leap forward from the password, OTP (one time passwords) and the security keys world,” Patodia said. “Some of the benefits I can see for passkey is that it really makes it very easy for the customer to use.”</p>



<p>Making it easier for consumers is critical for Amazon overall as it’s core to the company’s mission.</p>



<p>“We have this term at Amazon we use a lot called customer obsession,” Patodia said. “And this fits perfectly for us in that this is actually a customer obsessed product where we are making it very easy for the customer to do what they want to do.”</p>



<p>PNC BANK looks to protect its users with FIDO</p>


 
 


<p>Susan Koski, CISO of PNC Bank, knows all too well the challenges of password, that’s why she’s such a strong advocate and supporter of FIDO.</p>



<p>She noted that criminals are going after user passwords in a bid to take over accounts. Among the risks that she is trying to help limit is that of phishable credentials, such as passwords.</p>



<p>“We really do want to reduce those phishable&nbsp; credentials but we do it in a way that a customer wants to use the service,” Koski said. “Balancing security and the customer experience. I think that’s just been a mantra for us in information security in cyberspace for a while.”</p>



<p>Koski said that PNC Bank has embraced FIDO as a way to help move towards passwordless over time. The importance of taking a standardized approach that benefits from the support and participation of a broad array of participants is critical as well.</p>



<p>“Passwords have been around for 50 plus years and it’s time, it’s beyond time for us to move past passwords,” Koski said.</p>



<p>Enterprise guidance for passkeys is on the way</p>



<p>Looking forward, Megan Shamas of FIDO Alliance outlined a series of efforts that are underway to help provide more enterprise guidance for passkeys.</p>



<p>“We will be publishing a group of five papers that address what we hope to be the majority of the use cases that are out there on the enterprise,” Shamas said.</p>



<p>The five papers include:</p>



 
 Introduction to passkeys in the enterprise 



 How to replace password-only authentication with passkeys 



 How to displace password + SMS OTP authentication with passkeys 



 FIDO authentication for moderate assurance use 



 High Assurance Enterprise FIDO Authentication 
 



<p>“If you would like to be part of the conversation around enterprise requirements, please do get in touch with us,” Shamas said. “This is the time now really to give your input on how we’re looking at passkeys from an enterprise perspective.”</p>

<p>Opinion piece by the Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ) Executive Council Policy &amp; Regulation Sub-Committee</p>



<p>Summary<br><br>Current regulation requires some businesses to use and hold on to personal information when you use their services. These large datasets of sensitive personal information are highly attractive for cyber criminals and contribute to ongoing cybercrimes and identity theft that can have a devastating impact on those affected. Optus &nbsp;and Latitude Financial are recent examples but they are not alone and not likely to be the last. Even businesses like these with good reputations can put the personal information you give them at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>New technology exists that allows you to sign-up for a new service without needing to hand over physical documents or share more than what’s needed. Along with other countries, New Zealand is behind in adopting this new game changing technology but changes are afoot. Until then you need to be aware of who you are sharing data with, how it will be used and how that party will protect it.</p>



<p>Digital Identity NZ (DINZ) is Aotearoa’s only industry association specifically focussed on digital identity and is leading the way to a future where every New Zealander can easily use their digital identity to access services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Current regulation requires some businesses to use and hold on to personal information when you use their services&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you think about the recent high-profile data breaches of personal information due to hackers finding ways to break into computer networks, you might wonder if the awful consequences for people affected could have been significantly reduced or prevented if firms had not stored electronic copies of documents.</p>



<p>The thing is, many businesses like big appliance retailers selling you credit so you can buy the TV of your dreams, or mobile network companies selling you a phone or SIM card, must interpret and follow rules overseen by a regulator in order to do business. This typically leads retailers to electronically copy and store personal information.</p>



<p>While it was the cybersecurity exposures that caused the breaches of personal information in the recent instances, and not the requirements to collect personal information set down by any particular Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime, it did magnify the impact of a breach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-63056838">Optus</a>, the Australian telco giant, obtained identity information not only to satisfy AML/CFT obligations but to satisfy law enforcement agencies’ needs regarding criminals’ use of mobile phones, while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/27/latitude-financial-cyber-data-breach-hack-14m-customer-records-stolen">Latitude Financial</a> obtained identity information to undertake credit checks as well as to fulfil AML/CFT obligations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These regulatory regimes should not be inadvertently putting the mass population’s sensitive personal identity documentation in jeopardy, just because legislation does not reflect current technical capability to make electronic copying of physical documents redundant, be that the traditional centralised approach or the emerging modern decentralised approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Large datasets of sensitive personal information are highly attractive for cyber-attackers&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stuff wrote an <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/131623747/complaints-made-to-privacy-commission-as-latitude-admits-1037-million-new-zealand-drivers-licence-details-stolen">easily readable piece </a>on the most recent high profile breach, Latitude, while focussing on the impact for New Zealanders caught up in it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you buy something, even gift vouchers, at a store on credit, many shoppers will have experienced having had a sense of unease of having no choice or leverage to decline when the retailer asked for identification documents and proceeded to electronically scan or copy them. Sometimes even when credit wasn’t required, but the retailer urged you to open a credit account. And once the interaction has ended and the AML/CFT provisions fulfilled, the unease remains – did they delete my personal information?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reasons why they are doing this might range from needing to comply with regulation to instore incentives for retailers to gather personal information, for the marketing department for example, when typically the company’s cybersecurity teams don’t want the data held due to the potential risks it creates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Who wins that ‘tug of war’ usually comes down to an organisation’s culture, information security and risk posture and where in the organisation these decisions are made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>New technology exists that allows you to sign-up for a new service without needing to hand over physical documents or share more than what is needed<br><br>In the review of New Zealand’s AML/CFT regulation currently underway, we call for urgent prioritisation of the <a href="https://www.dia.govt.nz/pubforms.nsf/URL/AMLCFT_Amendment-to-IDVCOP-2013-FINAL-October-2013.pdf/$file/AMLCFT_Amendment-to-IDVCOP-2013-FINAL-October-2013.pdf">Amended Identity Verification Code of Practice 2013</a> (AIVCOP), which has outdated requirements relating to face-to-face verification and the use of copies of documents certified by the trusted referees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As inferred in our<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2021/11/Digital-Identity-New-Zealand-AML_CFT-Report_20-October-2020_FINAL.pdf"> report published in 2020</a>, we support a complete overhaul of AIVCOP so that it better supports not only the Privacy Act 2020, but also the use of robust and reliable digital identification services to achieve AML/CFT compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also must be complementary to and aligned with the upcoming opt-in Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) Act that accredits rules-compliant digital identity service providers should they opt-in to do so. <a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0078/latest/LMS459583.html">The Bill</a> had its third and final reading this week and is set for implementation in July 2024.</p>



<p>Capability has existed for over a decade to electronically verify claims about personal information from its applicable centralised authoritative source compliant with the Privacy Act 2020 and its 1993 predecessor. The problem is to do with scale and interoperability. Scaling New Zealand retail point of sale counters to send identification-related claims to the government agency authoritative registers to have them confirmed, or not as the case may be, and the scale needed by the authoritative source to process so many claims. The high level of interoperability needed to have multiple systems performing like payment networks is a significant and ongoing investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decentralised digital identity,the subject of <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/03-april-perspectives-on-decentralised-identity-summer-series-2023-webinar/">DINZ’s summer series of perspectives just completed today</a>, is a topic that offers the strongest hope for a brighter future. Because implicit in this privacy centric approach, is the notion that the individual holds their data inside a secure container such as a digital wallet on a digital device like a smartphone. This way the plethora of computer networks storing people’s personal information as is current practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Significant investment and the collective will to do so notwithstanding, a robust decentralised digital identification approach could allow individuals to access financial services at point of sale without the need for them to hand over physical documents for electronic copying. It could also accelerate financial inclusion if, as a nation, we can overcome obvious barriers such as ground level digital literacy and access to a smartphone/device of some kind which is a prerequisite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final.pdf">recent report published by Digital Identity New Zealand highlighted</a> that “Digital identity underpins the majority of our digital transactions and is the foundation for digital transformation”. The report’s recommendations called out the yearning need to increase awareness and education in many sectors of our society so that everyone in Aotearoa can enjoy the benefits of the digital economy if they choose to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most countries, New Zealand included, are behind the game. To minimise the risks we see from data breaches, right now we need trusted and universally accepted identification methods envisaged by the DISTF Act, that are compliant with privacy and AML/CFT regulations. These also need to allow people to identify, verify and authenticate themselves and to decide if they will share data or proofs and with whom without the need to hand over physical documents containing personal information for electronic copying by retailers with all the associated risks of it being stolen and used for criminal gain.</p>



<p>The AML/CFT Act is under review and parts of the legislation selected for amendment first are currently out for comment. But those parts are not the AIVCOP. Prioritising the AIVCOP can help not only bring compliance with the Privacy Act 2020 closer, but also reduce the unintended consequences of the current AIVCOP provisions that create personal information honeypots for hackers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the face of it, privacy legislation is trumped by AML/CFT legislation when they should be complementary.&nbsp; Regulatory regimes must support the use of technological advancements in digital identification where there is a demonstrable benefit to New Zealanders. Firms are not going to make the leap to digital identity services if they consider it will put them in breach of their regulatory requirements. But in hesitating, many New Zealanders’ personal information is at risk.</p>

<p>By Andy Parsons, Senior Director, Content Authenticity Initiative&nbsp;</p><p>This past month, the Content Authenticity Initiative achieved three major milestones representing the fast pace of progress toward our critical goal of making content more transparent and trustworthy, everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>First, we are thrilled to announce that the CAI has crossed the 1,000-member mark! After launching the CAI just over 3 years ago, we are incredibly proud to have grown a global coalition of leading tech and media companies, camera manufacturers, news publishers, creative professionals, researchers, NGOs and many more – all contributing their expertise, code, and energy to advance this mission. &nbsp;</p><p>This comes at a critical time as content becomes easier to manipulate and determining what’s authentic is challenging, to say the least. Specifically, generative AI has broken through as a creative technology for content inspiration and creation that is transforming the world. While AI has unprecedented potential to amplify human creativity, it also shines a light on the urgent need to restore trust online. 3 years ago, the CAI team and partners anticipated a future of powerful AI tools and eroding trust. And through hard work and deep collaboration, we are proud to see the day-by-day heightened call for authenticity at this key turning point in human history. Above all, we’re resolute in finding ways to deploy the techniques, tools, and standards that we have built together, so that everyone can benefit from them.&nbsp;</p><p>Leveraging Content Credentials in Firefly Beta&nbsp;</p><p>At Adobe Summit last month, Adobe’s new generative AI model, <a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2023/Adobe-Unveils-Firefly-a-Family-of-new-Creative-Generative-AI/default.aspx">Firefly</a>, was announced, and along with it our commitment to leveraging CAI’s Content Credentials to bring transparency to generative AI outputs. Every asset produced with Firefly has embedded a Content Credential indicating the model used and its version. This is significant—it not only builds on our mission to ensure tools like Firefly are used responsibly, but also gives viewers of this content important context to understand what they’re seeing or hearing, enabling them to make trust decisions when necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, to ensure creators have more control over their work, they can use CAI provenance technology and attach “Do Not Train” credentials that travel with their content wherever it goes. With industry adoption, this will prevent AI developers from training on content with “Do Not Train” credentials. With this universal standard now published in the latest C2PA technical specification, we believe this will be adopted quickly across industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Creative storyteller <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/hallease">Hallease Narvaez</a> showcased our Content Credentials features in the Firefly Beta at Summit, exhibiting an incredible display of how the CAI technology works with generative AI content – be sure to check out her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBaPWYhHRg">video here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>C2PA Releases Key Updates to the Technical Specification&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As the CAI and the non-profit standards development organization, the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), continue to engage in deeply complimentary threads of work—the C2PA honing the blueprint for the future of digital provenance while the CAI builds a massive community to put the standard to work—we are also excited about the just-released <a href="https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.3/specs/C2PA_Specification.html">version 1.3</a> of its technical specification that includes expanded support for an array of media types, as well as generative AI transparency capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>This is perhaps the largest update to the spec since its initial publication in 2021. Among the highlights are:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Support for additional file types, including WAV for pro audio and WebP for image delivery.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Extended metadata for media creation and modifications so AI-generated ingredients can be clearly captured and displayed.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Regions of interest” for explaining which parts of media were impacted by various actions, when appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Universal support for generative AI transparency and creators’ “do not train” intent.&nbsp;</p>  <p>I am so inspired and humbled by the recent accomplishments of the CAI ecosystem. I’m also reminded how much more work we all have ahead of us, to ensure digital provenance is available to journalists, creators, and consumers wherever and whenever they need tools for authentic storytelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As always, if interested in our work, you can join our expansive and ever-growing community <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/membership">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 La Suisse en route vers une nouvelle identité électronique — Lancement d’une sandbox publique pour tester l’écosystème des preuves numériques <p>Cet article donne un aperçu sur les développements de l’E-ID en Suisse et renseigne sur l’environnement Sandbox récemment lancé. (<a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/die-schweiz-auf-dem-weg-zur-neuen-elektronischen-identit%C3%A4t-public-sandbox-gestartet-99723a2e31bf">Artikel auch auch Deutsch verfügbar</a>.)</p> Contexte de l’E-ID suisse&nbsp;: ce qui s’est passé jusqu’à&nbsp;présent <p>Alors que le commerce électronique dans l’Union européenne est largement régi par le règlement eIDAS, il existe en Suisse différentes lois qui régissent des aspects comparables du commerce électronique. Actuellement, il n’existe toutefois pas de base juridique au niveau fédéral en Suisse pour une identité électronique émise par&nbsp;l’État.</p><p>Une première loi fédérale sur l’E-ID a déjà été adoptée en Suisse par le Parlement en septembre 2019, celle ci reposait sur des fournisseurs d’identité centraux et privés, mais elle a été abrogé lors d’une <a href="https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/fr/home/themes/abstimmungen/bgeid.html">votation populaire le 7 mars&nbsp;2021</a>.</p>Source de l’image: <a href="https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/fr/home/themes/abstimmungen/bgeid.html">https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/fr/home/themes/abstimmungen/bgeid.html</a><p>En mai 2021, le Conseil fédéral a chargé le Département fédéral de justice et police, le Département fédéral des finances et la Chancellerie fédérale d’élaborer, avec la participation des milieux scientifiques et des cantons, un concept sommaire pour un nouvel&nbsp;E-ID.</p><p>Une audition et une consultation publiques ont ensuite permis de discuter des trois solutions possibles suivantes pour un E-ID suisse&nbsp;:</p>  Self-Sovereign Identity  Infrastructure à clé&nbsp;publique  Fournisseur d’identité central de&nbsp;l’État  <p>En décembre 2021, <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/fr/home/aktuell/mm.msg-id-86465.html">le Conseil fédéral a annoncé une décision</a> orientée en faveur de la solution Self-Sovereign Identity pour l’E-ID&nbsp;suisse.</p><p>L’E-ID devra être émis par l’Office fédéral de la police (fedpol), qui est subordonné au Département fédéral de justice et police&nbsp;(DFJP).</p><p>L’infrastructure de confiance doit être développée et exploitée par la Confédération et permettre l’établissement de données et de justificatifs d’identité publics et&nbsp;privés.</p><p>Après la <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/fr/home/aktuell/mm.msg-id-89515.html">consultation sur la nouvelle loi E-ID</a>, qui a duré jusqu’en octobre 2022, le Département fédéral de justice et police devrait présenter la nouvelle loi E-ID d’ici l’été 2023. Parallèlement, l’expérimentation de la technologie dans une sandbox se poursuit.</p> Lancement d’un environnement d’essai public “Sandbox”. Source de l’image&nbsp;: Github repository “e-id-admin”.<p>La Suisse est en train de développer une nouvelle solution E-ID. La nouvelle solution E-ID poursuit l’objectif de stocker de manière décentralisée les données d’identité numériques et les justificatifs des citoyens. L’État conserve le contrôle de l’infrastructure de confiance nécessaire. Pour la mise en œuvre de l’écosystème E-ID, on mise, comme à l’avenir dans l’Union européenne, sur le concept des Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI).</p><p>Cette semaine, l’Office fédéral de l’informatique et de la télécommunication (OFIT) et l’Office fédéral de la justice (OFJ) ont mis en place une Public Sandbox afin de recueillir les premières expériences pratiques avec des ID-Wallets et des preuves vérifiables. L’objectif de la Sandbox est de travailler avec environ 40 partenaires participants&nbsp;:</p>  Permettre des applications pilotes SSI en Suisse De générer des expériences pratiques préliminaires pour l’ensemble de l’écosystème et de ses&nbsp;acteurs.  D’acquérir une expérience technique et organisationnelle par l’expérimentation  De faire progresser la construction d’une culture de collaboration au sein de l’écosystème.

 Die Schweiz auf dem Weg zur neuen elektronischen Identität — Öffentliche Sandbox gestartet <p>Dieser Artikel gibt einen Überblick über die E-ID Entwicklungen in der Schweiz und informiert über die kürzlich gestartete Sandbox Umgebung. (<a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/la-suisse-en-route-vers-une-nouvelle-identit%C3%A9-%C3%A9lectronique-lancement-dune-sandbox-publique-pour-306c77e38b6a">article également disponible en allemand</a>).</p> Hintergrund zur Schweizer E-ID: Was bisher&nbsp;geschah <p>Während der elektronische Geschäftsverkehr in der Europäischen Union weitgehend in der eIDAS-Verordnung geregelt wird, gibt es in der Schweiz unterschiedliche Gesetze, die vergleichbare Aspekte zum elektronischen Geschäftsverkehr regeln. Derzeit besteht auf Bundesebene in der Schweiz allerdings keine Rechtsgrundlage für eine vom Staat herausgegebene elektronische Identität.</p><p>Ein erstes Bundesgesetz zur E-ID in der Schweiz, welches auf zentralen, privaten Identitätsanbietern beruhte, wurde zwar bereits im September 2019 vom Parlament verabschiedet, jedoch in einer <a href="https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/bgeid">Volksabstimmung am 7. März 2021&nbsp;</a>gekippt.</p>Bildquelle: <a href="https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/bgeid">https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/bgeid</a><p>Bereits im Mai 2021 beauftragte der Bundesrat das Eidgenössische Justiz- und Polizeidepartement, das Eidgenössische Finanzdepartement und die Bundeskanzlei unter Beteiligung der Wissenschaft und Kantone ein Grobkonzept für eine neue E-ID zu erarbeiten.</p><p>In einer anschließenden öffentlichen Anhörung und Konsultation wurden die drei folgenden mögliche Lösungen für eine Schweizer E-ID diskutiert:</p>  Self-Sovereign Identity  Public Key Infrastruktur  Zentraler staatlicher Identitätsprovider  <p>Im Dezember 2021 gab der <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/aktuell/mm.msg-id-86465.html">Bundesrat einen Richtungsentscheid zugunsten der Self-Sovereign Identity Lösung für die Schweizer E-ID&nbsp;bekannt</a>.</p><p>Die E-ID selbst soll vom Bundesamt für Polizei (fedpol), welches dem Eidgenössischen Justiz- und Polizeidepartement (EJPD) unterstellt ist, herausgegeben werden.</p><p>Die Vertrauensinfrastruktur soll durch den Bund entwickelt und betrieben werden und sowohl die Ausstellung öffentlicher, wie privater Identitätsdaten und Nachweise ermöglichen.</p><p>Nach der <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/aktuell/mm.msg-id-89515.html">Vernehmlassung zum neuen E-ID Gesetz</a>, welche bis Oktober 2022 andauerte, wird mit einer Vorlage des neuen E-ID Gesetzes durch das Eidgenössische Justiz- und Polizeidepartement bis Sommer 2023 gerechnet. Parallel wird die Erprobung der Technologie in einer Sandbox vorangetrieben.</p> Start einer öffentlichen Versuchsumgebung “Sandbox” Bildquelle: <a href="https://github.com/e-id-admin/general/blob/main/meetings/20230302_E-ID_Participation-Meeting_March_Update_Public_Sandbox_Trust_Infrastructure_en.pdf">Github repository “e-id-admin”</a><p>Die Schweiz ist auf dem Weg eine neue E-ID Lösung zu entwickeln. Die neue E-ID Lösung verfolgt das Ziel, die digitalen Identitätsdaten und Nachweise der Bürgerinnen und Bürger dezentral zu speichern. Die Kontrolle über die erforderliche Vertrauensinfrastruktur verbleibt beim Staat. Für die Umsetzung des E-ID-Ökosystems wird, wie auch zukünftig in der Europäischen Union, auf das Konzept der Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI)&nbsp;gesetzt.</p><p>Diese Woche haben das Bundesamt für Informatik und Telekommunikation BIT und das Bundesamt für Justiz BJ eine Public Sandbox eingerichtet, um erste praktische Erfahrungen mit ID-Wallets und verifizierbaren Nachweisen zu sammeln. Ziel der Sandbox ist es mit ca. 40 teilnehmenden Partnern:</p>  SSI-Pilot Anwendungen in der Schweiz zu ermöglichen  Frühzeitige praktische Erfahrungen für das gesamte Ökosystem und seine Akteure zu generieren  Durch das Experimentieren technische und organisatorische Erfahrungen zu&nbsp;sammeln  Den Aufbau einer Kultur der Zusammenarbeit im Ökosystem voranzutreiben  Bildquelle: <a href="https://github.com/e-id-admin/general/blob/main/meetings/20230302_E-ID_Participation-Meeting_March_Update_Public_Sandbox_Trust_Infrastructure_en.pdf">Github repository “e-id-admin”</a><p>Das E-ID-Team des Bundes veranstaltet jeden Monat ein öffentliches E-ID Partizipationsmeeting online. Mehr Info gibt es per Newsletter. (<a href="https://www.eid.admin.ch/eid/de/home/e-id-gesetz/partizipation.html">Anmeldung via Newsletter</a>). Am 2. März 2023 wurde die <a href="https://github.com/e-id-admin/general/blob/main/meetings/20230302_E-ID_Participation-Meeting_March_Update_Public_Sandbox_Trust_Infrastructure_en.pdf">Sandbox zum ersten Mal in mehr Details</a> vorgestellt.

Interessierte Unternehmen und Organisationen mit Sitz in der Schweiz können den Lissi Agent nutzen, um digitale Identitätsdaten und Nachweise in der Schweizer Public Sandbox auszustellen, zu verwalten und zu verifizieren. Weiter ist es vorgesehen, dass die Lissi-Wallet im Rahmen der Public Sandbox Trust Infrastructure eingesetzt werden&nbsp;kann.</p>Abfolge aus Sicht eines&nbsp;Bürgers<p>Natürliche Personen erhalten mit dem Lissi Wallet eine sehr intuitive ID-Wallet zur Nutzung für unterschiedliche Anwendungsfälle innerhalb der Public&nbsp;Sandbox.</p>Die Lissi Agent Plattform ermöglicht verschiedene Anwendungsfälle in der Schweizer E-ID&nbsp;Sandbox.<p>Falls Sie ein Schweizer Organisation vertreten und sich mit einem Anwendungsfall an der Sandbox beteiligen möchten, können Sie gern <a href="https://r82hs8os9o6.typeform.com/to/p7VCW5Jt">unser Kontaktformular</a> ausfüllen. Wir unterstützen Sie gerne bei der Umsetzung.</p> Über Lissi <p>Lissi bietet einfache Anwendungen für Organisationen, um digitale Nachweise auszustellen, zu verwalten und speichern.

<p>Tell us a bit about Konfir – what do you do and why?                                                                              Konfir was established to revolutionize the employment verification process by securely removing companies’ administrative burdens when requesting or completing employment and gaps in employment verifications. We achieve this by leveraging our certification under the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF) and streamlining the process in a GDPR-compliant way. We aim to accelerate all corners of the modern UK economy, from those switching jobs to those renting a property or obtaining any type of credit.</p>



              



<p>Our unique focus is on protecting and enabling consumers by ensuring transparent and secure access to their own income and employment records. We’re dedicated to helping UK-based workers get approvals faster while controlling their data flow and helping relying parties verify employment faster. By offering instant results, improved candidate experience, and faster turnaround times, we make it a no-brainer for employment screening teams to choose Konfir.</p>



<p>What makes Konfir unique?<br>Konfir stands out from other providers in the employment and income verification space for several reasons. The antiquated and insecure solution of contacting previous employers takes days or weeks to process and only verifies what a candidate has said, not necessarily the reality. In contrast, Konfir provides instant employment data from authoritative sources using payroll integrations and open banking. This allows us to offer comprehensive results in a flash, which is especially helpful for employment verification and gap in employment validation checks that can often be time-consuming and cumbersome.</p>



<p>We also focus on improving the candidate experience, evidenced by our conversion rate of over 80%. Candidates appreciate the convenience, speed, and security of our service, which helps them complete what is sometimes a stressful and time-consuming experience so they can get to work quicker. As the only method of employment verification underpinned by certification, we’re continuously innovating to make the employment verification process even smoother and more efficient.</p>



Team Konfir



<p>What was the key driver for choosing certification under the UK DIATF?<br>The primary driver for choosing certification under the UK DIATF was to foster trust by providing evidence that Konfir operates to the highest security standards. The certification serves as a springboard to open conversations about employment verification with public bodies and the market given it is already understood by many following the Digital ID rollout. By establishing digital trust in the employment screening process, we can ensure that personal data is used responsibly and that individuals have control over how their data is used. This certification helps set the standard for employment and income verification in the UK; placing Konfir as a pioneer in the industry.<br><br>What made you choose Kantara Initiative (KI) as your certification body?<br>We selected Kantara Initiative as our chosen certification body due to their responsiveness, support from start to end, and their experience in this space in the UK and abroad. Furthermore, Kantara’s in-depth approach to ASP certification has complemented our ISO 27001 journey, ensuring a robust and comprehensive certification process that demonstrates our commitment to security and data protection.</p>



<p>What did you learn about your business as you went through the certification process?<br>Going through the certification process, one of the first major external full-company audit processes we’ve experienced, validated that we’re doing many things right. We also identified a few areas for improvement and learned a lot about how to standardise our rating of the identity and employment attributes we make available to our clients. The process emphasised the importance of digital trust and our commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals in the employment screening process.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to other start-up organisations considering certification?<br>Our advice to other start-ups considering certification is to start early and engage with organizations that have already gone through the process. Understand the requirements and benefits of certification, and ensure your business is well-prepared. Certification not only helps establish trust with your clients and partners but also strengthens your company’s internal processes and security standards.</p>



<p>How have you used certification to support your business development strategies?<br>Certification has been instrumental in enhancing our business development strategies. It has opened doors to partnership opportunities with key players in the trust framework, such as OSPs and IDSPs, as well as relying parties. As Konfir employs novel technologies like open banking and payroll integrations to complete verifications, the certification instills trust in the secure and responsible use of these technologies.</p>



<p>This certification not only establishes Konfir as a credible and viable business partner but also fosters trust in our processes among candidates. By operating in a secure, auditable, and compliant manner, candidates are more inclined to engage with our processes over non-certified competitors. Furthermore, our pioneering position in the industry, amplified by certification, boosts our visibility among employment screening companies and other stakeholders, contributing to the success of our business development efforts.<br><br>What feedback can you provide for the Kantara team?                                                                             The auditors were highly skilled individuals possessing a wealth of knowledge. Their structured and approachable demeanor made the entire experience both smooth and enjoyable. Throughout each step, they clearly communicated the requirements, rationale, and methods, ensuring a seamless process. We truly appreciate the Kantara team’s dedication and support.<br><br></p>

             <p>During the 37th GS1 Healthcare Conference in Paris (2022), Cliona Kiersey, Chief Pharmacist, HSE National Immunisation Office presented on stage the key successes for COVID-19 vaccine traceability in Ireland, including the early detection of quality issues and medication safety through reporting discard codes for vaccine usage. The implementation of TrackVax increased the certainty of valid doses, and collaboration and co-design with multiple stakeholders allowed system users to take ownership and continuously propose improvements. The system also provided full accountability in an environment of limited supply and public demand, and enabled real-time and accurate national reports with a rich dataset. Additionally, the system offered end-of-day reconciliation compared to paper-based reporting and provided timely, accurate, informative (usage trends) standardized reports, thereby increasing visibility.</p>

  Tracking the distribution of Covid vaccinations
 
 
     

 
             A successful pilot with Covid-19 vaccines has helped lay the ground for pharmaceutical traceability for all drugs by 2024 
     

 
             <p>A successful pilot with Covid-19 vaccines has helped lay the ground for pharmaceutical traceability for all drugs by 2024. The arrival of vaccinations against Covid-19 represented a big step forward in managing the pandemic. Countries around the world have been seeking ways to easily and constantly monitor the amount of vaccine available to citizens, to ensure efficient and fair distribution of these medicines. As a relatively new treatment – with side effects and efficacy still being closely tracked – it is also important to know which batches of which medicines are where, not least in case of recall.</p>

<p></p>     <p>Members of the Finance, Securitization, and Smart Contracts Working Group co-developed Citopia vinTRAK Zero-Knowledge proof of location verification for Dealer Floorplan Audit automation. </p>
          <p>Los Angeles — 30 March 2023: MOBI and its members have successfully demonstrated the first-ever Web3 digital infrastructure for privacy-preserving verification of vehicle track-and-trace, enabling lenders and auditors to automate Dealer Floorplan Audits (DFA). Currently, DFA is done manually, a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. The technologies piloted, MOBI Trusted Trip (decentralized identity linked with location into a verifiable trip) and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof of location, are foundational for many more applications, such as tolling, road usage charging, CO2 emissions tracking/reporting, and usage-based insurance.</p>
<p>Modern IT systems allow for the track and trace of connected devices with a big catch — the location of device users (Personal Identifiable Information, or PII) is exposed! Vehicles on dealer lots are filled with sensors that can provide accurate data about the vehicle’s condition, location, and other important information. While it is theoretically possible to use existing vehicle telematics to check location and automate the audit process, doing so can potentially reveal customer PII, for example, if the vehicle is sold or loaned to a customer. In addition, each dealer lot may contain vehicles from multiple manufacturers (OEMs) that do not share data with each other during the audit. As a result, lenders have continued with manual auditing.</p>
<p>MOBI’s DFA pilot uses Citopia vinTRAK ZK proof of location verification capabilities to safeguard vehicle location and other PII. The only public information required to verify the ZK proof and verification is the geofenced location of the dealership. During the audit process, the vehicle is asked “Are you in this geofenced location?” and the vehicle responds with the proof “Yes/No.” The proof does not contain any clear text information about a vehicle’s location or identity (e.g. VIN number).</p>
<p>An additional layer of privacy for the technology being demoed is the use of <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> standards to create <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Citopia Self-Sovereign Digital Twins (SSDT)</a>. An SSDT is a Digital Twin (DT) where only the owner/controller has access to the data stored inside the DT and can participate in autonomous transactions. In this pilot:</p>
<p>Vehicle geolocation resides in the vehicle SSDT and only the vehicle data owner/controller has access to this data. Lenders receive the ZK proof and MOBI and Lenders do not have access to vehicle C-SSDT.</p>
<p>ZK verification of vehicle location (does not contain a specific location or the VIN) resides in both the vehicle and the lender SSDTs (MOBI does not have access to this data).</p>
<p>The technologies used in this pilot enable the automation of Dealer Floorplan Audit for lenders and auditors without the complications and legal risks of handling PII associated with vehicles. This pilot is foundational for many track-and-trace applications powered by MOBI Trusted Trip and ZK cryptography. Building on this innovative groundwork, OEMs can monetize connected vehicle data in future applications such as vehicle maintenance traceability, battery cross-border compliance, and usage-based services.</p>
<p>The DFA Pilot using Citopia vinTRAK ZK proof of location verification is spearheaded by MOBI’s Finance, Securitization, and Smart Contracts (FSSC) <a href="https://dlt.mobi/mobi-working-groups/">Working Group</a>.

<p>Canada’s trusted digital ID leader, the DIACC, welcomes Budget 2023; applauds the government for investments in digital transformation and Canada’s shift to a digital economy</p>



<p>RONTO, MARCH 29, 2023 — Joni Brennan, President of the Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) released a statement following the tabling of the federal budget yesterday:</p>



<p>The DIACC welcomes the federal government’s investments for digital transformation and Canadian innovation to enable a thriving digital economy announced in yesterday’s budget.</p>



<p>Canada has an opportunity to be a global leader in digital ID, and unlock opportunities for Canadians, decrease costs for governments, consumers, and business, improve service delivery, and drive GDP growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A digital identity is a highly personal yet critical component to both serve and protect Canadians. From increasing data protection and privacy in the public sector to strengthening national security, public safety and child protection through effective authentication and authorization, digital ID is an important part of our transition to a digital world and a digital economy. Further, we know that an effective, safe and secure digital ID ecosystem will save manual operation costs and reduce fraud, saving an estimated $482 million for provincial and federal governments, and $4.5 billion for private sector organizations.</p>



<p>This budget announcement reinforces the government’s commitment to Canada’s digital transformation as it looks for ways to be a full participant in the global digital economy and shift to a digital-first mindset. The government has made some encouraging progress in adopting digital technology solutions to better deliver programs and services, and Canadians are benefiting from that progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were pleased to see the following commitments included in the budget:</p>



 
 A commitment to introduce legislative amendments to the Criminal Code and the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) to strengthen the investigative, enforcement, and information sharing tools of Canada’s AML/ATF Regime. 



 A commitment to improving Airport Operations and Passenger Screening, including $1.8 billion over five years to the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) to maintain and increase its level of service, improve screening wait times, and strengthen security measures at airports. 



 Commitments to improve service delivery for Canadians including $156.7 million over five years to reduce backlogs in Veterans Affairs Canada; $123.9 million over seven years for Old Age Security IT modernization; and a commitment to amend the Citizenship Act to enable the electronic administration of the citizenship program, automated and machine-assisted processing, and the collection and use of biometric information. 
 



<p>The budget provides an opportunity to further advance digital ID in Canada, and the DIACC remains committed to partnering with both government and industry to continue building a trusted digital ID ecosystem and educating Canadians to combat dis and misinformation regarding digital ID.</p>



<p>About Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC)</p>



<p>The Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) is a non-profit coalition of public and private sector organizations committed to developing research and tools to enable secure, robust, and scalable Canadian digital ID solutions and services. With privacy, security, and choice at the forefront of all DIACC initiatives, we aim to enable all Canadians to participate safely and confidently in the global digital economy.</p>

<p>We have long said there will not be one blockchain to rule them all. It will take a mix of blockchains and blockchain technologies to maximize the value of distributed ledgers, smart contracts, digital assets and self-sovereign identity between businesses, across industries and around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hybrid networks, which combine the capabilities of private and public blockchains, can deliver a number of advantages, including high levels of scalability and performance, and provide the right balance of security, privacy and transparency. The private blockchain offers secure, permissioned data storage—an essential feature that’s particularly crucial for highly regulated industries. Meanwhile, the public blockchain brings scale and immutability, enabling a more open and transparent ledger.</p>



<p>As part of our spotlight on #HyperledgerHybrid, we’ve compiled a sampling of production deployments and solutions leveraging Hyperledger technologies to deliver value across a mix of permissioned and public chains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain for Energy</p>



<p>Energy industry consortium, <a href="https://www.blockchainforenergy.net/">Blockchain for Energy</a> has launched a new decentralized and interoperable platform powered by <a href="https://www.kaleido.io/">Kaleido</a> and leveraging <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/firefly">Hyperledger FireFly</a>. The B4E Network &amp; Platform allows energy companies to access proven solutions and build applications that leverage Web3 constructs including smart contracts, digital assets, NFTs, and tokenization across both public and private chains. The first production-grade solution released on the new platform is from the B4E Commodity Transport Program, a collaborative effort led by Pioneer Natural Resources, that utilizes IIOT and blockchain technology to track chemical deliveries.</p>



<p>IPwe Digital Assets</p>



<p>In September 2022, <a href="https://www.casperlabs.io/">Casper Labs</a> and <a href="https://ipwe.com/">IPwe</a> developed and launched a dynamic NFT blockchain solution, IPwe Digital Assets. The solution uses the permissioned distributed ledger technologies of open source <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> and the public Casper Blockchain to securely store verified public and private information about each patent. The integration capitalizes on the data security and trust inherent on a Hyperledger Fabric network and enables Casper to securely bring assets locked on the private ledger to the public chain.</p>



<p>IPwe is now <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/02/02/ipwe-launches-revolutionary-platform-and-deployment-of-25-million-patent-nfts-on-hybrid-casper-blockchain-and-hyperledger-fabric-network">deploying 25 million patent NFTs</a> leveraging the hybrid Casper Blockchain and Hyperledger Fabric network. On top of that, IPwe’s solution includes <a href="https://ipwe.com/smart-intangible-asset-management/">Smart Intangible Asset Management</a> (SIAM), a comprehensive SaaS tool for IP valuation and management that allows enterprises to fully utilize these patent NFTs to transact, manage, and value their IP. This revolutionary implementation of blockchain technology will enable IPwe to bring liquidity to the IP space, where currently approximately 95% of IP assets are not transacted or commercialized</p>



<p>Palm Network</p>



<p>The <a href="https://palmfdn.org/#/network#network">Palm network</a> is an Ethereum sidechain dedicated to selling, purchasing, and trading NFTs that are associated with real-world and digital assets. It is built with <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu">Hyperledger Besu</a> and uses IBFT 2.0 proof of authority (PoA) consensus, with network validators being run by key stakeholders. IBFT 2.0 offers fast transaction speed and free minting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An automated bridge relay service connects payment tokens, like DAI, and NFTs on Ethereum and the Palm network, with bridging contracts deployed on both networks to manage the connection. Fees collected from this bridge are partially used to purchase carbon offsets.</p>



<p>Starling Lab&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.starlinglab.org/">Starling Lab</a> is a joint effort developed by the USC Shoah Foundation and Stanford University’s Department of Electrical Engineering. The initiative’s goal is to develop a set of tools and principles to be used across non-profit organizations, news outlets, and industry experts to solve challenges when it comes to the uncertainty of the media we see today and our enduring effort to preserve the truth. </p>



<p>Starling provides an open-source, end-to-end framework for the media generation and verification process. The framework consists of three modules: capturing the image, storing the information, and verifying its authenticity. It leverages multiple blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. Each metadata record, such as the caption or photographer byline added by an editor to a photo’s record, is relayed to a Hyperledger Fabric peer for notarization on a private permissioned ledger. Each transaction posted to Hyperledger is recorded on <a href="https://hedera.com/consensus-service">Hedera Consensus Service (HCS</a>) using a hashgraph that rapidly orders and stamps each entry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Toko</p>



<p>Global law firm DLA Piper developed its <a href="https://www.dlapiper.com/en/about-us/law-and/toko">TOKO</a> tokenization platform to issue non-fungible tokens across asset classes including real estate, fine art, debt and even intellectual property. Toko is a digital asset creation engine to solve inefficiencies in today’s capital markets by using DLTs to distribute, trade and settle transactions rapidly, bypassing the need for trusted third party intermediaries that are both expensive and slow. It is built using the combination of a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric network and the Hedera Consensus Service.</p>

<p>This review period is now closed.</p>



<p>Notice of Intent: DIACC is collaborating to develop and publish the Trust Registries component of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) to set a baseline of public and private sector interoperability of identity services and solutions. During this public review period, DIACC is looking for community feedback to ensure that the conformance criteria is clear and auditable.</p>



<p>To learn more about the Pan-Canadian vision and benefits-for-all value proposition please review the<a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PCTF-Overview-FINAL.pdf"> Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Overview</a>.</p>



<p>Document Status: These review documents have been developed by members of the DIACC’s<a href="https://diacc.ca/committees/"> Trust Framework Expert Committee</a> (TFEC) who operate under the DIACC controlling policies and consist of representatives from both the private and public sectors. These documents have been approved by the TFEC as Draft Recommendations V1.0.</p>



<p>Summary:</p>



<p>A Trust Registry is a key component of the new and emerging decentralized digital identity architecture. In this decentralized (or Self Sovereign) architecture a Digital Wallet receives Verifiable Credentials from Issuers and then subsequently provides presentations of these Credentials to Verifiers. In this architecture a Trust Registry provides Issuers, Verifiers, Digital Wallets (and their human Holders), and other Trust Registries the information necessary to verify the identity and status of the other parties as well as the authenticity and status of Credentials and Presentations that a Digital Wallet receives and presents.</p>



<p>Invitation:</p>



 
 All interested parties are invited to comment. 
 



<p>Period:</p>



 
 Opens: March 27, 2023 at 23:59 PT | Closes: April 27, 2023 at 23:59 PT 
 



<p>When reviewing the components Conformance Criteria, please consider the following and note that responses to this question are non-binding and serve to improve the PCTF.</p>



 
 Would you consider the Conformance Criteria as auditable or not? That is, could you objectively evaluate if an organization was compliant with that criteria and what evidence would be used to justify that?

<p>The <a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/l/cp/0BXjjcnX">Privacy-Enhancing Mobile Credentials Working Group</a> within <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> is working to develop the necessary privacy-related guidance for those organizations issuing, verifying, and developing the technologies to hold digital credentials such as mobile drivers’ licenses (mDL) when in person. This work has been underway since November 2021, and the lessons learned in that time have resulted in the revision of the PEMC WG charter.</p>



<p><a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PEMCP/pages/2097569/WG+Charter">Revised Charter</a></p>



<p>The revised charter provides a new Background section to help people new to the space understand the impetus behind the work and a clear description of the target audience for the specifications that this group will produce. The goal of all Kantara Initiative working groups is to be open and accessible to all, and providing a clearer background for the work will enable those new to the space to be more confident when engaging with the group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Purpose and Scope have also been clarified, moving the timeline to its own section with revised dates and offering a bit more detail on both what is in scope and out of scope for our work.</p>



 
 In Scope: Credentials issued by both public sector and private sector issuers are in scope of this document. 



 Out of Scope: Collection, use, and maintenance of identifying attributes by the Issuer are out of scope of this document. Decisions made by an Issuer could be set by policy or regulation regarding what information they collect for the credential itself. 
 



 PEMC Implementors Report 



<p>The next official output of the PEMC WG is the Early Implementors Draft Report. The Implementors Report offers the necessary framing, guidance, and description of appropriate evidence that will allow the PEMC WG to develop the requirements and profiles needed for implementing the best practices described by the PEMC WG. It will also provide much-needed initial guidance for Holders (the people and/or organizations that provide technology to store mobile credentials and support the necessary consent models for its use), Issuers (the people and/or organizations issuing the credentials), Verifiers (those entities that must verify the credential as valid or legitimate).</p>



<p>The goal is to have this report published by the close of Q2 2023.</p>

 About Kantara Initiative and the OpenID Foundation 



<p>Support for the volunteer-led PEMC WG is offered by Kantara Initiative and the OpenID Foundation.</p>



<p>About Kantara Initiative</p>



<p>Kantara Initiative is a global community focused on improving the trustworthy use of identity and personal data. It has multiple working groups that explore innovation, and standardization and develop good practices around the collection, storage, and use of personal identity information. Kantara nurtures thought leadership, and ground-breaking R&amp;D and develops specifications that will create and maintain a trustworthy identity ecosystem. Our working groups concentrate on informing policy and standards on topics as wide-ranging as User Managed Access and Consent Receipts; Privacy-Enhancing Mobile Credentials, and Digital Healthcare Services.</p>



<p>Kantara also runs the world’s leading Identity Assurance programs. These assessment programs uniquely audit companies and their products for conformance against a number of Trust Frameworks, including the National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) 800-63 standards for privacy and security around Identity and the UK government’s Digital Identity &amp; Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF).</p>



<p>Different classes of Identity Assurance Trust Marks are awarded to organizations that meet specific criteria around technical and business expertise. The most complete Trust Mark is awarded for full compliance with technology, business processes, maintenance, and governance for full credential service providers.</p>



<p>&nbsp;More than 50% of Kantara members reside outside the US.&nbsp; Our leadership is committed to low – or no – barriers to participation, and we encourage membership from organizations across all public, private, and non-profit sectors and across all geographies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This new ToIP white paper sets out practical steps for better business decisions using decentralized identity SSI infrastructure.</p>



<p>Although this new ToIP white paper, publishing jointly by the ToIP Ecosystem Foundry, Governance Stack, and Concepts and Terminology Working Groups, is entitled <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Decentralized-SSI-Governance-V2.0-2022-01-06.pdf">Decentralized SSI Governance</a>, the focus of the paper is actually on how governance can be used to specify business logic and workflow and hence the contextual validity of what qualified data:</p>



<p>Qualified data: data that comes with assurances, e.g. regarding its provenance and integrity (immutability), such that it qualifies as ‘valid to be used for specific purposes of individual parties’.</p>



<p>In the world of TCP/IP it is argued, any data can be transmitted, whereas SSI is specifically exchanging qualified data that is contextually relevant for decision-making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper first distinguishes between verification and validation — a critical distinction which interestingly challenges traditional identity and verification models. In traditional ID&amp;V workflow, validation comes before verification. For example, at an airport when a traveler presents at passport control, the passport is first scanned to check that it is a valid document, then the border officer will use human and/or machine tools to verify that the traveler presenting the document is also the passport holder.</p>



<p>With SSI, this workflow is reversed. At the time of presenting their credential, the traveler is already verified as being the document holder (for example, using biometric verification and/or zero knowledge proof cryptography). Then the document’s data contents need to be validated as relevant for the purposes of that particular context— in this case, passing over an international border.</p>



<p>The paper lays out the business drivers and business process challenges of changing this logical flow. It shows how the benefits of SSI can be realized by following a clear roadmap at three levels:</p>



 
 Participatory governance for all three roles in credential exchange (holder, issuer and verifier) to set policy for their respective contexts. 



 Automating decision-making based on arguments (business logic). 



 SSI assurance communities that are built on the existing accreditation, certification and audit regimes. 
 



<p>While it is billed as a white paper about governance, it is really a pragmatic guide for business people can make the most of SSI infrastructure, streamline their business processes, and implement new workflows for qualified data. The result is a clear path for transitioning from validation first to verification first, based not on future technological capabilities (although the roadmap proposes tools such as cryptographically enforceable policies for the future), but on existing business and assurance processes.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Decentralized-SSI-Governance-V2.0-2022-01-06.pdf">paper (PDF)</a> is available to read.</p>

<p>By Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>SK Telecom, a leading mobile phone service provider in Korea, is taking a big step forward in terms of user authentication by adopting passkeys for their online users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys are a replacement for passwords that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices.&nbsp;Unlike passwords, passkeys are always strong and phishing resistant.&nbsp;They eliminate the need for users to remember complex passwords and the authentication process is much faster.&nbsp;Passkeys are based on FIDO authentication, which is proven to be resistant to threats of phishing, credential stuffing and other remote attacks.&nbsp;</p>



 







 



<p>SK Telecom has introduced passkeys as a means of user authentication to PASS, their identity verification services with over 18 million users.&nbsp;Customers using iOS16 or higher devices can use the passkeys for PASS login, identity verification through PASS, and electronic signature.&nbsp;Depending on the device, user authentication is performed using Face ID and Touch ID.&nbsp;Android users can now use FIDO2 based authentication methods and perform authentication by utilizing screen locks (biometrics, PINs, patterns, etc.) provided by their devices.&nbsp;In the future, SK Telecom plans to make sign-ins with passkeys available to Android users as well.&nbsp;SK Telecom will introduce new user scenarios in a variety of ways to better protect customers’ assets and identity through the introduction of the passkeys.</p>



 


 
 


 



<p>[Passkey Registration Process on SK Telecom PASS]</p>



<p>SK Telecom Developed support for passkeys through cooperation with platform operators, and the FIDO authentication server for processing sign-ins with passkeys was developed by SK Telecom’s own technology.&nbsp;By actively introducing not only PASS but also various services provided by SK Telecom, they hope that many customers who use SK Telecom services will be able to use the service more conveniently and without worrying about security.</p>



<p>This deployment represents a new milestone in SK Telecom’s journey with FIDO. In 2019, during the FIDO Alliance Public Seminar in Korea, SK Telecom reported zero credential stuffing once the company adopted FIDO Authentication for internal usage.&nbsp;They also claimed that their FIDO-based biometric authentication reduced the average authentication time to less than 5 seconds, which previously took more than 30 seconds on average, when the internal users tried logging in with ID and passwords. It is great to see that they continue to innovate and now provide the benefits of FIDO Authentication to the general public.</p>



<p>Through this milestone, many users in Korea will be safe from various threats stemming from passwords, and SK Telecom’s movement as an innovator will have a positive impact on spreading password-less authentication not only in Korea but also globally.</p>

You can also download the PASS apps by visiting the App <a href="https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/pass-by-skt/id1141258007">Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sktelecom.tauth&amp;hl=ko&amp;gl=kr">Google Play</a>.</p>

<p>Now in a key 18-month window, 1Password plans to ramp up its shift to passkeys in 2023.</p>



<p>Big Tech companies have recently made headlines by pledging to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2022/05/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard/">move away</a>&nbsp;from traditional passwords in favour of a more modern solution: passkeys. But for Anna Pobletts, the advent of passkeys is nothing new.</p>



<p>Two years ago, Pobletts co-founded and was CTO of Austin, Texas-based startup Passage, which focused on making the predecessor to passkeys, an API called WebAuthn, accessible to developers and businesses that were looking to implement passwordless authentication.</p>



<p>In only the second year of its existence, Passage caught the eye of another major player in the authentication space: 1Password, the password manager used by millions and one of Canada’s&nbsp;<a href="https://betakit.com/1password-claims-2-5-billion-cad-valuation-in-new-round-as-investors-rave-about-generational-security-software-business-opportunity/">most valuable</a>&nbsp;tech companies.</p>

<p>Until recently, replacing passwords has ranked somewhere between tricky and impossible. Passkeys completely eliminate passwords, and while they won’t end cyberattacks, they represent a far more convenient and secure framework to navigate the digital world. “Legacy frameworks, including some forms of two-factor authentication, depend on a human-readable and shared secret. This makes them highly susceptible to attack and relatively easy to bypass,” explains Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance.</p>

<p>While Twitter CEO Elon Musk has defended the move to ban 2FA for non-subscribers as a way to protect user security, most leaders aren’t buying it. “Just from a purely pragmatic standpoint, this is basically stripping away the lowest threshold of 2FA out there without any sort of viable or easy replacement,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance. As Shikiar sees it, Twitter could have told users that they’re removing OTP but educating users on passkeys, which are safer and built into Android and iOS devices.</p>

<p>GitHub will begin its official rollout of two-factor authentication for developers who contribute code on the platform, starting March 13. GitHub added that it will support SMS text messages as a second factor, while testing FIDO Alliance passkeys internally to improve the security posture. “It is true that SMS 2FA can be easily phished by hackers as it relies on knowledge-based credentials. But GitHub recognizes these risks and strongly recommends using security keys and TOTPS wherever possible for greater security – [and] will continue to offer SMS for 2FA – which is better than removing the option entirely,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance.</p>

 Nurturing a healthy online community takes personality, purpose, and persistence. <p>In the world of Open Source, it’s well known that products and projects with a healthy, vibrant community withstand the test of time. For some reason, though, in the ever-expanding digital landscape, “community” is a hard concept to understand.</p>cc-by-nd Visual Thinkery for&nbsp;WAO<p>There is an obvious, visible difference between a community and a group of consumers. Talking to users is not the same as collaborating in a community. A community is a group of people with a shared purpose, and cultivating a healthy one demands patience as you help people find their shared purpose, culture, and connection.</p><p>With this post, we aim to demystify the special sauce that makes truly collaborative communities different.</p> Anti-transactional relationship building <p>There are certain behaviours that should be left at the door when doing community work. One is a transactional mindset, where “you scratch my back, and I’ll scratch yours”. While this can work, it’s usually in the short-term. While communities are made up of individuals with varying motivations, goals, and personalities, for organisations looking to build community, it’s important to understand the difference between transactional marketing relationships and community driven collaboration.</p><p>Trust and solidarity develop not through transaction, but through collaboration&nbsp;. So, be transparent about your intentions and values, and stay true to your community’s purpose. Authenticity fosters trust, and authentic relationships are not always transactional.</p><p>Staff members who interact with community members on a regular basis need to hone the connection between their own authentic voice and the brand or organisation they’re representing. Their ability to embody the organisational mission and empower other people are key components to a thriving community.</p><p>Example: A community manager might be a little quirky and really into 80s pop music. How do these personality traits show up in relation to their organisation’s mission?</p> Show solidarity <p>Engaging a community involves both honing a voice and helping bridge the gap between organisational intentions and community initiatives. It’s also about ensuring that the culture of the community is inclusive and representative of the people inside&nbsp;it.</p><p>As community members follow the activities of the organisation, so too should the organisation follow the activities of highly engaged community members. Encouraging people in endeavours that take place outside the community’s immediate landscape is a way to find points of overlap. By spotlighting things community members are doing in other contexts, you create both content and engagement for the community more&nbsp;broadly.</p><p>Example: A community manager notices that one of their community members is doing a charity run. How can the community manager call attention to the relationship between what the community member is doing and the community’s mission?</p> Advocacy in Leadership <p>Building a healthy online community is a marathon, not a sprint. It requires dedication and consistent effort to maintain and grow your community. You need people in leadership who are committed to the community and prepared for occasional setbacks or slow periods. This persistence will pay off in the long run as the organisation witnesses the community flourish.</p><p>As with any living organism, online communities grow and change over time. Organisations need to be receptive to feedback and willing to adapt to the evolving needs of community members. This means that detailed roadmaps are difficult to create that cover more than the next few months. However, you can plan in broad brushstrokes some of the ‘tentpole’ initiatives you want to run. Taking a different approach runs the risk of not knowing what the community wants and needs! Instead, find processes to regularly evaluate your strategies and make necessary adjustments.</p><p>Advocates in leadership teams are essential for community work. Community engagement is all about impact and real impact is tricky to measure. It is sometimes impossible to see. What looks like a failed community initiative might actually be the point where everything changed for the&nbsp;better.</p><p>Example: The community team organises a community call, which runs out of steam after a few sessions. The team does a post-mortem, decides to change the focus, agenda and timing. What else could the team try to iterate&nbsp;on?</p> Start Small, Think Long-term <p>To build a successful online community, you need a strong foundation. Begin by assembling a small group of dedicated members who believe in your mission and are willing to invest time and energy into fostering connections. Focus on incremental growth to create a sustainable, lasting community.</p>cc-by-nd Visual Thinkery for&nbsp;WAO<p>Engagement is the lifeblood of any online community. Encourage members to participate by asking questions, sharing stories, and sparking discussions. Be present in these conversations and listen actively to understand the needs and desires of your community members. By making yourself accessible and responsive, you create an environment where members feel seen, heard, and&nbsp;valued.</p><p>Empower your community members to contribute their knowledge, skills, and experiences. User-generated content (UGC) not only enriches the community but also fosters a sense of ownership and belonging among members. Collaborative projects and initiatives can help community members bond and feel invested in the community’s success.</p><p>Example: Your community team runs a 24 hour documentation edit-a-thon. During the event, a translator mentions that she wishes the documentation was in French. How can your community team empower this translator?</p> Conclusion <p>Cultivating a thriving online community requires a delicate balance of personality, persistence, and planning. Remember, the most successful communities are built on strong relationships, which can only be nurtured through time and intention. So, take a deep breath, roll up your sleeves, and get ready to embark on this rewarding journey.</p><p>Co-written with <a href="https://dajbelshaw.medium.com/">Doug&nbsp;Belshaw</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-art-of-community-cultivating-online-connections-738cc90b0a39">The Art of Community: Cultivating Online Connections</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Open AI; Why is Self-Sovereign ID superior to Digital Identity?

 Open AI; Why is Self-Sovereign ID superior to Digital Identity? 



<p>Self-sovereign identity (<a href="https://lionsgate.io/main/">SSI</a>) is a decentralized approach to digital identity management that emphasizes individual control and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investoffshore.com/contact/">ownership</a>&nbsp;over personal data. In contrast, digital identity (DI) typically involves the use of centralized systems, such as those employed by social media platforms, governments, and financial institutions, to manage and authenticate identity.</p>



<p>There are several reasons why SSI is often considered superior to digital identity:</p>



 
 Control: With SSI, individuals have full control over their personal data, including what data is shared, who it is shared with, and for how long. This gives individuals greater privacy and security than with centralized systems where data may be shared or accessed without their consent. 



 Portability: SSI enables individuals to carry their identity with them wherever they go, regardless of the platform or service being used. This allows for greater flexibility and convenience, as well as reducing the need for individuals to create and manage multiple identities across different systems. 



 Interoperability: SSI is designed to be interoperable across different systems and platforms, making it easier to use and integrate with other technologies. This can facilitate the development of new applications and services that rely on identity verification. 



 Trust: SSI is built on trust networks, where identities are verified by trusted parties rather than centralized authorities. This can help to reduce the risk of fraud and identity theft, as well as promoting greater transparency and accountability in identity management. 
 



<p>Overall, SSI offers a more secure, flexible, and user-centric approach to identity management than traditional digital identity systems.</p>







 Open AI; When will W3C make SSI mandatory in browsers? 



<p>As an AI language model, I cannot predict when the W3C will make SSI mandatory in browsers, as this decision is ultimately up to the W3C and its members. However, it is worth noting that the W3C has been actively involved in developing standards for SSI, such as the Verifiable Credentials Data Model, and has created a Working Group dedicated to developing SSI standards. Additionally, several browser vendors, including Microsoft, have already implemented support for SSI in their browsers.</p>



<p>That being said, making SSI mandatory in browsers would require significant buy-in from both browser vendors and the wider web development community, as well as careful consideration of the potential impact on user privacy and security. It is possible that we may see more widespread adoption of SSI in the coming years as the technology matures and its benefits become more widely recognized, but it is difficult to predict exactly when or if it will become mandatory in browsers.</p>







 Open AI; When will SSI reach adoption? 



<p>The adoption of SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) is a complex process that depends on several factors, including technological development, regulatory frameworks, industry standards, and user acceptance. While SSI is still in its early stages, there are several promising developments that suggest it may see increasing adoption in the coming years.</p>



<p>First, there has been a growing awareness of the importance of digital identity and the need for more user-centric approaches to identity management. SSI is seen as a solution to many of the issues associated with traditional identity management systems, including privacy concerns and data breaches.</p>



<p>Second, there has been significant progress in the development of SSI technologies, including the emergence of decentralized identity networks, such as Sovrin and DID (Decentralized Identifier) systems, which are based on open standards and provide a framework for interoperability between different SSI systems.</p>



<p>Third, several major players in the technology industry, including Microsoft and IBM, have already begun developing and implementing SSI solutions, which suggests that the technology is gaining traction in the enterprise space.</p>



<p>Finally, there has been increasing interest from regulators and policymakers in exploring the potential of SSI to improve identity verification processes and protect user privacy.</p>



<p>While it is difficult to predict exactly when SSI will reach widespread adoption, there are clear signs that the technology is gaining momentum and is likely to play an increasingly important role in the future of digital identity management.</p>







 Open AI; Is SSI good for KYC? 



<p>Yes, SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) can be an effective solution for KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements in industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce.</p>



<p>Traditionally, KYC has been a time-consuming and costly process for businesses, requiring the collection of extensive personal information from customers and often involving manual verification procedures. SSI can streamline this process by enabling individuals to share only the information necessary for KYC purposes, while still maintaining control over their personal data.</p>



<p>By using verifiable credentials, which are based on cryptography and distributed ledger technology, SSI systems can provide a secure and tamper-evident record of identity information, which can be easily verified by businesses and other third parties. This can help to reduce the risk of fraud and identity theft, while also improving the efficiency of KYC processes and reducing costs for businesses.</p>



<p>In addition, SSI can also provide benefits for individuals, such as greater privacy and control over personal data, as well as the ability to carry their identity with them across different services and platforms.</p>



<p>Overall, SSI can be a valuable tool for businesses looking to comply with KYC requirements, while also improving the customer experience and enhancing data privacy and security.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to announce the availability of certification tests for both <a href="https://openid.bitbucket.io/fapi/fapi-2_0-security-profile.html">FAPI 2.0 Security Profile Implementers Draft 2</a> and the upcoming first <a href="https://openid.bitbucket.io/fapi/fapi-2_0-message-signing.html">Implementer’s Draft of FAPI 2.0 Message Signing</a>.</p>
<p>The FAPI Working Group has taken many of the learnings from FAPI 1.0 and also formulated an attacker model, producing a second iteration of FAPI that is simpler and easier to use but still meets the security goals. You can learn more about the <a href="https://openid.net/2021/12/14/what-are-the-differences-between-fapi-1-0-and-fapi-2-0-and-what-do-they-mean-to-you/">differences between FAPI 1.0 and FAPI 2.0 on our blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The release of these FAPI 2 certification tests is an important next step on the journey to these standards becoming final specifications. The release of the FAPI 2 certification tests follow the <a href="https://openid.net/2022/12/19/fapi-2-0-announcement/">comprehensive security analysis performed and published in Summer 2022</a>. The researchers at the University of Stuttgart, Institute of Information Security led by Prof. Ralf Küsters, Pedram Hosseyni, and Tim Würtele were able to prove the security properties of the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile (formerly known as FAPI 2.0 Baseline). This is a great result and should give implementers of FAPI 2.0 further confidence in the security benefits of implementing the specifications.</p>
<p>Two ecosystem profiles are currently supported for certification – the “plain” FAPI 2.0 specification and a profile of FAPI 2.0 Message Signing for the <a href="https://connectid.com.au/">Australian ConnectID ecosystem</a> (the latter requiring support of the OpenID Connect ‘claims’ parameter).</p>
<p>A significant change in the new FAPI 2.0 tests is that support of OpenID Connect (in particular, the openid scope value and the return of an id_token) is now optional.</p>
<p>Certifications that include DPoP will launch later in the year (beta versions of the DPoP tests are available but are not yet complete and do not yet support some features like DPoP nonces).</p>
<p>Please note a few features of the FAPI 2 specification currently not supported:</p>
 
 RAR 
 HTTP Message Signatures 
 Servers must reject unregistered redirect URLs 
 
<p>These features will be tackled in due course. If you have any current use-cases that rely on these features and are particularly interested in any, please inform the certification team at <a href="mailto:certification@oidf.org">certification@oidf.org</a>. Additionally, the certification team kindly welcomes feedback from all testers on the performance of the tests.</p>
<p>The Foundation also kindly thanks ConnectID for their directed funding contributions to support the development of these FAPI 2.0 conformance tests. This directed funding accelerated the development of these tests for the global community to start using with Implementer’s Drafts, and the importance of these tests to help the FAPI 2.0 family of specifications move towards Final in due course.</p>

<p></p>      Introduction           <p>Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI) is a global nonprofit smart mobility consortium. MOBI and our members are creating blockchain-based standards to identify vehicles, people, businesses, and <a href="https://dlt.mobi/trusted-trip/">MOBI Trusted Trips</a> (decentralized identity linked with location into a verifiable trip). We are building a <a href="https://dlt.mobi/web3-infrastructure/">Web3 digital infrastructure</a> (Citopia vinTRAK) for connected ecosystems and IoT commerce. Our goal is to make transportation more efficient, equitable, decentralized, and sustainable, all while preserving the data privacy of users and providers alike.</p>
<p>The Dealer Floorplan Audit (DFA) Pilot using Citopia vinTRAK <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c">zero knowledge</a> proof of location verification is spearheaded by MOBI’s <a href="https://dlt.mobi/mobi-working-groups/">Finance, Securitization, and Smart Contract (FSSC) Working Group (WG)</a> with contributions from Accenture, Altaventure, Amazon Web Services, BMW Bank, CEVT, Connections Insights, CO-OP Financial Services, ConsenSys, D.E. Consulting, DENSO, DMI, Ford Credit, Global Debt Registry, GM Financial, Honda, IOTA, Itochu, National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), Nissan Motor Acceptance Company, On the Road Lending, Orrick, Quant Network, Quantstamp, Reply, RouteOne, Southeast Toyota Finance, Spring Free EV, Stellantis Financial Services, Tezos Foundation, Toyota Industries Corporation, Trade Log, and USAA.</p>
                       Overview of the Pilot and the Problem it Solves           <p>When dealers buy vehicles from manufacturers (OEMs), they finance the purchase with the vehicle as collateral for the loan. To ensure that the collateral is safe, lenders perform audits to verify that the vehicles expected to be at the dealership are actually physically there — hence the name, dealer floorplan audit. If a vehicle is sold, the loan must be repaid under the lender’s terms. This is similar to the housing market where you must immediately pay your mortgage lender if you sell your house. In the housing market, mortgages are repaid out of escrow as part of the sales process. Dealer floorplan loans have no similar escrow process, so lenders currently employ human auditors (usually third party service providers) who provide a trust service to guarantee that their unsold vehicles are on the lot and that the sold vehicles are being paid according to the lender’s terms.</p>
<p>Floorplan auditing requires an extensive amount of manual work as auditors must physically go to dealer lots to count and verify that the vehicles are on the lot or otherwise accounted for. Furthermore, these audits are not done frequently enough to catch all potential errors. Therefore, lenders hold reserves to compensate for the risk, thus increasing the cost of the loans for dealerships.</p>
<p>To this end, MOBI and our members are building a digital infrastructure called Citopia vinTRAK. Auditors can incorporate the technology provided by vinTRAK to significantly improve their auditing process/application by reducing resources while being able to perform secure and privacy-preserving audits at any time and any frequency (with frequencies corresponding to different levels of risk at different dealers). This will eliminate substantial expenses for the lenders — fewer auditing resources, cheaper capital — and therefore lower the costs of loans for dealerships; a win-win.</p>
                     Our Innovative Solution           <p>Modern IT systems allow for the track and trace of connected devices with a big catch — the location of device users (Personal Identifiable Information, or PII) is exposed! Vehicles on dealer lots are filled with sensors that can provide accurate data about the vehicle’s condition, location, and other important information. While it is theoretically possible to use existing vehicle telematics to check location and automate the audit process, doing so potentially reveals customer PII, for example, if the vehicle is sold or loaned to a customer. In addition, each dealer lot may contain vehicles from multiple OEMs that do not share data with each other during the audit. As a result, lenders have continued with manual auditing.</p>
<p>MOBI’s DFA pilot uses Citopia vinTRAK zero knowledge proof of location verification capabilities to confirm the loan collateral without revealing vehicle location or any other data. Vehicle location within or outside a dealer lot at any moment in time can be proven and verified using Zero Knowledge (ZK) cryptography without revealing any clear text information about a vehicle’s location or identity (e.g. VIN number). The only public information required to verify the ZK proof and verification is the geofenced location of the dealership. During the audit process, the vehicle is asked “Are you in this geofenced location?” and the vehicle responds with the proof “Yes/No.” Lenders can vary how frequently the vehicles should generate such proofs in response to the varying levels of risk between different dealers. See Appendix A for ZK proof input/output and generation/verification.</p>
<p>An additional layer of privacy for the technology being demoed is the use of <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> standards to create <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Citopia Self-Sovereign Digital Twins (C-SSDT)</a>. **A C-SSDT is a Digital Twin (DT) where only the owner/controller has access to the data stored inside the DT and can participate in autonomous transactions.</p>
 
 Vehicle geolocation resides ONLY in the vehicle C-SSDT (MOBI and Lenders do not have access to this data) 
 ZK verification of vehicle location (does not contain specific location or the VIN) resides in both the vehicle and the lender C-SSDTs (MOBI does not have access to this data)** 
 
<p>Together, these technologies enable the automation of DFA without the messy complications of handling PII associated with vehicles. This DFA pilot is foundational for many track-and-trace applications powered by ZK cryptography. Building on this innovative groundwork, OEMs can monetize connected vehicle data in future applications such as vehicle maintenance traceability, battery cross-border compliance, and usage-based services.</p>
          <p>PILOT STAKEHOLDERS — See (**) above regarding C-SSDT. For this pilot, C-SSDTs are implemented on Citopia cloud.</p>
<p>OEMs: </p>
 
 Create a secure account and self-onboard by creating C-SSDT 
 Onboard vehicles by creating vehicle C-SSDTs (VIN, make &amp; model) and generating secure API endpoints 
 Connect vehicle C-SSDT to vehicle telematics via secure API connection (specifically only near real-time geocoordinate is needed. This data resides in the vehicle C-SSDT and is not shared with MOBI or Lenders) 
 Allow communication between vehicle and Lender C-SSDTs via secure API connection &gt;&gt; Lender C-SSDT asks vehicle C-SSDT “Are you in this geofenced location?” the vehicle responds with the proof “Yes/No” 
 
<p>Lenders:</p>
 
 Create a secure account and self-onboard by creating C-SSDT 
 Provide periodic updated list of dealers and each dealer’s geofenced location(s) via secure API connection 
 Provide periodic updated list of vehicles (VIN numbers) for each dealer via secure API connection 
 Set vehicles’ ZK proof of location requirements for each dealer (e.g. ping vehicles 1-24 times a day) 
 Set vehicles’ ZK proof of location report for each dealer (e.g. once every 1-3 days) 
 
           Pilot FAQ           <p>Our focus for phase 2 of the DFA pilot is to use in-vehicle telematics (specifically only near real-time geocoordinate is needed). As stated above, this data remains in the vehicle C-SSDT and is not shared with MOBI or Lenders. If you have questions, please contact <a>griffin@dlt.mobi</a>.</p>
<p>1. Why is near real-time geocoordinate data needed for this DFA pilot?<br>
To generate ZK proof of location verification with PII and data privacy. The proof does not contain clear text information about vehicle location or VIN, therefore vehicle location is not shared with MOBI or Lenders.</p>
<p>2. What are the required in-vehicle telematics attributes?</p>
 
 VIN 
 Latitude and longitude within at least 5 decimal (approx 1.11m) degrees accuracy 
 Timestamp in UTC (date and time) 
 
<p>3. What frequency of vehicle geolocation data is needed?<br>
Maximum once/hour. Vehicle exact geolocation remains in the vehicle C-SSDT. Lenders receive the ZK proof and MOBI and Lenders do not have access to vehicle C-SSDT.</p>
<p>4. How is vehicle geolocation data shared?<br>
A secured API connection directly to the vehicle C-SSDT. MOBI and Lenders do not have access to or see data.</p>
 
 When an OEM creates a secure account and self-onboard, the OEM C-SSDT is automatically generated in the system 
 OEM onboard vehicles by creating vehicle C-SSDTs 
 Vehicle C-SSDTs generate API endpoints for C-SSDT to C-SSDT communication (e.g. Lender C-SSDT asks vehicle C-SSDT “Are you in this geofenced location?” and the vehicle responds with the proof “Yes/No”) Note: See Appendix A for ZK proof input/output and generation/verification 
 Future phases of the pilot may include Dealer and Lender C-SSDTs asking the vehicle C-SSDT for additional telematics and/or sensor data for use in other applications 
 
<p>5. How long is the pilot duration?<br>
Six months.</p>
<p>6. How often does the system need the updated list of vehicles (VIN list)?<br>
Minimum once per day through a secured API connection directly to the Lender C-SSDT.</p>
<p>7. How often does the system need the updated list of dealers and their geofenced location(s)?<br>
Minimum once per month through a secured API connection directly to the Lender C-SSDT.</p>
<p>8. How many vehicles are needed for the pilot?<br>
There is no limit and the more the better. Minimum ten vehicles per dealer.</p>
<p>9. Which ZK proof system was used for this pilot and why?<br>
For this pilot, Lenders are repeatedly pinging Vehicles at regularly defined intervals to request Proof of Location (PoL). As the number of requests for PoLs increases, the number of proofs increases quickly. Moreover, those proofs must be stored, as Lenders must be able to reference them in the future. And they should be fast to verify without heavy compute requirements. Therefore, proofs should be efficient (fast to generate without requiring a lot of storage and compute during proof generation) and succinct (small in size, and, therefore, fast to verify on regular computers/devices).</p>
<p>In light of these requirements, Citopia utilizes ZK-SNARKs (Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) as the ZKP method of choice for vinTRAK ZK Proof of Location. SNARKs are a powerful cryptographic tool that have several advantages over other types of ZKPs for this use case due to the following key factors:</p>
 
 SNARKs are private and trustless. SNARKs enable the verification of computations without trusting any third-party or revealing any information about the private inputs used in the computation. This makes them useful in situations where the privacy of the inputs is important, such as in financial transactions or in sensitive data processing (such as geolocation). 
 SNARKs are scalable. SNARKs enable the verification of large computations with very low computational overhead. This is because the proof generated by a SNARK is very small (on the order of a few hundred bytes) and can be verified very quickly (on the order of milliseconds). This makes SNARKs suitable for verifying computations on large-scale systems, such as blockchain networks, where scalability is a critical concern. 
 SNARKs are efficient. SNARKs are computationally efficient, meaning that they can be generated and verified using relatively low computational resources. More specifically, SNARKs have an O(N*logN) proving time and O(1) verification time. This makes them useful in situations where computational resources are limited, such as in low-power devices or in resource-constrained environments. 
 
<p>Overall, SNARKs offer computational efficiency, strong security, and privacy, making the approach a valuable tool for those handling sensitive or valuable data like geolocation or other PII.</p>

<p>The past few months saw a lot of buzz around emerging digital technologies. There wasn’t a week going by without news of AI-enabled tools that create sophisticated content from basic human prompts, major advances in biometrics, robotics or extended reality tech, and other viral stories from the sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as the tech industry’s impact has become more significant, it has become consequently difficult to tell which of these innovations are truly groundbreaking and which will be passé soon, which are the harmless and the more worrisome advancements within the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We at The Engine Room are no stranger to this complexity: we have been helping activists navigate the nuances of digital systems for over a decade now. One key area that tends to almost always come up in our analysis revolves around the “sustainability costs” of these emerging systems. How much will digital tech cost us in the long run, both in a financial and philosophical sense? What are the unintended environmental, social and political consequences of such systems going mainstream? What kind of labour relationships fuel innovation? Who really maintains the success of the industry? And how is this division entrenching historical inequalities?&nbsp;</p>



 The sustainability costs of innovation 



<p>When we look at the evidence, it is increasingly clear that emerging tech systems and internet technologies are very resource intensive. Our own <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/TER-Final-Report-07-07-22.pdf" title="">research</a> at The Engine Room has shown that corporate data centres have high energy needs, algorithmic models are data hungry and often built on exploitative labour relations, while the production of smart devices requires excess mineral extraction. To illustrate, the emissions generated by large-scale language models are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243" title="">reportedly the same</a> as the emissions of five cars, <a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SustAIn_Magazine_2022_EN.pdf" title="">underscoring</a> how heavily AI systems rely on the exploitation of our natural and social resources.</p>



<p>And yet, the popular attitude in the tech industry (and adjacent sectors) is to continue prioritising high energy interventions –regardless of whether more efficient options are available or not. Facebook and Google famously tried to <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-internet.html" title="">use drones and high-altitude balloons to connect remote regions to the internet</a>, even though the <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/the-life-and-death-of-snet-havanas-alternative-internet/" title="">shadow internet in Cuba</a> and the <a href="https://firn.genderit.org/research/cultivating-feminist-community-network-reflections-practices-quilombo-ribeirao-grandeterra" title="">community networks in Brazil</a> have proven that low-tech alternatives are often more sustainable, affordable, efficient and resistant to disruptions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what are some of the ways to push back on the notion that innovation should be prioritised by all means? How can we continue experimenting with technology’s liberatory potential, without sacrificing too much?&nbsp;</p>



 Low-tech solutions to high tech problems 



<p>Recognising the importance of a sustainable digital future, <a href="https://aisustainability.cargo.site/" title="">more and more activists are calling</a> for a low-tech/degrowth mindset that prioritises simplicity and durability over scale and fanciness. The degrowth movement is not a product of the digital era: the 1970s already saw growing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Is_Beautiful" title="">critique</a> of modern technology’s depletion of resources like fossil fuels, with many advocating for locally affordable, efficient technologies. Since then, the term ‘low-tech’ has become mainstream across different sectors, as a way to describe sustainable, accessible, responsible and ethical approaches to innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But how do these principles translate into every-day decisions for the makers and users of digital solutions?</p>



<p>There are a number of inspiring approaches and conceptual frameworks in emerging tech that prioritise degrowth. Some of the more promising examples include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.pikselkraft.com/en" title="">Low-energy approaches to web design</a> that are fully adapted to users’ needs without any technological or functional surpluses 



 <a href="https://www.ursi.org/files/RSBissues/RSB_339_2011_12.pdf" title="">Long-range wifi networks</a> that increase access and narrow the digital divide without the burden of costing too much 



 <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2020/01/how-sustainable-is-a-solar-powered-website.html" title="">Solar powered web hosting and data centres</a> that experiment with renewable energy sources in order to create resource-efficient content 



 <a href="https://library.theengineroom.org/01-tool-reuse-open-contracting/" title="">Reusable, open source and easy-to-maintain code</a> that can alleviate the costs of technological development 



 <a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SustAIn_Magazine_2022_EN.pdf" title="">Sustainable AI practices</a>, and more 
 



<p>For those who want to learn more about environmentally conscious web development, I highly recommend a deep dive into the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BhGaPrfJ4l0m6NM0C0l6xXCRD5vo3l4GMMCYp0Vc2Vw/edit?pli=1#" title="">Web Environmental Sustainability Guidelines</a>, a collaboratively written document that provides helpful prompts and resources. To illustrate, here are some of the questions that one can ponder before developing or deploying a particular technology:</p>



 
 What is the overall carbon footprint of this tech solution? Is it possible to decarbonize by detecting carbon leaks.? (<a href="https://www.greenframe.io/#features" title="">GreenFrame</a> and others offer open-source solutions that can help with that.) 



 How long is this application trying to “retain’ users and keep their attention, thus increasing their energy consumption, and causing <a href="https://ledger.humanetech.com/" title="">other significant harms to their mental </a>health? Are we making it easy for people to find the information they need, or are we trying to keep them hooked on our tech? 



 How much data does this tech collect? Only what is needed to improve the experience of the people using it? Or are we collecting excess information that will require energy-intensive data centres, while <a href="https://responsibledata.io/" title="">raising other concerns as well</a>?&nbsp; 



 Are we using large visual files and complicated design features? Or are we prioritising simplicity, access and sustainability in our visual approach?&nbsp; 
 



 Get in touch!&nbsp; 



<p>These are just some of the many questions we can ask ourselves when thinking about the longer term sustainability of digital innovation.</p>

This week, the release of their GPT4 product has swept the news cycle with debate of its ability to analyze and describe visual&nbsp;content.</p><p>But the companies responsible for generative AI are just that: companies. Companies must turn a profit eventually, which makes the outcome of concurrent intellectual property disputes around generative AI incredibly important. This is why I wanted to interview Jessica Fjeld, whose legal practice is focused on supporting the work of creatives, archivists, and advocates, especially as it intersects with emerging technology and debates around topics like intellectual property but also equity and inclusion. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/12/when-ai-can-make-art-what-does-it-mean-for-creativity-dall-e-midjourney">Across the world</a>, people who study the ownership, governance, and power of emerging technology companies are concerned about the power of generative AI to displace artists and creative workers. Now is the time to discuss the potential devaluing of creative work and the unique skills and vision of artists in the labor market through machine learning appropriation and reproduction.</p><p>Fjeld is a Lecturer on Law and the Assistant Director of the Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University. She is an accomplished poet whose legal practice focuses on supporting creatives as their work intersects with emerging technology. We sat down to discuss intellectual property in the context of the rise of generative AI.</p><p>Krista Cezair: Generative AI, like ChatGPT, has been predicted to displace poets, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04397-7">writers</a>, and artists. One novelist asks, “Can ChatGPT <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/can-chatgpt-write-a-better-novel-than-i-can/2023/02/11/e7f3d0c4-aa0e-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html">write a better novel</a> than I can?” Are these fears&nbsp;valid?</p><p>Fjeld: I’m not worried about generative AI replacing artists and writers. I think we’ll find ways to manage&nbsp;it.</p><p>Using photography as an example, my artist friend explained that when the camera was invented, most art schools devoted a lot of time to teaching people to paint in photorealistic styles. With the advent of the camera, there were worries about whether this meant the end of painting. But when art schools stopped teaching with the emphasis on photorealistic painting, it gave us abstract painting, a meaningful cultural advance. But for the upheaval of the camera, we wouldn’t have&nbsp;it.</p><p>Similarly, the skill of initially drafting will become less important, and the skills of editing and topic selection will become more important. Fundamentally, these algorithms are recombinatory. They’re not novel. They’re not innovating. They’re just producing raw material.</p><blockquote>They’re not novel. They’re not innovating. They’re just producing raw material.</blockquote><p>Cezair: If your poems were used as training or seed data, and then something was produced in the style of your work, would you expect attribution?</p><p>Fjeld: Yes, I think so, and that aligns with contemporary practice. When people are integrating elements of other works or inspired by a particular poem, you see captions at the top of poems that say “after so-and-so” or acknowledgment sections in the backs of books that cite other&nbsp;texts.</p><p>I fundamentally trust people and think that they’ll do the right thing if they’re given appropriate guidance. Ethically, that is the practice in most domains, and to the extent that <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/">The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a> has a future in legislation or otherwise becomes enforceable through law, we’ll see it even as a kind of social best practice. It’s reasonable to&nbsp;expect.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@bamagal?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">"My Life Through A Lens"</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>.<p>Cezair: That makes sense, especially with your theory about how fears would be overblown right now as we start to use this technology. Would it be fair to say that you think that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence-ai-regulation">regulation of generative AI</a> should be at a more local level, like within a contract, rather than at the more systemic state or federal&nbsp;level?</p><p>Fjeld: I think it’s very tempting, especially when we have revolutionary technologies — “disruptive technologies” to use the Silicon Valley term — to start to think about regulating them technology by technology because we’re worried about the change brought up by that technology. But in general, I think the most impactful regulation has to do with a harms-based approach.</p><p>In the copyright infringement context, we already have the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/getty-images-lawsuit-says-stability-ai-misused-photos-train-ai-2023-02-06/">Getty and Stable Diffusion lawsuit</a> brought by three artists. So, I think we’ll see that existing framework begin to deal with these new technologies. Copyright also had a hard time with the camera. Photographs came to be recognized as copyrightable after the courts realized they required originality and creativity to produce. The challenge here isn’t exactly parallel, but it will be similar to see courts grapple with how these technologies implicate copyright.</p><p>Cezair: Again, it shows that you have faith in humans and our already-built structures to be able to manage these very human-made creations. My final question is about this copyright idea and if it’s found that working artists don’t own the intellectual property of the product of what was trained on their work. Do you think that this ownership scheme reifies current power structures that devalue the labor of working artists who are <a href="https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/Artists_and_Other_Cultural_Workers.pdf">disproportionately of a lower socioeconomic status</a> than other professional workers in favor of corporations and capitalist hegemony?</p><p>Fjeld: Yeah, it’s a great question, and it’s worth recognizing the work of scholars like <a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/caelj36&amp;div=29&amp;id=&amp;page=">Anjali Vats</a> and others who have routinely and persuasively pointed out that even the existing copyright laws themselves have often been used in ways to reify existing racialized and economic power structures. You see the use of copyright law in music to devalue the work of Black musicians and to allow sampling of their works by white musicians.</p><p>Something that’s kind of interesting that I haven’t seen people thinking about yet is the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/robin-thicke-pharrell-williams-blurred-lines-copyright-suit-final-5-million-dollar-judgment-768508/">Blurred Lines case</a> in music copyright. In that case, Marvin Gaye’s estate won a judgment against Robin Thicke for a song that copied the feel or groove of Marvin Gaye’s original. If an algorithm is prompted by typing in, “I want something in the style of Krista’s work,” there could be an expansion of that type of case law to say there’s liability for this as a derivative work because it captures the overall feel of her&nbsp;work.</p><blockquote>It’s also important to remember that the creativity that goes into making these types of software programs is valuable and that those people should have rights,&nbsp;too.</blockquote><p>It’s also important to remember that the creativity that goes into making these types of software programs is valuable and that those people should have rights, too. And so, we want to reward the artists who are contributing to social progress through all of the important work they’re doing, and we also want to reward the technologists.</p><p>There are good guys on the tech side,&nbsp;too.</p><p>Cezair: Thank you. That’s a fantastic note to end&nbsp;on.</p><p>So, Fjeld fundamentally trusts us. She trusts us to apply existing structures and frameworks to new problems that arise from disruptive technologies. She trusts us to be honest about our use of generative AI. And she trusts us to protect those of us who would otherwise be exploited by this technology. But I wonder how much that optimism should be tempered with caution. Technological advances that implicate the skills of laborers have not been kind to people who are already subordinated in the American workplace, like people of color, women, and people with disabilities.</p><p>Recalling the Anjali Vats example, we see that the work of these kinds of marginalized groups is often already diminished even without the convenience of disruptive technologies to use to perpetuate that discrimination. As Fjeld’s discussion makes clear, technology outpaces law. I argue that particular regulatory attention must proactively be paid to artists and creative workers, themselves an underpaid class, and especially to those who exist at the intersection of other subordinated classes to guard against their further subjugation in response to the proliferation of generative AI.</p><p>Krista L.

<p>by Scott S. Perry, CPA, CISA<br>Principal, Crypto and Digital Trust Services<br>Schellman</p>







<p>Back in 2021, members of the Trust Over IP Foundation took on a monumental task.&nbsp; An august set of passionate cyber technologists (including me, who plays at it) set out to create design principles for its innovative Internet architectural model where trust and digital identity can be layered onto online transactions for greater transactional confidence and authenticity.</p>



<p>Within this effort, the group plummeted into a deep dive focusing on what are the key principals driving human trust and the factors in enacting decisions based on trust.&nbsp; I believe this effort was groundbreaking, and I fear this portion of a technical white paper will get lost without the effort to raise the topic to more prominence.&nbsp; In this paper, I hope to summarize and elevate the topic of human trust principles and the factors we humans employ in making decisions based on trust.</p>



<p>From the Oxford dictionary, trust is defined as the “firm belief in the reliability, trust, ability or strength of someone or something”.&nbsp; All of these are human constructs to measure and apply.&nbsp; This makes the concept of trust, with so many variables in play, more of an art rather than science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Trust Over IP <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-01-17.pdf">Design Principles</a> identified the following human trust principles as headings in this essay.&nbsp; The principles create the fabric in which we make decisions to trust something or someone.&nbsp; I’ll explore each one.</p>



 Trust is Human 



<p>Trust can be achieved with only a few data points or volumes of input.&nbsp; While we can artificially program computers to “trust” using rule sets and decision trees, the full embodiment of trust has too many variables to be programmed holistically.&nbsp; Humans use data, but they also use instincts and emotion to drive their trust decisions, characteristics which are difficult to program.&nbsp; The ingredients of trust are human concepts: belief, experiences, propensity, tolerance, and fear.&nbsp; It is said that human life is a compilation of decisions.&nbsp; Many of these decisions involve trust.</p>



 Trust is Relational 



<p>In the Oxford definition, trust is the state of reliability, truth, etc. about someone or something.&nbsp; That requires a relationship between the trustor and the object of trust.&nbsp; Those objects are in two broad categories: parties(people) and things.&nbsp; Trust is based on an unlimited number of conditions and experiences, some of which we cannot define verbally or objectively (or sometimes even consciously). Human trust can be vague and subjective, yet it is adaptable enough to consider conditions that are not yet known. It can also change over time—trust in people and things can be built up over multiple interactions and then eroded or destroyed by a single action.&nbsp; But it is all within the trustor over their relationship with the trusted person or object.</p>



 Trust is Directional 



<p>In the unaccounted number of trust decisions taking place in the world as you read this, each single trust action takes place in one direction.&nbsp; While the earlier principle identified there is a relationship between the trustor and the object of trust.&nbsp; That relationship is always one way, a human trustor applies trust to a party or thing.&nbsp; Trust can be bidirectional, but each trust action is one way and separate and nondependent on each other.&nbsp; Now that we have the two atomic principles for trust, we can build upon these elements using the next principles.</p>



 Trust is Contextual 



<p>In the world of digital trust, context is king.&nbsp; But what is context?&nbsp; Our friends at Oxford define context as “the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement or idea and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed”.&nbsp; Think of context as its own mini metaverse, with a singular focus on all the factors that contribute to a specific trust decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar to direction, context may need to be broken down to a point where it cannot be parsed any further.&nbsp; For example, a parent might not trust a teenager to help with all tasks in a household but may trust her to babysit his four year-old.&nbsp; That trust is predicated on the teenager passing an American Red Cross babysitting course and the parent supervising the babysitting for two two-hours sessions without incident.&nbsp; If we change the context to assistance in fixing the family minivan, alternative evidence is needed to trigger the parent to trust the teenager for that context such as experience and a high-school car maintenance class.&nbsp; Therefore, trust is not triggered for all decisions, each context is taken individually.</p>



 Trust Has Limits 



<p>As we have seen that context may need to be segmented in order to be properly applied, the degree of trust is neither infinite nor needs to be for a trust decision to be enacted.&nbsp; The question is what are the factors required for a person to make a trust decision within a given context?&nbsp; The secret is within traditional risk analysis using the concepts of risk tolerance, confidence intervals and assessed risk determined from factors of likelihood of occurrence and severity of outcomes.</p>



<p>Risk tolerance is defined as the standard level of risk and uncertainty innate to the risk taker based on experience and biological factors.&nbsp; How much of a “risk taker” are you? How did you establish that stance?&nbsp; Was it through previous risky decisions that went right or wrong?&nbsp; Have you always been willing to take risks that others will not?&nbsp; How attuned are you to learn from others’ risky decisions to make your own?&nbsp; All these factors set a personal risk tolerance level that is imprinted within trust decisions we make in our daily lives.&nbsp; That is why, given the same information and experience, two people could make different trust decisions within a given context.&nbsp; The following diagram illustrates this point.</p>







<p>The trust trigger area is a continuum when a given set of experiences, transactions, and other human perceptions combined with a person’s risk tolerance will cause an individual to take a trust action.&nbsp; The amount of information needed is not infinite.&nbsp; As the amount reaches B, we start experiencing “analysis paralysis” where the need to gather more information outweighs the utility of making a trust decision.&nbsp; At the limit, we don’t act.&nbsp; Where do you place yourself in the trust trigger continuum for trust decisions you’ve made?</p>



<p>Confidence level is the surety of making an appropriate trust decision at the time of its trigger. This level considers the likelihood of it being the wrong decision and the totality of that wrong decision’s effect on the context.&nbsp; Typically, higher consequence trust decisions take more confidence and information to trigger a decision.&nbsp; For example, typically we require deep analysis of budget, locations and features to trigger a home purchase; it takes nanoseconds to trigger an action to cross the street.</p>



<p>As we have seen that there are limits to the amount of information we need to trigger a trust decision, there is a limit to the amount of confidence we have in that decision when we make them.&nbsp; No trust decision delivers absolute assurance so what confidence do we need to trigger trust decisions?</p>



<p>In the audit profession, attestation reports cite that reasonable assurance is applied to auditor opinion letters.&nbsp; That level equates to a 95% confidence level for illustrative purposes.&nbsp; The amount of effort in reviewing and analyzing evidence to assert more confidence is not cost-effective. Relying parties have accepted the 5% risk understanding the costs.&nbsp; This applies to individuals making trust decisions.&nbsp; The confidence level in triggering a trust decision considers, risk likelihood/severity, time, availability of evidence and the person’s risk tolerance.&nbsp; This equates to a reasonable level of assurance perceived by the trustor at the time of making that trust decision.</p>



<p>The final attribute of the limits of trust is the time horizon.&nbsp; Each trust decision typically takes place within a planned time horizon and has a (usually unstated) time window when that trust applies.&nbsp; I may be willing to trust my friend John with my car within the next month; that trust would not extend a lifetime.</p>



 Trust Can Be Transitive 



<p>In our collective society, trust decisions are not solely based on personal experiences.&nbsp; We typically consider the positions of others in which we have developed a trust relationship.&nbsp; Who are these trusted third parties?&nbsp; There are many but in the revolution of social media applied to the global landscape, the term “influencer” has been coined with both positive and negative connotations.&nbsp; Who influences your trust decisions? We may be more inclined to trust the purchase of a skin product because our favorite celebrity endorses it or accept a SOC 2 auditor’s report because Schellman’s name is on the letterhead.&nbsp; We follow clergy’s opinions on a range of faith topics and take our parent’s advice on a place to eat.&nbsp; In these cases, as in mathematics, we are applying our trust decision using the perception of trust we have about a third party’s trust input.</p>



<p>The factors that cause us to rely on third parties are the same principles discussed in this paper. We create our own trust triggers for third parties based on the same concepts of risk likelihood/severity, time, availability of evidence and the person’s risk tolerance.&nbsp; Using transitive trust is likely to be more efficient and can be more effective than without it depending on the reliability of the trust source on the context we are seeking trust.&nbsp; As in all human experiences, some sources are more trustworthy than others.</p>



 Tying the Human Trust Principles Together 



<p>Next time you need to make a decision that has notable downstream consequences, think of the following:</p>



 
 What is the context of the trust decision? 



 What could go wrong if the wrong decision is made? How likely is that to happen? 



 How much information do I need to make the decision? Where can I find that information? 



 What timeframe do I need to make that decision? 



 How long do I need to trust? 



 Are there third parties I can consult to assist in the decision? How can I trust their input? 



 How confident do I need to be when I make that trust decision? 



 What prior experience can I draw from to assist in that decision? 
 



<p>Humans process trust transactions like a bank account.&nbsp; When we make commitments, then execute them to another’s satisfaction, we are building trust.&nbsp; We do this unsuccessfully, we erode trust.&nbsp; Therefore, to become more trustworthy, we need to be transparent and confident when we make commitments and work diligently to achieve them. The more collective trust there is in society, the more transitive trust is available to consider.</p>



<p>As we propagate trust decisions to our digital life, human trust principles will apply.&nbsp; It is our collective responsibility to understand these principles and build trustworthy applications considering that humans will remain on the forefront of their own decision-making process.</p>

<p>Let me start with the difference between the Internet and the&nbsp;web.</p><p>The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers or devices. The World Wide Web is a collection of information (data) on this network (see&nbsp;<a href="https://sciencerack.com/difference-between-world-wide-web-and-internet/">link</a>)</p><p>That means the web sits on the Internet.</p><p>Typically, web pages are owned and processed by centralised servers so to decentralise data, you might use a blockchain or some equivalent technology to tokenise and track the data between these centralised systems.</p><p>But what if, instead of decentralising data from the central data processing system we decentralise the data processing system&nbsp;itself?</p><p>That’s what a decentralized data server (DDS) is. (It’s also called the <a href="https://hubofallthings.com">HAT</a>). It is a virtual “device” in the cloud ownable by any legal entity – individuals, businesses and governments. The R&amp;D work by Dataswift and 8 U.K. universities brought the price of each of this data server down to less than $3 per&nbsp;year.</p><p>What this means is that data can be stored and processed at any entity’s data server, not just at centralised servers. The data in these server databases are called Self-Sovereign Data (SSData), a special legal and economic class of data that is much safer to use and&nbsp;share.</p><p>Over the years, Dataswift has built “pipes” and “valves” that move SSData between servers based on contracts agreed between parties and recognising where it was originally generated, where it was used and shared without knowing its contents. The Internet now has a new “lane” on its superhighway for SSData. SSData can be produced by one entity, processed by another, shared with another, all moving on this lane safely, securely and speedily. This legal class of data (SSData) can now create&nbsp;markets.</p><p>On top of that Internet layer, you can still have the normal web1, 2 or 3 technologies. The web pages or applications above it can read from multiple data servers, with the right permissions and contracts. And you can still tokenize and chain the SSData if you wish.

<p>By Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CMO, FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yahoo! JAPAN is an industry pioneer known for being an early adopter of new technologies to improve the security and usability of its services for its customers. Today, the company is continuing that tradition with its <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">adoption of passkeys</a> across Apple’s iOS, iPad OS, MacOS, and Google’s Android operating systems.</p>



<p>“Yahoo! JAPAN is one of the first companies to support passkeys from Apple and Google,” said Yuya Ito, ID Division, Yahoo! JAPAN. “Passkeys solve the usability issues that FIDO authentication has traditionally faced and dramatically improve users’ difficulties in using FIDO authentication. Through these initiatives, Yahoo! JAPAN and the FIDO Alliance will promote the shift away from passwords and the spread of passkeys and contribute to providing more secure and simple authentication on the Web.”</p>



<p>Based on FIDO standards, passkeys are a replacement for passwords that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices. Unlike passwords, passkeys are always strong and phishing-resistant.​ Passkeys simplify account registration for apps and websites, are easy to use, work across most of a user’s devices, and even work on other devices within physical proximity.​</p>



<p>Passkeys stand to fundamentally shift the way that consumers sign into apps and services across the web and across world, moving away from the burden and vulnerabilities of passwords and OTPs to a fundamentally stronger and simpler approach that allows users to sign in by taking the same action they use to unlock their device dozens of times each day – typically a biometric or local PIN code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Yahoo! JAPAN, more than 70% of its active users use either SMS or <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/yahoo-japans-password-free-authentication-reduced-inquiries-by-25-sped-up-sign-in-time-by-2-6x/">FIDO-based biometric passwordless authentication</a>. With passkeys, Yahoo! JAPAN’s customers can access their FIDO sign-in credentials on many of their devices, even new ones, without having to re-enroll every device on every account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By enabling its users to sign in with passkeys, Yahoo! Japan continues to serve as a leading innovator in Japan and in the FIDO Alliance, where it has played a vital role on the Alliance’s Board of Directors, the FIDO Japan Working Group and other FIDO Alliance bodies.</p>

Which is weird, right? Who enjoys meetings?</p><p>Meetings can be useful though, depending on a) how the meeting is run and b) why it’s being held in the first place. Many organisations run status update meetings. These can be, sadly, quite boring and disempowering for many in the room. That’s partly because these kinds of meetings adhere ‘status’ to people too. That’s part of what makes them soul-sucking.</p><p>WAO meetings feel qualitatively different. No matter what meeting we’re in, we bring our full selves to work and try to encourage others to let the masks slip away. After all, when we feel comfortable being ourselves, we’re more likely to contribute ideas and collaborate with others. This leads to a more productive and innovative work environment.</p><p>So how do you do&nbsp;this?</p>  Start with a check-in — how’s everyone doing today? Schedule time to allow people to settle in and let everyone else know what’s going on for them. Yes, this might feel awkward at first, but it’s an important norm to get into our working&nbsp;lives.  Use rounds —the norm in meetings seems to be a kind of free-for-all where anyone can speak next. This allows the loudest voices to speak the most, and some people never get to say a word. Instead, try an approach where at some points of the meeting, and particularly at important decision points, everyone gets a chance to speak or&nbsp;react.  Make things visual — holding everything that people have said during the meeting is conceptually difficult. Showing collaborative notes being taken on a screen makes this task easier. It’s even more generative (and fun!) to do it in a visual way using real or virtual sticky&nbsp;notes.  <p>If you’re not in the position where you’re running or organising meetings, then there are still things you can&nbsp;do:</p>  Be honest and transparent — share your thoughts and feelings honestly, even if they don’t align with the expectations or norms of the workplace. Authenticity builds trust and can lead to more productive relationships with your coworkers.  Embrace your unique perspective — everyone has a unique perspective and set of experiences that they bring to the table. Recognise and contribute your unique ideas and insights.  Practise active listening — it’s difficult, but really listening to others and acknowledging their perspectives is key to allowing everyone to be their authentic selves. You can do this by asking questions, demonstrating empathy, and reflecting back what you’ve heard people&nbsp;say.  Set boundaries — while empathy is important, there’s such a thing as being too empathetic. Set boundaries to maintain a work-life balance by prioritising your own needs and communicate them clearly to your coworkers.  Seek out opportunities for growth — “get busy livin’ or get busy dyin’” goes the famous line from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shawshank_Redemption">The Shawshank Redemption</a>. Being your full self also means being open to growth and learning, so seek out opportunities for professional development and take on new challenges that align with your values and passions.  <p>We spend a good chunk of our lives at work, so we might as well spend that time authentically. So, the next time you’re in a meeting or interacting with coworkers, consider ‘taking off the mask’ and showing up as your true self. You may be surprised at the positive impact it can have on your work and your overall well-being!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/bring-your-full-self-to-work-day-7efbaea914f1">‘Bring Your Full Self to Work’ day</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Best practices for enabling consistent, accessible and trustworthy data exchange experiences for all

<p>The Trust over IP Foundation is forming a new Interaction Patterns Task Force under its Human Experience Working Group. The mission of this task force is to enable consistent, accessible and trustworthy data exchange experiences for all. The task force will accomplish this through the documentation of best practices in design decisions for specific user-focused interactions and enabling both designers and developers to implement such decisions.</p>



 Why 



<p>The experience and security of any system operated by people depends on the information conveyed through user interfaces, the response of the users, and the interpretation of their actions. In the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/">Trust Over IP Stack</a> the critical interface for end users is at layer 2, where they interact with ‘wallets’. Existing ‘wallet’ interfaces commonly let technology dictate interaction sequences, default to culturally narrow mental models, and inconsistently represent key objects and functions.</p>



<p>Trustworthy data exchange is a foundational building block in the infrastructure of modern society—for it to function as a public good, it must be available and accessible to all. As such, the digital objects involved should be easy to identify, clearly communicate their boundaries and functions, and demonstrate consistent behaviour within interactions. Interfaces should make it easier for users to understand data exchange interactions and accomplish tasks whilst reflecting unique contexts.</p>



<p>Design principles and best practices, which the Interaction Patterns Task Force will deliver, will provide the guard rails to deliver humane, transparent and consistent software behaviours while allowing for a culturally diverse ecosystem to flourish.</p>



 How 



<p>The intended deliverable is a living repository of resources for the community that articulates clear principles on the social mechanics of trustworthy interactions, highlights existing standards and interaction examples, recommends research-backed best practices and identifies new patterns to unlock novel user experiences.</p>



<p>We intend to work in phases, initially focussing on identifying archetypal user journeys and the interaction patterns associated with the most common use cases. We will then begin to identify patterns transversal across different ceremonies and rituals, cultures, domains and contexts, adapting to differences in user behaviour and interactions across form factors and devices.</p>



<p>In our initial calls, we will be starting with show &amp; tell sessions where group members are invited to walk through product user journeys, beginning to map which flows and actions are most relevant for us to consider. We anticipate repeating this activity periodically, providing an opportunity for a diverse range of voices to share their experience and highlight challenges or positive outcomes in trust infrastructure interaction and user experience design.</p>



 Get involved 



<p>We welcome all experts in the Human Experience Working Group (that’s you), ethical design, consent agreements, social sciences, human-computer-interaction and interaction design.</p>



<p>More details are available at the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Interaction+Patterns+Task+Force">Interaction Patterns Task Force Wiki</a>, where we also store meeting notes and recordings. We meet on the 2nd and 3rd Thursday of each month at 17.00UTC. We report back to the Human Experience Working Group on the first Thursday of every month at 17.00UTC. Meeting details can be found at the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Calendar+of+ToIP+Meetings">Calendar of ToIP Meetings</a>.</p>



<p>We look forward to you joining us!</p>

     <p>Mobility is one of the core foundations of human civilization — expanding the range of opportunities to vast swathes of our society. Auto insurance protects the rights of individuals to access these opportunities while minimizing the downside in the event of an accident or natural disaster. Considering the importance of this function, this industry is highly regulated and places costly overhead looking for a path to transformation. The best way we can leverage technology is to address problems today and evolve them into a solution for the future. In this community lecture, we will look at the structure of the auto industry and how we can chart a path to transformation.</p>

<p>In just two weeks, the ban on SMS two-factor authentication for non-subscribers on Twitter will go into effect, a move blasted by the majority of the security community.</p>



<p>While Twitter CEO Elon Musk has defended the move as a way to protect user security, most leaders aren’t buying it.</p>



<p>“Just from a purely pragmatic standpoint, this is basically stripping away the lowest threshold of 2FA out there without any sort of viable or easy replacement,” Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance, told SC Media.</p>

<p>Due to rapid developments in both safe and harmful technology, cybersecurity is among the most volatile industries. However, we can still identify certain trends affecting the industry. From passwordless solutions broadly available to consumers, to the first real-life cases of automotive hacking, all of these are likely to shape the cybersecurity landscape in 2023. 2022 marks the year when the passwordless future idea experienced its first big wins, and 2023 is expected to be even more fruitful. Many progressive companies are likely to adopt the new passkeys technology, supported by the FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance. Tech giants such as Microsoft, Apple, and Google have already announced their commitment to delivering passwordless logins and even introduced their first efforts to consumers.</p>

 How can we make valuable experiences visible with Open&nbsp;Badges? <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/?s=experiences">Your Experiences have value</a> by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> is licenced under&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a><p>Doug Belshaw and I made a little talk for the <a href="https://werklund.ucalgary.ca/teaching-learning/instructor-resources/opened">Open Education Talks</a> at the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/">University of Calgary</a>. It is also <a href="https://oeweek.oeglobal.org/">Open Education Week</a> currently which means it is the perfect timing to talk some more about Open Recognition in education.</p><p>As an example we are talking about my five months of studying abroad at the University of Lapland in Finland. For me it was one of my biggest live experiences and I learned so much about myself, professionally and culturally. But in my CV or my LinkedIn profile it is just a sidenote without any&nbsp;proof.</p><p>The <a href="https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/">Eramus+ Program</a> has started to experiment with Open Badges for <a href="https://openbadgefactory.com/fi/webinar/case-erasmus-virtual-exchange/">their virtual exchanges</a>. But also the people who are going abroad can benefit from earning badges for their experiences. They are very individual and badges can help to tell a story in different ways. For an employer you might prefer showing the badges for knowledge and personal development but if you want to apply for another exchange you might prioritise showing the cultural awarness badges and personal development ones.</p>Example: my imaginary badge backpack for&nbsp;Finland<p>This excercise of remembering what I did in Finland and think of badges I would’ve earned was great. It is fun to go back to all these memories and I might design some of these badges further and issue them myself. Because this is the great thing with Open Badges, I can do this, I don’t need the offical program to do it for me. And over time I will meet people who can endorse these badges because they might see some of the skills and understandings that I gathered.</p><p>Interested in helping foster an ecosystem of Open Recognition?

   Stretching an analogy?&nbsp;Maybe.  Metaphors are powerful things. They can help people understand new concepts, and they can also help stretch our thinking about the art of the possible.  In this post, I want to use Sim City 2000, one of my favourite childhood video games, as a metaphor for Open Recognition.

 Stretching an analogy?&nbsp;Maybe. <p>Metaphors are powerful things. They can help people understand new concepts, and they can also help stretch our thinking about the art of the possible.</p><p>In this post, I want to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000">Sim City 2000</a>, one of my favourite childhood video games, as a metaphor for <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>. For those who may be unfamiliar, Sim City 2000 was a popular city-building simulation game released in 1994. In the game, players act as mayors of their own virtual cities, managing everything from zoning laws to infrastructure development.</p><p>You may be wondering how Open Recognition (and <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a>) is like building your own city? Here are some&nbsp;reasons.</p> Infrastructure <p>Cities need a strong infrastructure to be able to function properly. So do recognition ecosystems. Open Recognition is all about creating a system that allows individuals to earn and display recognition for their skills, knowledge, and achievements. Fortunately, we have the ever-evolving Open Badges specification which supports the creation, sharing, and validation of recognition in a way that is open and interoperable.</p><p>You can imagine Open Badges as the roads, bridges, and buildings that make up the infrastructure of a city. They provide a way for individuals to earn recognition and for this recognition to be displayed and shared across different platforms and contexts.</p><p>Sadly, real-life cities have often been designed by a certain subset of the general population and, as books such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Women:_Exposing_Data_Bias_in_a_World_Designed_for_Men">Invisible Women</a> point out, this can be hugely problematic. So too with recognition — how can we recognise people in all of our diversity?</p> Resources <p>When playing Sim City 2000, it’s important to balance the needs of citizens with the resources you have available. Too many people, not enough power stations? Uh-oh. (Weirdly, I was always obsessed about getting enough water to everyone, but that’s a story for another&nbsp;post!)</p><p>When building Open Recognition ecosystems, we need to balance the needs of individuals, organisations, and the Community of Practice in which they interact. We need to ensure that recognition is meaningful and valuable to individuals, that it meets the needs of organisations, and that it aligns with the broader goals of the community.</p> Zoning <p>In Sim City 2000 players must define different areas as ‘zones’ — for example, residential, commercial and industrial zones. This helps to create a balanced and sustainable city. Too much of one thing can spell disaster!</p><p>Similarly, with Open Recognition, we need to create different zones or categories of recognition. This can include recognition for formal learning, informal learning, and experiential learning. Instead of people’s LinkedIn profiles being just a list of formal qualifications and where they’ve worked, we can recognise people in all of their wonderful complexity.</p> Evolution <p>Players in Sim City 2000 must constantly adapt and evolve their cities to meet changing needs and challenges. One of my favourite things to do was to initiate a ‘disaster’ to see if my city could handle a UFO attack, nuclear meltdown, or a rampaging Godzilla.</p><p>It is a rare individual, organisation, or community that doesn’t at some point face some kind of crisis. Keeping up-to-date with a world beyond microcredentials is important as new technologies, standards, and practices emerge. This helps with adaptability and resilience, allowing us to find new ways to recognise learners.</p><p>There are so many other ways to take this metaphor. But there are also points of deviation. For example, a key part of Sim City 2000 is that you play in ‘god mode’ where you can do whatever you want and hang the consequences. In real life, we have ‘town hall’ meetings where, to get back to the metaphor, recognition can be co-designed with the people we want to recognise.</p><p>Just like in Sim City 2000, it takes careful planning, thoughtful design, and ongoing adaptation to create a thriving ecosystem of recognition. So let’s roll up our sleeves and get building!</p><p>Interested in helping foster an ecosystem of Open Recognition?

 New toolkit enables enterprises to launch a variety of applications for multilateral business processes, from 24/7 renewable energy matching to integrating distributed energy resources <p>Zug, Switzerland, 7 March 2023 — Energy Web, an independent non-profit accelerating the global energy transition with open source software, today released the <a href="https://github.com/energywebfoundation/worker-contract">Energy Web Worker Node toolkit,</a> a new technology that enables enterprises to construct distributed computing networks that securely execute sensitive business operations impacting multiple companies.</p><p>Worker Nodes were originally developed to solve a paradox that hinders advanced renewable energy tracking solutions like 24x7 matching and green electric vehicle charging: credibility relies on accurate, publicly verifiable results (e.g., proof that digital representations of renewables are not double-counted). But inputs from separate organizations, such as granular renewable energy production and electricity demand data, are commercially sensitive and need to remain private. Complex commercial, legal, and technical requirements often make it challenging for a single actor to unilaterally access and process all requisite data. The ability to establish a shared source of truth from segregated, individual information sources has been an ongoing challenge in multilateral settings; the challenge is even greater for energy market participants seeking to exchange and process granular data in order to procure services from distributed energy resources.</p><p>The Energy Web Worker Node toolkit solves these challenges by enabling enterprises to configure, launch, and maintain distributed computing networks that ingest data from external sources, execute custom workflows based on business logic, and vote on results in order to establish consensus without revealing or modifying the underlying data. Worker Nodes apply concepts and components from blockchain technology in a novel, enterprise-friendly architecture to provide all stakeholders with cryptographic proof that mutually-agreed rules and and processes are followed correctly, ensure computational outputs from business processes are correct, and preserve the privacy and integrity of underlying data for auditing purposes.</p><p>Worker Nodes are currently in production supporting several solutions in the Energy Web ecosystem, including:</p>  Conducting 24/7 renewable energy accounting by <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/case-study-24-7-track-and-match/">ingesting and matching granular electricity load and generation data</a>, ensuring that matching rules and preferences are enforced correctly, and that there’s no double-counting of renewable generation;  Coordinating dispatch of distributed energy resources by <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/case-study-project-edge/">enabling distribution utilities, market operators, transmission actors, and distributed energy resources </a>to exchange critical operational data that enhances each organisation’s ability to perform its function without revealing sensitive commercial information  <blockquote>“Worker Nodes are the single most powerful Web 3 technology for enterprise that I have encountered to date,” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web. “For a low carbon energy system to run, companies need to be able to exchange and perform computations on data from millions and eventually billions of people, businesses, and clean energy assets. Using a decentralized network of nodes to do useful work produces better outcomes than giving all that data and responsibility to a single&nbsp;entity.”</blockquote><p>Currently Worker Node networks comprise independent worker nodes, which can be implemented in multiple languages and hosting environments, and a governing smart contract, which collates voting results and publishes consensus results. <a href="https://github.com/energywebfoundation/worker-contract">The Worker Node repository is now available to the public on Github</a> containing both a smart contract and basic Worker Node template based on a 24/7 renewable energy matching application. This initial release includes business logic for 24/7 matching, enables users to authorize issuance of certificates, and allows users to set permissions for data input. An easy to use “as-a-service” version of the toolkit is currently under development as is Energy Web X, a new public blockchain for governing and securing Worker Node networks; both are expected to be made available to the public later this&nbsp;year.</p><p>The Green Proofs smart contract, part of the Worker Node Toolkit, was recently <a href="https://hacken.io/audits/#energy-web">audited by blockchain security auditor&nbsp;Hacken</a></p><p>and given a 10/10 rating, indicating the highest standard for blockchain security.</p><p>Interested parties can contact info@energyweb.org to learn&nbsp;more.</p><p>About Energy&nbsp;Web</p><p>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers.

 The Past Year with Verite<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>In 2022 Verite launched, laying a strong foundation for the collaborative work and opportunities ahead. This post highlights milestones reached as well as new  discoveries, research directions, and ongoing conversations.</p> Compliant Membership<a href="https://verite.id/blog/year-in-review-2023#compliant-membership">​</a><a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>We remain laser-focused on solving the use case of Membership Proofs. These proofs attest that a specific blockchain address has undergone a set of compliance requirements and this credential can be verified in a privacy preserving way that limits identifiable data either on-chain or on the open web.</p><p>Our research into this use-case uncovered complexity and diversity among on-chain decentralized applications and the varying degrees of credentials needed for these membership proofs. This led us to support parallel technical variations and form-factors.</p><p>The original architecture of Verite was modeled as a 3-actor system: 1) issuers of KYC status credentials, 2) end-users who directly choose to whom they want to show those credentials, and 3) dApps which operate their own verification services to receive offchain credentials, which, after validating them, pass decisions off to their frontends or smart contracts.. As part of our user research, we decided to shift from a 3-actor and add support for a 4-actor (see #2 below)</p>  Some consumers only wanted to consume membership proofs on-chain, emphasizing the importance of continuing to enable membership proofs on-chain.  Other smart-contract-based consumers want to outsource their protocol’s policy governance (usually based on roughly defined policies, and expected to be refined over time) to a single service, with an expectation of real-time monitoring and complete separation of concerns. Essentially, “relying parties” wanted a new, fourth actor (which we’ve been calling “verifier services”) to handle verification for them, and hand off decisions rather than data.  There was widespread acknowledgement that these services will need to be retooled over time as regulatory requirements and reliance frameworks evolve – policies enforced by verifier services needed to be changeable much more quickly than code deployment, and more often.  Nearly everyone we spoke with was concerned about centralization and silos forming, at the new verifier services level in particular. There is a deep, shared desire for services to be interoperable between end-users, meanwhile making the barrier to entry for running these services as low as possible, providing a larger and more decentralized on-chain customer-base.  <p>Previously, Verite’s designers assumed that on-chain activity could be gated by on-chain inputs or artifacts containing minimal Personally Identifiable Information (PII), with heavier PII contained in the off-chain Verifiable Credentials (VCs), but the further we delved into the customer requirements of on-chain platforms, the more it became apparent that this approach would not fit into the desired technical or business models better suited to the constraints above. Even if there was no Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in the Verifiable Credentials, there was still too much data, risk of potential liability, and custodianship of “data points” (if not of PII) for the comfort of some relying parties. </p> Governance and Compliance<a href="https://verite.id/blog/year-in-review-2023#governance-and-compliance">​</a><a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The role of governance in the system shifted substantially over the past year. When the work began, we thought Verite would only require a simple feedback loop between relying parties. We constructed a schema design for the contents of the Verite credentials which would be issued and/or validated by verification services. What we discovered, though, was that sometimes verification services were owned by an individual instead of by <a href="https://verite.id/verite/overview/architecture-overview">relying parties</a>), necessitating more complex governance frameworks for this growing network.</p><p>In particular, we worried that on-chain communication would be the hardest to align on given the business model pressures of this new 4-actor model. While "schema design", as we had been calling it, sounded like a relatively simple technical question of data modeling, it turned out to be a far more complex beast across different chains of reliance and architectural variants.</p><p>For this reason, less schema design happened in Centre-hosted working groups than we had expected. As end-to-end products continue to evolve, this kind of alignment could perhaps be premature, and many Verite partners have opted to defer this kind of harmonization until after there is significant adoption and traction. The schemas published so far are adequate to geographically-limited launches of the initial use-case, and as the sphere of supported geographies and use-cases expands, or as more players enter the space and demand grows for federation and interoperability, we look forward to truly viable self-governance. In the meantime, we will continue technical research and design work that falls into four categories:</p>  On-chain Design  Architectural Design &amp; Adoption  Technical Standardization  Additional Use-Cases   Ongoing On-Chain Research<a href="https://verite.id/blog/year-in-review-2023#ongoing-on-chain-research">​</a><a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>One of the most active working groups Verite hosted over the last year was the On-Chain Best Practices group, which zoomed in on the "last mile" between the on-chain consumers relying on Verite to deliver safe addresses and the off-chain verifiers handling all the messy details and off-chain data with privacy and nuance. This group focused on the subtle difference between Verification Results (verbose, subject-identifying, necessarily off-chain and archival for reporting and legal reasons) and Verification Records (concise, anonymized, essentially just a log entry or a pointer to archival results documentation). Only the latter can go on-chain, thus requiring enough detail for on-chain relying parties to act. The former, however, enables all the flexibility and nuance needed for a policy engine, a data translation layer, and a federation of competitors.</p><p>Two Verite on-chain researchers and a few academics cooperated on a synthetic comparison of architectures represented in today’s compliance market. Outlined and discussed at the 2022 <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a> (RWoT) conference in The Hague, these researchers produced a functional taxonomy for apples-to-apples and apples-to-oranges comparisons of various products and ecosystems. The result was a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/onchain_identity_verification_flows.md">thorough lightpaper</a> laying out where Verite fit in the broader landscape of on-chain identity with and without verifiable credentials. </p><p>Zooming in even more on the relationship between on-chain consumers and identity-enabled on-chain tokens, Keith Kowal from the Hedera-focused research team at Swirlds Labs wrote up another <a href="https://hedera.com/blog/the-rise-of-the-identity-token">useful primer</a>. It focuses on where on-chain tokens do and don't fit the "soul-bound" model for a "decentralized society," as well as how on-chain artifacts can and cannot meet the requirements of compliance in today's jurisdiction-based and centralized society of laws.</p><p>As products launch and evolve in the marketplace, this group remains confident that alignment on incrementally more technologically prescriptive guidance will be valuable, leading to shared interfaces and shared security models as federations form. For this reason, Verite's most active working group plans to keep meeting and designing on-chain registries and smart contracts across multiple languages and blockchain environments.</p> Ongoing Architectural Design<a href="https://verite.id/blog/year-in-review-2023#ongoing-architectural-design">​</a><a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The RWoT lightpaper linked above implicitly compared <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/onchain_identity_verification_flows.md#architecture-c-blinded-off-chain-proof-verified-on-chain">the Verite architecture</a> to simpler end-to-end products already active in the DeFi space today, but this comparison only works at a certain level of abstraction. Verite has actually forked into two separate-but-equal architectures over the last year and our collaborative research team works hard to keep feature and use-case parity between the two.</p><p>The original Verite design assumed an end-user either using two separate (an identity wallet and a crypto wallet), or a "fat wallet" controlling both a private and portable Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and one or more blockchain private keys. This defined our initial schemas, and the original Verite implementation guide imagines <a href="https://verite.id/verite/developers/wallet-guide">multi-chain Crypto wallets adding support for a DID</a> in much the same way they handle adding support for a new blockchain or private-key type to be able to handle private, DID-based off-chain VCs. This "SSI" (self-sovereign identity) and "Crypto" dual-wallet is a cornerstone of <a href="https://areweweb5yet.com/">the "Web5" approach</a>, allowing SSI for next-gen (and post-cookie!) Web2 use-cases, strong privacy and pseudonymity for Web3 use-cases, and even a few carefully guard-railed bridges between the two. While we fully endorse this approach long-term, we are waiting for more implementation interest and DeFi demand to further prototype technical artifacts for this “fat-wallet” architecture.</p><p>In the meantime, a simpler architectural pattern (outlined in detail in a <a href="https://verite.id/blog/verification-patterns-1">prior blog post</a>) emerged in prototyping work with Circle Engineering: an <a href="https://verite.id/verite/patterns/issuance-flow#address-bound-credential-issuance">address-based credential</a>, issued not to a DID controlled by a specific wallet client, but to an address (which might even be controlled from multiple wallet clients). This enables a different path to wallet support, piggybacking on the <a href="https://medium.com/walletconnect/walletconnect-v2-0-protocol-whats-new-3243fa80d312">WalletConnect version 2</a> upgrade cycle to get wallets implementing lightweight, "minimum-viable" support for verifiable credentials without the need to handle DID keys or complex VC-specific protocols.</p><p>In the coming months, expect to see the <a href="https://verite.id/verite/developers/supporting-wallet-connect">Wallet Connect</a> instructions on the Verite documentation expanded and entries added to other pages as more wallets roll out support for Verite credentials via Wallet Connect rails. This is a major ongoing research topic with Circle and WalletConnect, testing the hypothesis that thin wallets want to stay thin just as much as dApps wants to stay ignorant of the identities of their users (even in compliant products).</p> Ongoing Technical Standards Contribution<a href="https://verite.id/blog/year-in-review-2023#ongoing-technical-standards-contribution">​</a><a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>It bears repeating often that Verite is not a product or a solution, but rather a prototype and a "cookbook" for overlapping DeFi ecosystems. As such, a key design goal for Verite from the beginning was to invent as little new technology as possible and use standards-track building blocks wherever possible to maximize interoperability between competitors and sustainability of technical decisions, two crucial ingredients in any sustainable ecosystem.</p><p>Verite might best be described as a "protocol" in the technical sense: a new way for wallets, users, and dApps to communicate directly. Or to be more precise, Verite could be seen as a "profile" and sample implementation of the more general-purpose and open source <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange</a> specification at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>.  The nuts and bolts of crypto-wallet adoption, off-chain VC presentation, and signing involves representing VC use-cases at the Chain-Agnostic Standards Alliance (<a href="https://github.com/chainagnostic/casa/">CASA</a>).</p><p>The bedrock <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc">W3C data model specification</a> on which all VC work depends is currently being iterated and Verite plans to take advantage of new features and improvements with time. </p> Ongoing Research Towards Other Use Cases<a href="https://verite.id/blog/year-in-review-2023#ongoing-research-towards-other-use-cases">​</a><a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>While the focus has always been on privacy-preserving exchange of off-chain credentials to enable on-chain reliance, lots of doors are opened by the adoption of Verite building blocks for other credentials. We've discussed:</p>  <a href="https://verite.id/verite/patterns/travel-rule">"Travel Rule" use-cases</a> and the role of VCs in a more open-world version of today's VASP-to-VASP discovery and exchange protocols (led by Nota Bene)  "Heavier" credentials expressing not just membership but actual personal information for cross-organization de-duplication or identification, or in its more complex formulation, "reusable on-boarding" and "portable identity verification"  Identity assurance for verifiable credentials, leaning on existing Web2 trust frameworks or "holder-binding" mechanisms for ensuring the actual person identified and onboarded is the same person presenting the credentials later, whether they be "membership" credentials or those categorized as more high-stakes   Zero-knowledge mechanisms for generating a verification record in the wallet that can be sent to an on-chain relying party, which would bring us back to the fat-wallet, 3-party model  <p>Each of these directions presents new possibilities and venues for future work, technological and otherwise. There are no timelines or commitments in place, as how each of these research directions pans out depends on how the work done thus far finds its way to market and wallet adoption.</p>

Unlike passwords, the mechanism passkeys use is more sophisticated under the hood, though this isn’t apparent in the user experience; passkeys are actually much simpler than passwords to create and use.&nbsp; Dashlane has been at the forefront of passkey support since passkeys were announced last year. In August, Dashlane introduced integrated passkey support in our security-first password manager and unveiled the first in-browser passkey solution.</p>

<p></p>



<p>THE CHALLENGE:<br>Improving Employee Access with Zero Trust</p>



<p>When Cloudflare started the company provided its employees with access to internal applications via a virtual private network (VPN). Access to some, but not all applications behind the VPN required two factor authentication, typically done with One Time Passcodes (OTP) generated by applications like Authy or Google Authenticator.</p>



<p>Cloudflare realized that it needed a more secure and scalable approach than VPN and started a process of moving toward a Zero Trust architecture utilizing Cloudflare Access.</p>







<p>From OTP to unphishable FIDO authentication</p>



<p>As part of its migration to a zero trust architecture, starting in 2018 Cloudflare began its usage of FIDO based security keys.</p>



<p>The goal behind using FIDO2 was to provide strong authentication that would enable Cloudflare’s zero trust model.</p>



<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I wanted something that was unphishable,” said Derek Pitts, director of enterprise security at Cloudflare. “If we were going to go through all the trouble of redoing a lot of our identity and access management infrastructure, I wanted it to be future proof and resilient.”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>



<p>Overcoming barriers to adoption with selective enforcement</p>



<p>Cloudflare’s path to adoption of FIDO security keys was not an entirely straight path. Initially there were concerns around account recovery and replacement of lost physical security keys.</p>



<p>Another challenge was the fact that Cloudflare’s users were used to using OTP technology with Google Authenticator, or Authy. Managing user change aversion and education were key components in the switch from OTP to FIDO security keys. This led Cloudflare to a selective enforcement approach, so as not to force change on users that could potentially lock them out.</p>



<p>What Cloudflare did was to integrate FIDO into its access identity aware proxy that internal users used to access internal sites. Instead of immediately requiring FIDO for all internal sites, Cloudflare initially only required the use of security keys on three of its sites. Selective enforcement for FIDO security keys were activated on July 20, 2020, which is the day Twitter fell victim to a social engineering attack.</p>



<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“That day was mayhem and we wanted to ensure<br>that didn’t happen to us,” Pitts said.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>



<p>Pitts said that by requiring the use of FIDO2/WebAuthn for its three more most sensitive internal apps, adoption grew as it gave employees a training ground to get familiar with the technology. In 2021, Cloudflare made the switch to requiring FIDO security keys across its network.</p>
 



 
 
  
 


 



 
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
		
<p><br>
Founded in 2010, Cloudflare
is one of the world’s leading
internet content delivery and
security platforms.</p>
		
<p>Overview<br>
Cloudflare is one of the world’s
most deployed security and
content delivery platforms.
Cloudflare’s products include
a range of services including
web performance, application
network, zero trust and
developer services.<br><br>
Cloudflare’s network handles
over 36 million HTTP requests
per second and blocks over 124
billion cyber attacks a day. The
Cloudflare network has over
200 points of presence around
the globe.</p> 



 
“Selective enforcement ended up being a huge deal for us,” Pitts said. “That was one of the biggest forcing functions and things that made this project successful.”<p></p>
		
Read Cloudflare’s blog,  <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-implemented-fido2-and-zero-trust/">“How Cloudflare implemented hardware keys with FIDO2 and
Zero Trust to prevent phishing,” to learn more about their FIDO Authentication implementation.</a><p></p> 



 
 
 



<p></p>



 



<p>LESSONS LEARNED:<br>Take the small wins where you can</p>



<p>From the outset, the movement toward strong authentication had top down support from Cloudflare’s CEO, CIO and CSO. Pitts said that having the executive buy in was important as it helped his team to push through when it ran into issues.</p>



<p>Cloudflare has a large and complex network architecture and it didn’t move to WebAuth/FIDO2 overnight. Pitts said that it was a multi-year effort that was successful on the foundation of a series of incremental small wins that helped to prove that the technology can work to improve security.</p>



<p>The small wins approach incorporated Cloudflare’s selective enforcement approach. Pitts said that it’s important to have a training ground that will allow users to try out security keys and get familiar with the approach.</p>

Lynzie Adams, US Assurance Program Manager



<p>Kantara Initiative has been running identity assurance programs since 2011.</p>



<p>As the global leader in this area, we asked our current US Assurance Program Manager, Lynzie Adams, to give us her top tips for organizations wishing to apply for a Kantara Grant of Approval – particularly against the NIST 800-63 standards. Having worked with a Kantara Accredited Assessor, you will be ready to submit your application for final consideration by our Assurance Review Board (ARB) who review many different applications every month. We want to make sure that by the time you get to this stage, you have the best possible chance of Approval.</p>



<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the standards in detail as you may not be quite ready to submit an application.&nbsp; [link to See the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST guidelines directly </a>or <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download-category/service-assessment-criteria-sets/">request the Service Assessment Criteria</a>]&nbsp;&nbsp; Be self-critical: does your product or service truly align to the criteria?&nbsp; You may be able to refine your processes slightly to help move things along more quickly.</p>



<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="mailto:secretariat@kantarainitiative.org">Talk to us</a> before you consider investing! Our team can help you understand the full requirements, which templates to use (and when) and whether you may be able to refine some of your processes to improve your chances of success.</p>



<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus on your Service Description (S3A) as this is often the first thing our Assurance Review Board will read. &nbsp;The ARB requires a detailed overview of the service you offer. They don’t see all the materials you have shared with your assessor so they can only judge by what the S3A tells them. Be honest about what you DO (and DON’T) offer in the realm of identity assurance.</p>



<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your solution overview needs to clearly point to the relevant sections on the corresponding Service Assessment Criteria (SAC) spreadsheet. Make sure everything cross-references correctly. The ARB needs the Service Description (S3A)&nbsp; document to be clear and detailed for them to understand fully what your service does. Clear reference to the Service Assessment Criteria sheet will help enormously.</p>



<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide as much evidence as you can in the S3A to support your application. Can you add visuals such as diagrams or graphics as these often help the Assurance Review Board to understand your application better?&nbsp;Be detailed and don’t be afraid to share supportive graphics that might help support SAC conformity. The S3A is a confidential document that will only be reviewed by the ARB.</p>



<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not involve your wider colleagues – including your Communications team who will be well practised at writing materials for diverse audiences?&nbsp; They will offer a more “independent” view on how easy your application is for a reader who doesn’t know your solution. And, significantly, they will help pick up any areas of conflicting information so you can remedy these before submission.</p>

 Advanced Notice &amp; Consent Receipt WG 



<p>February 28 2023   Chair: Salvatore d’Agostino</p>







<p>On 20th February, our Advanced Notice and Consent Receipts Work Group (ANCR WG) celebrated the 5th anniversary of the publication of the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/7902/">Consent Receipt Specification v1.1</a></p>



<p>This is now an integral part of multiple ISO standards and has been adopted by developers and service providers around the world. We are currently extending this work to meet the challenges of an evolving, decentralized identity market.&nbsp; Our current efforts focus on providing an ‘Open Source Notice Controller’ credential which will include Transparency Performance Indicators (TPIs) to measure the transparency, privacy and security of individual data controllers.</p>



<p>This credential and its performance indicators are widely applicable across sectors but are particularly relevant to regulated activities such as banking, healthcare, and – importantly, in the case of automated decision making – to the use of AI in the delivery of identity and access services.</p>



<p>The work of the ANCR WG is relevant to several national and global initiatives including the CoE 108+ protocols for the protection of individuals with regards to the processing of their personal data, adopted by 47 countries including 28 EU members. The WG submitted comment to rulemaking at the US Federal Trade Commission and is preparing a response to the current Request for Comment by NIST on SP 800-63-4 Digital Identity Guidelines &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Open Notice Controller Credential and TPIs address key areas of interest to NIST including advancing equity. &nbsp;This includes expanding the risk management framework to measure the impact of digital identity adoption on individuals. It considers any equity implications in terms of individual control or increased risk exposure. The approach also provides optionality and choice with notice and consent receipts that can be used independently of service providers. Our work also helps to deter fraud and advanced threats through actionable co-governance that allows people to be involved personally in managing their data security.</p>



<p>Join us as we engage with innovators and standards setters in identity assurance for people. &nbsp;We welcome new contributors and participation in the Work Groups, it does not require membership in the Kantara Initiative. Visit <a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WA/overview">ANCR WG</a> or <a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GI/overview">Kantara Wiki</a> for more information.</p>



 Identity Assurance Work Group 



<p>March 1 2023    Chair:  Andrew Hughes</p>







<p>IAWG continues to bring together contributors to Kantara’s assurance framework which underpins the Kantara Trust Framework program. ID proofing&nbsp;and authentication&nbsp;providers,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;assessors convene to discuss, clarify and&nbsp;improve the framework documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At present, IAWG is focused on analysing, and providing feedback on, NIST SP 800-63 v4 draft.&nbsp;The four volumes of 800-63 are being updated, with potential impact to Kantara’s approved CSP vendors. We will assemble a comments package to submit to NIST for consideration, by the deadline of March 24th, 2023.</p>



<p>Later in 2023, IAWG will work on updates to our Service Assessment Criteria to match the updated 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines&nbsp;as well as initiatives related to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in relation to the Identity space.</p>



<p>If you work with ID proofing/verification providers or authentication/authorization&nbsp;providers and wish to gain insight into how those services fulfill requirements, please join our weekly calls. Just complete the&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/gpa-signup/?selectedGroup=12">Group Participation Agreement</a>&nbsp;to get set up.&nbsp;</p>

  🚀 Foundation News  
<p>Are you up to date on recent accomplishments of the DIF Working Groups? This newsletter covers the latest updates from Claims and Credentials, ID and Discovery, Secure Data Storage, Applied Cryptography, Sidetree, Wallet Security,DIDComm and all of DIF’s open groups.</p>
<p>We want to give a warm welcome to DIF's new Executive Director, Clare Nelson. Clare brings a wealth of experience to DIF and is looking to move DIF’s mission forward to “advance the interests of the decentralized identity community, including performing research and development to advance pre-competitive technical foundations towards established interoperable, global open standards.” If you are interested in participating in any of the Working Groups described below, please click <a href="https://identity.foundation/join/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here.</a></p>
<p>We also want to give a big thank you to our outgoing Executive Director Rouven Heck. Rouven has served as ED of DIF since 2019 and has done tremendous work in leading its foundation and growth.  Make sure to read Rouven’s latest <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/rouven-heck-welcomes-clare-nelson-as-new-executive-director-of-dif/">post</a> to review all the great progress DIF has made as a community.</p>
<p>Lastly, we are thrilled about an upcoming event. On Thursday March 2nd, DIF will be hosting a one-hour Ask me Anything (AMA) with Daniel Buchner on Decentralized Web Nodes or DWNs at 11am PT/2pm ET/ 8pm CET. There are still tickets available. Register <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ask-me-anything-on-dwns-with-daniel-buchner-tickets-543200957687?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here</a> while you still have a chance!</p>
  🛠️ Working Group Updates  
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">🛡️ Claims &amp; Credentials</a> 
<p>Presentation Exchange and Credential Manifest<br>
The Claims &amp; Credentials Working Group at DIF is excited to announce the release of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Presentation Exchange (PE) v2 specification.</a> Presentation Exchange enables a verifier to express to a credential holder (via their software agent, such as a wallet) their requirements for claims and proofs. This updated and ratified version of the spec includes a restructured set of core requirements, as well as an extensibility mechanism through the use of optional “features.” You can read the full press release <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/presentation-exchange-v2/">here.</a> Ongoing work on implementation guidance and test suites begins in March, and new contributors are warmly welcome.</p>
<p>The “sibling specification” defining <a href="https://identity.foundation/credential-manifest/v1.0.0/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Credential Manifest</a> (a requirement for open-world and widely interoperable Presentation Exchange) has also just been finalized as a WG-approved v1, so implementer feedback is warmly welcome (and required by the DIF Steering Committee for ratification!). Part of finalizing CM v1 was breaking out the ongoing design work on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/wallet-rendering?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Wallet Rendering</a> extension as an optional extension; this latter specification is seeking active contribution to join the v1 club.</p>
<p>Presentation Exchange, Credential Manifest and Friends meets weekly at 10am PT/1pm ET/ 7pm CET Thursdays</p>
<p>Data Agreement</p>
<p>The task force is developing consent receipts for Presentation [Exchange] proofs (which log signature of “data agreements”) conformant to <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/80392.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">ISO 27560 standards.</a> These provide a legally-grounded, verifiable, and immutable record of intended usage of data received, including data received in the form of Verifiable Credentials. Work is ongoing to create alignment of data agreement fields across vendors using ISO 27560 as a reference. They are also exploring potential interoperability events and test vectors for signing of data agreements.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the Data Agreement Specification <a href="https://hackmd.io/mX-SvRovRr6aeuMONApt3Q?view=&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">here.</a></p>
<p>Data Agreement meets bi-weekly at 7amPT/ 10amET/ 4pmCET Thursdays</p>
<p>Trust Establishment</p>
<p>The Trust Establishment work item is looking to output specifications, interoperability profiles, and reference implementations that help organizations assemble and maintain an ecosystem of trusted relationships and data.</p>
<p>The v0.0.1 draft sets out the core data structures that can be referenced in credentials. There's also been discussion with the Trust over IP (ToIP) Governance Architecture Task Force to make sure both groups stay aligned on the mechanics of how open-world or permissionless Trust Establishment mechanisms can consume trust documents from permissioned  governance structures, such as documents from <a href="https://indicio.tech/trust-registry-or-machine-readable-governance/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">machine-readable trust frameworks.</a></p>
<p>Trust Establishment meets bi-weekly at 10am PT/ 1pm ET/ 7pm CET Mondays</p>
<p>Schema Directory</p>
<p>Claims and Credentials has a work item for a schema directory and right now they have a survey out to understand what schemas DIF members are using with a goal of greater alignment and convergence. They are looking for more participation in the survey at this time which can be found <a href="https://forms.gle/Yzj9bYLXFLVdtDk96?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here.</a></p>
<p>Schema directory meets bi-weekly on 9am PT/12pm ET/ 6pm CET Thursdays</p>
<p>VC-JWT bi-weekly</p>
<p>The VC-JWT biweekly has been an occasional meeting place for DIF members to catch up on and discuss the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/vc-jwt/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">JWT work</a> taking place in the Verifiable Credential work group at the W3C.  This work on a formal standards-track document was discussed at a recent special W3C meeting in Miami. As an update, for the first time, there is now a native and more tightly-specified JSON Web Token (JWT) representation for Verifiable Credentials. This representation uses IANA-registered JWT claims whenever applicable, and requires no understanding of or reference to JSON-LD. Long-time DIF contributor Mike Jones offered <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2316&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">this summary</a> of the evolution of the specification.</p>
<p>The DIF VC-JWT discussions happen sporadically at the bi-weekly “reserved time” of Thursdays at 11am PT/ 2pm ET/ 8am CET; DIF members can inquire about vc-jwt issues and check for meetings in the #vc-jwt channel on DIF Slack.</p>
 <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/crypto-wg/blob/main/agenda.md?ref=blog.identity.foundation">🔐 Applied Crypto WG</a> 
<p>BBS+Signatures</p>
<p>Members of our Applied Cryptography work group have been doing a fabulous job preparing the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-01.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">IETF draft for BBS+</a>signatures which iterates the early DIF draft in preparation for the next IETF meeting in March. There is one new JavaScript implementation of the draft and the group is close to having a complete set of test vectors that will be cross-validated by multiple implementations (and hopefully be part of the new version that will be pushed to the CFRG working group at IETF before the next annual meeting).The draft is close to becoming quite stable. DIF Member Greg Bernstein has made a fantastic online application for people to test BBS+ which can be found <a href="https://www.grotto-networking.com/BBSDemo/https://www.grotto-networking.com/BBSDemo/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here.</a></p>
<p>More attendance, reviews and implementations are always welcome.</p>
<p>The DIF Crypto - BBS+ work item meets weekly  at 11am PT/2pm ET /8pm CET Mondays</p>
<p>Crypto Revocation Work Item bi-weekly</p>
<p>The group is looking for more participation at this time, particularly from potential implementers of low-level libraries for the novel revocation schemes the group has been researching and documenting. If you’re interested in contributing and helping to drive work on this, please reach out to limari@identity.foundation.</p>
<p>The DIF Crypto Revocation work item meets bi-weekly at 11am PT/2pm ET/8pm CET Thursdays</p>
 📡 DIDComm User Group: (Open Group) 
<p>For those who have been away from DIF for a while, the DIDComm “Unsyc” has now been reformed into the DIDComm User Group, which meets Mondays at 12 pm PT. The group is open and non-IPR protected. The group is currently discussing creating a DIDComm user guide in addition to a DIDComm testing tool, a training course, and a browser-based DIDComm-focused playground with the intention of helping the community understand and extend DIDComm v2. Feel free to join the group meeting or contribute to the discussion on <a href="https://discord.gg/8FB8c4FG?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Discord.</a></p>
<p>The DIDComm user group meets weekly at 12pm PT/3pm ET/ 9pm CET Mondays</p>
 🌳 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Sidetree Weekly Work Group</a> 
<p>DIF is restarting the Sidetree weekly meeting and the group is getting to work on bug fixes and specification clarifications/errata for a v1.1. Some features they’re looking to add to v2 are more human-friendly named aliases and more flexible cryptography support. Be on the lookout for a survey on what people would like to see for v2 in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Sidetree Weekly Work Group meets at 10am PT/ 1pm ET/ 7pm CET Tuesdays</p>
 💡 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Identifiers and Discovery Work Group</a> 
<p>In the Identifiers and Discovery work group there was recently a presentation by Christoph Fabianek about a DID validator called <a href="https://didlint.ownyourdata.eu/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DID Lint</a>  and <a href="https://www.ownyourdata.eu/en/soya/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">SOyA</a>, or Semantic Overlay Architecture. SOyA is a data model authoring and publishing platform and also provides functionalities for validation and transformation.</p>
<p>There has also been ongoing discussion about the finer points of rotating and revoking keys in DID documents, and how that relates to VC issuance and verification and the VC extension pattern formerly and elsewhere known as “holder binding”. The working group keeps detailed meeting minutes which can be found <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/blob/main/agenda.md?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here.</a></p>
<p>Here are the updates on the Universal Resolver drivers since December:</p>

<p>The Edelman Trust Barometer is a comprehensive study conducted every year since 2000 by Edelman, a global communications firm, to measure the current level of trust around the world in institutions such as Governments, Businesses, NGOs, and the Media. It usually generates significant attention and debate about Edelman and clients potentially deriving business value from exploiting the notion of Trust in managing reputation.</p>
<p>This article focuses solely on the results of the 23rd survey which was released around the World Economic Forum last month and the interesting insights it reveals, which seem to encourage business leaders to be the actors of change for trusted practices and technologies in a world where governments and their representatives have lost voters’ trust.</p>
<p>This year’s survey is based on interviews with 32’000 respondents in 28 countries. This time again, it shows how Trust is a complex and multifaceted concept, as opinions and perceptions vary among individuals, communities and countries. Trust can also be influenced by a range of factors such as personal experiences, media coverage or cultural and social contexts.</p>
<p>The backdrop for the report is 2022, the post pandemic year, the year of a return to normal life and economic rebound. To the contrary, we faced a Russian invasion of Ukraine, an Afghan crisis and an Iranian freedom movement. But not only. We also saw an increase in people struggling to feed themselves compared with before the pandemic, a worldwide inflation crisis as well as persistent droughts.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, a recent announcement by the CFF to increase the level of camera surveillance in train stations throughout the country, has triggered concerns and actions from politicians and citizens alike, fearing and distrusting a systematic spying in the public space whether for commercial or security reasons.</p>
 The collapse of trust in current economical contexts but businesses seen as most competent 
<p>What are the consequences of all that on the world level of trust? Let’s break it down.</p>
<p>First, according to the 2023 Barometer, economic optimism is collapsing around the world: in 24 out of 28 countries, the number of people who think their family will be better off in five years has never been lower.</p>
<p>Second, on a more individual aspect, personal anxieties and existential societal fears have become impressively high. Out of all the people interviewed, 89% fear to lose their job, 76% are scared of climate change and 74% fear inflation and its negative impact on their purchasing power. Sadly, fears of a potential nuclear war, of food or energy shortage, are not much lower.</p>
<p>The Barometer also reveals an evaporation of trust across most institutions. People persistently do not trust the media or social media which create even more entranched divisions. Trust in media declines in 16 of 27 countries. Trust in Governments and institutions declines in 14 of 27 countries.</p>
<p>The level of trust in the United Nations (UN) has also decreased in 21 of 27 countries and the current level is 59%, a 2% decrease compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>The survey reveals that trust in the UN varies widely depending on the region. The UN suffers from the lowest level on trust in the U.S. and Europe. But it reaches its worst level in Japan with 35 %! However, China, Indonesia, Thailand and India win the award of the countries trusting the most the institution (with a level between 78% and 80% ).</p>
<p>On the other hand, despite the criticisms it faced because of its initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN agency responsible for international public health, the World Health Organisation (WHO), becomes the most trusted global organisation in the world (67%). Its level of trust varies according to regions, its handling of specific health crises, political controversies, and media coverage, but it stays surprisingly high.<br>
Taking a closer look to the results, Businesses seem to be the only institution seen as competent and ethical (with the greatest trust increase in the U.S.) and Family-Owned Businesses are the most trusted of all. Trust in industry sectors such as Technology, Education, Food &amp; Beverage as well as Healthcare remains the highest.</p>
<p>NGOs and Businesses are seen as the most reliable source of trustworthy information, unlike Governments and the Media.</p>
<p>The report shows that in the globalised economy, trust is still very much local. We tend to trust people in our neighborhood, our local community, and our coworkers more than Government leaders, journalists or CEOs.</p>
<p>In summary, the Edelman’s 2023 trust barometer paints a complex and multifaceted picture of the current state of trust around the globe.</p>
<p>The continued erosion of trust in traditional institutions represents a significant challenge for leaders, policymakers and business owners. To rebuild trust and to rebalance a polarized world, it is obvious that actions, not words, and measurable results bringing a positive difference to the close nexus of human and animal populations as well as the environment, are now more than ever needed.</p>

  💡  Join our founders and core team for an <a href="https://discord.com/events/682786569857662976/1078046728349036564?ref=blog.ceramic.network">AMA today, Feb. 28, at 1pm ET</a> on Discord  <p><a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB</a> on Ceramic is the world’s first decentralized, composable graph database. With today’s release of ComposeDB Beta (v0.4), developers can easily build fully-composable Web3 applications on Ceramic Mainnet.</p><p>Combining Ceramic, GraphQL, and reusable data models, ComposeDB is a graph database that unlocks an interoperable data ecosystem for all applications built on it. It lets Web3 applications support data-intensive use cases like rich social features, identity and reputation, shared knowledge graphs, and dynamic collaboration.</p><p>Jump into the brand new ComposeDB <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?ref=blog.ceramic.network">website</a> and <a href="https://composedb.js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">docs</a> to learn more and get started.</p> What is ComposeDB?   📀 Powerful, decentralized graph database <p>ComposeDB is a decentralized property graph database designed for building data-intensive, highly-relational Web3 application use cases. ComposeDB’s graph database relies on popular GraphQL for powerfully expressive schemas, queries, and mutations.</p> 🪐 Composable data models and data ecosystem <p>ComposeDB’s ever-growing, interoperable data ecosystem makes it easier to build apps and grow them faster than ever before. Developers can reuse existing plug-and-play models from the ComposeDB catalog to bootstrap their app with all data that exists on the network. Every additional ComposeDB integration adds to the overall data available for you to use when building your app.</p> 🔌 Loads of Web3 integrations <p>ComposeDB is designed to play nicely with the rest of your Web3 stack. You can use ComposeDB with all popular Web3 wallets such as MetaMask and Phantom, along with other popular Web3 data protocols such as Sign in With Ethereum for authentication or Lit for encryption.</p> 🔥 Powered by Ceramic, now faster than ever <p>ComposeDB is built on Ceramic’s Web3 event streaming network, so you can trust that it is decentralized, secure, verifiable, and fast. ComposeDB indexes Ceramic data, improving query performance.</p> What’s included in ComposeDB Beta?  <p>The Beta release of ComposeDB includes all the core features needed for developers to build fully-composable Web3 graph data applications to Ceramic Mainnet. ComposeDB Beta (v0.4) introduces the following improvements over previous versions.</p>  ⏳ History Sync: History Sync brings full composability to ComposeDB, letting developers instantly sync the full history of all data associated with any model they add to their application  🔍 Query Performance: Server-side GraphQL query execution brings faster query speeds, more responsive applications, and better user experiences. It also makes ComposeDB more optimized to support popular GraphQL clients like Apollo and Relay  ✅ GraphQL Types: We’re continually adding support for more GraphQL data types. Now you can use <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides/data-modeling/schemas?ref=blog.ceramic.network#enums">Enums</a> and new <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/api/sdl/scalars?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Scalars</a> in your ComposeDB schemas, letting you write more strict or expressive models  🔢 Future-Proof Models: Model versioning ensures data models created today are future-proofed against changes and upgrades to the data models protocol in the future  📖 Updated Docs &amp; Guides: New <a href="https://composedb.js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB docs</a> make it easier to get started developing with better information, more examples, and detailed <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides?ref=blog.ceramic.network">guides</a> on data modeling, performing queries, and mutations  <p>During Beta, Mainnet applications will be rate-limited by default to ensure the network remains performant under load. Apps that have previously deployed to Ceramic Mainnet are not impacted by this. </p>  📧  If you need &gt;200 requests/second, email us at <a href="mailto:partners@3box.io?ref=blog.ceramic.network">partners@3box.io</a>.   Ceramic Upgrades  <p>The Ceramic protocol and network infrastructure have been meaningfully improved to support ComposeDB’s Mainnet debut. </p>  🔑 Self-Serve Mainnet: Developers can now onboard their node to Ceramic Mainnet in under 5 minutes without needing to contact any community members  ⚓️ Improved Anchoring: The Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) is responsible for finalizing Ceramic transactions by time-stamping them into the Ethereum Mainnet blockchain. This service has improved performance, providing more scalability and stability to the network  📌 Secure Pinning: A security hole has been closed, ensuring only node admins are able to pin and unpin streams on your Ceramic node  🛠 Improved Pubsub: Ceramic now works with a new version of IPFS Kubo, formerly named go-ipfs, to mitigate a pubsub flood issue with more proactive limiting. Thank you to Protocol Labs for helping us expedite this important fix 🙏. We strongly recommend this upgrade to improve stability, <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/please-upgrade-ipfs-to-kubo-v0-18-1/932?ref=blog.ceramic.network">see this post</a> for details on how to upgrade Kubo.  🚩 ComposeDB by Default: ComposeDB now runs by default on your Ceramic node. Previously, ComposeDB was only enabled through experimental ENV variables or CLI flags   Future Improvements  <p>Ceramic core devs are already working on supporting the most requested features and improvements. If something you want isn’t on this list, drop a post in the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/c/graph/9?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Forum</a>.</p>  Performance and Stability: Continual optimization across all parts of the Ceramic and ComposeDB stack. Particular focus on the speed of queries and history syncs as well as more robust network monitoring  Complex Queries: Support queries that span multiple graph relationships. This will enable developers, for example, to get all posts by anyone a user follows in a single query, to get all data for an account, or to query specific fields within a model  More GraphQL Types: The goal is to support as many native GraphQL data types and schema rules as possible, such as regex. The next data types to be added will likely be date and time scalars  Evolvable Schemas: Support the evolution of schemas over time to better fit the development flow of most applications that launch with something simple at first and then add or change features. Today, models are immutable and once they are created they cannot be changed  Model Catalog UI: A simple UI that makes it easier to find and use relevant and popular models, improving on today’s DX of using the ComposeDB CLI to discover models in the catalog  Deployment Scalability: Enable larger-scale deployments of Ceramic and ComposeDB to support applications that require much greater scale, reliability, and uptime than can be provided by a single node. This may include clustering to unlock stability, high availability, and horizontal scale   Getting Started With ComposeDB  <p>There are lots of resources to make it as easy as possible to get started developing with ComposeDB:</p>  Jump into the <a href="https://composedb.js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Docs</a>  Try the <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/getting-started?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Quickstart</a>  Read the <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Guides</a>    💡  If you've already been working with ComposeDB, see this <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/please-upgrade-ipfs-to-kubo-v0-18-1/932?ref=blog.ceramic.network">forum post</a> on upgrading to the newest Ceramic version.

 Energy Web is accelerating the European electricity market to enhance grid transparency and interoperability of clean&nbsp;energy <p>Energy Web recently participated in the European Commission’s consultation on <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13668-Electricity-market-reform-of-the-EUs-electricity-market-design/public-consultation_en">Electricity Market Design</a>. Some of Energy Web’s key messages in this consultation focused on what we do&nbsp;best:</p>  To enhance grid transparency and interoperability of clean energy assets, data and workflows should be harmonized across the transmission and distribution interface  End users should have the ability to independently verify where their energy comes from at a granular&nbsp;levels  <p>Our comments included the following:</p><p>Increased granularity for EU’s guarantee of origin system: <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions-green-proofs/">Granular Guarantees of Origin (GO) could increase legal certainty for investors and reduce greenwashing</a>. Increased granularity can improve Europe’sGO System as there is often no temporal and geographical correlation between generation and consumption events. It can also support an extended range of power purchase agreement offerings that could lead to further renewable expansion.</p><p>Flexibility Resource Registry: This concept is emerging as a critical infrastructure requirement for network operators to manage distributed energy resources (DERs) and unlock demand flexibility. Flexibility Resource Registries, developed either at the European level or national level, based on a set of harmonized rules and <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions-data-exchange/">decentralized, interoperable open-source architecture</a>, can provide transmission system operators and distribution system operators with access to a shared registry,enabling them to have greater visibility and access to services from customer-owned resources connected with their networks.</p><p>Distributed Energy Resources and Energy Communities: Harnessing demand-side flexibility from DERs and energy communities give grid operators new tools to balance an increasingly decarbonized grid.. Energy communities should not be limited solely to community trading, nor should DERs be limited to self-consumption; they should be allowed to actively participate in flexibility markets and engage in trading within and across energy communities.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers.

 Newly registered domain names enable small business owners to easily accept payments from customers 



<p>TEMPE, Ariz.,&nbsp;Feb. 23, 2023&nbsp;/PRNewswire/ — GoDaddy Inc. (NYSE:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/godaddy-launches-payable-domains-reimagining-the-domains-role-in-business-301754432.html#financial-modal">GDDY</a>), the company that empowers entrepreneurs around the world, today announced the launch of Payable Domains, which allow entrepreneurs to register a new domain and easily start accepting payments from customers. GoDaddy is the first company to seamlessly bundle payment technology with the brand power of a professional domain – at no additional cost – to help small business owners start growing from day one.&nbsp;<br><br>For more than 30 years, domain names have been essential to the digital identities of entrepreneurs and companies worldwide. Yet during this time relatively little innovation has occurred–– until now. Powered by&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3790836-1&amp;h=973874803&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Faboutus.godaddy.net%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%2Fpress-release-details%2F2021%2FIntroducing-GoDaddy-Payments-Fast-and-Secure-Payments-for-Small-Businesses%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;a=GoDaddy+Payments">GoDaddy Payments</a>, Payable Domains are branded pay links that create a secure checkout page, shareable via a link, that enable U.S.-based domain name customers to begin accepting payments shortly after they purchase a newly registered domain, even if they do not yet have a website or online store. Any domain purchased after, or for any existing domain owners, the respective Payable Domain can be&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3790836-1&amp;h=630591174&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.godaddy.com%2Fhelp%2Fconnect-a-domain-to-online-pay-links-41120&amp;a=accessed">accessed</a>&nbsp;through their GoDaddy back-end dashboard.<br><br>Combining the ability to accept payments with the credibility of a domain name enables small businesses to get up and running instantly. Small business owners can easily share their Payable Domain with customers through text, social media, QR code and more—and with GoDaddy Payments’ industry-low transaction fees of 2.3% +&nbsp;$0.30&nbsp;per online transaction, they will keep more of what they make.</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/lionsgate.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Domain_Chart.jpg?ssl=1"></a>



<p>“While there’s been innovation around add-on products for domain names, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3790836-1&amp;h=2892273127&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.godaddy.com%2Fdomains%2Ffull-domain-privacy-and-protection&amp;a=Domain+Privacy+and+Ownership+Protection">Domain Privacy and Ownership Protection</a>&nbsp;services, not much has been done to enhance the capability of domain names themselves,” said GoDaddy President of Domains&nbsp;Paul Nicks. “Domains have largely been used as a digital identity for businesses, but with this new commerce capability we view the domain name taking on a far more versatile role for up-and-coming small businesses. The Payable Domain ultimately serves as an innovative and cost-effective tool for entrepreneurs to accept online payments before even setting up a website.”</p>



<p>Now when a&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3790836-1&amp;h=661576838&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.godaddy.com%2Fdomains&amp;a=domain+name">domain name</a>&nbsp;is registered, its usefulness is no longer contingent on its owner creating a website and publishing content. Instead, domain owners can quickly start taking payments via their enabled Payable Domain. For example, if a person registers the domain of their name or business, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.roohshad.co/">www.roohshad.co</a>, they will then receive the corresponding Payable Domain, pay.roohshad.co, to accept payments. Once that first payment is received, domain owners can then link a bank account to their GoDaddy Payments account, complete the verification process, and receive payouts for transactions just as they would with any other payments service. Payments are processed securely and efficiently, with funds deposited into users’ bank accounts as early as the next business day.</p>



<p>In addition, small business owners can customize their Payable Domain with their company logo, product images, cost of their products or services, or other branded content to create a seamless checkout experience and maintain a personal and professional look.</p>



<p>“We’re intensely focused on building connected commerce solutions that make growing a business easier, whether you’ve just named your business or are in the process of expanding its sales across the country,” said GoDaddy President of Commerce&nbsp;Osama Bedier. “With Payable Domains, it’s never been easier to start selling online.”</p>



<p>Payable Domains is just one part of GoDaddy’s expansive push to provide businesses with payment solutions out of the box. GoDaddy Payments is integrated and easily enabled in a host of GoDaddy commerce products, including GoDaddy’s Website Builder, Managed WordPress and Managed WooCommerce Store plans, GoDaddy Point of Sale and more. This latest innovation strengthens GoDaddy’s suite of connected commerce tools that empower entrepreneurs with everything they need to start, grow, and scale their business.</p>

<p><a href="http://index.as/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Index.as</a> is a Web3 native, no-code, organizational and content curation tool taking aim at the content discovery space. It offers creators, curators, and topical experts the ability to create their own search ecosystems and independently control the value of their curation. The Index team chose to build on Ceramic's new decentralized graph database, <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB</a>, because of its ability to facilitate decentralization and support interoperable ownership and discovery.</p><p>Index.as is building tools to enable context-based discovery to become as powerful as social discovery. Platform-controlled content distribution purposefully inhibits cross-platform discovery and seeks to capture and hold hostage user attention. This limits users’ ability to discover engaging, interesting information outside of these silos, trapping them with the same or irrelevant content instead of revealing corners of the internet that pique curiosity and delight. Additionally, these businesses wrest value away from creators, concentrating power at the distribution layer. To solve these problems, Index.as set out to build a tool that helps builders, creators, and communities connect atomized information without creating another walled garden—opening vast opportunities for authentic content playgrounds.</p> How it Works <p>Data ownership, signing and authorization via DIDs and interoperability with shared schemas offered Index.as a reliable framework to build on top of. Indexes are schemas that represent context and become curated maps based on users’ tastes and motivations. They act as niche, topic-based search engines that are both searchable and filterable. For example, product curations are automatically sortable by price, brand, or event, and can be filtered by date, location, and other relevant criteria.</p><p>Additionally, it allows the product to index data from specified models such as profiles, indexes, and links and makes it easy to define one-to-many relations between documents. Every new element in an index (e.g., a product, video, or article) can be related to the Index document, creating a complete and interoperable graph.<br><br>You can learn more about how Ceramic powers applications <a href="https://ceramic.network/how-it-works?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p> Composability in Action <p>Index.as’s partners are collaborating on developing and reusing data models on <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB</a> (Ceramic's composable graph database) for a variety of use cases. Veeo is focused on an interoperable web annotation model to support knowledge mapping. <a href="https://www.csensemakers.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Csensemakers.com</a> is leveraging the aforementioned index schema to enable decentralized curation of scientific research.</p><p>Developers can access a wealth of data simply by reusing established models, all while keeping ownership, access and authorization in the hands of users. Veeo and Csensemakers are bypassing the time and resources required to build and maintain siloed data structures by collaborating across models built in ComposeDB on Ceramic, and are speed-running the process of building network effects by automatically populating their dApps with network data.</p><p>Index.as is excited to continue development, first with multi-user curation and role-based access control via NFTs enabled by Lit Actions and subsequently with private indexes, incentivizing creators and curators to invest in developing experiences meeting the unique interests, tastes, and needs of their communities.<br><br>If you're interested in building your application on Ceramic you can learn more <a href="https://composedb.js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a> or ask questions on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">forum</a>. </p>

<p>It is hard to imagine a world without passwords. They remain the most-used authentication method for consumers according to the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance’s annual Online Authentication Barometer, despite the fact that passwords almost universally fail at keeping accounts secure and preserving a smooth user experience. The death of the password will be a huge relief for users, removing the need to remember or type passwords and enabling better user experiences. For organisations, the upsides are just as powerful, with a passwordless future offering better improved security, reduced risk of data breaches and lower support costs. As we enter the new year, 2023 seems set to be the year when passwords finally become an endangered species.</p>

In any case, the tech giants, Microsoft, Google and Apple in the lead, within the FIDO Alliance, are doing everything to ensure that the adoption happens as soon as possible. To quickly summarize what we had already explained previously, authentication without passwords, or passwordless , has, as its name suggests, the purpose of allowing you to connect to sites and services without passwords.</p>

 We need everyone around the table to move AI principles into practice. <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/maroussia-levesque">Maroussia Lévesque</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/tom-zick">Tom Zick</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/dredeker">Dennis Redeker</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/you-jeen-ha">You Jeen Ha</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/florian-martin-bariteau">Florian Martin-Bariteau</a>, and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/mkortz">Mason Kortz</a> — inspired by discussions within the Rebooting AI Working Group at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp;&nbsp;Society</p><p>The White House recently released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/">Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a>. It consists of five high level principles and supplementary information detailing its relevance, expectations, and examples of good practices.</p><blockquote>We propose to build on the Blueprint, opening up the conversation between and across people working on AI governance from various&nbsp;fields.</blockquote><p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/about-this-document/">legal disclaimer</a> is careful to say that this is ultimately a non-binding white paper, so any expectation of binding legislation is off the table for now. The Blueprint aligns with a history of aspirational, yet mostly non-binding documents that articulate people’s rights and technology governance principles in the digital age. Such <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2687120#">Internet bills of rights</a> have been proposed by various actors including tech firms, civil society, and states. Even more closely related, documents outlining <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/42160420/HLS%20White%20Paper%20Final_v3.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">AI principles have proliferated around the world</a>, mostly non-binding and mostly as high-level principles.</p><p>Yet the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights stands out from other such documents in several respects. First, the document was drafted in a relatively inclusive one-year process, which has been <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/listening-to-the-american-people/">well documented</a>. Second, it adopts a civil rights framing. Civil rights come with a body of clarifying case law, enforcing institutions and mechanisms, and a shared vocabulary to articulate, contest, and redress harm. Third, concrete <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/10/04/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-key-actions-to-advance-tech-accountability-and-protect-the-rights-of-the-american-public/">executive/administrative actions</a> accompany the Blueprint. This signals a comprehensive governmental approach to AI policy that is often missing and may allow the Blueprint to percolate across the various nooks and crannies of government. Fourth, the Blueprint attempts to complement high-level guidance with cues for implementation. In our opinion, this crucial piece is often missing to bridge ambitious policy ideas to the nitty-gritty task of implementation.</p><p>In this post, we explore how to further specify the Blueprint’s principles into workable guidance for engineers and others on the ground. We propose to build on the Blueprint, opening up the conversation between and across people working on AI governance from various&nbsp;fields.</p> Now what? <p>The Blueprint provides an opportunity to further translate general guidance into technical specifications for industry adoption. While “plug and play” recipes are challenging in light of the contextual variability across deployments, academic and civil society organizations can play a key role in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3531146.3533091">mediating between theory and practice</a>. The Blueprint’s breath is vast, but two areas conducive to such specification are discrimination and explanation. In what follows, we propose concrete ways for multi-disciplinary groups to narrow the gap between high-level statements and implementation.</p><p>Discrimination</p><p>The technical companion to the Blueprint purports to provide concrete steps to move the principles into practice. Its section on disparity assessment suggests three types of metrics: demographic performance measures, overall and subgroup parity assessment, as well as calibration. While this is a step in the direction of more explicit guidance, it still leaves important questions unanswered for the technical community at the frontline of implementing protections against discrimination. To name but one obstacle, some fairness metrics are mutually exclusive, in the sense that satisfying them simultaneously is impossible when demographic subgroups fare differently. As the <a href="https://perma.cc/2WAM-7QPM">controversy</a> about risk assessment tools in the criminal justice system illustrates, equalizing error rates entails a loss of accuracy when the base rate differs between demographic groups. The devil is, so to speak, in the&nbsp;metrics.</p><p>There’s no one-size-fits-all answer as to what fairness metrics should prevail. But developing a common language to bridge high-level equality principles with the actual task of measuring a model’s performance is a good starting point. A shared vocabulary will foster transdisciplinary debates and avoid the proverbial two ships passing in the night. This is a two-way street: those with legal and policy training should strive to get a more granular understanding of the statistical theory undergirding fairness metrics, while technical experts should grasp the contours of legal and ethical implications. As examples of this sociotechnical approach, questions for further research&nbsp;include:</p>  What is missing from the proposed metrics in the Blueprint?  Which fairness metric is most compatible with legal obligations in a given&nbsp;context?  Who should make judgment calls about which fairness metric to constrain a model&nbsp;with?  Are the existing siloed institutions (e.g. developers conceiving models ex-ante; courts reviewing harm post-facto) capable of making such&nbsp;calls?  How should we (re)think the pipeline between the technical front-line implementors and external oversight?  <p>Explanation</p><p>Much like discrimination, the notion of explanation in a colloquial and legal sense differs from the technical conception. Moreover, explainability is subject to technical limitations that inhibit its efficacy in a multitude of ways. The implementation guidelines for the Blueprint bundle the notion of ex-ante and ex-post explanations.</p><p>On the ex-ante side, the guidelines prescribe documentation reporting “how the system works and how any automated component is used to determine an action or decision,” as well as stakeholder notification when the system has changed. Ex-post explanations are more like justifications. The guidelines state this “need not be a plain-language statement about causality but could consist of any mechanism that allows the recipient to build the necessary understanding and intuitions to achieve the stated purpose.” The guidelines emphasize the need for such explanations to be tailored to their use and validated by user experience research. That’s great. But how that plays out in real world systems can get complicated.</p><p>The guidelines correctly point out that explainability is an active area of AI research. This means that ‘explanations’ from AI can take a variety of forms, some of which may not comport with intuitive definitions of explainability. Some explanations can draw on the data used by an AI to reach a decision. Others are completely ex-post, meaning that explanations can be provided by an entirely separate AI system that has been trained to output explanations for the original system’s recommendations. In other words, one AI system produces recommendations, another explains them. Some initial questions that come to mind&nbsp;are:</p>  What level of sophistication do AI explanations need to reach before they can fill the role the Blueprint envisions? Which types of explanatory AI have cleared this bar (if&nbsp;any)?  What should be contemplated in ex-ante documentation given the type of AI&nbsp;system?  How much of the system should be described ex-ante versus how much can ex-post rationales be relied&nbsp;on?  What does it mean for models to be fully transparent?  How should techniques for ex-post explainability vary with risk&nbsp;levels?   Next steps for building on the Blueprint <p>Neither policy, law, or technical approaches alone can build on the Blueprint. Just like carpenters, plumbers, and electricians contribute to building a house, we need different expertise to come together. In terms of AI governance, this requires technical systems to surface facts for human oversight, rather than baking in opaque editorial choices that resist external review. Thankfully, we have references in adjacent areas on how to improve the interoperability between technical implementation and external oversight. For instance, <a href="https://datanutrition.org/">data nutrition labels</a> provide qualitative assessments to inform external evaluations of data provenance, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf):">model cards</a> foster transdisciplinary discourse on fairness by detailing salient model parameters, and <a href="https://cltc.berkeley.edu/reward-reports/">reward reports</a> do the same for continually learning AI&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The Blueprint provides a foundation for aligning AI systems with democratic values and civil rights and liberties, but it is ultimately up to all of us to build on that foundation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/building-on-the-blueprint-9471276f2cce">Building on the Blueprint</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What is the OpenWallet Foundation? 



<p>The <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">OpenWallet Foundation</a> (OWF), which <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-an-intent-to-form-the-openwallet-foundation">announced its intent to form</a> last September, formally launched today, February 23rd (press release: <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/newsroom/linux-foundation-europe-launches-open-wallet">English</a>, <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/fr/newsroom/linux-foundation-europe-launches-open-wallet">French</a>, <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/de/newsroom/linux-foundation-europe-launches-open-wallet">German</a>, <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/it/newsroom/linux-foundation-europe-launches-open-wallet">Italian</a>, <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/de/newsroom/linux-foundation-europe-launches-open-wallet">Spanish</a>). As an open source project of the Linux Foundation, the mission of the OWF is to develop a digital wallet “engine” that anyone can use to build secure, privacy-respecting, interoperable multi-purpose wallets. The OWF compares this wallet engine to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_browser_engines">the open source browser engines</a> that currently power all major Internet browsers.&nbsp;</p>



 Why is this important to the ToIP Foundation? 



<p>The mission of the OWF is highly relevant to the Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) since our mission (described in our <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">Introduction to ToIP white paper</a>) is to define a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust that combines cryptographic assurance at the machine layers with human accountability at the business, legal, and social layers.</p>



<p>In this architecture, referred to as the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/">ToIP stack</a>, digital wallets play a prominent role at the very heart. They are the tool that individuals and organizations—even connected things—will use to generate and store cryptographic keys, obtain and present digital credentials, make payments, exchange cryptocurrency and NFTs, unlock cars and hotel rooms, sign digital documents, and perform countless other digital trust tasks.</p>



 What does the ToIP Foundation expect to contribute? 



<p>Since the missions of ToIP and OWF are so complementary, the ToIP Foundation is joining the OWF as an Associate Member. We will support the development of OWF code projects by providing requirements, specifications, governance tools, and best practices as to how OWF code modules can accomplish interoperability using the ToIP stack. For example, ToIP deliverables immediately relevant to OWF include:</p>



 
 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack</a> 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Architecture V1.0</a> 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Metamodel Specification V1.0&nbsp;</a> 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification V1.0</a> 
 



<p>ToIP also has two task forces currently working on protocols that can be incorporated directly into OWF code modules:</p>



 
 <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force">The Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force</a> is developing <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">the ToIP Layer 2 protocol</a> that will enable authentic connections between any digital wallets and agents. 



 <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">The Trust Registry Task Force</a> is developing the protocol that any digital wallet can use to query a compliant trust registry for governance information—for example to verify if an issuer is authorized under a governance framework to issue a certain type of digital credential, or if a verifier is authorized to request presentation of a certain type of credential. 
 



<p>ToIP anticipates a rich ongoing dialogue with OWF as its coding projects implement ToIP specifications and OWF feedback improves ToIP specifications, tools, and guides.</p>



 Why another Linux Project? 



<p>The OWF represents the largest global collaboration on open source digital wallets since the emergence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">decentralized digital identity</a>. It represents an expansion of — and ideally a collaboration with — the Linux Foundation <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries digital wallet project</a> that began in 2019 and currently powers a first generation of open source digital wallets, such as the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/government-id/bc-wallet">BC Wallet</a> from <a href="https://bcdigitaltrust.info/">BC Digital Trust</a>. The OWF will also build on years of work on decentralized identity standards and open source code at another Linux Foundation sister project: the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF). OWF is a wonderful complement to ToIP, Hyperledger, and DIF as the LF projects working to directly enable a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust.&nbsp;</p>

 State-of-the-art approaches to cybersecurity awareness training are challenging the old employee education models 







<p>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES, February 22, 2023 /<a href="http://www.einpresswire.com/">EINPresswire.com</a>/ — CybeReady, provider of the world’s fastest security awareness solution, today announced the availability of a new&nbsp;<a href="https://cybeready.com/live-talk-with-the-ciso-for-the-city-county-of-san-francisco">on-demand webinar</a>&nbsp;featuring Michael Makstman, CISO for the City &amp; County of San Francisco and Michal Gil, Head of Product Development for CybeReady. In this webinar, Michael Makstman shares his experience of using positive training techniques, combined with advanced automation to motivate more than 30,000 employees to take an active role in mitigating cyberattacks.</p>



<p>Known for its progressive approach to deploying innovative technologies, The Golden City decided to shift from a legacy security training model to engage in a more effective employee-centric cybersecurity culture. During the webinar, he shares how a positive and more modern training approach, combined with advanced automation, now motivates over 30,000 employees to take a more active role in mitigating cyberattacks.</p>



<p>Michael Makstman mentions the primary challenges faced by CISOs today:<br>1. Understaffed and overburdened security teams with endless tasks, which are time-sensitive and essential for keeping the organization safe.<br>2. The focus of employees on their own professional development and KPIs who view cybersecurity training as a waste of time.<br>3. Workforce dynamics such as a high number of remote employees with high turnover rates which is now resulting in additional risk and uncertainty from new, untrained employees.</p>



<p>According to Makstman, “The role of a CISO is no longer limited to the technology aspects of an IT environment. Being part of a larger ecosystem, CISOs must be part of the business and understand employees and customers in order to make better informed decisions. It includes looking at business aspects, understanding employees, and understanding the potential ramifications throughout the decision-making process.”</p>



<p>When it comes to security awareness training, the CISO’s challenge is amplified. Cybercrime is escalating and so are the attacks employees are facing. Organizations must embrace change to address these evolving challenges, and create a new culture-based training.</p>



<p>To start building a cybersecurity culture, Makstman suggests the following:</p>



<p>1. Define your KPIs – Set measurable goals you can work toward and choose a solution that allows you to track progress over time.<br>2. Set employees up for success – Deploy a positive training approach with immediate feedback for maximum success. Training sessions should be short and embedded in employees’ work day to generate quick, rewarding engagements.<br>3. Communicate continuously – Conduct the training in ongoing cycles to create multiple opportunities for engagements and at the same time, yield multiple data points for adapting the training to each employees’ performance.</p>



<p>“CISOs today have a lot on their plate. Training employees can be a tedious task if the wrong path is taken, which often results in training taking a backseat to other activities,” said CybeReady’s Head of Product, Michal Gil. “Having a highly automated security awareness platform that communicates continuously and ensures progress is the preferred direction for CISOs today.”</p>

 Learn how Blockchain Laboratories is using web3 to bring more trust and better ROI to ESG markets, and how you can too. 







<p>SHERIDAN, WYOMING, UNITED STATES, February 22, 2023 /<a href="http://www.einpresswire.com/">EINPresswire.com</a>/ — In recent years, digital assets have emerged as a revolutionary new technology that is beginning to change the way businesses operate. Digital assets are a form of cryptographic token that can be used to store and transfer data in a secure, immutable, and reliable manner. The potential applications of digital assets are seemingly endless, and businesses around the world are beginning to adopt this technology in order to take advantage of its potential benefits.</p>



<p>An advantage of ESG digital assets is the efficiency they provide. By using digital assets, brands can quickly transfer assets and track ESG related data knowing that it is publicly auditable. This can help to reduce overhead costs associated with data management and transfer fees. Also allowing businesses to quickly and easily access and track their ESG data.</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/lionsgate.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/esg-tokenization-forecast.jpeg?ssl=1"></a>



<p>Finally, digital assets can also help to reduce the risk of fraud. By using digital assets, businesses can securely store and transfer data in a way that is nearly impossible to forge.</p>



<p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and its Potential to Conserve &amp; Increase Biodiversity</p>



<p>Also in the last few years, decentralized finance (DeFi) has come on the scene and is beginning to change the way financial markets operate. DeFi is a form of blockchain-based finance that allows anyone to access financial services without the need for a trusted third party. This new technology has the potential to revolutionize the way industries operate, and one of the areas in which it could have the most impact is ecological conservation and regenerative finance.</p>



<p>One of the potential benefits of DeFi for conservation and regenerative finance is increased transparency in carbon markets. By using DeFi for carbon credits, businesses can ensure that their financial transactions are transparent and secure. This increased transparency can help to validate ESG claims, and provide supporting data for ESG reporting.</p>



<p>Regenerative Finance (ReFi) and its Potential to Protect Biodiversity</p>



<p>And in more recent years, regenerative finance (ReFi) has become a trending topic to fund ecological projects, protect biodiversity, and to support regenerative practices on many types of landscapes. ReFi allows individuals and businesses to access ESG markets and services in a publicly auditable way. This new Green Finance model has the potential to have a major impact on biodiversity conservation and regeneration.</p>



<p>One of the potential benefits of ReFi for biodiversity protection and preservation is increased transparency through using digital assets and distributed ledger technology to track the whole lifecycle of eco projects. Another potential benefit of ReFi for biodiversity protection is increased funding going to the eco projects. By using ReFi, eco projects can quickly and easily transfer funds with minimal overhead costs and without any delays. This can help to reduce overhead costs associated with financial transactions, and create more funding for the work on the ground by making easier for eco projects to fundraise.</p>



<p>Innovators at the crossroads of ESG digital assets and ReFi PaaS</p>



<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carbonlanddao-trust-esg-nfts-protect-133000486.html">Blockchain Laboratories has been at the forefront of ESG digital assets</a>&nbsp;and the ReFi movement. Since April 2021 Blockchain Laboratories has been working on building Carbonland Trust’s carbon credit registry on the XRP Ledger. And although there have been setbacks to overcome that caused the development timeline to be extended, lots of progress has been made, and the carbon credit tokenization platform is scheduled to go live in April 2023.</p>



<p>And in more recent times, Blockchain Laboratories started&nbsp;<a href="https://blockchainlaboratories.com/blockchain-laboratories-announces-partnership-with-intrinsic-methods-to-build-carbon-credit-registry-on-xrpl/">building a XRPL carbon credit tokenization platform for Intrinsic Methods</a>. Intrinsic Methods Registry will use XRP Ledger to issue Future Mitigated Units(carbon credits) from reforestation projects globally.</p>



<p>In the near future, Blockchain Laboratories will be on scene at some industry events to network and share about the web3 platforms that were launching in the 2nd quarter of 2023. In March the events on our schedule are the Climate Summit in Denver on March 1st, the World Sustainability Summit(we are presenting here) in Dubai on March 16th-17th, and the World Blockchain Summit in Dubai on March 20th-21st.</p>



<p>Our goal in attending these summits is to share about what we have learned from two years of intense R&amp;D. And to showcase and bring attention to the ReFi Platform as a Service(PaaS) that we have developed over the last two years. We know digital assets and DLT have the potential to bring radical transparency to the ESG and carbon markets, and strive to be thought leaders in the industry.</p>

<p>This will be the last release before ComposeDB Beta goes live on Mainnet early next week. The <code>Model Versioning</code> feature provides backwards compatibility, even as future updates are made to the models protocol. The rollout involves a wipe of all models and ComposeDB data currently on Clay testnet, with breaking changes to model indexing and configuration table structure.</p><p>This release will allow devs to experiment with the HistorySync feature.</p> Model Versioning &amp; Table Config <p>The new table config structure includes a <code>version</code> field. Follow these steps below to update:</p>  Stop the node &amp; update packages  If using <code>SQLite</code> delete the existing database found at:   <code>~/.ceramic/indexing.sqlite
</code> <p>3. &nbsp; If using <code>Postgres</code> connect to the DB and drop the following tables: <code>ceramic_models</code>, <code>ceramic_config</code>, and any tables starting with <code>kjz</code>(the index table).</p><p>Example Postgres Structure:</p> <code> Schema |                              Name               |   Type   |  Owner
--------+-------------------------------------------------+----------+---------
 public | ceramic_config                                  | table    | ceramic
 public | ceramic_models                                  | table    | ceramic
 public | kjzl6hvfrbw6c8c48hg1u62lhnc95g4ntsl...vsbjtw374 | table    | ceramic
</code> <p>4. &nbsp;Start up the node: you'll see <code>ceramic_models</code> and <code>ceramic_config</code> tables be created as part of the startup message.</p><p>5. &nbsp; Recreate your models using the latest <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides/data-modeling/introduction-to-modeling?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB tooling</a></p> History Sync <p>History Sync enables developers to index models and sync all history for the model, enabling full backwards and forwards composability. History Sync will be run by default after the Beta release next week, but if you want a sneak preview, you can try out History Sync by adding <code>CERAMIC_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_SYNC='true’</code> when <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/set-up-your-environment?ref=blog.ceramic.network#run-a-ceramic-node">starting your daemon.</a></p>  ComposeDB Beta on Mainnet <p>Thank you for your incredible patience and excitement leading up to our Mainnet launch of ComposeDB Beta on February 28th. We are less than a week away! Stay tuned for more details.</p>

<p>What has your career journey looked like?<br>I started my career in media as a customer success manager, then got into media sales which lead to working in technology sales in business intelligence. From there I did some consulting and wound up in cybersecurity where I found my sweet spot: product marketing. From there I have focused on scaling and growing innovative technologies; AI and now digital identity. It’s a very exciting time to be contributing the to DI ecosystem globally.</p>



<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?<br>I wanted to be the CEO of a international marketing agency and a part-time travel photographer for National Geographic.</p>



<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>The barriers I’ve encountered&nbsp;are reflected across&nbsp;women in the tech industry:&nbsp;<br>1. Lack of mentors<br>2. Lack of female role models in the field<br>3. Gender bias in the workplace<br>4. Unequal growth opportunities compared to men<br>5. Unequal pay for the same skills&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>Working for companies with cultures that match my value work/life balance, turning off slack, and prioritizing my personal and family life after 5 pm (easier said than done).</p>



<blockquote>
<p>❝Creating an environment that encourages girls from an early age to pursue technology fields is essential in advancing their participation in the workforce.❞</p>
Alana Bennett</blockquote>



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?</p>



<p>Creating an environment that encourages girls from an early age to pursue technology fields is essential in advancing their participation in the workforce. Whether it’s donating to organizations, promoting young women in STEM, volunteering to mentor, or developing company policies that push for more diversity and inclusivity, there’s plenty to do to shape the future for many girls and women globally.</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?<br>Representation is a key step in creating an inclusive and equitable environment where all employees can do the best work of their lives. Today’s companies are well aware that women in positions of power can lead to more innovation and better outcomes. Organizations can develop meaningful programs to develop technical talent, which not only supports women but helps diversify‌ representation and ideas, which often leads to even more innovation. Internships or job shadowing programs provide a chance for women to gain tangible technology skills. Mentorship programs that help employees learn, develop, grow and thrive in today’s ever-changing environment.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?<br>Income inequality compared to male colleagues, workplace gender bias and a shortage of female role models are among the main barriers faced by women working in the tech industry. Women are often underrepresented in leadership positions in tech companies. This can make it difficult for women to advance their careers and achieve their goals.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?<br>Advocate for yourself, and know that reaching outside of your comfort zone with the support of strong mentors and a company that shares your values can take you far.<br><br>Alana Bennet is the Product Marketing Director at <a href="https://atbventures.com/">ATB Ventures</a></p>

     <p>This lecture took place on 15 March 2023. </p>
<p>While many countries are trying to meet their climate goals, and companies are embracing ESG by moving away from ICE vehicles, higher utilization of EVs has boosted the demand for charging stations. EV charging infrastructure development is making headway, CPOs, corporates and fleet operators are adding more charging ports every day, and the charger hardware itself is becoming more user-friendly and interoperable, but there are other issues that must be addressed. Among them, how to avoid stressing the power grid and reduce charger downtime are top priorities.</p>
<p>ASJade Technology’s smart EV charging solution tackles these problems with advanced hardware and management software, allowing EV owners to keep their vehicles charged while maintaining a stable grid, providing utilities greater flexibility during times of increased need. It can be particularly useful for companies that operate many EVs or communities that have many private EVs that need to be charged but not necessarily all at once. Future work includes vehicle-to-grid or vehicle-to-home technology that can allow certain EVs to transmit electricity back to the grid during peak hours, or to power a home during an outage. When combined with decentralized renewables-generating platforms such as roof-top solar power along with battery energy storage systems, this can make EV charging even more flexible.</p>
<p>Besides, as more public charge points and networks are available, the EV-drivers are left with choice paralysis when planning a long-distance trip such as driving from Nuremberg to Porto. EV drivers will need to investigate and install several parking &amp; charging network apps that could use different payment methods. The lack of interoperability and trust among eMobility service providers and charge point operators led to fragmented charging network. One of the potential solutions to overcome this challenge is to incorporate decentralized identifier and verifiable credential service that enabled by consortia or Federated networks such as <a href="https://itn.global">ITN (Integrated Trust Network)</a>.</p>

 Multichain Decentralized Knowledge Graph: AI-grade Knowledge Assets Hub on the OriginTrail Parachain <p>This blogpost outlines the next development milestones within the scope of the multichain strategy pursued by the OriginTrail ecosystem and amends relevant sections of <a href="https://origintrail.io/roadmap#turing">the roadmap pertaining to the OriginTrail Parachain development and its overarching role in devising a future blueprint for </a>allowing more blockchain networks to integrate the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph&nbsp;(DKG).</p><p>The OriginTrail technology presents a unique two-layer decentralized system, designed for sharing trusted data as AI-grade knowledge assets made discoverable across the Internet. The core component, OriginTrail Decentralized Network hosts the multichain Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), integrated with multiple blockchains. With each blockchain connected to the DKG, the DKG semantic features of Knowledge Assets are enabled on that particular chain.</p> AI-grade Knowledge Assets are a new, dynamic resource for the&nbsp;Internet <p>The next generation DKG V6 is following the expected growth trajectory, with OriginTrail Parachain underpinning its cutting-edge features. The key innovation V6 brings are dynamic AI-grade Knowledge Assets, with prescribed ownership, designed to drive unprecedented potential network effects as they gain existence on the new DKG V6. The AI-grade knowledge asset represents a leapfrog innovation as a new, dynamic resource on the Internet with the following main features:</p>  Ownership through the non-fungible token (NFT): Each Knowledge Asset is created with an NFT token (inaugurally on the OriginTrail Parachain), enabling trusted ownership of the underlying structured knowledge;  Verifiability: Each Knowledge Asset state can be verified using a cryptographic proof on the blockchain;  Discoverability: Each Knowledge Asset has its own Unique Asset Locator (UAL), similar to how websites have&nbsp;URLs;  Asset knowledge graph: Knowledge Assets have AI-grade data structure and their growing knowledge graph can be private and public (e.g. metadata/indexing data is always public, the rest of the knowledge can be kept privately), thus capable of powering AI and ML algorithms in a fully decentralized manner;  Composability: Due to their underlying vehicle — the DKG, each Knowledge Asset can be connected to others to form a connected knowledge about anything (scientific research, supply chains, value transactions, IoT data…) and establish an unprecedented potential for the value generation based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law">Metcalfe’s law on network&nbsp;effects</a>.  The anatomy of a DKG Knowledge Asset<p>You may learn about the growing number of solutions and industries that are being positively impacted by the knowledge assets&nbsp;<a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions">here</a>.</p> Multichain approach <p>The multichain approach, envisioned in the initial 2017 whitepaper, embodies the 3 key principles of the ecosystem — neutrality, inclusiveness and usability — driving the DKG expansion to blockchain ecosystems that benefit from the unique capabilities of the Decentralized Knowledge Graph.</p><p>With the recent launch of DKG V6 on the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot, the DKG receives an additional, tailored blockchain environment to both further innovation on the DKG, as well as to devise new means and approaches to expand the infrastructure and creation of Knowledge Assets on other blockchains (Polkadot Parachains and EVM compatible networks alike). The potential value of knowledge assets interconnected across blockchain networks integrated in the DKG, will grow according to Metcalfe’s law of network&nbsp;effects.</p><p>After DKG V6 inaugural launch on ecosystem’s own L1 — the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot, an important milestone was achieved, as this DKG-specific blockchain became both an AI-grade Knowledge Assets Hub for innovations in the semantic web space as well as an acceleration environment for developing new approaches for expanding the DKG to other EVM-capable blockchains (multichain strategy, starting with Polkadot Parachains). Each expansion will be decided within the OriginTrail community through an auction-like selection process (the blueprint to be rolled out in the<a href="https://origintrail.io/roadmap#metcalfe"> Metcalfe phase of OriginTrail’s roadmap</a>).</p><p>With <a href="https://teleport.origintrail.io/">nearly 85 million TRAC utility tokens teleported</a> to the OriginTrail Parachain (23% of circulating supply) to provide utility needed on the DKG V6, we now aim to address the following topics under the scope of the multi chain strategy within the Turing phase <a href="https://origintrail.io/roadmap#turing">of the&nbsp;roadmap</a>:</p>  Strengthening decentralization for the OriginTrail Parachain,  OriginTrail Parachain Token (OTP) availability,  OriginTrail multichain growth.   Strengthening decentralization for the OriginTrail Parachain <p>In the Turing phase of the roadmap, we will see the OriginTrail Parachain reach its maturity as a decentralized blockchain. This will be achieved by initiating the OriginTrail Parachain collators system, OriginTrail Parachain’s governance system and performing the sudo removal&nbsp;process.</p><p>Both collators and governance systems will be introduced through an RFC document open for inputs from stakeholders before their deployment on the OriginTrail Parachain testnet and mainnet. Both will also follow the good practices that we’ve already seen established in the Polkadot community and leverage some of the battle-tested components.</p><p>Successful integration of both components will be followed by the sudo key removal process, which will be detailed in the Governance RFC document.</p><p>RFCs pertaining to strengthening decentralization topics are planned to be released in&nbsp;March.</p> OriginTrail Parachain Token (OTP) Availability <p>As described in the OriginTrail whitepaper, OTP’s basic utility is to facilitate the transactions in the OriginTrail consensus layer (similar to ETH used on Ethereum). With the inaugural deployment of the OriginTrail DKG V6 on the OriginTrail Parachain, there has also been a growing need to access OTP to use the DKG v6 functionalities. Partially, this has already been addressed through the OTP bounty distributed during the TRAC Teleport process. Additionally, there are 4 other important developments coming in the Turing phase — the OTP sponsorship pallet, XCM enablement, OTP availability on Statemint (<a href="https://forum.polkadot.network/t/statemint-update-roadmap/1200">in line with their roadmap</a>), and Ledger hardware wallet support for&nbsp;OTP.</p><p>The OTP sponsorship pallet’s aim is to support the knowledge asset users by “sponsoring” the costs of gas fees for Knowledge Asset interactions (create, update, transfer) on the OriginTrail Parachain. By doing so, the core functionalities of the DKG v6 will be accessible to anyone even before additional options to obtain OTP tokens are available. The sponsorship pallet will substitute the need for a converter on the OriginTrail Parachain and will, before deployment, be also introduced in an RFC document detailing its implementation.</p><p>Another important milestone for OTP availability which will take place in the Turing phase is integration with Statemint via XCM. The exact timeline is largely dependent on the<a href="https://forum.polkadot.network/t/statemint-update-roadmap/1200"> Statemint roadmap</a> but is expected to happen in the coming months. This will allow anyone to obtain OTP on the decentralized exchange and transfer it to the OriginTrail Parachain using XCM to be used for DKG and OriginTrail Parachain functionalities.</p><p>Final availability milestone in the Turing phase is a dedicated OTP app on Ledger devices. We can confirm that through our collaboration <a href="https://twitter.com/_zondax_/status/1592173152364384256">with Zondax</a>, we have submitted the final version of the OTP app for review with the Ledger team. Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/origin_trail">our Twitter </a>for any updates on the review process timeline.</p> OriginTrail Multichain Growth <p>The fact that the OriginTrail DKG is a network integrating with multiple chains has already proven valuable for efficiency and resiliency of the OriginTrail ecosystem. With the launch of the new OriginTrail V6 in December, we are also turning a new page in the OriginTrail Multichain approach, ensuring that the Knowledge Assets and its functionalities can be accessed across more blockchain ecosystems.</p><p>Opening access to blockchains other than the OriginTrail Parachain will start within the Polkadot ecosystem (leveraging the core Polkadot capabilities), followed by possibilities of other EVM-compatible blockchains to integrate with DKG as well. In the Turing phase, we are expecting 3 important developments in this process — the conclusion of the TRAC teleport process, integration with the Polkadot Snowbridge system and detailing the DKG integration capabilities and requirements for Polkadot Parachains.</p><p>The Teleport process for TRAC tokens started last August and has so far seen over 84 million TRAC get transferred from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain (23% of circulating supply). The teleported TRAC tokens are used to fuel the DKG functionality on the OriginTrail Parachain and have been implemented as a native token on Polkadot, allowing it to leverage all other Polkadot capabilities (including XCM transfers between Polkadot parachains). Teleport will conclude on 22nd of March 2023 with a total of up to 100 million TRAC having the possibility to be teleported from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>Following the teleport process, there are no planned movements of TRAC between Polkadot and Ethereum until the Polkadot-supported <a href="https://docs.snowbridge.network/">Snowbridge infrastructure</a> is in place. Their treasury proposal suggests a Polkadot deployment of the infrastructure in July 2023, which would be the requirement for further integration with TRAC to take place with an RFC detailing the process available before that, in the Turing phase of the OriginTrail roadmap.</p><p>Finally, the Turing phase will also see more details on how the OriginTrail DKG can get integrated on other parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem, allowing the first wave of multi-chain network effects. While all the details on the approach will be available at a later stage, it is expected that the approach will leverage core Polkadot capabilities like&nbsp;XCM.</p> Towards a human-centric knowledge economy <p>With the advent of AI-grade Knowledge Assets as the new resource on the Internet made possible with the DKG V6, the potential to spawn a human-centric knowledge economy has become a possibility. Each Knowledge Asset gaining existence on the DKG is discoverable and verifiable across the universe of otherwise disconnected systems, which constantly expands the value potential based on the Metcalfe’s law of network effects and then materializes in connections generated to form connected knowledge about anything.</p><p>The AI-grade Knowledge Assets hub on the OriginTrail Parachain is now envisaged to spawn new methods to bring the powers of the DKG to other parachains on Polkadot as well as any EVM-compatible blockchain, furthering network effects across a multiverse of communities. Upon validation of each reusable component within the OriginTrail-specific blockchain environment, more Web3 teams will gain a chance to leapfrog their value proposition with these strong semantic web fundamentals.</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Join our mission</a> in making the global economy work, by organizing the AI-grade Knowledge Assets!</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by organizing trusted AI — grade knowledge assets. It leverages the open source Decentralized Knowledge Graph that connects the physical world (art, healthcare, fashion, education, supply chains,&nbsp;…) and the digital world (blockchain, smart contracts, Metaverse &amp; NFTs,&nbsp;…) in a single connected reality driving transparency and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Advanced knowledge graph technology currently powers trillion-dollar companies like Google and Facebook.

<p>The death of the internet password has been proclaimed many times, but this time, it may actually be coming sooner than you think. Its replacement? The passkey.</p>



<p>Passkeys are the way of the future in basic internet security as they’re intrinsically more secure and phishing resistant, according to Kathleen Moriarty, the chief technology officer at the Center for Internet Security. As major companies including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL">Apple</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL">Google</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;work with the standards developed by the FIDO Alliance and World Wide Web Consortium — two organizations that create password authentication standards — to provide support for passkeys on their platforms, the list of organizations offering passkeys as an alternative to passwords is continuing to grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Passkeys are an example of what security should be: seamless and invisible to the end user,” said Moriarty.</p>

<p>After the whole&nbsp;<a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2022/12/lastpass-says-hackers-stole-customer-data-in-recent-data-breach.html">LastPass</a>&nbsp;fiasco, many users are wary of entrusting their sensitive information to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/best-password-managers">online password managers</a>. But the era of password-protected vaults may soon be a thing of the past, as leading tech companies, including 1Password, are pushing for a new form of authentication technology that is more secure than passwords called passkeys. The company recently&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.1password.com/unlock-1password-with-passkeys/">announced</a>&nbsp;plans to support passkeys in the summer of 2023, allowing users to log in to accounts without using a master password.</p>



<p>This move follows the acquisition of ID authentication start-up Passage and the company’s announcement last year that users would soon be able to log in to apps and websites through its platform using passkeys. While 1Password already supports biometric authentication, CPO Steve Won believes that “For passkeys to be the way forward, it’s not enough for them to replace some of your passwords. They have to be able to replace all passwords – including the one you use to unlock 1Password.”</p>

<p>Internet passwords death may have been proclaimed many times before. But this time, with Apple, Google, and Microsoft going big on passkeys, you might soon have to say goodbye to passwords.</p>



<p>So what exactly are passkeys, and how will they make internet passwords obsolete? Well, there are many great things that this new technology has to bring to the table. And when it goes into the full-fledged integration mode, you feel old using passwords for your accounts. Let’s take a deeper dive to understand more about it.</p>

<p>We have increasingly been using applications on our mobile devices for everyday payments. In recent years, Apple and Google revolutionised the way we were using our phones for making secure digital payments, but without being aware, people had been using digital wallets long before then.</p>
<p>The beginnings of digital wallets were modest, initially storing different access passes, membership cards, coupons, or airplane boarding passes that still had to be visually checked by a human or provided a simple code for a machine scan. Nowadays, digital wallets are mostly associated with card payments and in some cases for managing crypto assets.</p>
<p>Use cases are however not limited to financial transactions. Developments of decentralised identity (DID) technology have expanded the use of digital wallets. In fact, digital ID is the foundation of all other possible digital services.</p>
 Digital ID is the foundation of all our future digital services 
<p>The web as we know it now is dominated by large platform-centric services (Amazon, Google) provided in exchange of personal data (Web 2.0). As the industry moves away from usernames and passwords as the defacto standard for authentication on websites and in digital transactions, wallets provide a user-centric approach for storing and managing private keys used for identification and authentication.</p>
<p>With the advent of verifiable credentials (VCs) as the most important artefact of decentralised identity, digital wallets can now be used to store and manage non-financial information, such as educational qualifications, professional certifications, and even government-issued identification. Verifiable credentials allow for the exchange of information in a trusted framework, between public administrations, citizens, and businesses. A recent study from Gartner indicates that over 30 per cent of national governments will provide digital wallets for identity for mobile phones by 2024. <a>[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials prove that “I am me” or “You are you” as the Holder. They are a digital version of a person’s identity card or qualification certificates, with all the entitlements that they may bring. VCs are digitally signed by the organisation or institution as the Issuer. Verifiable credentials are also instantaneously verified by third parties, be they governments or any other public or private organisation. Verifiable credentials represent every aspect of “My life”, — My Education, My Work, My Health – and can include my driver’s license, my diplomas, or my employment certificates. By storing these credentials in a digital wallet, individuals have greater control over their personal information and can easily share with a Verifier only what is necessary in terms of data.</p>
 Verifiable credentials reduce fraud and increase trust in digital interactions 
<p>One of the major advantages of verifiable credentials is the ability to reduce fraud and increase trust in digital interactions. Traditional paper documents are not only easy to fake, but indeed difficult to verify in online transactions, not to mention the very poor user experience with media discontinuity. With verifiable credentials, the authenticity and integrity can be easily verified through a digital signature or other cryptographic techniques.</p>
<p>Another advantage of this technology is streamlining processes like customer onboarding for online services. It follows the KYC principle, to automate and optimise otherwise inefficient and manual business processes. For example, in the onboarding process, instead of providing multiple forms of identification, an individual can simply share all required data attributes from various digital credentials in “one tap” which can be verified by the receiving organisation in real-time. This not only saves time but also reduces the potential for errors and increases security.</p>
<p>However, as with any other innovative technology, digital wallets also raise concerns about data privacy and security. Digital wallet providers must ensure that personal information stored in the wallet is protected against unauthorised access and breaches. Holders or individuals should be aware of the risks and take steps to protect their digital wallets and the information stored within, just like they protect their physical wallets or mobile devices.</p>
<p>The use of digital wallets for payments and identification is on the rise. We are witnessing how European Union is redefining its eIDAS framework with the introduction of European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet) which is intended to be used by all Europeans across the EU member states in both public and private sector as early as 2024/2025 <a>[2</a><a>]</a>. As technology continues to advance and is adopted by society, it is likely that digital wallets will become a trusted starting point for every digital interaction in our digital lives.</p>

<p><br><br>Dear DIF community,</p><p>After my 3.5 years as the voluntary Executive Director of DIF, I am excited to announce my successor Clare Nelson who has joined as full time ED as of Feb 1st, 2023.</p><p>In reflecting on our progress and development over the last few years, I am incredibly proud of the evolution &amp; growth we’ve achieved.</p><p>DIF working groups have delivered various well received specifications like <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1">SideTree</a>, <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2">DIDComm</a> v2 and <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Presentation Exchange</a>. &nbsp;We’ve incubated <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDAuth</a> which grew to become a joint effort at the OpenID foundation. Many of the other working groups are making great progress around core elements in the technology stack like decentralized storage &amp; wallet security.</p><p>Membership has grown from around 80 members to over 350 companies and more than 100 individual contributors. DIF has established itself as one of the leading organizations in the broader (decentralized) identity ecosystem and established strong connections with partner organizations like ToIP, W3C, OpenID Foundation, Hyperledger, etc. - and in various cases, established cross-ecosystem collaborations like the DIF facilitated cross-community Interoperability Group.</p><p>Motivated by DIF’s goal to increase global access, education &amp; collaboration, we established virtual events, regional working groups, and special interest groups. In doing so, we educated hundreds of new people about what’s going on in our industry, established a more permanent exchange amongst organizations in the APAC region including a <a href="https://identity.foundation/SIG-Japan?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Japanese-speaking chapter</a>, and created industry-specific working groups around verticals like <a href="https://www.notion.so/Banking-and-Finance-SIG-b2d528af578d44699aeb742ed47b81d2?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Banking &amp; Finance</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/SIG-IoT?ref=blog.identity.foundation">IoT</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/SIG-Hospitality-and-Tourism?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Hospitality &amp; Travel</a>.</p><p>DIF as an organization has also evolved significantly. Working groups are largely empowered to operate independently. A technical steering committee (TSC) has been introduced to ensure strong communication &amp; collaboration across these working groups. The overall strategic direction &amp; leadership is provided by the Steering Committee, whose seats are now filled by members based on a yearly election process voted by all membership organizations, rather than based on financial contributions to DIF. &nbsp;DIF has introduced a free membership tier to increase inclusivity for members around the world, and has grown the supporting team from none to three members, whilst becoming a financially stable &amp; sustainable organization.</p><p>As DIF continues to grow and the ecosystem matures, the need for a dedicated Executive Director to bring the organization to the next level has become clear. Over the last months of interviews, we found an excellent candidate for the role. Clare brings a lot of experience in leading organizations, a strong technical background as well as industry experience. I am excited to work with Clare as I continue in my role as a DIF steering committee member. Stay tuned for a welcome message from Clare in her own words.</p><p>To sum up: It has been an honor to serve as the ED of DIF. I am inspired by all we have achieved together, and the positive impact our community can have in the world. I look forward to working with Clare, and all of you, in realizing the very best of these possibilities.<br></p><p>Rouven Heck</p><p>Executive Director at DIF 2019-2023</p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p>

<p>Ceramic nodes operating on Ceramic mainnet must upgrade to at least version <code>2.20.1</code> of the <code>@ceramicnetwork/cli</code> package or the docker image before February 21st.</p><p>The Ceramic core team implemented the network's first hard-fork on February 15th. The team discovered a bug during post hard-fork validation related to an incorrect smart contract address. An immediate hot-fix was deployed to address the issue and will prepare Ceramic nodes to use the proper smart contract address.</p><p>As a result of the hot-fix, Ceramic nodes operating on the Ceramic mainnet must upgrade to running at least version <code>2.20.1</code> of the <code>@ceramicnetwork/cli</code> package or the docker image before February 21st. </p><p>We will continue to share status updates as we work on this via the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Forum</a>. </p><p>Update Feb 22: You might see the AWS error below while updating, please disregard:</p><p>"NOTE: The AWS SDK for JavaScript (v2) will be put into maintenance mode in 2023. Please migrate your code to use AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3). For more information, check the migration guide at <a href="https://a.co/7PzMCcy?ref=blog.ceramic.network">https://a.co/7PzMCcy</a>(Use <code>node --trace-warnings ...</code> to show where the warning was created)"</p> <p>Protocol Changes to Anchoring, Detailed<br><br>The upcoming ComposeDB Beta launch at ETHDenver includes HistorySync, the ability to sync historical data related to your models. Enabling HistorySync requires breaking changes to the Ceramic anchoring system.<br><br>There are two main changes we are making to the way anchoring (timestamping) works:</p>  Transactions to put anchor tree merkle roots onto Ethereum will no longer be simple regular transactions. &nbsp;Instead there will be an anchor smart contract and we will call an “anchor” function that causes the smart contract to emit an “anchor event” that ethereum RPC clients can subscribe to. &nbsp;This will make it easier for Ceramic nodes to discover when anchors happen and to sync the history of anchor events.  The second change is designed to make the system more resilient to block reorgs on Ethereum. Ceramic anchor commits will no longer include the specific blockNumber and blockTimestamp that the anchor event was included in, as it’s possible the transaction could later be reorged into a new block. Instead, Ceramic will only use the transaction hash and will look up which blockNumber the transaction was included in from Ethereum directly.  <p>Both of these changes require changes to the js-ceramic node implementation so that the node can still know how to verify and apply anchor commits with the new behavior. Nodes that haven’t upgraded will have failures when applying anchor commits.</p><p>Data update commits that fail to be anchored within the CACAO timeout period will then start failing to apply as the node will not be able to verify that the update was created during the time when the CACAO (the capability that gave the app permission to write into the stream on behalf of the user) was valid. This can wind up corrupting the state of streams and invalidating writes that seemed to be applied successfully at first, but then are later invalidated when their CACAO times out.</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>With a great sense of accomplishment, it’s exciting to share the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final.pdf">Digital Identity in Aotearoa: Identity and Trust in an Increasingly Digital New Zealand</a>&nbsp;report published earlier this month.</p>



<p>The report combines DINZ’s latest results from its survey of people and businesses carried out last year, with perspectives on the state of the growing digital identity ecosystem comprising local and international providers, government and business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ensuring people are delivered secure and privacy-aware identification, authentication and authorisation services, to support a trusted fraud-free digital economy in Aotearoa is the shared goal – and a complex one requiring a range of approaches as the reports’ recommendations make clear.</p>



<p>It also recognises that people have the right to choose a non-digital channel over the convenience of a digital one. Regardless, their personal information must be processed respectfully with the attendant care for security and privacy that it deserves. The concept of digital identity is quite new, with emerging tech continually fueling conversations to challenge yesterday’s status quo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversation at the AWS sponsored Wellington event last week was terrific and I expect similar at the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/digital-identity-in-aotearoa-report-and-research-results-virtual/">online event on 9 March</a>. Such a pity that the cyclone forced the cancellation of the Air New Zealand sponsored Auckland event but I hope that all registered for that can make the online event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No doubt not everyone will agree with everything in this report. But that’s why this space continues to attract endless, if sometimes circular conversation that remains the essence of its attraction – it will never simply be ‘done’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Please take time to read the report, form your view and share it with colleagues, iwi, hapū &nbsp;and whānau, to form their view as well as DINZ.</p>



<p>The conversation in Aotearoa will be all the richer for it.</p>

<p>In the next few weeks, the release of ComposeDB Beta will provide improved composability, usability, and offer more stability for developers building with Ceramic in production.</p><p>In September we introduced plans to build ComposeDB, a composable graph database powered by Ceramic.

Today Ceramic provides a protocol for decentralized event streaming to some of Web3’s largest projects, but after the release of ComposeDB developers will have more powerful tools to build applications across social, reputation, collaboration and database storage, in addition to Ceramic’s protocol capabilities.</p><p>Providing a fully decentralized and mutable data layer for applications solved the infrastructure challenges that many developers face; however, in order to help devs build data-rich apps on Ceramic and make the future of composability between apps a reality, Web3 devs needed more than fast write times and mutable storage within the network—they needed a product that could provide native query and an advanced property graph to map and manage the data layer.</p> Introducing ComposeDB on Ceramic <p>The core team behind Ceramic spent the past six months working with our community to build ComposeDB, the first decentralized graph database for Web3 applications.</p> Build faster <p>Historically, app developers must define the database layer from scratch for each application they build.

<p>The ToIP Foundation is pleased to announce the appointment of Judith Fleenor as full-time Executive Director. Judith is taking over the role that John Jordan, Executive Director of Digital Trust Services for the Province of British Columbia, has served in a part-time volunteer capacity since the Foundation’s inception in May 2020. John has been elected to serve as Chair of the Steering Committee.</p>



<p>Judith first joined the ToIP Foundation as Director of Strategic Engagements in May of 2021, a role in which she helped grow the organization to over 400 organizational and 100 individual members and coordinate the Foundation’s engagement at events including the Internet Identity Workshop, the European Identity Conference, Identiverse, and the ToIP 2022 Summit.</p>



<p>Judith recently sat down with John to have a conversation about her new position.</p>



<p>Congratulations, Judith. What was your reaction when the Steering Committee invited you to become Executive Director?</p>



<p>Frankly, I was surprised and honored when the Executive Committee came to me with the proposal. Titles have never been that important to me. I’ve always been about how I can use the skills I have and what I enjoy doing to help move an effort forward. One of my favorite sayings comes from Lao Tzu:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Go to the people.<br>Live with them. Learn from them. Love them.<br>Start with what they know.<br>Build with what they have.</p>



<p>But with the best leaders,<br>when the work is done,<br>the task accomplished,<br>the people will say<br>‘We have done this ourselves.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was an honor to be asked with a group of wonderful individuals who are all volunteering their time and talents to make a real difference in the future of the Internet. What could be more fulfilling than that?</p>



<p>What motivated you to initially join ToIP as Director of Strategic Engagements?</p>



<p>I have always had an interest in Identity and Access Management (IAM), dating back to my time as Director of Training Delivery Worldwide at Netscape. We were promoting the use of LDAP, and the courses we were giving on IAM made me quickly realize that digital identity goes way beyond the need for authentication and access. It is a very complex topic with multiple interweaving issues.</p>



<p>The reality is that the way we have been designing digital identity systems has not matched the way identity works in the real world, where we naturally share different identity attributes in different contexts. For example, in some contexts a person needs the freedom to be anonymous or pseudonymous, while in other contexts the need for individual and community security requires a greater ability to correlate.</p>



<p>As a result, the field of digital identity and trust is always interesting and challenging—even more so when you want solutions to be decentralized and vendor-neutral. It requires deep thinkers who look at problems from multiple perspectives. The ToIP Foundation is a place where these thinkers can collaborate to take on these tough challenges. As the song from the musical Hamilton put it, “I want to be in the room where it happens.”</p>



<p>What resonates with you about the mission of the Foundation?</p>



<p>The mission of the Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) is to simplify and standardize how trust is established over digital networks and using digital tools. Our goal is to achieve this by bringing together (and developing when necessary) robust, common standards into a complete architecture for internet-scale digital trust.</p>



<p>While it is easy to state that mission, it is anything but easy to execute on it. It takes a high-functioning collaborative community to get it right. Very few of the protocols within the ToIP stack will be developed within the ToIP Foundation. Some are being developed at the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), some at W3C, some at other standards development organizations. Some will be nurtured by multinational organizations, others by open source projects, others by entrepreneurs as yet unknown.</p>



<p>I think the part of the ToIP stack that most resonates with me is the central piece, the concept of a <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">trust spanning protocol</a> that can be used by other higher-level protocols for many different trust tasks, yet works across ecosystems built for different purposes. This is just like how the Internet Protocol works everywhere, yet supports many other higher-level protocols built for many different purposes.</p>



<p>This means we need the equivalent of an IP address, but for digital trust relationships—which is what the trust spanning protocol will provide. Note that I use the term “digital trust”, not “digital identity”, because when we say “digital identity” we most often think of humans, whereas the ToIP stack needs to work not only for people and organizations—in all their complexity—but for objects and data as well.</p>



<p>What are your top three priorities for 2023 in your new role?</p>



<p>Collaboration, Collaboration, Collaboration!</p>



<p>Seriously—the challenges we are trying to solve at the ToIP Foundation all require collaboration at three levels:</p>



 
 Collaboration between different working groups and task forces within ToIP itself. I want to work with our members and Linux Foundation experts to create better processes to facilitate that collaboration. 



 Collaboration across the various communities and foundations in the digital identity, credentialing, and business transactions space. I’d like to help reduce marketplace confusion about who is working on what, iron out differences, and focus on crossover work efforts. 



 Collaboration with government(s) to help educate and influence the adoption of decentralized digital trust infrastructure. For example, when governments begin issuing verifiable digital credentials that citizens can use to prove their identity – as digital versions of the same documents every government does for its citizens today in physical form, it has the potential to streamline and strengthen processes, while providing cost saving and added security. It’s no coincidence, John, that you are leading just such an <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023CITZ0003-000076">effort in British Columbia right now</a>. John, you are forging a path for your Canadian citizens that has the citizens’ best interest in mind. I want ToIP to be a resource for governments everywhere to understand that not all verifiable credentials methodologies are the same and that the choice they are making now, have long range implications. As governments roll out their solutions, it will be a massive boost to adoption. We need to help governments understand the implication of the decisions they are making to allow them to make the best decisions now. 
 



<p>How can potential collaborators get in touch with you to follow up?</p>



<p>One of the benefits of being Executive Director of an international non-profit organization is that it is very easy to reach out to me. You can fill out the contact form at our website, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">trustoverip.org</a>. I get copied on all of those. I’ll try to reply to your message as soon as I can. If you are already a member of ToiP, just send me a direct message via our Slack workspace.</p>

<p>Are you a civil society organisation or collective working within or with the health sector? Are you thinking about ways to collect, manage and store data more efficiently and securely? Are you looking to strengthen your organisation’s capacity around responsible data practices? Please read on, our Light Touch Support programme might be a great fit for you!</p>



<p></p>



 How we can support you 



<p>One of our goals for the year is to increase our offer of support to organisations working at the intersection of health and social justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">Light Touch Support</a> (LiTS) programme, we offer lightweight, pro bono support to organisations and individuals with questions about using data or technology in their social justice work. We work with a wide array of individuals and organisations, usually from within Latin America and Africa, most of whom work on some aspect of social justice. Our partners’ technical backgrounds are as varied as the work they do – some are looking for specific, technical advice on their projects, while others want to get more familiar with broader conversations around using data or technology in their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the beginning of a LiTS partnership, we connect with our partners to learn more about their work and understand the challenges they are facing. We then devise a support plan – the exact shape can vary and depends on the identified needs and context, but it often includes a mix of knowledge sharing, provision of technical feedback, drawing specific recommendations, facilitating connections to other organisations or experts, and sharing useful research, tools or resources.</p>



 Supporting organisations working on health and social justice&nbsp; 



<p>Organisations working at the intersection of health and social justice collect, manage and store a lot of data through community health projects, research programs and advocacy campaigns, and a significant portion of that data is often sensitive data that needs to be protected. Many organisations that reach out to us are interested in expanding&nbsp; capacity and expertise to securely and responsibly collect, manage and store data, particularly sensitive data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data collected from civil society has the potential to complement and enhance official state data collected by National Statistical Offices (NSOs) on various pandemics and epidemics such as HIV, TB and COVID-19 and their impact on marginalised groups. The repercussions of those pandemics have contributed to broader conversations around data and public health, such as:</p>



 
 Advocating for health data that is inclusive: Who is not being counted and who is left behind as a result? 



 Investigating how data is being used and managed: Who has control over our data and what is it being used for? 



 Learning about the risks associated with data: Can health data be used to abuse marginalised and vulnerable populations? 
 



<p>For many organisations, these conversations have sparked reflections at the organisational level and, through our work, we see that many groups working at the intersection of health and social justice are grappling with questions such as:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Are the ways we collect, share and store data and information that are more secure and more responsible? 



 How can we decide on what data to keep, and which one to delete? 



 How can I explore if there’s a risk for our data to be accessed by unauthorised external parties?&nbsp; 



 How are the ways we use data impacting our work? 



 Are the digital platforms we use safe and effective for our context?&nbsp; 
 



<p>We support our partners by providing space to reflect on these questions, and offer tailored resources to strengthen organisations’ data practices and processes. </p>


 
<a href="https://calendly.com/the-engine-room"></a> 


<p>What do we mean by organisations working at the intersection of health and social justice?<br>By organisations working at the intersection of health and social justice, we are referring to civil society organisations working in the health sector in various ways, such as: advocating for access to care, addressing health inequities, influencing public health policy, providing support and care to beneficiaries, etc. This broad category can also include:<br><br>– Organisations focusing on specific health issues (such as HIV, TB, Malaria, or COVID-19),&nbsp; at a policy and/or advocacy level.<br>– Organisations promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and/or reproductive justice.<br>– Organisations working on human rights issues that involve a health component, such as LGBTQ+ organisations addressing mental health issues, trans organisations advocating for access to gender affirming therapy, youth organisations promoting access to sexual and reproductive health services for young people, and more.<br>– Organisations directly providing specific health services to communities.</p>



 Going beyond Light-Touch Support 



<p>Once your organisation has <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">engag</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">e</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">d with our Light Touch Support</a> multiple times, and it seems like you and your work might be a good potential fit for more intensive support, we may propose an exploratory call to discuss <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/" title="">Matchbox-partnership</a> possibilities.</p>



<p>Through our Matchbox Programme, we support selected organisations, over a period of 6 – 8 months, to think through the design, development and implementation of their data and tech project or general strategy – customising the support to the specific needs and contexts of our partners. Matchbox support can include targeted research, matchmaking with other organisations, and tailored recommendations.</p>

 “INEEXS” project leverages digital technology to create new business models for utilities and energy service companies <p>ZUG, Switzerland, 14 February 2023 — Energy Web has joined a new, EU-funded initiative to enhance the value of energy efficiency solutions across Europe. The initiative, “Innovative Energy Efficiency Service Models for Sector Integration via Blockchain’’ or INEEXS, is primarily focused on improving the business case for energy efficiency with the help of open source digital technologies. To do so, INEEXS will enable market participants to exchange granular building, asset, and organizational data in a secure, privacy-preserving way. Solutions under the initiative will be deployed in Germany, Spain, Greece and one additional EU member country to be selected during the deployment process.</p><p>Energy efficiency and demand flexibility solutions continue to follow a positive growth trajectory across Europe. However, a series of technical barriers and regulatory challenges prevent these solutions from being adopted at the scale needed to facilitate the European Union’s transition towards a clean energy economy. INEEXS is primarily focused on overcoming technical barriers to progress by enabling energy service companies, retailers, distribution system operators, financial institutions, and distributed energy resource aggregators to exchange trusted data from organizations and&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Over the next three years, the initiative will launch new technology and associated business models in support of this objective. As a first step, INEEXS will analyze five primary energy efficiency business cases, their legal requirements, cost structures, revenue streams, and benefits beyond cost savings in order to prioritize technology development activities under the initiative.</p><blockquote>“We couldn’t be more excited to bring our open source technology stack to this initiative” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web. “Energy Web solutions are designed to support this exact use case — enabling multiple market participants, each with their own information technology systems to exchange and trust granular data — in this case data powering energy efficiency solutions across&nbsp;Europe.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Elaborating innovative and fitting business models by active market participants is pivotal if we are to address the existential challenge of transforming the energy system”. Explains Filippos Anagnostopoulos, Senior Associate at IEECP and Project Coordinator. “The INEEXS project offers a unique opportunity to energy retailers, energy communities, technology developers, energy agencies and real estate companies to validate, replicate, adopt and roll concrete technical solutions with potentially transformative impact.”</blockquote><p>By adopting new digital technologies, methods, and tools to enable automated, accurate, fast and secure data exchange, INEEXS meets the key principles of the European Green Deal; More information can be found on the project webpage: <a href="https://ieecp.org/projects/ineexs/">https://ieecp.org/projects/ineexs/</a></p><p>Partners: IEECP — Institute For European Energy And Climate Policy (the Netherlands), HERON — Iron Thermoilektriki Anonymi Etaireia (Greece), NTUA — National Technical University of Athens (Greece), ESCAN (Spain), ENERCOOP- Cooperativa Electrica Benefica San Francisco De Asis Sociedad Cooperativa Valenciana (Spain), DOMX (Greece), VL — Verdia Legal (Spain), BEA — Berliner Energieagentur (Germany), OFFIS (Germany), Inlecom Group (Belgium), HIVEN (Finland), Energy Web Foundation (Switzerland).</p><p>Co-funded by the European Union under project ID101077033.

 The release of Energy Web’s Decentralized Data Hub on Microsoft’s Azure Marketplace significantly improves user experience for enterprise <p>ZUG, Switzerland — 13 February 2023 — <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-2022-lookback-navigating-the-storm-before-the-calm-9b056e02d8dc">2022 was a major turning point</a> for Energy Web. Whereas in the past much of our effort was devoted to innovation and experimentation, last year our focus shifted entirely to execution–specifically, delivering new features and functionalities across three core solutions.</p><p>We, and our community of enterprise members, are now crystal clear about what <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/what-we-do-the-grid/">problems we solve</a> and how our open-source software solutions create tangible business value. The question is no longer what we’re going to build, but how to streamline implementation.</p><p>As demonstrated by many other software categories with huge addressable markets, the best way to scale adoption and impact is to make our solutions available on-demand, with the click of a button. Or in other words, make EW-DOS look and feel like conventional enterprise Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).</p><p>In December we took the first step in this direction with the release of <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-now-available-on-amazon-9bb6c65375ca">RPC on AWS Marketplace</a>. Today we’re pleased to announce another step forward with the r<a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/energywebdevhubgmbh1670375546257.ewf-data-exchange-client-gateway?tab=Overview">elease of Data Exchange client gateway on the Azure Marketplace</a>. This is an important milestone, as it represents our first core enterprise solution component to be made available with a seamless user experience, and without the need for specialized technical resources.</p> What is the Data Exchange Client Gateway, and why does it&nbsp;matter? <p>The Data Exchange Client Gateway is a key component of <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions-data-exchange/">Energy Web’s Data Exchange solution</a>: it’s the application that provides the UI and APIs for interacting with shared messaging infrastructure to send, receive, and authenticate messages. One of the main value propositions of the client gateway is providing a single, standardized integration method for many independent organizations to exchange information across various messaging channels.</p><p>The client gateway was developed in support of the Data Exchange solutions deployed in <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/case-study-project-edge/">Project EDGE</a> and <a href="https://www.westernpower.com.au/community/news-opinion/project-symphony-premieres">Project Symphony</a> in Australia. These projects are demonstrating how a shared industry data hub can <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/canary-in-the-sunshine-australia-is-showing-the-rest-of-the-world-what-a-modern-grid-looks-like-ce95832cc017">enable better utilization of customer-owned, distributed energy resources</a> (“DER”, such as rooftop solar and battery storage systems) by improving coordination between AEMO (the national grid and wholesale market operator), distribution network utilities, and aggregators. Compared to the status quo approach to data sharing, which relies on a multitude of point-to-point integrations between individual companies, a shared data hub will help enhance DER visibility and ensure consistency across market participants, while maintaining standard cybersecurity and reducing costs to industry.</p><p>There are several dozen other markets around the world that need similar solutions for sharing and validating DER data among multiple entities, especially in the US (where r<a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/ferc-order-2222-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity-for-decentralized-technologies-to-accelerate-the-c35cf41527cb">egulations like FERC 222</a> are removing barriers to DER market participation) and Europe (where <a href="https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/Publications/Position%20papers%20and%20reports/TSO-DSO_ASM_2019_190416.pdf">coordination between transmission and distribution grid operators</a> is <a href="https://www.ceer.eu/documents/104400/3731907/C16-DS-26-04_DSO-TSO-relationship_PP_21-Sep-2016.pdf">a regulatory priority</a>). As Energy Web we see a major opportunity for our Data Exchange solution to unlock the full potential of DER all over the world, and so making the Client Gateway as user-friendly as possible as at the heart of our technology roadmap.</p> DDHub on Azure: How it Works and Why it&nbsp;Matters <p>The EDGE and Symphony trials have been ongoing since 2022 and while overall results have validated the value of a shared data hub, a <a href="https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/initiatives/der/2022/project-edge-lessons-learnt-2--final.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=0A6D7D1A47CE168E130983F082EA9CDE">key lesson learned is that integration needs to be&nbsp;simpler</a>.</p><p>The Client Gateway is an independent application that each market participant runs within an environment of their choice. Up until now, the process of deploying and maintaining Client Gateways across multiple companies was complex, manual, and required specialized technical knowledge of advanced topics like containers and orchestration.</p><p>The reality is that not all electricity market participants have the internal capabilities to manage this manual deployment model and even those that do don’t always have spare capacity. Further complicating matters, because this approach requires each company to independently download, install, and configure the Client Gateway application, coordinating both initial installations and ongoing maintenance and update releases was challenging and time-consuming.</p><p>Making the Client Gateway available on Azure obviates the need for any specialized IT resources and reduces the time to install the application by 90%. Additionally, participants are able to natively integrate the Client Gateway application with other Azure services (for example, Azure Key Vault) that they already use and need to integrate with the shared data hub. Taken together, this means the Energy Web Data Exchange solution is not only better positioned to support existing projects, but production-grade solutions in any other&nbsp;market.</p> Conclusion <p>2023 is going to be a pivotal year for Energy Web, as the global energy transition is hitting an inflection point right as we’re evolving from delivering individual projects to delivering software solutions that are repeatable and scalable. Our whole focus is simplifying the user experience for enterprises to adopt these solutions not just in the innovation sandbox, but the core operational business.</p><p>Making the Data Exchange Client Gateway available as an Azure marketplace offering is an important step in realizing our vision of a complete EW-DOS-aaS. Going forward, in the near term we will continue to expand marketplace offerings. Later in Q1 we will share additional updates on our plans to make all of our solutions available “as-a-Service” via managed service, third-party resellers, and fully self-hosted options.</p><p>About Energy&nbsp;Web</p><p>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p></p>     <p>This lecture took place on 1 March 2023. </p>
<p>Zero trust and its architectures are incomplete in a digital world where the benefits of exponential innovation are starting to be outweighed by its risks. To exponentiate trust in the digital world, zero trust must be expanded to zero trust under zero knowledge — because in a world of generative AI, none can be trusted, nothing should be shared, and if something is shared it must be verifiable to be true by anyone without revealing any sensitive data.</p>
                           <p>Q: If how <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> work is inherently Zero-Knowledge (ZK), then what does the ZK layer in <a href="https://dlt.mobi/citopia/">Citopia</a> do?<br>
A: VCs are not inherently ZK. Typically they will contain clear text data making claims about a subject that might be pseudonymous when using DIDs and attested to by a VC issuer that might also be using a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a>. But that is not ZK. ZK in a VC is, for example, attesting to a ZK proof that the subject is over 21 years of age without revealing the birthday at the time the VC was issued.</p>
<p>Q: Is it more of a verification that ZK is actually being preserved?<br>
A: It is a verification that a ZK proof was created at a specific point in time, more than anything else. But that is a very powerful statement by itself since otherwise, you cannot prove when a ZK proof was created.</p>
<p>Q: Interaction between digital twins is zero trust (ZT) in a network, but if a digital twin is accessed by an API, is it still a ZT network?<br>
A: Yes, it is as long as the requester of the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twin (SSDT)</a> API is required to prove its identity using public key cryptography every time the requester accesses the API of the SSDT.</p>
<p>Q: What is the difference between the Citopia nodes being connected using Citopia API vs the Citopia nodes being connected via ITN?<br>
A: Citopia Nodes connected to one another are network nodes in one network connected to one another, as network nodes are in IPFS or Bitcoin or Ethereum. Citopia Nodes connected to the ITN are one network talking to another network – cross-network node communications.</p>
<p>Q: When do the Citopia nodes communicate with one another?<br>
A: Only when one node wants to discover or access services and applications in another node or when Citopia membership credentials are replicated between nodes.</p>
<p>Q: Is it strictly for peer-to-peer communications, such as proof presentations?<br>
A: Basically, yes.</p>
<p>Q: I think peer-to-peer communication including write transactions is slow, what is the tech in order to speed up the communication?<br>
A: Requests between Nodes can be processed in parallel. Therefore, more powerful compute and network infrastructure improves throughput.</p>
<p>Q: Is it correct to understand that interaction between Citopia API nodes is ZT and interaction between Citopia applications is ZT but interaction between Citopia API node and Citopia application node is NOT ZT because that API interaction is not by ZT (DID to DID)?<br>
A: Communication within a Citopia node is within a trust boundary. Therefore, although all traffic is encrypted, not all applications must authenticate each other. However, all external requests made to a Citopia node must be authenticated and authorized by the Citopia node and by the targeted Citopia Application – double verification.</p>
<p>Q: Which ensures ZKPs? SSDTs by themselves or SSDTs with Citopia services or SSDTs and Citopia services interacting with core services?<br>
A: ZKPs are generated and verified by Citopia Services or — a bit later on the roadmap due to required optimizations — directly within a Citopia SSDT as part of an SSDT’s capabilities. </p>

<p>By <a href="https://medium.com/@kimdhamilton?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Kim Hamilton Duffy</a>, on behalf of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Claims &amp; Credentials Working Group</a></p><p><a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">The Claims &amp; Credentials Working Group at DIF</a> is excited to announce the release of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Presentation Exchange (PE) v2 specification</a>. This updated and ratified version of the spec includes a restructured set of core requirements, as well as an extensibility mechanism through the use of “features.”</p><p>But first, let’s take a step back: <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">The DIF Claims &amp; Credentials Working Group</a> is responsible for developing interoperable formats and supporting tools for broad adoption around issuing, requesting, exchanging and verifying credentials in a vendor-agnostic manner. Current work items include Schema Registries, Trust Establishment, Data Agreement, JWT-VC Interop Profiles, and of course, Presentation Echange. All of this open-source work is licensable under Apache 2.0, Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 or W3C Patent licensing, as outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_CC_WG_charter_v1.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">WG Charter here</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_CC_WG_Operating_Addendum_V1.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">WG Operating Addendum here</a>.</p><p>So, what is Presentation Exchange all about? In short, it enables a verifier to express to a credential holder (via their software agent, such as a wallet) their requirements for claims and proofs. For example, a financial institution can use PE to express to a potential customer (via the customer’s credential wallet) that they require a driver’s license from a certain set of state DMVs, as well as proof of address. The customer’s wallet can then use this information to pre-select the necessary credentials and, upon receiving the customer’s consent, generate a cryptographic signature, and package it all up to send to the financial institution. Importantly, different kinds of wallets using different cryptography and credentials formats can be added and subtracted over time, abstracting out many of the divergences in today’s verifiable credential systems.</p><p>With the release of PE v2, we have restructured the spec to define a reduced set of core requirements for implementers. This was based on input from implementers across different identity standards communities, who were all converging around a core set of baseline requirements on their respective roads to production. The spec separates this core set from additional functionalities, known as “<a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#features">features</a>” which enable additional features only activated when both wallet and server signal support for them. This design allows verifiers and relying parties to layer additional functionality on top of the PE spec, while still providing a streamlined, implementable baseline for all implementers and a graceful upgrade path for wallets and implementations alike.</p><p><br>Additionally, we have restructured some of the PEv1 data model, moving previously mandatory properties and objects into optional features, which enables a more concise and consumer-friendly language. A variety of other minor improvements were also made based on implementer feedback. You can find more details on these updates in a new section of the spec, available <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#what-is-new">here</a>.</p><p>The net result of these various updates is a broader range of support for the PE spec. A number of companies and organizations have already implemented the spec, including <a href="https://block.xyz/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Block</a>, <a href="http://bloom.co/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Bloom</a>, <a href="http://centre.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Centre</a>, <a href="http://circle.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Circle</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">OIDF</a>, <a href="https://sphereon.com/solution/dif-presentation-exchange-with-siop-v2/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Sphereon</a>, <a href="http://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Spruce</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/workday-engineering/lets-actually-share-our-verifiable-credentials-7ab1b4c73079?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Workday</a>, <a href="http://benri.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Benri</a>, and <a href="http://gendigital.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Gen Digital</a> just to name a few.</p><blockquote>Presentation Exchange: in short, it enables a verifier to express to a credential holder (via their software agent, such as a wallet) their requirements for claims and proofs.</blockquote><p>Presentation Exchange V2 joins the list of delivered work items from DIF WGs, including <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1/">SideTree</a> and <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2/">DIDComm v2</a>.
