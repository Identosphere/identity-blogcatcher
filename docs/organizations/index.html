 Valuations in our sector are rocking — with no signs of slowing&nbsp;down. <p>Best-in-class, scalable technology solutions that exceed customer expectations are in high&nbsp;demand.</p> Precis <p>2020 saw a rush of adoption and evolution in eCommerce and online presence, not created by but fuelled in pace by the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>By sector we are referring to technology, and fast-growing subsectors digital identity and verification needs and facilitations, the financial technology space, and all eCommerce interactions in this next internet era. Fintechs are consistently part of challenger banking now, or neobanking, upending the oligopolistic traditional financial services practice. This sector is bringing along fast-moving partners and symbiotic cutting-edge solutions that meet and drive customer expectations and behaviour. For clear reasons, the need for safe and trusted digital tools is quickly spreading to all arenas, including verified identity.</p> Safe Harbour <p>Tom Kennedy has been remunerated by KABN Systems NA in the past twenty-four months.

The M&amp;A cycle is seeing a lot of activity too. Incumbent players are moving fast on new developments to bolster their product offerings and keep up with the customer and market demands. Financial investors are searching for the next unicorn, or more likely a puzzle piece positioned to be gobbled up at handsome valuations by leveraging vertical integrations or amalgamating user bases into their&nbsp;own.</p><p>Internet deals in the US led the way in Q4/20, with almost double the dealflow Healthcare saw in second place. While we do not expect this pace to continue its linear growth, we do expect that 1) Canada typically lags the US markets, and 2) the horse has already left the barn. While KABN’s timing appears to have been excellent, execution demand will only increase as these players are expected to demonstrate they are worth premium valuations.</p><p>Figure 1: Q4/20 was all about internet&nbsp;deals</p>Source: PwC/CB Insights MoneyTree™ Report Q4&nbsp;2020. The stock market is supportive of valuations <p>The stock market is very useful for valuation as buyers and sellers commit to pricing every day trading is open. Over the past two years, we have seen a cyclical shift away from certain sectors like commodities, consumer goods, and traditional financial services towards technology.</p><p>There are many ways to illustrate this point. We compare the Dow Jones industrial Average, a metric of the broad US markets, against the Technology subsector, over the past two years, in Figure&nbsp;2:</p><p>Figure 2: Tech Stocks are just beginning to outperform</p>Source: Investing.com; Tom&nbsp;Kennedy. The pandemic didn’t create this upcoming Tech Boom — but it didn’t&nbsp;hurt <p>While the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly had huge exogenous impacts on markets and consumer habits, we contend it did not create this evolution. That said, it has clearly sped things&nbsp;up.</p><p>One anecdotal way to explain adoption is that inevitably the customer is likely to embrace a more convenient, safer, cheaper, or better alternative brought on by technology eventually. The exact timing however is often difficult to pinpoint. During the pandemic, many people chose to or were strongly encouraged to purchase food online. This may be an activity they had never engaged in before and might not even have the technology. So they end up buying groceries that arrive at their door in good time and good order, or a prepared meal, and they enjoy it, and are now committed online shoppers. According to 451 Research, a boutique eCommerce research firm in the US, eCommerce spending rose by 23% year over year in 2020 over 2019. These kinds of numbers represent rapid adoption that will not reverse to pre-COVID levels.</p><p>We would note the broader market has also done very well during the pandemic, which is helpful to enhancing access to capital for any subsector.</p><p>A different way to look at the relative performance of tech versus the broader market is seen comparing the value of $1 invested (all figures USD for this point) on 23 March, 2020 to 22 January, 2021. That dollar would be worth $1.95 now, relative to $1.67 for a buck in the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>This represents an alpha, or relative outperformance, of the tech subsector, at 16.8% over that timeframe which is approximately 10 months of data. A couple of caveats are that we have chosen the US market for more robust data but further believe the US market is an excellent proxy for Canada. That said we have not normalized for the exchange rate, but there are so many things from elections to interest rate movements and virtually infinite economic minutiae that affect all durations of currency fluctuation. In addition, Canada typically lags the US, particularly in market developments. This element enhances our point if true and furthermore contributes to the benefits of obtaining a wider US investment audience both from a valuation and adoption perspective.</p><p>Figure 3: Value of $1 invested at pandemic market&nbsp;bottom</p>Source: Investing.com; Tom&nbsp;Kennedy. The Customer will ultimately drive adoption — and that’s where we believe KABN can&nbsp;excel <p>Global professional services firm Accenture surveyed 47,000 customers on their digital banking practices in their Accenture 2020 Global Banking Consumer Study. Our interpretation is that the customers can be segmented logically by range of adoption, from Traditionalists to Pioneers, and they are rapidly adopting digital interactions with a focus on humanized elements (“Congratulations, your loan is approved!”) with security and online threats being a major theme. Note that ‘humanized’ and ‘personalized’ are two different important factors. Humanized means counteracting the user feeling their requests are being served by a computer program, while personalized refers to a customized experience with their online interactions that feels tailored to their needs, attitudes, and utility rather than fees seemingly for a beige product suite with few alternatives. Well, guess what incumbents: there are fast-moving disruptors with better and better mousetraps.</p><p>Trust in interactions has also fallen precipitously as seen in by the survey’s results, led by bank institutions and insurance, but broadly across all major categories. Trust in banking fell to 37% in 2020 (from 51% of customers trusting their bank in 2018), Insurers fell to 32% (40% — 2018) and Online Payments to 21% (from 30% Trust in&nbsp;2018).</p><p>KABN is uniquely placed to play a role in all these personalized, customer-centric interactions. The customer stands to gain online safety and confidence, the customer owns and can transparently monetize their own identity, and Liquid Avatar stands to be a customized key, wallet, and armour to open empowered and expanded online presence and functionality.</p> Two recent transactions — the announced sales of Kount and SoFi — indicate takeout valuation goalposts <p>Two relevant transactions were announced thus far in 2021. The first was Kount, which announced an acquisition for US$640 MM in cash by Equifax (EFX:NYSE). The second was the acquisition of fintech startup SoFi for US$8.65 BB by one of Social Capital’s special purpose acquisition corporations.</p><p>So to valuation: in each of these cases, the takeout premiums were impressive, and de-emphasize revenues in favour of what SoFi refers to as “WINNER TAKES MOST.” We know what this means. My thesis is that the firms with best-in-class products that are in a position to respond to the massive growth in online eCommerce are going to share a huge pie, not take the whole thing. And the value they are in a position to create is driving buyers to pay up for years of as-yet unrealized performance.</p><p>Take <a href="https://kount.com/">Kount</a>, a leading provider of anti-fraud solutions to thousands of North American&nbsp;brands.</p><p>They have two significant assets, one being a robust proprietary data library and the other being a “secret shopper” type process whereby they test your company’s system for fraud protection. Kount then operates as a high end security consulting firm with bespoke solutions for clients’ eCommerce suites.</p><p>This drove a valuation we estimate at &gt;13x trailing twelve months’ (TTM) revenue, a number that obviously demonstrates the value of their non-revenue performance. They appear cash flow breakeven for at least another full year, as Equifax speaks to the value they will add in over two years of future performance as part of the basis of their purchase price. Equifax constantly runs the risk of becoming a dinosaur every passing day and needs the shot in the arm that is found in new and promising technology. That said, they have the liquidity to acquire new products and teams rather than build them in-house so they can quickly leverage for their existing customers and cross-sell for internal use and customer acquisition alike. Equifax is no stranger to security challenges across their own customers, being dealt a blow in 2017 over a security breach that exposed over 150 million customers’ private&nbsp;data.</p><p>Social Capital’s offer to acquire <a href="https://www.sofi.com/">SoFi</a> represents a significant going-public premium. SoFi is widely recognized as a central market disruptor in financial services right now. This transaction represents an acquisition by a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, not dissimilar to an RTO (reverse takeover) method of going public. This is effectively a financial transaction with a lofty premium in spite of the lack of any synergies or strategic development other than going&nbsp;public.</p><p>SoFi is a fintech pioneer that is disrupting the banks, being vastly more customer friendly and customer focused, and offering a far lower cost model given the internet infrastructure rather than bricks and mortar banking. The valuation being paid by venture capital firm Social Capital implies 13.6x 2025E forecast Adjusted Net Income on figures released by Social Capital. To provide a nearer term perspective, this implies a valuation of 13.9x 2020E Adjusted Net&nbsp;Revenue.</p><p>This means the buyer has already pre-paid for five full years of success culminating in projected results to be announced around now in 2026, at a 50%+ percent premium to current banking institutions’ one-year forward earnings. In the case of SoFi, the SPAC shell saw its value soar, meaning investors see more room above and beyond the premium’s baked in accomplishments. We would also note there are normal considerable growth milestones yet to be accomplished by SoFi that their growth relies upon, notably the receipt of a federal banking&nbsp;license.</p> Summary <p>In summation, we believe the market is entering a new period of non-standard valuations for best-in-class technology that delivers on customer expectations. We expect this will continue all through 2021 and into the foreseeable future.</p><p>We will leave with a parting thought: Merriam-Webster Dictionary has added the word “crowdfunding” for 2021. Things are developing so fast even the dictionary is trying to stay relevant.</p><p>KABN is potentially well-positioned to thrive in this fast-paced environment.</p><p>© 2021 Thomas Kennedy.

<p>The specification, defining a free, open document file format for office applications, enters the 60-day public review that precedes the call for consent as an OASIS Standard</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) TC [1] are pleased to announce that Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) Version 1.3 Committee Specification 02 is now available for public review and comment in preparation of the call for consent as an OASIS Standard.</p>



<p>The OpenDocument Format is a free, open XML-based document file format for office applications, to be used for documents containing text, spreadsheets, charts, and graphical elements. OpenDocument Format v1.3 is an update to the international standard Version 1.2, which was approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO/IEC 26300 (2015). OpenDocument Format v1.3 includes improvements for document security, clarifies under-specified components, and makes other timely improvements.</p>



<p>The OpenDocument Format specifies the characteristics of an open XML-based application-independent and platform-independent digital document file format, as well as the characteristics of software applications which read, write and process such documents. It is applicable to document authoring, editing, viewing, exchange and archiving, including text documents, spreadsheets, presentation graphics, drawings, charts and similar documents commonly used by personal productivity software applications.</p>

<p>Papaki kau ana ngā tai o mihi ki a koutou katoa.</p>



<p>As the Kiwi summer rolls on it brings with it a sense of optimism for 2021 and reminds us how truly blessed we are to call Aotearoa New Zealand home.</p>



<p>The year ahead for our digital identity ecosystem and DINZ is one of optimism and progress&nbsp; too – with our focus squarely set on leading a united approach to digital identity for the benefit of all New Zealanders.&nbsp; 2021 will be a significant year of progress as the work to formalise the DIA’s proposed Trust Framework is gathers momentum.</p>



<p>In the spirit of optimism and progress, I would like to let you know that Andrew Weaver will be leaving DINZ as our Executive Director at the end of March.&nbsp; Andrew has been a true rangatira and kaitiaki of DINZ since its establishment.&nbsp; Working together with our members and Executive Council, Andrew has set our association on the path to growth and success and developed significant local and international profile and respect.&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew is leaving us to pursue other opportunities and we sincerely thank him for his contribution to DINZ and the ecosystem and wish him all the very best. Prior to the end of March we will take time to acknowledge his significant contribution to DINZ.</p>



<p>Our mission at DINZ is to create a digital identity ecosystem that enhances Kāwanatanga (honourable governance), Rangatiratanga (self-determination &amp; agency) and&nbsp;&nbsp; Ōritetanga (equity &amp; partnerships) for all people in New Zealand.&nbsp; We are on a journey to become more tiriti-honouring by enhancing our practice to embody Kāwanatanga, believe digital identity is a taonga and we collectively have a great responsibility as Kaitiaki to treat people’s identity with dignity, respect and care.&nbsp; We have started the process of looking for a new Executive Director who will drive this mission and kaupapa at DINZ.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.seek.co.nz/job/51507981">Learn more about the Executive Director role opportunity</a></p>



<p>I would also like to formally welcome our new <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council members</a> who joined in with our first meeting of the year on the 28th January.&nbsp; Welcome and we look forward to your wisdom and guidance on the Executive Council.</p>



  Sat Mandri, JNCTN  John Evans, TSB  Russell Craig, Microsoft NZ  Luke McIntyre, MATTR  



<p>In the Government seat on the Executive Council, the DIA will continue to represent the government and we are pleased to welcome Alan Bell replacing Tony Eyles as the government representative.<br><br>We look forward to engaging with you throughout 2021 as we shape a new future for digital identity in Aotearoa New Zealand.<br><br>He mihi mutunga kore</p>

<p>The US Federal Reserve is participating in a Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) Cross-border Payments Task Force to identify ways to promote cross-border payments that are faster, less expensive and more transparent and inclusive.</p>
<p>With the CPMI’s initiative to improve cross-border payments (and their upcoming conference&nbsp;<a href="https://lnkd.in/dBmT9q6">https://lnkd.in/dBmT9q6</a>), the Institute of International Finance (IIF) and the OpenID Foundation (OIDF) have submitted input on the important nexus of #identity and #payments. The submission details IIF’s collaboration in the Open Digital Trust Initiative, how this fits with the G20 Payments Roadmap, and some important considerations in #AML. The submission is available at <a href="https://lnkd.in/dyMM_Mv">https://lnkd.in/dyMM_Mv</a>, referencing draft Principles for Digital Trust Networks&nbsp;<a href="https://lnkd.in/de59CjU">https://lnkd.in/de59CjU</a>, which all sought feedback. We will further build on this in our upcoming Open Digital Trust Initiative interim report.</p>
<p>The joint Institute of International Finance – OpenID Foundation’s Open Digital Trust Initiative has published Draft Principles for Digital Trust Networks, identifying the high level ‘rules of the road’ that digital trust networks should adopt in order to incentivize a high level of digital trust, user centricity and low cost.</p>
<p>The International Institute of Finance Open Digital Trust Initiative has four policy Work Groups. &nbsp;The Initiative’s two technical Work Groups, the OIDF’s eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance and the Financial-Grade APIs are responsive to the steep rise in the use of fintech apps and services. &nbsp;In that context, the new eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Standard responds to the need for trusted online identity verification alternatives to today’s problematic in-person proofing requirements. The Financial-Grade APIs standard helps secure the portability and privacy of personal data held by banks and used by fintech innovators in new online applications.</p>
<p>As OIDF members know well, technical standards are critical components of an ecosystem’s infrastructure. Identity standards like OpenID Connect are key to validating the commercial viability, facilitating multi-vendor interoperability, securing data portability and privacy protections for customers. Promoting the adoption of these technical standards in concert with the IIF’s focus on regulatory requirements expedites the legal compliance needed for the implementation of innovative technologies. It’s an alternative to wasting resources navigating between competing frameworks. It is a market based approach with open technical standards being adopted on criteria such as effectiveness, opportunity cost and enabling compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>The Report points out to its unique contribution to the global identity ecosystem at a critical time. Put simply, the IIF has advanced a diverse global community’s understanding of both technology “tools” and the governance “rules.” The IIF’s Initiative has triggered a virtuous circle coupling the development of open technical standards with policy development in a time of economic, technical and social disruption. The result is a positive feedback loop between the policy and technical working group that initiated a virtuous circle that can inform a global collaboration strategy for years to come.</p>
<p>While the IIF and the OpenID Foundation do not themselves propose to “police” the Principles, or award or allocate trust marks to particular Digital Trust Networks, we encourage identity attribute verifiers, trust framework operators and others to consider offering these services. In concert with the OpenID Foundation’s technical workshops and pilots, the Open Digital Trust Initiative may also road-test the draft Principles in the first half of 2021, through one or more proof of concept projects.</p>

Hardoon, Gena Boutin, Stéphane Mouy, Nick Mothershaw, Scott David, Conan French, Mina Loldj &amp; Matt Ekberg, and many more.</p>

 Why the resignation of the Dutch government is a good reminder of how important it is to monitor and regulate algorithms <p>On January 15, the Dutch government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/15/dutch-government-resigns-over-child-benefits-scandal">resigned </a>amid a scandal in which the tax authorities unjustly accused more than 26,000 families of mainly low socio-economic background of committing fraud. An overtly strict interpretation of government policy led to any minor inconsistency between data, or any <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/world/europe/dutch-government-resignation-rutte-netherlands.html">failure to sign </a>one of the pages of the form, to be classified as fraudulent. The government, which has pursued a policy of zero tolerance for tax fraud, required those families to return to the state huge sums pertaining not only to the period in which the alleged fraud was committed, but up to 5 years prior to when the alleged fraud was committed. It was later revealed that applications from candidates with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-politics-resignation-idUSKBN29K1IO">more than one citizenship </a>were also automatically flagged as suspects, and so most of the families erroneously accused of fraud were lower-class immigrant families, sparking additional controversy about institutional racism. The draconian way of locating cases and collecting debts has led many families to considerable financial difficulties, declaring bankruptcy, and collapsing the family unit under the&nbsp;burden.</p><p>A parliamentary report entitled <a href="https://nltimes.nl/2020/12/17/parents-faced-unprecedented-injustice-years-childcare-subsidy-scandal">Unprecedented Injustice</a>, examined the actions of the government and put the blame on tax officials, politicians, judges, and other government officials. Although the report does not mention the use of algorithms as one of the reasons for the failure, given the reliance of the Netherlands and many other countries on algorithms to determine certain benefits, it is plausible that the default would have happened because of an algorithm, therefore the consequences of such occurrence should be considered.</p><p>Just a few months ago, a court in The Hague <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/05/welfare-surveillance-system-violates-human-rights-dutch-court-rules">declared illegal </a>one of the algorithms used by the Netherlands Ministry of Social Services to detect and investigate cases of social benefit fraud. The algorithm, named SyRI (which stands for System Risk Indication), was implemented deliberately only in <a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/story/syri-netherlands-algorithm/">the poorest neighborhoods </a>of the Netherlands where underprivileged and immigrant populations tend to make up a large share of the demographic. SyRI also incorrectly classified many families as involved in fraud and thus blocked their way to receiving social benefits to which they were entitled. In addition, the Dutch Public Broadcasting Company (NOS), in 2019 <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2286848-overheid-gebruikt-op-grote-schaal-voorspellende-algoritmes-risico-op-discriminatie.html">revealed </a>extensive use of algorithms by many government ministries for determining where criminal offenses are committed, assessing how much social support each person will need and what are the chances a certain student will drop out of school. Government ministries are <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2286880-privacywaakhond-overheid-moet-transparanter-zijn-over-algoritmes.html">not always transparent </a>about the use of algorithms and citizens do not always know that a particular decision in their case has been made by computer software. For this reason, the Dutch Data Protection Authority intends to tighten supervision of the use of algorithms in government ministries due to the danger that those algorithms will discriminate against underprivileged groups.</p><p>As mentioned, the Netherlands is not the only country that makes extensive use of sophisticated algorithms for ranking and evaluating citizens. A <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25156">report </a>written by Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, warns against “stumbling zombie into a digital welfare dystopia”. Alston highlights the fact that technology is often presented as a tool that will increase efficiency, benefit citizens, and provide them with better services. However, in practice, governments use technology mainly to surveil and track citizens, particularly the underprivileged, and also in order to reduce welfare budgets and the number of people eligible for government support.</p><p>When the decision to deny eligibility is made by an algorithm, public officials do not always have the option to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3692792">understand exactly</a> what led to that disqualification and they cannot always intervene and change the decision. Of course, the algorithm directly reflects the policy dictated by the government. So if the overriding goal is to detect as many social benefit scams as possible, the algorithm is calibrated to achieve the same result, and the same decision to tag any failure to sign or fill in a particular field on the form will lead the algorithm to classify the case as fraud, just as tax officials did manually in the Dutch child benefits&nbsp;affair.</p><p>Fortunately, the parliamentary committee that examined the state’s conduct regarding the default of child benefits was able to understand precisely what led to many families being mistakenly classified as involved in fraud. The committee examined the procedures and criteria established for the purpose of classifying each case as a fraud, thus exposing the fact that failure to fill one field in the form in good faith, or lack of one signature among many led to the misclassification. As a result, it was possible to have a public debate on the legitimacy of each of the criteria that should lead to the classification of fraud cases and to come to the conclusion that these do not constitute a justifiable reason for denying the benefit and labeling families as fraudulent. If the decision was made by an algorithm, the concern is that due to the technological ambiguity surrounding the operation of the algorithm it would have been much more difficult to point out the government’s failure and to restore the damages done to the victims of the unjust&nbsp;policy.</p><p>Hence, the Dutch case clearly demonstrates why it is vital to maintain high standards of transparency and supervision in algorithms that influence individuals’ lives. Principles of transparency and control help in maintaining proper governance and particularly help in holding accountable those who decide to adopt a certain algorithm or those who built&nbsp;it.</p><p>This story has been originally published as an <a href="https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001359618">op-ed</a> in Globes Israeli Business Journal, 4 February 2021 (in&nbsp;Hebrew)</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/why-the-resignation-of-the-dutch-government-is-a-good-reminder-of-how-important-it-is-to-monitor-2c599c1e0100">Why the resignation of the Dutch government is a good reminder of how important it is to monitor…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

     <p>ISO/IEC 6523 is a standard whose aim is to define a structure for uniquely identifying organisations and parts thereof in computer data interchange and specify the registration procedure to obtain an International Code Designator (ICD) value for an identification scheme. Some organisations including PEPPOL (Pan-European Public Procurement On-Line) and the European Commission have adopted this standard to discriminate identifiers issued by different organisations. More than 200 ICDs have been allocated so far. These include ICD 0088 for the GS1 Location Number (GLN) and 0160 for the GS1 Global Trade Identification Number (0160). GS1 requested and obtained ICD 0209 to generically refer to other GS1 identification keys. </p> <p>Previously, only GS1 identifiers GLN (088) and GTIN (0160) could be used in transactional data exchanges based on ISO 6523 (European Norm on eInvoicing EN 16931, Peppol standards, European eProcurement workgroup TC440, …). To be able to use all GS1 identifiers, a new code (0209) has been introduced to provide possibility on using all (and even combined) GS1 identifiers.</p>

<p>This protocol, defining a business-oriented exchange header envelope, enters the 60-day public review that precedes the call for consent as an OASIS Standard.</p> 


<p>OASIS and the Business Document Exchange (BDXR) Technical Committee [1] are pleased to announce that Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>The Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) has been developed jointly by UN/CEFACT and OASIS as the successor to the UN/CEFACT Standard Business Document Header (SBDH) version 1.3 and the OASIS Business Document Envelope (BDE) Version 1.1.</p>



<p>XHE defines a business-oriented artefact either referencing (as a header) or containing (as an envelope) a payload of one or more business documents or other artefacts with supplemental semantic information about the collection of payloads as a whole. An exchange header envelope describes contextual information important to the sender and receiver about the payloads, without having to modify the payloads in any fashion. This vocabulary is modeled using the UN/CEFACT Core Component Technical Specification Version 2.01.</p>



<p>The TC received 4 Statements of Use from IBM, ph-xhe open source project, Chasquis Consulting, and Efact [3].</p>



<p>The Committee Specification and related files are available here:</p>

<p>UBL v2.3 is ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that Universal Business Language Version 2.3 from the OASIS Universal Business Language TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>UBL is the leading interchange format for business documents. It is designed to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes. The European Commission has declared UBL officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations, and in 2015 UBL was approved as ISO/IEC 19845:2015.</p>



<p>Specifically, UBL provides:</p>



  A suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business documents.  A library of schemas for reusable data components such as Address, Item, and Payment, the common data elements of everyday business documents.  A set of schemas for common business documents such as Order, Despatch Advice, and Invoice that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation contexts.  



<p>UBL v2.3 is a minor revision to v2.2 that preserves backwards compatibility with previous v2.# versions. It adds new document types, bringing the total number of UBL business documents to 91.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>

<p>Thank you to all who voted in the 2021 elections for representatives to the OpenID Foundation Board of Directors.</p>
<p>As per our bylaws, three individual board members represent the membership and the community at large. As George Fletcher has one year remaining on his 2-year term, I want to thank George for his continued leadership and service to the OpenID Foundation and the community at large.</p>
<p>Nat Sakimura and John Bradley were re-elected to new two-year terms as community member representatives. Nat and John’s well-known technical expertise and global thought leadership ensures continuity across working groups and as the Foundation transitions to new leadership in 2021.</p>
<p>Each year, Corporate members of the OpenID Foundation elect a member to represent them on the board. All Corporate members were eligible to nominate and vote for candidates. I am very pleased to welcome Ashish Jain, Head of Identity at eBay, to the Board as Corporate Member Representative. Ashish served on the board in the past. He’s been an expert technical contributor over the years and brings a fresh perspective to the Board.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Dale Olds of VMware, who has served as the Corporate board representative for the last few years. Like so many in our community, I’ve benefited from Dale’s support and appreciate his contributions to the Foundation.</p>
<p>Board participation is a substantial investment of time and energy and requires diligent consensus building. Please join me in thanking Nat, John, and Ashish, as well as the other directors, for their service to the Foundation and the community at large. And thanks to all for continuing your investment of time and membership that drives the Foundation’s contributions to the evolving Internet identity layer.</p>

<p>February 9,&nbsp;2021</p><p><a href="https://ufa.worldbank.org/">1.7 billion</a> adults and millions of organizations do not have access to essential financial services; billions more have bank accounts but are unable to use them. Despite initiatives such as the <a href="https://ufa.worldbank.org/">World Bank’s Universal Financial Access program</a> and governmental and industry encouragement, many remain underserved or entirely excluded from the global financial system. For many, the basic societal need to hold monetary value securely, transact for necessities, and transfer money to friends and family is still out of&nbsp;reach.</p> Regulatory Compliance Is an Enabler for Innovation in&nbsp;Fintech <p>Thankfully, financial services continue to evolve rapidly, providing new avenues for people and organizations to engage in essential services. Alternative financial technologies (fintech) are bursting into the marketplace, offering innovative products and services to banking participants through direct, smartphone-based, non-traditional channels. The digitization of monetary exchange has also experienced explosive growth, often proving to be faster, more convenient, more privacy-respecting, and more secure than physical transactions.</p><p>These trends expand the risk and compliance challenges of money transmission beyond traditional banks to startups, enterprises, and nonprofits/NGOs, which are typically unfamiliar with regulatory scrutiny or essential compliance controls. Global regulators are currently monitoring this transition and looking to ensure existing regulations apply to new fintech players. This transition includes virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and other non-bank financial institutions which act as a conduit for the financially excluded and underserved or those otherwise considered ‘high-perceived-compliance risk.’</p> Financial Inclusion Needs Identity for&nbsp;All <p>According to the World Bank’s ID4D, “<a href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/953621531854471275/pdf/Global-ID-Coverage-Barriers-and-Use-by-the-Numbers-Insights-from-the-ID4D-Findex-Survey.pdf">People with an ID are more likely to own bank accounts and mobile phones, and financial and mobile services are among the most frequently reported uses of one’s&nbsp;ID</a>.”</p><p>Identity verification is at the core of essential financial regulations of Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT). Financial governance leaders are recalibrating their requirements to keep up with the pace of innovation to ensure that bad actors do not exploit the financial system and that intermediaries of all types have adequate financial crime compliance (FCC) programs in&nbsp;place.</p><p>The fundamental right for individuals to participate in society no matter their origins or circumstance has long been at the core of the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>’s vision. The Foundation promotes control of one’s own identity to utilize digitally stored credentials to access and engage daily services. While decentralized identity has been a barrier in traditional banking, fintech and regtech have introduced the constructs to leverage digital and self-sovereign identity to drive financial inclusion for tens of millions of outliers.</p><p>Indeed, these new technologies provide great promise in modernizing finance, payments, and identity management in tandem. But related regulatory compliance is in equal need of modernization. Traditional legal compliance relies on legacy banking infrastructure. Its growth has forced the sector into a false binary choice: provide incentives for universal access or protect financial system integrity with exclusionary compliance controls. This choice has disproportionately impacted those who are in most need of essential financial services, such as low- or moderate-income families, and access to vital services, such as international remittances. The Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the importance of such entry to small businesses reliant on support and financially underserved or excluded households looking for&nbsp;relief.</p> Innovation in Governance, Compliance, and Regulation <p>Since 2019, Sovrin has hosted the Compliance and Payments Task Force (CPTF), an open group of traditional bank and non-bank financial institutions, regulators, policymakers, technologists, ethicists, and legal experts. The CPTF has developed and promoted the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SswHBZ1pwuIUcePeFe8czOoAOaHE78ij4okXuQq5OW0/edit">Rulebook</a>, an innovative best practices framework that extends traditional banking compliance and payments guidance to emerging fintech and VASP processes.</p><p>The Rulebook serves to ensure essential global banking compliance while accommodating fintech’s seamless experience and smooth flow of funds for members and reinforcing the application and intersection with traditional banking rails. The Rulebook defines technical standards for end-to-end transaction flows and service-level agreements between parties to reflect the operational realities of an increasingly decentralized and cross-border financial system.</p><p>As part and parcel of regulatory compliance to expand the operational focus of the CPTF to serve the Identity for All mission and advance inclusion, the Group has reimagined into the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0EAHbtr2GFDoK7_WlbrOJO1p8rUv9HrKCFBsPdnaUo/edit">Compliance and Inclusive Finance Working Group (CIFWG)</a>. The CIFWG builds on the tactical efforts of the CPTF, with a robust and ambitious mandate: promoting financial inclusion as a critical enabler. CIFWG will monitor the challenges faced by the financially excluded and underserved, focusing on how economic and regulatory technologies, supported by self-sovereign identity (SSI), can bridge the gap between traditional banking compliance and the associative risks injected by innovation.</p><p>With the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SswHBZ1pwuIUcePeFe8czOoAOaHE78ij4okXuQq5OW0/edit">Rulebook</a> as an anchor framework, the Group will facilitate the advancement of financial inclusion and a modernized application of established global banking requirements and the attendant and necessary FCC protocols. CIFWG is also engaging with other international organizations, initiatives, and regulatory-led groups that advance financial inclusion and modern regulatory compliance solutions. Its ultimate goal is to promote access to traditional and non-traditional financial services and highlight the resulting benefits of building economic resilience and prosperity.</p><p>CIFWG believes that SSI is a powerful enabler for security, compliance, and inclusion&nbsp;. “Our bedrock approach recognizes that any institution today can be a financial services provider; our job is enabling their full participation in the global banking system,” says Amit Sharma, CIFWG Chair. “Digital finance is not new, although the cryptographic creation and representation of value show promising applications to democratize finance truly. Innovative and modern FCC approaches must meet market innovation. We encourage all who are interested in joining us in the CIFWG to help facilitate a pathway to a more sustainable economic future for&nbsp;all.”</p><p>For more details about the Working Group and instructions on how to join, please see the Compliance and Inclusive Finance <a href="https://sovrin.org/inclusive-finance/">webpage</a> or contact <a href="mailto:cifwg@sovrin.org">cifwg@sovrin.org</a>.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://sovrin.org/promoting-banking-for-all-announcing-the-compliance-inclusive-finance-working-group-cifwg/">https://sovrin.org</a> on February 9,&nbsp;2021.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>At Equifax, I work with governments across Canada to help them utilize data, insights and analytics to make policy decisions more data driven. We also have fraud and authentication solutions that tend to work well for government departments administering social assistance programs. We are a member of DIACC and I am a Co-Chair of the Outreach Committee this year. We’re focused on getting lots of identity content out, on topics that might need more explaining like facial recognition technology, for example. It gets me out of bed in the morning because I enjoy the people I am working with and these are problems I really enjoy solving.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>That is a long story. My Dad was (and still is) the Mayor of the small town I grew up in, so I quite literally grew up in politics. In university, my desire to understand how governments worked was strong so I started doing internships. I got hired at Queen’s Park as my first job out of university and ended up in the Ministry of Finance. That led me to the financial services sector where I first got introduced to the world of identity and authentication as more transactions started happening online.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>My degree is in Environmental Policy so I always felt like I didn’t belong in financial services or technology. The most important lesson I have learned along the way is that hard work and a strong willingness to learn and execute is just as important as credentials. Work hard, have a growth mindset, and don’t be intimidated.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START /STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>There are a lot of solutions out there today and the sector is evolving so fast. What we are starting to do really well and need to continue to do is collaborate. I have been part of many co-pitches now<br>
and it is really fun.</p>
<p>What we need to start to focus on more is how do we better reach the general public and build trust? That’s not any one person or organization’s role, but it is a focus of the DIACC outreach committee because we believe that education will help adoption.</p>
<p>Communication is so important, and one thing I think we should stop doing is speaking too technically about product benefits and features. Let’s talk instead about values and solving customers problems. Identity solves so many customer problems and it will help people and organizations connect the dots.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>We need different perspectives around the table in order to make informed decisions.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>I recently read The Choice by Dr. Edith Eva Edger. She is a psychologist and one of the last remaining Holocaust survivors. It is one of those life changing books. Although the book is about struggle and suffering, it is an inspiration.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Don’t limit yourself to things that you know, accept failure as part of the skill development process.</p>
 Where can we find you on social media?

 Good Health Pass: A New Cross-Sector Initiative to Restore Global Travel and Restart the Global&nbsp;Economy <p>Today, <a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020</a> announced the launch of the <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> along with more than 25 leading individual companies and organizations in the technology, health, and travel sectors — including the Airports Council International (ACI), Commons Project Foundation, COVID-19 Credentials Initiative, Evernym, Hyperledger, IBM, International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Linux Foundation Public Health, Lumedic, Mastercard, Trust Over IP Foundation, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative is an open, inclusive, cross-sector initiative to create a blueprint for interoperable digital health pass systems that will help restore global travel and restart the global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every segment of the global economy, but none as profoundly as<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/industries-most-and-least-impacted-by-covid19-from-a-probability-of-default-perspective-september-2020-update"> travel and tourism</a>. Last year, airlines lost an estimated<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-11-24-01/"> $118.5 billion USD</a> with related impacts across the economy in excess of <a href="https://www.unwto.org/impact-assessment-of-the-covid-19-outbreak-on-international-tourism">$2 trillion&nbsp;USD</a>.</p><p>In conjunction with the announcement, the Collaborative also released its first white paper, entitled, <a href="https://goodhealthpass.org/good_health_pass-a_safe_path_to_global_reopening">Good Health Pass: A Safe Path to Global Reopening</a>.</p> Collaboration Among a New Ecosystem of&nbsp;Players <blockquote>“There’s one thing the world agrees on — we need to address the health concerns today to support a return to normalcy,” said Ajay Bhalla, President of Cyber &amp; Intelligence at Mastercard. “Delivering a global, interoperable health pass system can only happen if we come together in a way that meets the needs of everyone involved. This Collaborative will be critical in helping to define how we connect the pieces that will bring travel back safely, spark job creation and jumpstart the world’s economic&nbsp;engine.”</blockquote><p>Various efforts are currently underway to develop digital health credentials systems — both vaccination and test certificates — for international travel. Yet, despite this race to market, it is unlikely that a single solution will be implemented universally — or even across the entire travel industry. Thus, it is critical that solutions are designed from the onset to be interoperable — both with one another and across institutional and geographic borders.</p><p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative is not intended to supplant existing efforts but rather to help weave them together, fill gaps where they may exist, and facilitate collaboration among a new ecosystem of stakeholders, many of whom have never worked together&nbsp;before.</p><blockquote>“Fragmentation is a risk we simply cannot ignore,” said ID2020 Executive Director Dakota Gruener. “To be valuable to users, credentials need to be accepted at check-in, upon arrival by border control agencies, and more. We can get there — even with multiple systems — as long as solutions adhere to open standards and participate in a common governance framework. But without these, fragmentation is inevitable, and travelers — and the economy — will continue to suffer needlessly as a&nbsp;result.”</blockquote> Global Travel &amp; Digital Health Credentials <p>COVID-19 test results are already required for entry at some airports and at international borders. But existing paper-based certificates are easy to lose, unnecessarily expose sensitive personal information, and are prone to fraud and counterfeiting.</p><p>By contrast, digital health credentials can be printed (e.g., as a QR code) or stored on an individual’s mobile phone. They enhance user privacy and “bind” an individual’s identity to their test result or vaccination certificate, thus enabling real-time, fraud-resistant digital verification.</p><blockquote>“Our health data consists of the most sensitive personal information, deserving of the strongest privacy,” said Dr. Ann Cavoukian, Executive Director of the Global Privacy &amp; Security By Design Centre. “Release of our health data must be under our personal control. The Good Health Pass does just that: With Privacy by Design embedded throughout, you control the release of your digital health data, and to whom; all de-identified and decentralized. Privacy and functionality: Win/Win!”</blockquote><p>The World Health Organization recently convened the Smart Vaccination Certificate Consortium to establish standards for vaccination certificates, but no analogous effort currently exists for test certificates. Given that it is expected to take years for vaccines to be universally available globally, widespread testing will remain an essential public health tool — and one that must continue alongside vaccination to ensure a safe and equitable return to public&nbsp;life.</p><p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative has defined four primary requirements that digital health credential systems for international travel must&nbsp;satisfy:</p>  Cross-border: Solutions must work at airports, airlines, ports-of-call, and borders worldwide and comply with international and local regulations.  Cross-industry: Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors.  Secure &amp; privacy-protecting: Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors. Solutions must comply with all relevant security, privacy, and data protection regulations and must be able to bind the presenter of the credential to the credential itself at the required level of assurance.  Frictionless: Solutions must seamlessly integrate into testing and travel processes, thus enhancing and streamlining the experience for individuals and airlines alike. Solutions must not add new material costs for travelers. Optimally, validation processes will be contactless to maintain or enhance&nbsp;hygiene.  <p>The Collaborative welcomes the participation of policymakers and representatives of government agencies; companies in the health, technology, and travel sectors; and civil society organizations who share a commitment to safely restoring international travel and economic activity while simultaneously ensuring that equity, privacy, and other civil liberties are protected.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more, please visit the Good Health Pass website at <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">goodhealthpass.org</a>.</p> Endorsing Organizations   Affinidi  Airport Council International (ACI)  Airside  analizA  AOKpass  Bindle Systems  BLOK Solutions  CLEAR  The Commons Project Foundation  Covid Credential Initiative (CCI)  Daon  Everynym  Global Privacy &amp; Security by Design&nbsp;Centre  Grameen Foundation  Hyperledger  IBM  idRamp  International Chamber of Commerce&nbsp;(ICC)  iProov  Linux Foundation Public&nbsp;Health  Lumedic  Mastercard  MIT SafePaths  National Aviation Services&nbsp;(NAS)  Panta  PathCheck Foundation  Prescryptive Health  SITA  STChealth  Trust Over IP Foundation  ZAKA   <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/good-health-pass-a-new-cross-sector-initiative-to-restore-global-travel-and-restart-the-global-8b59eb1050a0">Good Health Pass: A New Cross-Sector Initiative to Restore Global Travel and Restart the Global…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>Working with partner digi.me, Digital Scotland is proposing a technology solution to enable a “data donor” program for Covid-19 vaccinations. 
<p>Importantly this is not a one-off point solution, an implementation of technology that will only serve this one purpose.</p>
<p>Rather it is a solution will leave behind an infrastructure that can be immediately used for future pandemics, and more generally will enable a patient centric evolution of health care and broader still, install the common data sharing foundations for Scotland’s entire digital economy.</p>
<p>Not only would Scotland be a world leader in health care, in the short-term regarding Covid and in the medium term more generally across all healthcare, but also in ensuring privacy, security and consent are at the heart of the patient experience, a principle that can then be extended to all citizen and business interactions.</p>
<p>The Scottish Council for Development and Industry <a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/news/scotland-urged-close-healthcare-%E2%80%98data-gap%E2%80%99">identified</a> that:</p>
<p>“The Scottish Government must invest in data, digital and technology in health and social care to help Scotland recover from Covid-19. Closing the data gap in the sector could be worth £800m a year and deliver savings of £5.4bn to NHS Scotland.&nbsp;SCD said better data would help to build resilience against future public health challenges, which in turn will drive a healthy economy.”</p>
<p>Our solution provides a platform for achieving exactly this, both in terms of equipping Scotland with a powerful integrated data environment and also through a framework where developers can further build on this with other apps for a myriad of other use cases. It could be tied in with the <a href="https://www.ukauthority.com/articles/nhs-scotland-launches-digital-service-for-covid-19-vaccinations/">vaccination scheduling system</a> as an immediate step for example.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalscot.net/glasgow-talks-ecosystem-review/">Mark Logans Ecosystem Review</a> provides an overall commercial context, with this platform acting to bring together multiple startups in collaboration around a common societal and government need, one of immediate benefit to Scotland and with an obviously large, global market.</p>
 Covid-19 Data Donor Platform 
<p>Covid vaccines are now being approved for mass use after a rapid, but comprehensive, trials regime. As they are administered to millions of individuals there is a need to ensure their full effectivity in the real world is understood. This requires Real World Evidence (RWE) from patients.</p>
<p>That evidence will need to include, at a minimum:</p>
 
 Vaccination status (Vaccine, date, article no., lot no., …) 
 Current health status (Well, Covid, other illness) 
 Medical records 
 Individual consent 
 
<p>Within any nation capturing this information at scale and being able to link to individuals and gaining their consent – and doing so quickly – is virtually impossible with current systems.</p>
<p>Even if the information is readily available and linkable to an individual, the integration task would take months if not longer and, without the direct involvement of the individual, would fail to gain the consent required for access to this detailed information on an individual basis.</p>
<p>However, there is a solution in the developing arena of patient centricity, where all information is at the individual. Because with patient centricity the data is all held at the individual, integration becomes straightforward – one-to-one links to the individual and a single consent-based request to the individual, with many of these links already in place). Furthermore, consent is direct and understood by the individual – fostering trust in the data collection, and the results obtained (critical for continued adoption of the vaccines themselves).</p>
<p>Therefore it is recommended that RWE for Pharmacovigilance and post-market surveillance is undertaken using a patient-centric approach, and with the world leading patient-centricity “data facilitator” digi.me, which already has many of the interfaces required and has been approved for medical data processing and handling by the health services of the UK, Netherlands and Iceland, and which full meets all stringent data protection provisions such as GDPR, security and safety requirements (see Digi.me – Accreditations and standards). (Digi.me has also implemented US Epic, Cerner, CDA and Blue Button interfaces.)</p>
<p>A system overview of this approach is as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this system diagram, digi.me already includes Self-Assessments capability, wearables and medical records integration and the full consent API/SDKs. To create a data donor program, three further elements are required:</p>
 
 Integration of vaccine data (if not available via medical records). This is straightforward and can be one or more of the following:
 
 Implementation of an API to national/local vaccination records system 
 Direct scan of vaccination certificate/card or scan of QR code if on certificate/card such as UK card below: 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 Secure Anonymised Data Repository
 
 Digi.me is already integrated with a secure SAAS data handling system created by partner DTACT. This system can be run over any cloud repository such as Azure, AWS or other national specific cloud repository. 
 (Note: the capability exists for anonymous data donors to be contacted, anonymously, to provide extra data or to contact directly for clarification – this would use a messaging component based on the anonymous ID sent by digi.me with the individual’s data. Only if the individual responds to such a message request would they disclose their identity (if required). 
 
 
 Data donor web site
 
 This would be publicised digitally and physically with posters 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 The site would have relevant information explaining use of data – and detailed anonymised sharing. 
 Should the individual elect to become a data donor, they would be presented with a digi.me Consent Certificate (existing capability) and guided through the set-up process. 
 Presuming Consent is given data sharing would then occur automatically each day. 
 And the individual has full control to cease being a data donor (and where provided request deletion of data in accordance with GDPR rules).

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>In this video author and tech entrepreneur Mark Logan is invited by Glasgow Talks to provide the audience an overview of his recommendations to the Scottish Government to stimulate and accelerate the maturity of Scotland’s Technology Ecosystem, with a focus on education, infrastructure and funding. 
<p>Commissioned by Kate Forbes, Mark Logan former COO for Skyscanner, has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-technology-ecosystem-review/">published a report</a> identifying how Scotland might accelerate growth of its tech ecosystem. Mark joins the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce to share his thoughts on the strategy.</p>
 What is a technology ecosystem? 
<p>Before summarizing the video, let’s talk about what is technology ecosystem and what does it do?</p>
<p>The term “ecosystem” was first used by British ecologist Arthur Tansley back in 1935 to describe the relationship between organisms and their environment.</p>
<p>Fifty-eight years later, business strategist James F. Moore co-opted the word in the Harvard Business Review article to describe the interconnected business world. Moore suggested that companies weren’t members of a single industry, but rather part of a business ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ecosystems now include communities that use shared, scalable resources to pursue challenging objectives and common interests. Ecosystems are about dynamic interactions between people, software, data, systems and services.</p>
 Video Summary 
<p>The First Minister announced that the people of Scotland must keep pace with digital innovation and by doing so they can help boost economic growth, drive innovation and protect businesses against any future crisis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With over 25 years experience, Mark is focused on helping to nurture the start-up community in Scotland and the UK as an investor, non-executive director and advisor. Mark is also a Professor in the School of Computing Science at University of Glasgow.</p>
<p>He undertook a review of the Scottish tech sector and delivered a blueprint to raise it to world-class status. The people of Scotland are now working to take forward his ambitious recommendations including the establishment of a national network of hubs for tech startups offering world-class training program, intensive monitoring and access to funding opportunities.</p>
<p>The tech ecosystem has inputs and outputs. The inputs are people, infrastructure, education and funding. The outputs are a stream of business and scaled tech business. To increase the rate of startups we can consider that inside the ecosystem box there is a distinct life-cycle of growth, there are pre-startups, startups, small scale ups and large scale ups.</p>
<p>There is an opportunity gap within this ecosystem box. The report is trying to identify the interventions and to support the inner lines to move forward towards the outer maturity. An ecosystem of a country reaches its tipping point where there’s sufficient critical mass of startups and scale ups that certain virtuous network effects start to operate.</p>
<p>There are three main drivers of this. The first one is attracting talent from outside the ecosystem, second creation of opportunities for them and the by-product is more commercial people. After the tipping point there is investment of money and expertise. The government of Scotland is very close to the tipping point as he sees more talent and ambition in the ecosystem.</p>
 Education 
<p>Currently Finland has the most high-tech ecosystem in the world, having been an early adopter of a technology ecosystem approach. In his report he has drawn out three foundations of technology ecosystem success, namely talent, education infrastructure and funding.</p>
<p>By increasing the supply of engineers and by creating potential tech entrepreneurs, the growth of tech ecosystem is accelerated. The education infrastructure relates to two core foundations – One is physical infrastructure and the other is social infrastructure. In the report he explains this through a definition of a market square, a place where people come together in different forums small and large and learn from each other and learn internationally and build a sense of community and identity and ability to find each other.</p>
<p>Funding covers different types of investment through different stages of requirements of a company’s growth. He has made 34 recommendations in his report to build these foundations of a tech ecosystem. Some of these recommendations have huge long-term leverage value.</p>
<p>Another key recommendation is to expand the involvement of children in Computer Science from an early age, so that they can be the potential future tech entrepreneurs. This is like planting the seeds for future growth, and&nbsp;Computer Science should be treated in education the same way that math and physics is treated for the growth of tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>It will take some time to teach students Computer Science at initial level and to increase the number of CS teachers at schools. Upscaling and reskilling of the teachers is also essential because CS changes rapidly. Inviting industry people to teach the classes, making room for programming projects and changing the syllabus will contribute to the growth of tech-ecosystem.</p>
 Incubators and Accelerators 
<p>Incubator and accelerator are the two terms that people have heard of most for startups. An incubator gives indefinite tenure subject to certain criteria and creates like a market square environment where people can learn from each other.</p>
<p>Accelerators tend to be different they tend to be relatively short-lived programs for like 12 weeks to 16 weeks and these tend to have an education element which shares lessons and success stories so.</p>
<p>The primary issue is that the government can do a better job of creating credible high-growth startups that can convince people that Scotland can repeatedly grow global scale up level businesses, and the challenge of education infrastructure, and availability of funding is essential for all stages of the startup life-cycle.</p>

<p>Team FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The second and final day of the Identity, Authentication and the Road Ahead: Virtual Policy Forum event on Feb. 5 brought together government officials, tech experts and policy advocates in a packed agenda.</p>



<p>The two-day event was hosted by the FIDO Alliance together with the Better Identity Coalition and the ID Theft Resource Center (ITRC) and had over 1,000 registered attendees. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/identity-authentication-and-the-road-ahead-virtual-policy-forum-day-1/">first day</a> of the event saw sessions that outlined the clear and present need for the government and industry to make identity and strong authentication systems more pervasive, to help protect and serve individuals and businesses alike. The second day in contrast had a strong focus on the need for strong authentication and was highlighted by an expert panel that explained how FIDO authentication was able to help secure the 2020 U.S. election.</p>



<p>The day’s event kicked off with a keynote from Congressman John Katko (R-NY) who emphasized the critical need for secure digital identity.</p>



  



<p>“Our homeland security, national security, economic security and way of life are threatened in unprecedented ways by highly sophisticated adversaries and simply being vigilant is no longer enough,” Katko (pictured) said. “Today’s threat environment demands a posture of unwavering resilience. This is particularly true for ensuring the sanctity and resilience of our digital identities.” </p>



<p>How FIDO Helped to Secure the 2020 Election</p>



<p>The resilience of digital identity and strong authentication was called into question during the 2016 election cycle when hackers were able to infiltrate the email accounts of Democratic party staffers, notably the attack of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s gmail account.</p>



  



<p>The same type of event didn’t re-occur during the 2020 election cycle, in part thanks to FIDO standards and a concerted effort to make sure that both Democratic and Republican party officials had access to strong authentication. In a panel during the event, Michael Kaiser, President and CEO of <a href="https://www.defendcampaigns.org/">Defending Digital Campaigns</a> (pictured) explained that his organization was created to help solve the challenge of political campaigns not having the right cybersecurity resources to defend themselves. As companies cannot directly donate to campaigns, Defending Digital Campaigns was formed to act as an intermediary, that enables political campaigns to get cybersecurity services including FIDO based strong authentication resources, for free or low cost. </p>



<p>Kaiser explained that political campaigns are not like a typical organization in that they are short lived and don’t have long term thinking about a security maturity model. Despite that, political campaigns need to be protected as they sit on incredibly valuable and important information.</p>



<p>“I think we gave away more than 10,000 security keys in the political sector in the 2020 cycle,” Kaiser said. “That’s a lot of people and a lot of accounts as we gave away more than $1 million worth of products to 183 campaigns.”</p>



  



<p>Bob Lord (pictured), chief security officer of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) noted that after the events of the 2016 election, security was clearly under the microscope. </p>



<p>“Security is a real challenge and everybody really understands the importance of it, but the dollar figures really can get in the way,” Lord said. “Making sure that there was a reliable source for things like security keys was really instrumental in moving forward.”</p>



<p>Within the DNC and across campaigns, Lord and his team strictly implemented the use of FIDO based security keys to provide strong authentication capabilities and limit the risk of potential phishing attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Today 100% of the people at the DNC who need to get access to their email and&nbsp; access to their documents, they’re all using security keys – no exceptions, no executive privilege to opt out of this,” Lord said.</p>



<p>The DNC also benefited from Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP) which provides additional levels of protection and assurance beyond what a basic gmail account enables.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re big supporters and real big believers in the combination of FIDO security keys and the APP,” Lord said.</p>



<p>Why DNC Believes in FIDO</p>



<p>Lord noted that there are a number of reasons why he is a big supporter of FIDO standards. For one is the fact that FIDO standards are built into the Google Chrome browser. Lord explained that the DNC was pushing the use of Chromebooks to campaigns and the integrated FIDO capabilities made it easier to deploy strong authentication.</p>



<p>While there are multiple types of two-factor authentication available in the market, for Lord there are really only two categories.</p>



<p>“I think there are really two kinds of multi-factor that are available in the consumer space – I think there are FIDO security keys and then there’s everything else,” Lord stated emphatically. “When I refer to everything else, I refer to those other multi-factors systems as legacy and I do that because I want people to get the mental model that this is something to be contained, minimized and eventually moved out.”</p>



<p>Lord observed that other multi-factor approaches, while better than not using multi-factor at all, have shown weaknesses, which is why in his view as an industry it’s important to really be pushing people pretty aggressively to move down the path of FIDO strong authentication adoption.</p>



<p>While Lord is an advocate for adopting FIDO based strong authentication with security keys, he also noted that there were some usability challenges his team had to work through as well training that was needed to educate and onboard users. The learning from the DNC’s efforts are all now being publicly shared by Lord’s team at<a href="https://democrats.org/security/"> https://democrats.org/security/</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s a non-partisan thing so there’s nothing red or blue about these best practices, but you’ll see in there that we really push pretty hard on security keys and the APP in particular,” he said.</p>



  



<p>Mark Risher, Senior Director of Security and Identity at Google (pictured) emphasized during the panel that in general adding a second factor does still objectively decrease the chances of a user becoming the victim of a phishing attack. That said, he noted that for an attacker, phishing a password, or just phishing a password plus a One Time Password (OTP) PIN code basically just&nbsp; requires basically one more line of code for an attacker. </p>



<p>“It does not require the funding of the nation state,” Rischer said about the ability to bypass OTP for phishing attacks. “So we need to get the world to understand the distinction, and to move into and start requiring these much more stringent hardware based strong authentication technologies and standards.”</p>



<p>How FIDO is Moving Forward to Enable Digital Transformation</p>



<p>The afternoon keynote at the event was delivered by Andrew Shikiar (pictured) the Executive Director of the FIDO Alliance. Shikiar noted that passwordless authentication is an important cornerstone for digital transformation.</p>



  



<p>“The security and authentication aspects of digital transformation came to the fore as everything was accelerated due to the pandemic,” Shikiar said. </p>



<p>Shikiar noted that social engineering had kind of a renaissance in 2020 as phishing continued to be successful.</p>



<p>“Simply put, the only way to break this cycle is to eliminate our dependence on server side credentials and password,” Shikiar said. “Anything on a server can and will eventually be stolen so they’re easy to phish, harvest and replay.”</p>



<p>The need to create stronger authentication is why FIDO was born. Shikiar explained that the FIDO Alliance’s mission is to create open standards for simpler, stronger authentication with public key cryptography and asymmetric public key cryptography, which is something that the average consumer should never have to pronounce, let alone know what it means.</p>



<p>Shikiar also outlined some of the FIDO Alliance’s highlights from 2020 including Apple joining the group. He added that Apple joining served as a powerful signal to the industry that really everyone is coalescing around the FIDO Alliance as the organization to collaborate on the standards based user friendly and strong authentication. Another key highlight from 2020 for FIDO was the level of support across operating system and browser combinations with different transport mechanisms for the authenticator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Over 4 billion devices can support FIDO authentication,” Shikiar said. “So in short, you know, we think FIDO is becoming part of the DNA of the web itself, which is a pretty audacious thing.”</p>



<p>“To summarize, FIDO is very much the present and the future of user authentication.”</p>



<p>The Solarwind #Solorigate Attack as an Identity Authentication Issue</p>



<p>A key topic that resonated throughout the second day of the policy forum was the impact of the recent Solarwinds attack which is also commonly referred to as Solorigate.</p>



<p>During a panel about what policies the Biden Administration should consider with regards to Identity, John Miller Senior Vice President of Policy and Senior Counsel at ITI, commented that the Solarwinds attack has been accurately described as a software supply chain attack but it really is also fairly characterized as an identity attack.</p>



  



<p>“Characterizing Solarwinds as an identity attack presents an opportunity to remind policy makers of how fundamental identity is to not only what we’re doing online as consumers but to, but an enterprise environment,” Miller said. </p>



<p>In the final keynote of the event, Alex Weinert (pictured) Partner Director of Identity Security, at Microsoft, outlined the gory authentication and identity details behind the Solorigate incident and why zero trust principles would help to mitigate many risks.</p>



<p>Weinert noted that the Solorigate attack was a fundamental attack on trust. He also emphasized the clear role that authentication played in the attacks and the need to move to strong authentication.</p>



<p>“What are we doing to encourage explicitly verifiable credentials, we all know passwords are crap, we know they’re incredibly vulnerable,” Weinert said. “Are we doing enough as an industry to push for the end of passwords?”</p>



<p>Today’s sessions (February 5) have been recorded and will be available soon.</p>

 About the Lissi&nbsp;wallet <p>The Lissi wallet is a simple but powerful tool to manage digital interactions. It can be used to establish connections to third parties and to exchange information. You can find a more detailed explanation <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/introducing-the-lissi-mobile-wallet-b2af9bccaf03">here</a> or on <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">our website</a>. It’s currently available as an open beta version for <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">iOS</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta">Android</a>.</p> The importance of multi language&nbsp;support <p>Within the identity community, we spend considerable time to ensure interoperability between different solutions. We engage in conversations in a variety of standardization bodies to enable a seamless user experience on a global scale. Frankly speaking, we are not there just yet. But we are on a good way to enable access to the services regardless of where an entity is based or which social background an individual has. While regulation as well as technical and educational hurdles remain, it’s crucial to increase the accessibility of products to different cultures and languages.</p><p>We have already received feedback from multiple stakeholders from the public and private sector saying that multi-language support is essential for the execution of various use cases. There are several nations, which have multiple official languages. If our end-user facing products are not available in the most common languages, it creates entry barriers so big that not even a piloting of these use cases would make sense. Hence, we took note and worked hard to ensure the Lissi wallet is available in the languages of communities, which currently explore the self-sovereign identity&nbsp;concept.</p><p>The Lissi wallet now supports the following languages:</p>  Arabic  English  French  German  Italian  Korean  Polish  Portuguese  Russian  Romanian  Spanish, and  Turkish.   Challenges remain <p>When designing a wallet, the language is only a small part of the whole user experience. The task is to design a universal cockpit, which people can navigate regardless of their social background. Similar to a dashboard in a car, which doesn’t look too different wherever you go. In order to achieve this, we have to standardize the icons, colours and user-flows to a certain degree. However, on the other hand, they need to be adjusted to the target audience. Let’s take the colour red as an example. In western cultures, red is associated with excitement, danger, urgency and love, whereas the same colour evokes danger and caution in the middle-east. In India, it’s associated with purity, while in China it symbolizes luck and happiness. Finding the right balance between standardization and necessary adjustments for the target audience will require knowledge about the cultural differences, feedback and time. When it comes to language it creates its own set of difficulties. Differences can be observed in the usage of genders, the left-to-right or right-to-left reading, the information density or the usage of tenses, just to name a few. Furthermore, there isn’t a common terminology used within the community, which makes a translation into different languages even more challenging.</p><p>Hence, our translation won’t be perfect. While we worked with native speakers, the context is often difficult to explain without demonstrating the user-flow and an actual use-case. Languages also change depending on the use-case or the subject in question. Nevertheless, we are looking forward to making the Lissi wallet even more accessible by adding additional languages and improving our current translation with your feedback. What language would you like to have us support next? We are always looking for translators for additional languages, so reach out to us to get our winter 2021 edition of Lissi Merchandise!</p><p>Cheers. The Lissi&nbsp;team.</p>

<p>Team FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The intersection of identity and authentication and how it can help to improve business as well as people’s lives was a core topic of conversation on the first day of the Identity, Authentication and the Road Ahead: Virtual Policy Forum event on Feb. 4.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance joined together with Better Identity Coalition and the ID Theft Resource Center (ITRC)&nbsp; to host the two day event running on Feb. 4-5, which has over 1,000 registered attendees who are gathering to learn more and discuss the current and future state of identity and authentication. The first day of the event had a strong focus on things the U.S. can and is doing to help improve the state identity, while recognizing the many challenges on the road ahead.</p>



<p>Identity is a National Security Issue</p>



  



<p>In the opening keynote, Michael Mosier (pictured), Deputy Director &amp; Digital Innovation Officer at the U.S. Treasury departments Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/">FinCEN</a>), outlined what’s at stake when it comes to digital identity. </p>



<p>“I view identity as a national security issue, and it will take the intellectual power and creativity of all of us to figure out how to secure identities and keep people from harm,”&nbsp; Mosier said.</p>



<p>Mosier emphasized that digital identity solutions are a key factor to help prevent fraud and financial crime. He added that in order to get payments right, there is a clear need to first get identities done right. The right way in his view, is an approach that preserves privacy while ensuring integrity in the system.</p>



<p>“The ability to detect and address risks is only as good as the ability to determine with whom you’re engaging,” Mosier said. “So the real question for identity related risk is, do you have the information necessary to reliably assess the risk of your counterpart or your customer.”</p>



<p>A key challenge FinCen is seeing is at the account opening stage, with identity proofing and verification. A July 2020 advisory from FinCen highlighted the issue reporting that criminals are undermining identity verification processes, through identity theft and synthetic identity fraud.</p>



<p>“We’re seeing a lot of identity authentication compromise, leading to account takeovers, as&nbsp; a lack of multifactor and multi step authentication is too prevalent across the financial sector,” Mosier said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The costs of those takeovers is far from trivial. FinCEN is seeing around 5,000 account takeover reports each month, reaching approximately $400 million per month over the last two months.</p>



<p>“The bottom line is that many account takeovers and fraud are occurring because of failures to enforce stronger levels of assurance and identity verification in authentication processes,” Mosier said.</p>



<p>Phishing is Top Source of Identity Theft and Cybercrime</p>



  



<p>The Identity Theft Resource Center (<a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">ITRC</a>) is seeing the same trends as FinCEN with phishing and credential theft being the leading source of identity theft, according to the groups recent release 2020 Data Breach Report. In a keynote session, Eva Velasquez, President and CEO and James Lee, Chief Operating Officer (pictured) of the&nbsp; ITRC outlined the high level findings of the report and its impact. </p>



<p>“Credentials are the coin of the realm today, as opposed to what we have traditionally thought of as being the kind of information that threat actors wanted to collect.” Lee said.</p>



<p>While other failures and vulnerabilities including unpatched software can and do lead to data breaches, Lee emphasized that the majority of the root causes of cyberattacks rely primarily on user logins and passwords</p>



<p>How the Pandemic has Accelerated the Need for Strong Authentication</p>



<p>With tens of millions of Americans looking to the U.S. government for help during the pandemic, there has been a clear need for strong authentication and identity technology.</p>



<p>During a panel, Sanjay Gupta, chief technology officer for the US Small Business Administration (SBA) noted that the SBA has been able to ramp up during the pandemic thanks in part to the deployment of a strong authentication based single sign on technology that makes use of FIDO Alliance standards. The SBA uses the <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> platform from the U.S Government’s General Service Administration (GSA).</p>



  



<p>In a keynote session, Congressman Bill Foster (D-IL) (pictured) stated that the COVID crisis has laid bare many of the inadequacies of the identity system in the U.S. </p>



<p>Just to pick one example, Foster noted that over a million stimulus checks were sent to dead people and for millions of others, the stimulus checks were delayed because of challenges in verifying who is eligible based on where they live. While there are challenges, Foster noted that there has also been a lot of relevant technological progress, independent of government action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The use of a secure enclave on a modern cell phone as a FIDO second factor device is a huge step forward,” Foster said.&nbsp; “The increasing use of privacy preserving biometric sensors on smartphones as a means of providing digital online authentication for human identity is going to be transformative.”</p>



  



<p>In a panel following the keynote on where the government can help with identity and authentication, Paul Rosenzweig, Resident Senior Fellow, Cybersecurity and Emerging Threat at the R Street Institute commented that good identity is clearly one of those common public goods that economic theory teaches us, is best provided at a governmental level. That’s an idea that panelist&nbsp;Phil Lam (pictured), Executive Director of Identity for the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) agreed with. </p>



<p>“I think that we as a government are providing a lot of benefits to Americans today and in order to facilitate providing that benefit, we kind of need to know who you are and&nbsp; are you eligible for a benefit,” Lam said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lam re-iterated that the FIDO-enabled <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> portal is a critical part of the U.S. government’s authentication strategy and now serves over 25 million users.</p>



  



<p>The final panel of the day tackled the socially important topic of equity and inclusion when it comes to identity and the individual. Among the panelists was Reverend Ben Roberts (pictured) who runs the ID Ministry, which is an effort to help the underprivileged get their identity so they can qualify for government assistance or even just to get a bank account. </p>



<p>Roberts detailed a number of heart-breaking cases of individuals that have had extreme challenges in getting some form of verified identity. He had a strong message for government policy makers and technology developers alike for how to enable strong authentication and identity systems.</p>



<p>“As we’re bringing things online and as new policies and new systems come into play, really do your level best to ensure that people are not getting left behind,” Roberts said.</p>

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee and Atsuhiro Tscuhiya, APAC Market Development Team</p>



<p>The reason to put passwords in the rearview mirror is more evident than ever. Our recent survey on consumer behavior says that 58% of abandoned online purchases are due to the difficulty of managing passwords. The Gartner Group’s research indicates that 20-25% of all helpdesk calls are password reset requests. The World Economic Forum (WEF) assessed that cybercrime costs the global economy $2.9 million every minute; about 80% of the attacks targeted passwords.</p>



<p>But the tide is turning. During our inaugural Authenticate conference, which took place in November 2020, Microsoft announced that they now have more than 150 million people are using their passwordless sign-in each month. That is a 50% increase from last year’s report at Microsoft Ignite back in November 2019.</p>



<p>We have all seen how the global pandemic has drastically accelerated the willingness of and the need for organizations to embrace passwordless FIDO Authentication. It is now a matter of how and with whom, instead of when.</p>



<p>Updates from APAC Marketing Forum</p>



<p>We are happy to share meaningful progress since the first FIDO AllianceAsia Pacific Marketing Forum (AMF) in July.&nbsp;Here are some updates from our members across the region:</p>



<p>Taiwan</p>



<p>Mentioned in our previous post was&nbsp; the introduction of FIDO’s standards in official documents developed by Taiwan Association of Information and Communication Standards (TAICS) and SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) Taiwan, as well as FIDO’s logo on the app of Taiwan-Cathay United Bank.</p>



<p>Recently, the government of Taiwan has also adopted FIDO’s authentication method for the purpose of citizen’s tax filing, a government service that supports more than 200,000 users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>India</p>



<p>FIDO2 is now accepted by the CCA (Controller of Certifying Authorities), under India Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, as an alternative to SMS OTP.&nbsp; The guidelines have been published on the CCA website (<a href="http://cca.gov.in/eSignAPI.html">http://cca.gov.in/eSignAPI.html</a>).</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance member Singular Key’s FIDO Certified authentication service is being used by ReBIT, the cybersecurity subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India.</p>



<p>Additionally, a whitepaper on FIDO authentication for banking space has recently been submitted to ReBIT. Webinars designed to educate the public on FIDO’s standards are also in the works. These efforts will no doubt help to drive up FIDO awareness amongst the India population.</p>



<p>Hong Kong</p>



<p>In Hong Kong, the passion for horse racing continued even as people stayed home and betting branches closed because of the global pandemic.</p>



<p>For the first time ever, the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) kicked off the horse racing season with all-digital betting. Punters had to log on to HKJC’s mobile betting app, provided by FIDO Alliance member Tradelink.</p>



<p>The betting channels, which are secured by FIDO via biometric authentication on users’ mobile devices, provided a user-friendly and safe experience that helped to secure a record HK$1.376 billion turnover – 6.83% higher than the previous record set in the 2017/2018 season! This was made possible, despite the record low number of attendees at the races in year 2020.</p>



<p>Separately, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government rolled out a new initiative powered by Tradelink’s FIDO Certified authentication – the “iAM Smart” initiative, which enables Hong Kong citizens to authenticate their identities using mobile devices for access to financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Malaysia</p>



<p>There is a clear transition towards a passwordless future in Malaysia.</p>



<p>The FIDO Certified authentication service from SecureMetric is recently being adopted by a number of public services in the country as part of the government’s Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024. This means that FIDO authentication will play a role in services such as Malaysia Central Bank’s (Bank Negara) Electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC), the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) National Technology as well as Innovation Sandbox (NTIS) from the Ministry of Science.</p>



<p>Vietnam</p>



<p>In Vietnam, the shift away from passwords is accelerating. Currently, there are 32 licensed e-Wallet providers all vying to lead the charge to facilitate the country’s shift to a more cashless society. There is also a major focus on smart city, digital signatures and electronic ID developments.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, FIDO member VinCSS became the first company in the country to develop FIDO2 Certified authenticators. Since then, it has met the FIDO2 standard for the second time, announcing its achievement of FIDO2 Certification for its strong authentication server named VinCSS FIDO2 Server.</p>



<p>This achievement also means VinCSS is currently one of only 13 companies globally with a FIDO2 certified server that can accept any FIDO certified authenticator, irrespective of its manufacturer – an amazing feat!</p>



<p>Other Notable Updates in Asia</p>



<p>Additionally, Japan-based telecommunications operator KDDI recently deployed FIDO2 for its “au ID” and started FIDO authentication service. Instant messaging app LINE, introduced biometric authentication that utilizes FIDO standards for iPad users, eliminating the need to key in passwords. The FIDO Japan Working Group Chair was invited as an expert by the Japan Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication on their discussions using My Number Card capabilities on smartphones.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in Korea, the Blue House, the executive office and official residence of the president of the Republic of Korea, deployed TrustKey’s login solution powered by FIDO’s standards for remote work and internal security access.</p>

<p>The 3Box Labs team will be back to EthDenver this year, though a lot is different this time around. EthDenver is virtual for 2021, of course, but our team will be manning the digital booth and roaming the virtual halls to meet and mentor hackers. We love this community and can't wait to see you and your projects, whether that's in the Sports Castle or GamerJibe.</p><p>The tech we have for hackers has changed too. Last year at EthDenver, our CTO Joel huddled in a corner of the castle to build the first POC of <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>. Almost exactly a year later, Ceramic Network has just <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">moved into beta on a live testnet</a>. <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a>, the open identity protocol built on Ceramic, is also in beta and ready for use. And 3Box is now <a href="http://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a>, with our full focus on <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/p/6c8da552-3900-472e-ad68-ded95ce3cbe0/">bringing these protocols</a> to builders across Web3.</p><p>Ceramic and IDX offer a massive improvement on previous 3Box products, and EthDenver hackers are the first to get a crack at the beta versions. To celebrate, we've got lots of content, tons of ideas, and nearly $10,000 in bounties up for grabs.</p> Workshops and Talks <p>We'll be all over the virtual stage over the next week talking about decentralized identity and data. (Add to your calendar from the <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/schedule">full schedule</a>).</p><p>Workshop: Using open identity with IDX <br>Saturday 2/6 at 9am MST/5pm CET</p><p>Tech Talk: Standards for encrypted and mutable data on IPFS <br>Sunday 2/7 at 11am MST/7pm CET</p><p>Evolution of Decentralized Identity: A history<br>Thursday 2/11 at 4pm MST, 12am CET</p><p>Identity Legos Panel: The composable Web3 identity stack <br>Thursday 2/11 at 4:30pm MST/12:30am CET</p><p>We'll also be on stage during bounty presentations and opening ceremonies to share more about our prizes and products, and we'll have an informal office hours at 10:30am MT each of Monday-Thursday for hackers who want to drop by with questions.</p> 10,000 DAI in bounties <p>We've got a huge trove of bounties to celebrate the beta release of 2 protocols: <a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> is a peer-to-peer dataweb for publishing, linking, and querying verifiable information on the open web. <br><a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX (identity index)</a> is an open identity protocol built on Ceramic that makes it simple to store, use, and manage decentralized identities and data across any network, platform or application.</p><p>We've split the 10,000 DAI in rewards across 5 categories.</p>  Best overall use of IDX (identity index): 3000 DAI across 4 winners  Best overall use of Ceramic Network: 3000 DAI across 4 winners  Best new tools for Ceramic Network: 1500 DAI to 1 winner  Best use of Ceramic for social features: 750 DAI to 1 winner  Partner bounties: use Ceramic with Textile (1000 DAI) and with NEAR (1000 DAI) – or go for all 3 together!   <p>The <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/post/ceramic-network">full bounty details are here</a>. We'll be looking for submissions that tackle an original project idea, use Ceramic/IDX well and deeply, provide a wow-worthy demo, and contribute value to the Web3 ecosystem.</p> Hack ideas we'd love to see <p>If you are looking for a great idea or a good way to use Ceramic or IDX, here are a few things we know we'd love to see.</p> Use IDX to manage user identities and data <p>🧩Cross-chain profiles and identities</p><p>If your hack uses an L2 or non-Ethereum chain, make sure you aren't splitting users across multiple accounts. IDX lets you <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/default/#3id-keychain">link multiple keys</a> to the same identity and profile, from any chain!</p><p>⚙Backup and sync DeFi settings on IDX</p><p>In most apps and exchanges, user settings including watched addresses, tokens, currency preferences, and contact lists are stored in local storage. A new device, browser or even cleared cache means everything is gone. Storing these in a user's identity index assures backup, multi-device support, and reusability across applications!</p> Use Ceramic as an open and auditable content store <p>🐤Mirror of Crypto Twitter onto Ceramic Network</p><p>Our community <a href="https://twitter.com/StefanDGeorge/status/1347861734716035074">has put up $15,000</a> (so far) in donations for a tool that mirrors tweets onto Ceramic Network, paving the way for a new Web3-native social conversation without the need for a mass migration off Twitter. Get started towards this at EthDenver!</p><p>🎨Mutable metadata for NFTs</p><p>NFTs are unique, but do they have to be static? Mint NFTs with metadata stored on Ceramic and the owner of the Ceramic document can change the properties of the NFT over time. &nbsp;An artist could keep updating the NFT metadata after it's minted, creating a unique evolving piece.</p><p>📝DeFi Annotations and Comments</p><p>Create a commenting system with Ceramic that lets users add notes to contracts, addresses, trades or anything else in DeFi. Managed by users directly, these notes could be accessible across any DeFi app. This could be a javascript library for apps to integrate, or a browser extension for users to add themselves.</p><p>📤Auditable discussion forums</p><p>Use Ceramic documents to create discussion forums that are auditable, flexible and decentralized. Each user can post to their own Ceramic document, with each aggregated and referenced to create the full forum. No server needed, and easy paths to a censorship resistant foundation with moderation layered on.</p> Use with other dweb tools to open up new use cases <p>✉P2P chat or comments</p><p>Use IDX with <a href="https://github.com/textileio/js-threads">Textile's js-threads</a> or another messaging protocol to build fully P2P social features that authenticate directly with a user's key and identity. You could create an embedded support bot, a DeFi trollbox, team chat tools, a "decentralized disqus", or a notification service.</p><p>🗄Ceramic as a CMS for content on IPFS, Textile or anywhere else</p><p>Ceramic's mutable documents with persistent doc IDs makes it great for managing dynamic information that is stored on IPFS or elsewhere. Use Ceramic to catalogue, index or generally manage the data used in your hack., wherever it's stored. You can publish the definition (schema, etc) of data stored in Textile or other DBs to make private data discoverable and interoperable.</p> Create tooling for decentralized identity and data <p>🗺Ceramic document explorer</p><p>Create a way to visualize and explore the documents that exist on Ceramic. This could focus on the available <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/learn/glossary/#definition">definitions</a> that have ben created, all Ceramic documents, individual user identity indexes, or anything else. We'd love to see how you'd like to explore the network!</p><p>🖇New crypto or social account links</p><p>The 3Box Labs <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/identitylink-services">IdentityLink service</a> provides verifications for Discord, Twitter and Github. Add one for Telegram, Matrix, Discourse or a KYC provider.</p><p>Or add support for a new blockchain. Ceramic can currently be authenticated by Ethereum, Filecoin, EOS, NEAR or Cosmos keys. It's <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">simple to add support</a> for your preferred chain.</p><p>🚛Import of Web2 social data to use on Web3</p><p>Many large Web2 apps now have APIs to export user data (with users' permission). Build a mass-export tool that puts valuable data into users' hands by adding it to a their identity index.

<p><br>
David McKinney, Managing Director of Local Government at Servelec, maps Scotland’s progress towards fully integrated health and social care, and discusses putting community at the heart of the country’s digital care journey.</p>
<p>In 2016, the Scottish Government legislated to bring together health and social care into a single, integrated system.</p>
<p>The legislation created 31 integration authorities who are now responsible for £8.5 billion of funding for local services. This brought about the most significant change to health and social care services in Scotland since the creation of the NHS.</p>
<p>Integration aims to ensure that services are provided in a seamless and co-ordinated way. Ultimately, it’s about securing better outcomes for people in Scotland, and the best way to achieve that is to make sure that everyone has access to the right information, in the right place, at the right time.</p>
 Serving the community needs 
<p>Public services are complex, so it’s important we work together to provide the best solutions. The very best digital care starts from a deep rooted interest in what communities need – the requirements of their citizens and the professionals and organisations who provide care for them. We must commit to joining up communities digitally by enabling connectivity between health providers, social services, education and charities, an approach with interoperable digital solutions at the heart.</p>
<p>Systems need deep domain knowledge, must be intuitive and easy to use and increasingly be as useful to citizens as they are to the professionals and organisations providing care. We need to strike the right balance between enabling access and protecting data, with a best of breed approach in an open environment where systems can talk to one another.</p>
<p>We’re pioneering this with the current implementation of the National Child Health Record in Scotland using our Rio platform. Our Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system for secondary care can be tailored to an organisation’s specific needs and supports the vision of every patient having one, fully integrated, health record. It operates across child health, mental health and community care settings and interoperates easily with other systems.</p>
 Support at a local level 
<p>The pandemic has required a rapid response from across Government, and has resulted in one of the most challenging years on record for local authorities. I’ve spent a lot of my time this last year meeting (albeit virtually) with local authority customers – learning about their challenges and common goals. It’s been remarkable to hear from teams who have implemented significant transformational change at record speed, in order to continue providing core public services during the pandemic.</p>
<p>We already provide social care systems to a number of local authorities in Scotland, via Mosaic, our case management software designed to give professionals the time and data they need to achieve more positive outcomes for people in their care. We’ve also been proud to support some of those authorities through our social value work – running digital skills workshops for young people in Dundee for example, as we recognise the importance of making a bigger societal contribution.</p>
<p>We’ve continued to support social workers by developing systems that provide them with all the information they need, at the point of care. Our Mobilise app provides the flexibility to update care records while in the community, providing frontline workers with the tools they need, wherever they are. It enables social workers to make more informed decisions, faster, helping to improve the overall quality of care and outcomes for vulnerable people. This way of working reduces duplication of effort and minimises unnecessary travel, by allowing social workers to complete work steps and update records wherever they are.</p>
 More effective digital channels 
<p>This last year, we’ve continued to work with clinicians and other care professionals in looking for improvements to health and social care systems to support communities. Especially solutions that enable citizens to increasingly take responsibility for their own care and wellbeing.</p>
<p>We’ve been developing person-centred, self-service systems, designed to help social care teams shift communication and engagement to more effective digital channels. Mosaic Portal allows people to engage with services more effectively, and offers a personalised, digital approach to social care delivery.</p>
<p>It’s a long and uncertain road ahead, but we’re excited to be part of Scotland’s digital care journey and we are committed to making integrated health and social care real by providing joined-up solutions that place people at the heart of public service provision.</p>

 Tell us a little bit about you and your role in identity?&nbsp; 
<p>I’m responsible for Identity and Access Management at GRTgaz the leading gas distribution company in Europe. As a product owner. I lead 2 teams: one for digital identity, looking after passwords, access controls, all that sort of thing. The other team works on active directories – whether it’s on premise or in the cloud. In total, we have about 5,000 people working for the company. We’re a business to business seller so our customers then distribute gas to their own customers. The global conversation about optimizing use of energy is really important, so we have a lot of innovative projects on going as we work out how to tackle climate change and become more efficient.</p>
 How did you end up in the world of identity? 
<p>I studied at university at Telecom Sud Paris. There were only a few girls in my year as, at that time, cybersecurity didn’t attract many women. I am so happy to see more and more women working in this field. Since then I’ve always worked in cybersecurity. I started out assisting our cybersecurity officers with IAM, and then got super interested in the technical side of Azure AD and how SAML and OIDC work. So I dived in and got to grips with them so I could then simplify it to teach back to my non-technical colleagues!</p>
<blockquote><p>At work, the most important thing is the people, the culture and how everyone works together, rather than the technology that you’re using to build your organisation</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone I worked with had a contagious enthusiasm for IAM. So, 4 years later here I am! When I started out here, there were loads of smaller teams that specialised in different areas of IAM – from multi-factor authentication to customer support to architecture. &nbsp;Everyone had their own objectives so it was hard to break down the silos and work together. My role was to get everyone to cooperate in delivery in order to get the maximum value for our customers. Introducing self-service was super challenging as we had to change user behaviour stopping them from always contacting the Service Desk! When I was offered the opportunity to lead a team here, I thought “Why Not??!” There are always new challenges, whether it’s new protocols or technologies, to keep me interested and busy.</p>
 What does a normal week look like? 
<p>Working across two teams I have a good mix of work. A big part at the moment is the global strategy to migrate to cloud from our on-premise infrastructure so I’m working out how to adapt our current processes, documentation and environments. I also create a lot of training videos for users and colleagues to help them use our products more efficiently. It also helps business leaders make informed decisions when investing in IAM.</p>
 Why is Women in Identity important to you? 
<p>Women are as competent as men so it’s not really a question why women are important in this field. We think through details in different ways and can challenge assumed user needs. Women in Identity provides a great opportunity to gather many voices and listen to the diverse range of experiences that women have in the IT and identity space. It’s so important to support girls to get access to training in IT – it enables them to take advantage of opportunities they wouldn’t have otherwise.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you most recommend to readers? 
<p>Whenever I have a problem I read this book 1 more time – 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey. It really helps with personal development and being more efficient in everything you do, whether it’s work or relationships. It’s not just about relations with colleagues but also maximising your time in all elements of your daily life. At work, the most important thing is the people, the culture and how everyone works together, rather than the technology that you’re using to build your organisation. You’ve got to understand that to be successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 If you were CEO of a company, what one thing would you make compulsory? 
<p>Aside from making Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) compulsory and banning shared accounts (they’re super risky!) I’d make sure I didn’t introduce change until I was sure we had explored all the alternatives. I would rather introduce changes progressively to end users. Covey’s habit “Seek first to understand than to be understood” would be my mantra: e.g. WHY do teams use shared accounts so that before banning, an alternative could be suggested.</p>
 And where would we find you when you’re not working? 
<p>Paris is such a beautiful city. I feel very lucky to live . I love cooking (and eating ). When we are allowed to do so again, I can’t wait to chill with friends in the many great bars and restaurants here in Paris. We can literally try food from kitchens from all over the world.</p>

 Key takeaways <p>👍 &nbsp;Our mission stays the same<br>🚀 &nbsp;<a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> and <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> are the future<br>3️⃣ &nbsp;3Box SDK and plugins will be deprecated, but...<br>👍 &nbsp;<a href="https://3box.io/login">3Box profiles</a> will still work and will be migrated to IDX<br>🛠 &nbsp;We support Ceramic with development, tooling, and ecosystem building<br>⚡️ &nbsp;Currently using 3Box? <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/migrating-from-3box-to-ceramic-and-idx/">Learn how to migrate</a></p> Mission <p>The mission of <a href="https://3boxlabs.com">3Box</a> has always been to advance a more open and sustainable web by creating software that breaks down information silos and redefines relationships between users, apps, and data. </p><p>We believe that by giving users direct ownership over their digital identity, direct control over their personal data, and by liberating information from centralized database silos and putting it on the open internet, we can correct the asymmetric power structures of the current web and contribute to a more safe and equitable digital future for all. Experience has taught us that the most impactful way to advance this mission is by equipping developers with powerful tools that make it easy to build applications on this new paradigm.</p> Where we've been <p>Since early 2018, 3Box has been the leading provider of decentralized identity, user profiles, database storage and messaging capabilities for Ethereum applications. The flagship <a href="https://github.com/3box/3box-js">3Box SDK</a> has been used by 1,500+ projects including <a href="https://metamask.io">MetaMask</a>, <a href="https://gitcoin.co">Gitcoin</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.page">Snapshot</a>, <a href="https://rarible.com">Rarible</a>, <a href="https://gnosis.pm">Gnosis</a>, <a href="https://zerion.io">Zerion</a>, and countless others to create and manage 40,000+ decentralized identities and 200,000+ decentralized databases. Our products have helped make decentralized identity and dynamic application data an indispensable pillar of the Ethereum ecosystem.</p> Introducing, 3Box Labs <p>Today we're excited to announce that 3Box is evolving to become <a href="https://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a> in order to more effectively deliver on our mission. Moving forward we will be shifting all efforts to developing the <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> ecosystem and protocols built on top of it such as <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a>. Over the next few months, we will be sunsetting current 3Box products in favor of these new, more powerful alternatives.</p><a href="https://3boxlabs.com">  3Box Labs: Creators of Ceramic Network, IDX, 3Box.js  3Box Labs creates software that advances a more open, safe, and collaborative web. We’re hiring!      </a><p>Our evolution in brand and product focus does not mean that we're leaving the Ethereum ecosystem or that we're changing our mission. On the contrary, it enables us to improve our offerings, expand into new markets, further decentralize our technology, and dramatically scale our impact. With Ceramic and IDX, now all developers (not just ETH devs) get much more powerful and robust infrastructure that opens up a whole new set of use cases for decentralized identity and dynamic data management.</p> Evolving our approach <p>3Box was a simple, out-of-the-box solution to decentralized identity and data management. Our SDK bundled existing Web3 technologies such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, <a href="https://orbitdb.org/">OrbitDB</a>, and <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> into an opinionated, but developer-friendly API that worked with users' existing Ethereum wallets for authentication.</p><p>We always knew that abstracting existing solutions at the API layer and not solving the problem at the base protocol layer would have its inherent limitations. Over time these limitations became bottlenecks to growth, decentralization, flexibility, and performance:</p>  Performance: "Why are data syncing and load times slow?"  Persistence: "How can I guarantee my data stays available?"  Decentralization: "Why are identities stored on 3Box Inc. servers?"  Consensus: "How can we anchor identities and data on-chain?"  Multi-DID: "How can I use a different DID method?"  Multi-chain: "How can I authenticate with a non-Ethereum account?"  Multi-account: " How can I connect multiple accounts to my DID?"  Flexibility: "How can I use a different database provider?"  Customization: "How can I extend the API to do custom things?"   Moving to the Ceramic Network <p>To address the questions above and support many new capabilities, we realized we needed a completely new technology stack from the ground up. This 18-month journey led us to develop <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> and <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> to be a much more robust and flexible combination of protocols for decentralized identity and dynamic data management. </p> Ceramic: A decentralized network for mutable content <p><a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> is a public, permissionless, censorship-resistant network for managing mutable content on the open internet. By combining IPFS, libp2p, blockchain, DIDs, and authenticated data standards, Ceramic gives developers the ability to build completely serverless applications using dynamic, verifiable, decentralized data. </p><p>Ceramic functions like a global-scale, permissionless NoSQL document database, but guarantees data integrity and ensures strict ordering of document updates by anchoring these updates in a blockchain. Ceramic does not require DB servers or trusted third-parties to host data and perform mutations on content.

 IDX: A protocol for cross-chain decentralized identity <p><a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a cross-chain protocol and SDK for decentralized identity and interoperable user data. IDX allows developers to attach any kind of data to a user, discover all of a user's data in one place, and share data between applications. </p><p>Unlike 3Box which only offered OrbitDB storage and Ethereum-based authentication, IDX can be used with any kind of datastore such as Ceramic, Textile, OrbitDB, Filecoin, IPFS, Sia, Arweave, blockchain registries, or even centralized databases and supports authentication from any kind of Web3 wallet. </p><p>IDX is great for associating user profiles, portable social graphs, reputation scores, verifiable claims, user-generated content, application data, settings, domain names, blockchain addresses, and social Web2 accounts to a user in a decentralized way. </p><a href="https://idx.xyz">  IDX: Identity protocol for open applications  IDX is an open source multi-platform identity protocol that allows users to build up a unified digital identity and freely share their data between apps.      </a> Available on Testnet now <p>You don't have to wait to get started building on all of these new tools. Last week Ceramic officially <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">launched the Clay Testnet</a> and at the same time, IDX went into beta.</p><p>Mainnet will be progressively rolled out over the coming months, beginning with a soft launch for interested projects and then proceeding to a full public release some time after that. If you're interested in deploying your project on the Ceramic mainnet as part of the soft launch, <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">reach out on Discord</a>.</p> Supporting the Ceramic ecosystem <p>Ceramic and IDX are decentralized protocols which are independent from 3Box Labs. However 3Box Labs is committed to supporting the Ceramic ecosystem along three key pillars:</p>  Core protocol development  Standards, developer tooling, core applications  Ecosystem development   Core protocol development <p>3Box Labs develops and maintains the Ceramic <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">JavaScript implementation</a>. If you're interested in writing a client in a new language, reach out in the <a href="https://discord.gg/GXPrjW3qvF">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Standards, developer tooling, and core applications <p>The use cases for Ceramic are virtually endless. While this is a positive for the long-term prospects of the network, it is important that a few key use cases are built out early on so developers can immediately use Ceramic without needing to wait for use cases to organically emerge. 3Box Labs is committed to developing decentralized identity tooling on Ceramic, and here's what we've created so far.</p>  <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/">IDX SDK</a>: 3Box labs maintains the IDX JavaScript SDK which makes it easy to add IDX to your application. The IDX SDK is the replacement to the 3Box SDK.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-method">3ID DID method</a>: A W3C-compliant DID method that uses Ceramic documents as decentralized, mutable DID documents. 3ID is great for end-user IDs. Ceramic-based 3IDs are the decentralized replacement to current 3Box 3IDs stored on 3Box servers.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-provider-or-wallet">3ID Connect</a>: An authentication system for Ceramic that works with all blockchain wallets. 3ID Connect currently supports Ethereum, Cosmos, Filecoin, Polkadot, and EOS with others such as Near and Flow coming soon. This version of 3ID Connect is the cross-chain, Ceramic-compatible replacement to the 3ID Connect currently used in 3Box.  Community infrastructure: 3Box Labs provides free and open access to hosted Ceramic nodes so developers can interact with the network during prototyping and development without needing to run their own node. The <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/#setup">endpoints</a> for these nodes can be found in the Ceramic documentation.  Self.ID (coming soon): A web UI that allows users to manage IDX records for their DID, such as a basic profile, Web2 account links, and Web3 address links from different blockchains. Self.ID will be the sequel to the <a href="https://3box.io/login">3Box profiles hub</a>.   <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/identitylink-services">IdentityLink</a>: A service that issues verifiable credentials which link a user's DID to their Web2 social accounts. 3Box Labs has funded the development of IdentityLink, and will run an instance of the service for anyone to use. Alternatively, you can also run your own IdentityLink.  <p>If you're interested in building out standards and tooling for identity or new use cases, reach out in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Ecosystem development <p>As a nascent protocol, Ceramic needs a lot of support in developing a vibrant ecosystem. 3Box Labs is committed to: developing strategic partnerships, use cases, and collaborations between Ceramic and other projects and ecosystems; funding community development work in the form of bounties and grants; providing Ceramic with financial support until there are self-sustaining token economics on the network; supporting developers through documentation, examples, and educational materials; engaging web standards bodies (i.e. W3C, DIF, IETF, blockchain foundations); and of course, memes and marketing. 😻</p><p>If you're interested in any of the opportunities above, reach out in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Migrating from 3Box <p>If you're currently using 3Box in your project, you'll want to skim through this related post which outlines various upgrade paths for migrating to Ceramic and IDX.</p><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/migrating-from-3box-to-ceramic-and-idx/">  Upgrading from 3Box to Ceramic and IDX  3Box Labs is sunsetting its current line of 3Box products. Learn how to migrate your integration to Ceramic and IDX.  The Ceramic BlogMichael Sena    </a> FAQs  How will Ceramic be governed? <p>Ceramic is already 100% open source, peer-to-peer software and anyone can participate in the network by simply running a Ceramic node. Formal governance of the network will progressively decentralize over time, eventually exiting to the community and a standalone foundation once a token is introduced.</p> Will Ceramic have a native token? <p>Ceramic does not currently have a native token, and one will not be present upon mainnet launch. In time, it is reasonable to assume token economics will be added to the network.</p> What is the relationship between 3Box Labs and Ceramic? <p>While 3Box Labs are the original inventors of the Ceramic Network and have been integral to bootstrapping the Ceramic ecosystem, we're committed to migrating Ceramic to an independently-governed foundation and stepping back to play a reduced role over time. In a way, 3Box Labs is just like any other contributor to an early stage protocol.</p> What is the corporate structure of 3Box Labs? <p>3Box Labs is a US corporation registered in Delaware with employees and contractors located across the US and Europe.</p> What is the business model of 3Box Labs? <p>There is no charge for the software that we produce. The 3Box Labs organization is able to sustain ourselves and fund development of the Ceramic ecosystem through the generous backing of some of Web3's most active and committed investors, including <a href="https://placeholder.vc">Placeholder</a>, <a href="https://www.coinfund.io/">CoinFund</a>, <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/crypto/">Collabfund Cryptocurrency</a>, <a href="http://consensys.com">Consensys</a>, <a href="https://dcg.co/">Digital Currency Group (DCG)</a>, <a href="http://venrock.com">Venrock</a>, <a href="http://northzone.com">Northzone</a>, <a href="https://underscore.vc/">Underscore</a>, <a href="http://protocol.ai">Protocol Labs</a>, and many more who have made equity investments into 3Box Labs. Once Ceramic has a token, 3Box Labs will maintain a modest percent of network tokens. Investors with equity in 3Box Labs will retain a proportion of the 3Box Labs allotment of network tokens. To date, there have been no direct investments in Ceramic Network but there may be an upcoming opportunity for that.</p> How can I get involved? <p>There are many ways to get involved. If you're looking to contribute code, write a client in a new language, run Ceramic nodes, write developer docs, help with community development and partnerships, or anything else, let us know in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.

<p><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/3box-labs-a-future-on-ceramic-network/">3Box Labs is sunsetting 3Box products</a> in favor of the new and more powerful combination of <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> and <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a>. In this post we provide a timeline and various upgrade paths for projects currently using 3Box. </p><p>To learn more about Ceramic, IDX, and the reasons behind the transition, read our previous post:</p><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/3box-labs-a-future-on-ceramic-network/">  3Box is now 3Box Labs – A path forward on Ceramic Network  In this big announcement, we share that 3Box is becoming 3Box Labs to reflect a new focus on the development of the Ceramic Network ecosystem.  The Ceramic BlogMichael Sena    </a> Timeline <p>Ceramic and IDX are currently live on the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">Clay Testnet</a>, but since it's a testnet they're not yet suitable for production deployments. In the next month or two, we will open a soft launch of the Ceramic mainnet to select partners that require more immediate production deployments. This would include current 3Box integrations. Some time after that, mainnet will be opened to the general public.</p><p>We encourage all 3Box developers to begin their setting up and testing their migrations to Ceramic and IDX on the Clay testnet as soon as possible, and reach out to us on the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> if you would like your project to be included in the mainnet soft launch.</p><p>Starting today we will begin formally deprecating 3Box products, but we won't immediately turn them off. Some reasonable amount of time after Ceramic mainnet is opened to the general public, we will disconnect the 3Box servers to complete the transition. Your application will need to be migrated to Ceramic and IDX by that date (TBA) or risk losing access to current 3Box data.</p> Upgrade paths by 3Box product  Profiles API <p>All 40,000+ 3Box profiles will be migrated to IDX. Standard 3Box profile data will now be stored in three different <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/learn/overview/#record">IDX records</a>. Basic profile fields such as those available in the 3Box Profiles app (<code>name</code>, <code>image</code>, <code>background</code>, <code>emoji</code>, etc.) will be stored in a <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/default/#basic-profile">basicProfile</a></code> record. Social verifications (<code>twitter</code>, <code>github</code>) will be stored in an <code>aka</code> record. Links to blockchain accounts will be stored in a <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/default/#crypto-accounts">cryptoAccounts</a></code> record.</p><p>If your application is only reading data from the 3Box profiles API, your migration is very simple. The existing 3Box profiles API will continue to work for both legacy profiles stored on 3Box and also for new and/or migrated profiles stored on IDX with no change needed. Eventually though, you will want to upgrade to <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/">js-idx</a></code> and use the <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/reading/">idx.get()</a></code> method for reading basic profiles, social verifications, and crypto account links stored on IDX. This pattern will be mandatory once we disable the 3Box API service.</p><p>The migration of the three profile data sets mentioned above will automatically occur behind the scenes the first time a user logs in to any application that uses <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-provider-or-wallet">3ID Connect</a>. For this reason, we recommend adding 3ID Connect to your sign-in flow even if you do not need to write data to IDX. This will ensure that the profiles for all of your users are migrated during the migration window.</p><p>If your application is setting or modifying standard data in a user profile, then you should upgrade from <code>3box-js</code> to <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/">js-idx</a></code> and use the <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/writing/">idx.set()</a></code> method to write to any of the profile data sets mentioned above.</p><p>If your application is storing custom, non-standard data in a user profile or if you created an app-specific profile in a 3Box Space, you will need to manually perform a migration for this data set. First, you need to create a <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/creating/">custom definition</a> for your data set. Then, the next time a given user logs in to your site (ideally using <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-provider-or-wallet">3ID Connect</a> so their standard profile data gets automatically migrated), you need to query their profile from the 3Box API, extract your custom data from their profile, then store this data in an IDX record using <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/writing/">idx.set()</a></code>.</p> Profiles App <p>The <a href="https://3box.io/login">3Box Profiles app</a>, which provides a simple UI for creating and managing profiles, will eventually be replaced by Self.ID built on Ceramic and IDX. In the meantime, 3Box Hub can continue to be used since all data will be migrated to IDX. Once Self.ID is live on Ceramic mainnet and using 3ID Connect for authentication, we will launch a marketing campaign to get users to sign in which will migrate their standard profiles to IDX.</p> Spaces and Threads APIs <p>Projects using 3Box spaces and threads APIs for storage and messaging will now need to replicate this functionality in their application using a combination of IDX for identity and either Ceramic documents or other datastores (such as Textile, OrbitDB, SkyDB, etc.) for content storage. </p><p>If you are storing simple JSON content in your space, then we recommend creating a <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/creating/">custom definition</a> for your data model, and using the <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/writing/">idx.set()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/reading/">idx.get()</a></code> methods for interacting with it. For migrating existing data, you should query the data using the 3Box spaces API, then write it to an IDX record after the user has authenticated.</p><p>If you are storing large volumes of data in a space, have high transaction throughput, require encryption, or are using messaging, then there are many nuances and directions your integration could take depending on your specific use case. We'd recommend joining the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> for assistance with your migration.</p> Plugins <p>3Box UI plugins including Comments, Chatbox, and Profile Hover will be deprecated without replacement. We understand this is less than optimal for existing projects, but we as a team have limited capacity to continue maintaining these with a high bar for quality. Since these components are just a thin UI, these functionalities can easily be replicated by adding IDX and Ceramic to your project and coding some simple HTML/CSS.</p> Hosting <p>3Box Labs has provided free hosting and persistence for data stored in 3Box. Moving forward, things will be a bit different due to the decentralized nature of Ceramic.</p><p>For historical 3Box data, 3Box Labs will continue to host and persist this content until some reasonable amount of time (TBA) after Ceramic mainnet has launched. This gives you a chance to upgrade your application and replicate the data of your users to Ceramic and IDX. After the migration window is over, we will be turning off our 3Box servers.</p><p>For new data stored in Ceramic and IDX, 3Box Labs will offer a few free hosted node options:</p>  3Box Labs node: A full Ceramic node that persists the profile data of users who automatically perform their profile migration via 3ID Connect (from any app) and users who manage their profile data in the Self.ID app.   Community gateway: A read-only Ceramic node.  Community dev node: A full Ceramic node used for prototyping and development, but does not guarantee data persistence. It will be wiped from time to time beginning at mainnet launch.  The endpoints for the gateway and dev node can be found in the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/#setup">Ceramic</a> and <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/#set-your-ceramic-node">IDX</a> docs.  <p>If you are building a production application and need to persist data on Ceramic and IDX, it is recommended that you either run your own Ceramic node or utilize a third-party node hosting service for persisting your data. We are engaging with various hosting providers to offer Ceramic nodes, and we expect these to be available over time.</p> What to expect from 3Box products during this transition <p>We are quickly working towards a mainnet release of Ceramic so you can begin to utilize this new powerful infrastructure as soon as possible. However it is likely that you may experience various issues with existing 3Box services in the meantime, such as slowness, loading, syncing issues, or log-in/browser compatibility. We deeply apologize for these inconveniences. The reality is many of these issues are out of our control and are caused from underlying technology dependencies. Normally, we would be working to fix these as soon as possible, but in this case the most impactful thing we can do is ship Ceramic mainnet faster. These are some of the reasons we're excited to move to this new Ceramic-based architecture.</p>  Questions or support? <p>We're always available to answer any questions and help you through this transition. Reach out to us in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> for assistance.</p>

<p>Declaring that blockchain has “gone mainstream,” Forbes today released its 2021 “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2021/02/02/blockchain-50/">Blockchain 50</a>,” featuring companies that have at least $1 billion in revenues or are valued at $1 billion or more and “lead in employing distributed ledger technology.” And, once again, half of the companies on the list are using Hyperledger technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Twenty five companies on the list name at least one Hyperledger technology as part of their solution platform. Hyperledger Fabric, specifically, is cited as a platform by 24 of the companies, topping the list as the most widely used technology. Hyperledger Aries, Indy, Grid and Sawtooth are all also deployed by companies on this list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The annual list, now in its third year, reflects the growing global impact of blockchain technology with 25 members from the U.S., 13 from Europe and a record 12 from Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. All in all, there were 21 companies that were new to the list, and 15 of them, including ones from Australia (BHP), India (Tech Mahindra) and Africa (Sappi), use Hyperledger-based platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the 12 companies that have made the list every year, six (Ant Group, Cargill, DTCC, IBM, ING and Walmart) use Hyperledger technologies.</p>



<p>More than just a basic list of companies and technologies, the Forbes Blockchain 50 provides a snapshot of the market-changing deployments these blockchain leaders have deployed. Accompanying <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2021/02/02/forbes-releases-3rd-annual-blockchain-50-list-of-companies-paving-the-way-using-blockchain-technology/?sh=32e070482e63">stories</a> add even more analysis and context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This annual look at the market is a good reflection point for the traction our technologies have in the current market but also a guidepost to what needs to come next. The increasing global adoption of blockchain – public, private, hybrid – and coming shifts in currency adoption and payments as well as uptake in markets as diverse as mining, telecom, pharma and shipping all point to the growing reach of distributed ledger technology. And, in the face of such challenges as the pandemic, climate change and income equality, it is important to put the focus on what we can accomplish building on blockchain as a cornerstone.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
 In this video the founder of Weebly, David Rusenko talks about their journey to find a product market fit for their Weebly web site platform. 
<p></p>
<p>Before summarizing the video, let’s talk about what is Weebly and what it does.</p>
 What is Weebly? 
<p>Weebly is a web hosting service, headquartered in San Francisco. Its parent company is Square, Inc. On acquisition in April 2018, Weebly had more than 625,000 paying subscribers.</p>
<p>Weebly was founded in 2006 by CEO David Rusenko, Chief Technology Officer Chris Fanini, and former chief product officer Dan Veltri. At the time, Penn State required all students to maintain an Internet portfolio, so they built upon this idea and created software that made it easy for anyone to build a personal website.</p>
<p>Weebly is an easy way for entrepreneurs to build a website or online store. Weebly’s free online website creator uses a simple widget-based site builder that operates in the web browser.</p>
<p>Time listed Weebly among the 50 Best Websites of 2007. In 2011 Business Insider included Weebly into its “15 Cool New Apps That Are Crushing It On Chrome” list.” Also, in 2011, David Rusenko, Weebly’s CEO and co-founder, earned a spot in Forbes “30 Under 30: social/mobile” list.</p>
 What Weebly does? 
<p>Weebly automatically generates a mobile version of each website. Storage is unlimited, but the service restricts individual file sizes. Consumers are given the option to have any url ending in weebly.com, .com, .net, .org, .co, .info, or .us. (example.weebly.com)</p>
<p>Android and iPhone apps are available that allow users to monitor their website traffic statistics, update blog posts and respond to comments, and add or update products if the user has an e-commerce online store.</p>
<p>Basic features for blogging and e-commerce are supported in Weebly as of 2018, site owners could develop simple stores with payments through either PayPal, Stripe or Authorize.net.</p>
<p>Users can choose to incorporate advertisements in their pages, and visitor statistics can be tracked through an in-house tracking tool or Google Analytics. Weebly also has integrated newsletter marketing features. As of 2020, Weebly was offered in 15 languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Polish, Norwegian, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, and Turkish.</p>
 Video Summary 
<p>In February 2016, over 12 years ago Dave wrote the first line of code for Weebly, and from there he grew the company to 50M users and around 350 employees, selling it to Square in May 2018 for $365M. Half of the USA population visits a Weebly site every single month and the key success factor is enabling entrepreneurs to build the websites themselves.</p>
 The journey of Weebly 
<p>He wrote the first line of code 12 years back In February 2006 at Beaver Stadium and by August 2006, 6 months later there were 12 users per day at Weebly.</p>
<p>In October of 2006, 8 months later they were hustling for the buzz on forums, they had created a sign-up link and 30 users had signed up on the record day. In October 2006 he applied to Y -Combinator on slashdot with the deadline for application being 2 hours to go. David Rusenko along with Dan and Chris who are the co-founders of Weebly moved to San Francisco, got accepted at the YC and started working there.</p>
<p>In January 2007 11 months after writing the first line of code, they were working full time at the YC program. Over a year Weebly didn’t have a product market fit.</p>
<p>In April 2007 they were successful in raising $650k from the investors. In May 2007 after 18 months, they were featured in News Week Magazine. They still didn’t have product market fit yet. In October 2007 after almost 20 months the first real traction happened. Every single day they had thousands of people coming. By February 2010 after 48 months they were off to the races.</p>
 What is Product-Market Fit? 
<p>The mantra of Y combinator is “Make something people want”. The idea is the initial stage of making a company, with the phases of a startup being: Idea, Prototype, Launch, Traction, Monetization and Growth.</p>
<p>First 4 phases that are between idea and traction are the initial product market fit search. The last 2 phases are continued product market fit refinement. This stage is really tough.</p>
<p>Top early challenges at a startup –</p>
 
 Finding Product Market Fit. 
 Hiring and building a world-class team. 
 Making Money. 
 Later, how to build an organization that scalably and repeatedly launches great products. 
 
<p>Product Market Fit is the hardest challenge.</p>
 Step 1 – How can you create a market? 
<p>By definition, market research is not going to help because you will create a new market.</p>
<p>Finding a hidden need is the key. What are you a substitute for, what need are you serving better? What job are you being hired for? Where are you getting pulled? Where are people hacking the thing you got and using it in a way you did not intend? Double down on that.</p>
<p>Often what you create will initially seem to fit into an existing market but with less functionality. With the fullness of time, it will become obvious that the job your customers are hiring you for is completely different than the incumbents.</p>
 Step 2 – How to build a remarkable product? 
<p>The following are necessary to build a remarkable product –</p>
 
 Talk to the customers. Develop a market thesis. 
 Listen to their problems not their solutions. It’s absolutely critical to talk to customers and understand their pain. No amazing product was ever created in a vaccum and delivered perfectly on V1. Listen to their proposed solution but dig deeper. 
 Rapid prototyping &amp; user testing – Building a fully functional product is the most expensive possible way to test your hypothesis. Focus on getting to a functional prototype as quickly as possible that you can get in front of users. 
 Don’t worry about scaling monetizing etc. Expect it will take 10x the number of expected iterations but keep your burn low. 
 Build a team that can do this quickly. 
 Build the solution to their problems. 
 Test the solution with them: Two important rules – i. Make sure you are talking to your target customer.<br>
ii. Don’t overthink it. Anecdotal is okay. Most helpful tools in the early days are i. Customer interviews, and i. UX testing sessions. In UX testing session do the following things:<p></p>
 
 Get someone to use your app/service in front of you. 
 Encourage them to give open and honest feedback. 
 Ask them to perform a task. 
 Do not say or do anything. 
 Watch in extreme agony as they struggle to figure it out 
 
 
 
 Step 3 – When to Launch? 
<p>Minimal viable and remarkable product. It is said by Paul Buchheit that “Launch when your product is better than what’s out there.”</p>
 Step 4 – How to Prioritize? 
<p>There are two important points here –</p>
 
 Only one thing matters – Focus only on the things that get you to your next milestone (Here that’s product market fit). 
 Optimize for learning – Most people prioritize by creating a list sorted by cost x benefit. Instead, ask yourself “What is our biggest unknown that would rewrite our priority list.” 
 
 Step 5 – How do I know when I have achieved product market fit? 
<p>Three key metrics –</p>
 
 Returning usage (Day 1,3,7,30 retention). 
 NPS. 
 Paying customer renewal rates: Metrics not included –
 
 Signups – These are more of a reflection of market fit than product-market fit. You have identified something a lot of people want but did you build the right solution? 
 Conversion Rates – It can often be tactical and unrelated to product-market fit. All conversion rates start low. 
 
 
 
<p>When customers start beating a path to your door then you will know you have achieved product-market it.</p>
 Beyond Product Market Fit 
<p>Three key things a startup needs to do –</p>
 
 Product that is meaningfully better than alternatives. 
 How to acquire customers in a differentiated way that scales. 
 Invent your business model without killing your traction. 
 
 Step 6 – Scaling the team 
<p>Do not scale team past 20 before the product market fit. A moderate amount of micromanagement is healthy at this stage. You should be involved in anything important and know all there is to know about your customers.</p>
<p>This helps you make a fast and high-quality decision. Do not delegate anything important Once you have found product market fit, scale aggressively. Then you have found a new market because you are in a race to capture this new market. Build the team aggressively but thoughtfully</p>
<p>No more micromanaging is needed at this stage.</p>
 Step 7 – Building a Brand 
<p>Great brands are built on a core consumer insight ideally the same one your product is built on.</p>
<p>Extremely powerful if you can identify and articulate this insight early on to form the basis of all your communications and marketing. More than anything else this is the foundation of your brand.</p>

<p>Committee Specification 02 ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that STIX Version 2.1 from the OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence. STIX enables organizations and tools to share threat intelligence with one another in a way that improves many different capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response, and more.</p>



<p>STIX v2.1 adds new objects and concepts and incorporates improvements based on experience implementing Version 2.0. The objects and features added for inclusion represent an iterative approach to fulfilling basic consumer and producer requirements for CTI sharing. Objects and properties not included in this version of STIX, but deemed necessary by the community, will be included in future releases.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

 Arup Chatterjee &amp; Puthiya Purayil&nbsp;Sneha  Session <p>The last decade has seen a slow but steady emergence of online literary spaces in India, marked by the ubiquitous nature of the internet and digital technologies, growing mobile phone penetration and increased access to devices such as tablets and e-readers. By literary spaces we refer to online journals, magazines and blogs, as well as reading groups and discussion spaces focused on writing in English and Indian languages. These range from those exclusively focusing on contemporary literature to others that feature writing on news, culture and arts. These spaces raise some intriguing questions about the growth a new online or digital literary culture, which may be mapped through the evolution of reading and writing practices as very explicitly technologized practices, and the changes in the notion of text and textuality, scholarship and pedagogy, among other&nbsp;things.</p><p>Some examples of such spaces that have come up in the recent years are The Little Magazine [1], Muse India [2], Kritya [3], Coldnoon: Travel Poetics [4], Kindle [5], Almost Island [6], The Indian Quarterly [7] and among several others. Many of these journals have both an online and print presence, while some are purely online and seek to reach a diverse audience featuring different genres of writing. While many carry an eclectic mix of creative and critical writing, perceptions about readership on the internet often dictate the form and manner of writing that is featured. The much anticipated and debated ‘disappearance’ of long form writing is one of the questions that may be asked of the emergence of these literary journals, which have in some way re-imagined this form in the digital sphere and have been instrumental in its growth. So even as there are books on twitterature [8], there are interesting ways in which online literary journals have tried to define the space of contemporary writing on the internet in&nbsp;India.</p> Plan <p>This panel discussion proposes to examine this phenomenon of the growth of online literary journals to understand the imagination of the ‘digital’ in their practices of writing and publication, whether as medium, content or context, as a way to explore how writing and reading practices today have been shaped by these changes. This also includes questions on methods of literary analysis that may have changed with the advent of the digital, and from a broader perspective, the production of literary scholarship and pedagogy in India. Some questions that could be points of discussion are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  What is the pedagogical role, if any of digital/online journals? Are they simply cost-effective modes of production of knowledge or are they indicative of some other form discrimination? Perhaps a discrimination between what gets read and what does not? Is a voluminous archive of nineteenth century writings of the same pedagogical merit as a list of 100 Hollywood romantic comedies? If the former is arguably much more educational, why then is the latter the source of the greatest traffic? Is pedagogy then a misnomer, and a non-entity in the world of online magazines?  Can the rise of online magazines be related with the rise of print culture and the subsequent rise of the novel? The novel was educational and, while English was still a very evolving language in the 17th and 18th centuries, the form helped both shape the language and educate the masses, bourgeoisie, and the aristocracy about the nuances of the still-nascent English language. Can a similar function be said to have been fulfilled by online journals? Or have they failed in playing this radical role of disseminating new language and new vocabulary, which is required to articulate new modes and conflicts within modernity — sexualities, queerness, televised elections, middle-eastern (Syrian, Palestinian, Israeli, Iraqi) mayhem in times of democracy, globalization, urbanization, travel, genocide, partition, terrorism, and so on? Are there any exceptions among the journals in being able to somehow fulfil the criteria of engendering a new language? What are the examples, if any? How popular are&nbsp;they?  Is online literature less literary than print? Is it more amenable to news, while print continues to be literary? Or is this only a misconception? Is online literature prone to non-serious, or populist sources of pedagogy, which serve more to titillate through trolling, humour, half-baked information, gossip, or is it playing a serious role too in portions? Apart from those newspapers and journals/magazines which also have print components, which are possibly the portals that create viable, meritorious, and universal categories of knowledge? Or, invocation of ‘merit’ and ‘universal’ essentially a flawed mechanism to judge online literatures?  <p>Addressing some of above questions through a study of two or more online journals, this session will attempt to open them up to a broader discussion on the nature and growth of an online literary culture in India, and the need for and significance of research in this&nbsp;area.</p> Readings <p>None.</p> Notes <p>[1] See: <a href="http://www.littlemag.com/">http://www.littlemag.com/</a>.</p><p>[2] See: <a href="http://www.museindia.com/">http://www.museindia.com/</a>.</p><p>[3] See: <a href="http://www.kritya.in/">http://www.kritya.in/</a>.</p><p>[4] See: <a href="http://coldnoon.com/">http://coldnoon.com/</a>.</p><p>[5] See: <a href="http://kindlemag.in/">http://kindlemag.in/</a>.</p><p>[6] See: <a href="http://almostisland.com/">http://almostisland.com/</a>.</p><p>[7] See: <a href="http://indianquarterly.com/">http://indianquarterly.com/</a>.</p><p>[8] See: <a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307055/twitterature-by-alexander-aciman/9780143117322/">http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307055/twitterature-by-alexander-aciman/9780143117322/</a>.</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day3.LiterarySpaces">IRC 2016: Day 3 #Literary Spaces : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Arup K Chatterjee is a doctorate in English from the Center for English Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University.

   The story of Quibi shows that vast amounts of money and technology alone will not guarantee startup success.

<p></p>
 This is the story of a video platform hiring a massive amount of A-list actors and creating a bunch of original content only to close down&nbsp;just&nbsp;six months after launching. 
 This platform is called Quibi. You can call it the ‘Netflix that never was’. This story is also about how the differences in generations can affect the world of business. 
<p></p>
<p>Before going to the summary of the video, let’s see what is Quibi?</p>
 Quibi 
<p>Quibi is a subscription-based streaming platform designed to deliver short-form scripted and unscripted content to mobile phones.</p>
<p>The name Quibi is a mash-up of the words “quick” and “bites,” a nod to the fact that episodes of Quibi shows will run roughly five to ten minutes in length. The app is available for both in Android (Google play store) and in iOS (App Store).</p>
 Video Summary 
<p>Unlike most of the recent startups, the story of Quibi starts with a baby boomer. The Platform was the brainchild of seasoned entertainment media mogul Jeffry Katzenberg. The interesting thing about the Quibi story wasn’t that Jeff didn’t have the experience to lead a great company. In fact, it was the opposite. He was a management genius in the tv and movie industry.</p>
<p>Katzenberg was born in 1950 in New York coming from a well-off background being the son of a stockbroker and an artist. He would start his career at paramount pictures in the 1970s and quickly rose through the ranks. In 1984, He would move to Disney. Disney’s motion picture division at that time was last in box office sales but by 1987 Jeff had led them to number one.</p>
<p>He would go on to oversee hit tv shows like the Golden Girls and Home Improvement. Jeff was only getting started though. When given the opportunity to revive Disney’s flailing feature animation department, he oversaw films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and the Lion King.</p>
<p>Basically, he was great at his job and whatever he touched turned to gold. Jeff would then use his professional insight to co-found Dreamworks in 1994 with Steven Spielberg. Fast forward to 2018 and presumably, after seeing the success of both Netflix and mobile video consumption in all forms, Jeff saw an opportunity to carve out a market of his own. The platform would be called Quibi and it launched in April of 2020. Katzenberg teamed up with former eBay CEO Meg Whitman to explore his vision.</p>
<p>Because of Jeff Katzenberg’s previous contacts in the entertainment industry, he managed to attract big names such as Jennifer Lopez, Steven Spielberg, Idris Elba, Dwayne the Rock Johnson, Zac Efron, Kevin Hart, LeBron James, Liam Hemsworth, and the list goes on. NBC Universal, SONY, Viacom, Warner Media, J.P.Morgan, Alibaba, Goldman Sachs, and Disney threw money at the project to invest $1.75 billion in total.</p>
<p>Unlike, Tik Tok and general Youtube, the content was high production, slick, and premium. There were three categories:</p>
 
 Reality TV Show. 
 Documentary. 
 Original movies delivered in 10 minutes chapters. 
 
<p>The core vision of the project was that users would watch these shows on a commute to a bus or train station. They were so confident in this core idea that there was no tv option at launch.</p>
<p>There are many problems with this idea. Betting on mobile commuters made their target market overly specific and relatively small, so it was a huge risk at its core. The main problem was, people could just watch Youtube or Netflix. Youtube has two billion users and you can find almost any content you want.</p>
<p>Quibi viewed their content as premium. But there were already competitions out there like Disney+, HBO, Apple TV, and many more. Users did not need another one. But in Quibi’s eye, they figured a gap in the market that there was no premium short-form content for mobile.</p>
<p>Quibi expected 7 million users in the first year and 250 million dollars in subscription revenue. But there was a massive miscalculation. By July, they had over 1 million active users but only 72,000 people signed up to pay. It was clear that the company was in trouble and needed to change.</p>
<p>In six months, the decision was made to pull the plug and the service was canceled. Jeffrey Katzenberg blamed the catastrophic failure on the coronavirus.</p>
<p>There are many reasons behind this failure. Here are some</p>
 
 Users couldn’t organically share viral moments of video snippets. 
 The marketing of Quibi was the worst. Many people didn’t even know that it existed. 
 One of the biggest failures was in content. Organically grown content is king now but Quibi focused on mainly celebrity-based content. 
 
<p>Some lessons from the failure of Quibi</p>
 
 Quibi didn’t understand the market or the audience. 
 The delivery of Quibi was poor. They had money but couldn’t deliver what the targeted audience expected. 
 Quibi could have postponed the launch or change from mobile-only to tv much earlier.

 In this video, HubSpot’s Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Halligan talks about HubSpot’s history going from its first few dozen employees to over a thousand, and how to find and step over the “potholes” that derail growth. 
<p></p>
<p>He shares insights and experiences that describe the journey of Going from Startup to Scaleup.</p>
 About HubSpot 
<p><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a> is a leading growth platform with thousands of customers around the world. Comprised of a Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub, and a powerful free CRM, HubSpot gives companies the tools they need to grow faster.</p>
<p>HubSpot Academy is a worldwide leader in free online training for inbound marketing, sales, and customer service professionals. They specialize in comprehensive certifications, singular topic courses, and bite-sized lessons for professionals looking to grow their career and business.</p>
 Video Summary 
<p>According to Brain Halligan, companies go through different phases. It’s like an S-curve. They go through the beginning which is the tough part and a challenge of can you get product market? Can you build something that another human will part at least a dollar with for. After getting some customers and the product-market fit, can you acquire some customers and get the math to work a little bit.</p>
<p>Can he acquire a customer for $X and get the value of at least $3X out of that, and then the next phase is what he calls the scale-up. The first two phases are kind of the startup phase. This phase is like can you pour a lot of resources into the top of my funnel and acquire customers at $X for at least three $X at scale and not break the Machine and have the wheels fall off. So, it took them probably six-seven years to kind of get out of start-up mode and they have been in the scale-up mode for the last couple of years.</p>
<p>The next phase in the S curve is the disruption phase. In this phase, a company will either get disrupted or run out of market. But they were lucky at HubSpot. When disruption happened, they disrupted themselves rather than having somebody do it. That’s why he believes he will be in the scale up mode for a very long time.</p>
<p>Before going to scale up mode, they started hiring sales and marketing people at a rapid rate, what Brian felt was jumping the gun somewhat. The reason is that most of the tech companies that become great are not run by someone from a sales and marketing background. They are actually run by product people and so he started hiring sales and marketing background people. But it costs them time and a lot of money. His advice is to get the product-market fit, get the early customers and hire one or two salespeople.</p>
<p>To turn a completely perfect stranger in the world into a visitor in their site, they spent four years in that mission to pull that off. What they did is opposite to what everyone else did. What everyone just did was getting very good at something and then expand it.</p>
<p>According to Brian, every company has to have a secret that you have to be right about something that everyone thinks you’re wrong about. He was right about a couple of things. He was right about going very wide and all in one serving businesses, building a scalable big profitable business in the SMB software space. It is very important in start-up to scale up.</p>
<p>Right now, it’s the world’s best time to start a company and at the same time the worst to start a company. Now one can build software compared to ten years ago. Same with hardware or prototype. These are much faster now compared to 10 years ago. The hard part now is shifting to sales and marketing. Because so products right now in the market and there’s so much choice for the buyers.</p>
<p>Now a company has to become a black belt in how to do marketing in a way that stands out and matches the way people buy. That’s turned out to be a long pole now. The long pole used to be building a great product and now it’s the move to how to sell and market that product in an effective way.</p>
<p>The thing that enabled HubSpot to skip from or move from startup to scaleup was improving customer value and improving retention rates. They made retention and customer value a team sport. They changed pricing and packaging, delivering services, and many other things. The pricing model helped a lot.</p>
<p>SaaS ( Software as a service) companies are going through the first challenge as can they get the product-market fit as it is hard to do and there are lots of competitors. They need a secret and they need to be able to build products. HubSpot gave a 90 percent discount for startups that are in the incubators and called it HubSpot for startups. In the second year, they gave a 50 percent discount and from the third year it’s a normal subscription again. This helped them getting hundreds of users from incubators.</p>
<p>Brian concludes with a critical insight. He believes marketing and sales has entirely changed, the traditional approaches like cold calling are dead. Now education, such as their Hubspot Academy courses, has proven to be the most effective way of engaging and enabling not only their existing customers but new prospects too.</p>

 Description 



<p>SMP v2.0 describes a protocol for publishing service metadata within a 4-corner network.</p>



<p>In a 4-corner network, entities are exchanging business documents through intermediary gateway services (sometimes called Access Points). To successfully send a business document in a 4-corner network, an entity must be able to discover critical metadata about the recipient of the business document, such as types of documents the recipient is capable of receiving and methods of transport supported. The recipient makes this metadata available to other entities in the network through a Service Metadata Publisher service.</p>



<p>This specification describes the request/response exchanges between a Service Metadata Publisher and a client wishing to discover endpoint information. A client can either be an end-user business application or a gateway/access point in the 4-corner network. This specification also defines the request processing that must happen at the client.</p>



<p>The TC has received four Statements of Use from IBM, Philip Helger, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and Efact.[2].</p>

<p>The ID2020 Alliance is delighted to welcome U.K.-based Nuggets as the newest member of its vibrant community. The Alliance is made up of public and private sector organizations who share a common commitment to good ID for&nbsp;all.</p><p>The Nuggets proposition could not be clearer, proclaiming boldly that “privacy is a fundamental human right” and signaling an immediate alignment with the ID2020 Manifesto — the statement of principles that guide the Alliance’s work.</p><blockquote>“We are always excited to welcome organizations who so wholeheartedly embrace our values,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “When we talk about complex issues, such as identity and data ownership, we know that transparency is essential to building trust — with customers, partners, and users. We could not be more excited to welcome Nuggets to the Alliance as we work together toward a future with good digital identity for&nbsp;all.”</blockquote><p>Nuggets offers a robust decentralized self-sovereign ID and payments platform, that enables consumers to retain control of their personal information and businesses to protect their customer’s data. Their solution leverages biometrics for verification, strong customer authentication, and cryptographic proof of identity to facilitate customer onboarding (KYC &amp; KYB), single sign-on with biometrics, omnichannel payments, age verification, contactless delivery and verified two-way communication transactions through a scalable, decentralized digital&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Founded in 2016 by Alastair Johnson and Seema Khinda Johnson, Nuggets is available in Europe and Australia and is expanding its platform into new verticals including financial services, which has been advanced by a significant partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions, one of the largest protectors of private and confidential data in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Nuggets has already won numerous awards for its industry-leading FinTech offerings, including most recently from Deutsche Bank. As part of their recent growth, Nuggets has established commercial partnerships with global companies such as LexisNexis Risk Solutions, LatPay, QFPay, and a variety of other organizations.</p><blockquote>“Frustratingly, 2020 was the worst year on record for data breaches, signaling a seismic shift in consumer attitudes towards privacy,” said Alastair Johnson, CEO &amp; Founder of Nuggets. “On this Data Privacy Day — held annually on January 28 to create awareness about the importance of respecting privacy, safeguarding data, and enabling trust — it feels particularly timely for Nuggets to join forces with ID2020 and the other brand leaders that are helping to make protecting customers’ data a top priority in this increasingly data-driven digital&nbsp;world.”</blockquote><p>The ID2020 Alliance also continues to grow at a healthy pace, welcoming organizations from the public and private sectors that share our commitment to user-managed privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID. As an Alliance, we are only as strong as our members and we are thrilled to add Nuggets to the partnership as we move — together — towards providing good ID for&nbsp;all.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p><p>About Nuggets</p><p>Nuggets is an award-winning, decentralized, self-sovereign identity and payment platform. It helps organizations to protect customer data while giving customers a frictionless, seamless experience. Nuggets is the only platform of its kind that truly brings together payments and ID, utilizing self-sovereign data principles.</p><p>Nuggets was founded on the belief that each of us should own and control our personal information. No one else. Privacy is a fundamental human right, and a fundamental change is needed in the way personal data is&nbsp;stored.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/uk-based-nuggets-joins-the-id2020-alliance-aa984893fa48">UK-Based Nuggets Joins the ID2020 Alliance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.3finery.com/">3Finery</a>&nbsp;uses ground-breaking&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality#:~:text=Augmented%20reality%20(AR)%20is%20an,%2C%20haptic%2C%20somatosensory%20and%20olfactory.">Augmented Reality</a>&nbsp;(AR) technology which can boost customer engagement with remote marketing campaigns by portraying goods, services and venues in innovative ways. It is expected to appeal strongly to businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The new twist on traditional AR methods was developed at the School of Computing over a three-year period by Professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drkennymitchell/">Kenny Mitchell</a> and his former PhD student <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/llogaricasas/">Dr Llogari Casas</a>.</p>
 Intermediated Reality 
<p>3finery provides an Augmented Reality technology that enables objects to interact, play and receive messages remotely as if they were magically coming to life. Their software provides a novel way of interaction with the user’s environment and can be easily integrated to already existing solutions.</p>
<p>As Llogari explains at 14m:05s their unique innovation is a concept they define as “Intermediated Reality” (IR), the ability for people to interact with objects brought to life through Augmented Reality capabilities.</p>
<p>The technology can be used to enhance products, services and venues from businesses that have interaction with their environment through mobile devices. They offer unique interactive experiences with the ability to better understand customer needs by gathering valuable user data from their interactions, and their technology is built around social media with virality as the core value proposition and can be used as an incentive to make users interact with third parties software.</p>
<p>The underlying technology behind 3finery can be applied in a variety of verticals, such as, theme parks, museums, interactive toys, social network communication or entertainment and beyond.</p>

   Better Internet Search have set themselves the most audacious of startup ambitions: A better search engine than Google!

 As he describes in the feature video, Gordon Povey of Better Internet Search is one of Scotland’s Digital Disruptors. 
<p></p>
<p>Our goal with the DigitalScot.live webinar series is to showcase Scottish startups setting out to disrupt major industries, and Better Internet Search is taking on the most audacious of challenges: To build a better search engine than Google!</p>
<p>The theme of Gordon’s talk is how many “experts” have told them what a foolhardy goal this is, and you’d be forgiven for agreeing with them when you consider just how massive and ubiquitous Google is.</p>
<p>However at one point in time Google was just two guys in a garage and they were being told the same thing, with objective of displacing the incumbents like Altavista being their foolhardy mission.</p>
<p>That is the nature of Digital Disruption in the Internet era, no one is safe, any one can be toppled from the top slot simply through a new player having a unique competitive advantage that moves the game to an entirely new playing field.</p>
 Integrated Commerce Search 
<p>For the main introduction Gordon sets the scene by highlighting search users have two main issues with the Google approach: Data privacy and advertising. Google very intrusively tracks all of your online behaviours and uses that data to personalize adverts at you.</p>
<p>So Better Internet Search is going for a different model, one that keeps your personal data entirely private and doesn’t offer any advertising.</p>
<p>This leaves you wondering what possible options are there then to generate revenues, but as he explains from 13m:00s, Gordon and his team are pioneering an alternative model, one that charges users for searching, paid through tokens that they top up into their search wallet.</p>
<p>The core of their model is that should a user proceed to an e-commerce store as a result of their search and make a purchase, the user is rewarded with tokens back into their wallet. They can also directly purchase top ups.</p>
<p>From 25m:00s Gordon demonstrates where this can lead, showing an integrated search / product commerce experience. Given it is such a popular and distinct use of searching, to find products you want to buy, there is huge potential to offer a much improved, end-to-end integrated experience.</p>
<p>Thus Better Internet Search has defined a unique niche in the marketplace where they could achieve product superiority, and the dream of winning the David vs Goliath battle with Google suddenly seems more than realistic.</p>

 Next week Stephen Ingledew joins our webinar series to present on ‘<a href="https://summit.digitalscot.live/talks/developing-the-fintech-community-cluster/">Developing the FinTech Community and Cluster</a>‘. 
<p>A helpful background is available through the feature video from Scottish Development International where Stephen, along with Modulr’s chief financial officer Chris Brooks, provide an overview of the Scottish FinTech sector.</p>
<p></p>
 What is FinTech? 
<p>FinTech is a portmanteau of the two terms “finance” and “technology”. It is an umbrella term for innovative technology-enabled financial services and the business models that accompany those services. FinTech is used to define a new tech that seeks to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services.</p>
<p>It also ​​​refers to the use of advanced technology to supply financial services to consumers and businesses — from buying and selling cryptocurrency to authenticating electronic payments. It can take the form of software, a service, or a business that provides technologically advanced ways to make financial processes more efficient by disrupting traditional methods.</p>
<p>In some cases, it includes hardware, too like smart, connected piggy banks or virtual reality (VR) trading platforms.</p>
<p>The FinTech industry is composed of companies that use technology to make financial services more efficient. It includes any company that provides financial services through software or other technology and also includes anything from mobile payment apps to cryptocurrency.</p>
 What does FinTech do? 
<p>Some fintech developments have improved traditional services, for example, mobile banking apps, while others have revolutionized services such as pay per mile car insurance or creating new products, such as Bitcoin. From mobile banking and insurance to cryptocurrency and investment apps, fintech has broad applications.</p>
<p>FinTech is currently helping companies, business owners, and consumers to better manage their financial operations utilizing specialized software and algorithms that are used on computers and, increasingly, smartphones enabling financial services that can make online transactions and gain access to insurance or credit.</p>
<p>Some of FinTechs traditional uses are crowdfunding platforms (Patreon, Kickstarter, GoFundMe, etc), blockchain and cryptocurrency, mobile payments, insurance, robo advising and stock trading apps and budgeting apps, online lending business and RegTech (regulatory technology).</p>
 Video Summary 
<p>In 2018 FinTech Scotland set out with an agenda of three parts, developed through three circles namely FinTech Cluster, FinTech Collaboration, and FinTech Community.</p>
<p>FinTech Scotland works for both consumers and businesses to improve the outcomes and build a participative cluster involving people and organizations from across Scotland. It has 136 member firms and 15 firms in the process of joining, a rapid growth from 26 at the beginning in 2018.</p>
<p>FinTech examples from across the world operating in Scotland include Modulr, Avaloq, Agrud, Encompass, FNZ and Gobill. FNZ is one of the most famous FinTech firms, with its HQ situated at Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The innovative FinTech community is reinventing financial services through financing, access, protection, affordability, engagement, giving, literacy, identity, community, payments, and cash flow. FinTech is also reinventing the regulatory landscape to improve the outcomes for both businesses and customers. FinTech does not only have a reputation in banking and insurance but also in capital markets.</p>
<p>It’s also responding to COVID 19 challenges. The global pandemic has accelerated the adoption of new technologies and the demand for innovation. They are helping businesses to improve themselves and become sustainable at speed and to adapt into the digital world.</p>
<p>FinTech Scotland is connecting the community by learning and supporting each other through innovation, driving outcomes, building impactful collaboration and an inclusive cluster, addressing regulatory priorities through progressive engagement and focusing on challenging issues of the environment.</p>
<p>The cluster is developing global engagement with the help of UK International FinTech Development, FinTech Global Trade Missions, European FinTech Collaboration Group and European FinTech Cluster Excellence.</p>
<p>In 2019 Fintech Scotland celebrated Scotland’s International Fintech Festival, sharing financial innovation around the world, and received ‘Scotland’s Fintech Cluster Achieves European Excellence Recognition’ in January 2020.</p>
<p>Recently they <a href="https://www.insider.co.uk/news/fintech-scotland-proposes-new-research-23381951">released a report</a> proposing plans for increased research and innovation to drive acceleration in fintech development across the UK.</p>
 Modulr 
<p>Modulr is a payment alternative for digital businesses, enabling end to end payments through three core services namely automate, embed and launch. Modulr maximize payment efficiency across the receivables payables collections disbursement etc. It helps people to build new banking or new payment services.</p>
<p>Modulr was founded in 2016 in London, with the CEO, leadership team, investors and funding team working from London. Modulr raised £43 million funding and moved to Scotland in June 2020 and since then has accelerated growth in Edinburgh to 120 people.</p>
<p>It has enjoyed a massive success through moving to Scotland. Modulr was awarded a £10m ‘Government Banking Innovation’ grant, and moving to Edinburgh empowered Modulr through a skilled workforce, customers, strong professional services and support, economics, and through a small and well-connected ecosystem and financial services and tech market.</p>
<p>Modulr grew quickly in Edinburgh because the city has major banks, a strong FinTech network and fantastic platform that enables companies with ambitions to grow rapidly. The challenges in Edinburgh were a competitive talent market, limited flexible office options in central Edinburgh, the availability of Scottish funding and the challenge of managing split locations whilst growing quickly.</p>
<p>Modulr managed the distance challenge by ensuring solid governance, established processes and procedures, communication, technology, agility and leadership.</p>

 Introducing, Clay <p>After more than a year of hard work, we're excited to officially unveil the Ceramic Clay Testnet. Starting today you can experiment, prototype, and develop applications on top of the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic">Ceramic protocol</a>. </p><p>To get started, try the <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">demo app</a> and jump into the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/quick-start/">docs</a>.</p> What is Ceramic? <p>Ceramic is a public, permissionless, censorship-resistant network for managing mutable information on the open internet. Ceramic combines a stack of cutting-edge web3 technologies including <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://libp2p.io">libp2p</a>, blockchain, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, and <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-store-signed-and-encrypted-data-on-ipfs/">standards for authenticated (signed/encrypted) data</a> to give developers the ability to build completely serverless applications using dynamic, verifiable, decentralized data.</p><p>Ceramic functions like a global-scale, permissionless NoSQL document datastore, but ensures strict ordering of document updates and data integrity without relying on database servers or trusted third-parties to perform mutations and transforms on content. Since Ceramic is built on a completely peer-to-peer network, all documents are openly discoverable and can be queried by any participant on the network or referenced in other documents.</p> Smart documents <p>In Ceramic all content is stored in smart documents, which are append-only IPFS logs where each commit (update) is signed by a decentralized identifier (DID) for verifiability and then subsequently anchored in a blockchain for consensus. Each smart document basically functions as its own independent doc-chain (a document blockchain). Here are some key features of smart documents:</p>  Mutable content: Store information in collections of mutable documents like your favorite NoSQL document database.  Immutable identifiers: Every document gets a globally unique persistent identifier, called a <code>DocID</code>. This DocID will never change regardless of how many updates are made to the document.  Verifiable signatures: Every update to a document must be signed by the DID of its owner, providing verifiability to its content.  Schema-enforced content: Documents can have schemas which will be enforced by the protocol. This allows for data integrity and simple cross-platform interoperability.  Strict versioning: Every update made to a document is anchored in a blockchain, so its commits follow a strict order. This allows the protocol to guarantee the state of a document at every commit and allows its content to be auditable and trusted at all times.  Programmable logic: Define custom rules for state transitions to enforce who, how, and when your document is updated without centralized servers. Rules can react to direct events such as a signature from the owner, or indirect events such as an update in another document.  Configurable persistence: Nodes can back up documents to any centralized or decentralized data storage platform.   How'd we get here? <p>Clay is the result of the tireless commitment by many in the community to the mission of creating an open dataweb free of silos. Since we first debuted a proof of concept of the Ceramic protocol in early 2020, the Ceramic codebase has had 1300+ git commits, 650+ releases, and dozens of top-tier projects in the Web3 ecosystem have been hard at work testing integrations and providing us feedback along the way.</p><p>This release is the final major milestone on a long journey to launching the Ceramic Fire mainnet, which is slated for the end of Q1 or early Q2 2021. Want to start building on Ceramic today? Continue reading to dive into the specifics of what's possible on Clay.</p> What's new for Clay?   A live, fully-functioning public test network that simulates mainnet as closely as possible  Three JavaScript clients: <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/clients/#core-client">Core client</a>, <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/clients/#http-client">HTTP client</a>, and <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/quick-start/">CLI</a>  Loads of new protocol features, improvements, and performance optimizations  The final breaking API changes before mainnet 🤞  Document anchoring on Ethereum's Ropsten (<code>EIP155:3</code>) and Rinkeby (<code>EIP155:4</code>) testnets  A dedicated p2p gossip network using the libp2p topic <code>/ceramic/testnet-clay</code>  A new <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network">documentation site</a>   Things to keep in mind   The Clay network is experimental and should only be used for prototyping, development, and testing purposes. It's great for getting your application ready for mainnet.  Documents created on Clay will not be portable to mainnet. These are separate networks, similar to Ethereum's testnets and mainnet.  Clay does not yet have a purely decentralized peer discovery mechanism for nodes, and instead uses a curated <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/peerlist">peerlist</a></code> for node discovery. This is because the <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-kad-dht">DHT</a> functionality in <code><a href="https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p">js-libp2p</a></code> is not yet sufficiently performant for production, however it will be ready by the time mainnet launches.  <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a protocol for cross-platform decentralized identity built on top of Ceramic. The IDX SDK is a useful tool for adding decentralized identity functionality to your already existing application, and is an easy entry point to get started with Ceramic. IDX runs on the Clay testnet and is currently in beta, so it has the same guarantees as Ceramic and will move to production when mainnet launches.  You may encounter a few bugs and/or performance issues. We've done our best to make things work as smoothly as possible, but this is still a testnet. Please report any issues by <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/issues">opening a ticket on Github</a> so we can fix them as soon as possible.  We're always available in <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a> to answer questions and help you out along the way. We're excited to see what you build on Ceramic!   Getting started   <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network">Jump into the developer docs</a>  <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">Try the Playground demo app</a>   What's next? <p>After Clay, our efforts will be 100% focused on releasing mainnet as quickly and safely as possible. We're targeting the end of Q1 or early Q2 2021.</p><p>The Fire mainnet release will include additional performance optimizations, fully decentralized peer discovery, a new pubsub topic <code>/ceramic/mainnet</code>, document anchoring on the Ethereum mainnet (<code>EIP155:1</code>), network monitoring, public analytics, bug fixes, and more.</p><p>The community is also gearing up for mainnet with many announcements, launches, and partnerships to go live. We will be sharing more information on those as they are available.</p>

<p>Come for the summaries, stay for the clip reel, bookmark for the&nbsp;links!</p><p>DIF held its semiannual “Face-to-Face” community’ event this week, and man what an event it was! For obvious reasons, it was virtual for the second time, and for the first time, it spanned both Zoom and the interactive social platform <a href="http://gather.town">gather.town</a>, giving a more intimate atmosphere and allowing for more organic networking than often happens at “tele-conferences.” If you missed it in part or in full, you’ll find below summaries and recordings of the main&nbsp;events.</p> 1# Opening remarks, and an update on DIF-OIDF Collaboration <p>Executive Director Rouven Heck got us started on a warm and welcoming note, bringing the largely unfamiliar audience up to date on DIF’s member-driven nature and its goals for 2021. These include a more engaged membership, more co-development at various scales, and more work items reaching stable specifications and publicly going from community incubation to commercial production.</p><p>Then, presenting from Tokyo (actually a little before the opening remarks, as is our asynchronous way here at DIF) Kristina Yasuda (<a href="https://online2020.mydata.org/presenter/kristina-yasuda/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://mydata.org">Mydata</a>) gave an update on her new role as the liaison between DIF and the OpenID Foundation. Joined by DID Authentication WG chair Oliver Terbu (<a href="https://mesh.xyz/">Consensys Mesh</a>), Kristina gave an overview not only of the ongoing SIOP work in the AB/Connect WG at OIDF, but also other identity-related efforts that might be of interest to DIF members, including the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/mobile/">MODRNA</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">KYC-IDA</a> working&nbsp;groups.</p> 2# Interoperability and DIDComm working&nbsp;group <p>The “main stage” working group presentations started with the Interoperability Working Group, which has taken a break from its test-harness/test-suite role under its new chairs to concentrate on educational materials that support broader interoperability among verifiable credential protocols… and a better understanding of those protocols among decision-makers on the business side of the decentralized-identity business.</p><p>The chairs (Pam, Kaliya, and Juan) gave an overview of the last 6 months of their group, its publications and maps, and other products, an overview of their invited guests (and handy recordings), as well as the “parking lot” for future discussion/research topics for&nbsp;Q1.</p><p>The DID Communications Working Group, energetically presented by Chair Sam Curren (<a href="http://indic.io">Indicio</a>, <a href="http://mattr.global">Mattr</a>), got the ball rolling with a swift and accessible overview of the group’s rapid progress from ambitious roadmap to the sophisticated draft specification since the last conference. In addition to the specification reaching its final rounds of editorial clean-up, many “nice to have” protocols that were put out of scope while the group focused on the specification alignment process (specifically a Bluetooth implementation and an NFC implementation) have spun out into parallel work items, which are already underway. In other DIDComm news, DIF member <a href="http://jolocom.com">Jolocom</a> announced this week a DIDComm v2 sample implementation in Rust, built for the company’s [otherwise completely non-Aries!] wallet. It seems 2021 will be the year of&nbsp;DIDComm!</p> 3# Claims and Credentials, Presentation Exchange, and&nbsp;Sidetree <p>The Claims and Credentials group’s co-chair Wayne Chang (<a href="http://spruceid.com">Spruce Systems</a>) took a quick stroll through the new work item initiation process (currently being extended to other WGs DIF-wide) and the other major work items: the paused Credential Taxonomy, the work item formerly known as Credential Manifest, the new VC Marketplace.</p><p>DIF’s first Executive Director, Daniel Bucher (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a>), gave a quick overview of the Presentation Exchange spec, an ambitious specification for scaffolding credential requests and presentations between unfamiliar systems. After months of collaboration with core architects of the Aries ecosystem from DIF member <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a>, the presentation and request mechanics have been aligned with the upcoming iteration of the relevant Aries “Present Proof” RFCs, making this a major interoperability win that bridges the largest production ecosystems the decentralized identity space has yet seen. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">specification</a> is in the very home stretch of reaching 1.0 status and in the last weeks of a period of public comment, so give it a read and leave some <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange/issues">issues</a> soon if you have&nbsp;any!</p><p>Daniel also presented the other specification he has been tirelessly driving for even longer than the Presentation Exchange work item at Claims and Credentials — the Sidetree specification, which reached v1.0 this week. In this quick, extemporaneous video, Daniel runs through some common misconceptions and relates the overarching Sidetree Layer-2 architecture to Microsoft’s specific Ion implementation, the work of DIF members <a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey</a> on a Hyperledger Fabric implementation, DIF members <a href="https://transmute.industries">Transmute</a>’s Ethereum implementation, and even the affinities with DIF’s next working group to spin out of I&amp;D,&nbsp;KERI.</p> 4# Secure Data Storage WG, Identifiers and Discovery WG, and&nbsp;KERI <p>From potentially universal specifications for presenting credentials, we jumped straight to potentially universal specifications for storing credentials and other confidential data. The Secure Data Storage working group co-chair Dmitry Zangadulin (<a href="https://digitalbazaar.com/">Digital Bazaar</a>) talked about the group’s first and flagship specification, <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">Confidential Storage</a>, which is designing a modular and DID-controlled storage protocol that would allow so-called “encrypted data vaults” (with or without a coupled authorization server called an “identity hub”) to create a portable, secure, redundant, and replicable storage layer for the decentralized identity world. In addition to bringing the audience up to speed on the current status of the specification work and prototyping, the group also gave a quick overview of the many <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">guest presentations</a> since the last F2F, spanning the cutting edge of decentralized storage and next-generation database projects.</p>The architecture of the Confidential Storage draft <a href="https://identity.foundation/confidential-storage/">specification</a><p>Identifiers and Discovery WG, the oldest continuously-active group at DIF, gave a detailed overview of its impressive roster of donations, work items, and updates since the last F2F. Chair Markus Sabadello (<a href="http://danubetech.com">DanubeTech</a>) ran through this long list. These include research on WebID and key recovery/roll-over systems, the evolving WebID pre-standard being discussed in some browser groups of W3C, new common libraries in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-common-dotnet/branches">.NET</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-key.rs">Rust</a>. Markus also explained to those new to the space the group’s broader mission of supporting the DID ecosystem and DID methods in particular as they experiment with decentralized governance and infrastructure. (Of particular interest to close watchers of the space was his update about the Universal Resolver project offering up very high-level analytics (privacy-preserving, of course!) about resolution activity on the public “testnet” service.)</p><p>Markus’ co-chair, Sam Smith (<a href="https://prosapien.com/">ProSapien</a>, <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/">Digital Trust Ventures</a>) talked about his passion-project, soon to become its own DIF WG: Key Event Receipt Infrastructure, or “KERI.” <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/keri">KERI</a> offers a new way of thinking of the “layers” of decentralized identity infrastructure, focusing doggedly on the “bottom half” of the concerns of a traditional DID method and separating itself entirely from the “top half,” including method-specific namespacing and all [clear-text] data. After months of honing the skill, Sam impressively conveys a considerable portion of the core concepts in this complex and nuanced system in a record-setting fifteen&nbsp;minutes!</p> 5# Special Interest Groups: Product Managers, Banking and Finance, and Healthcare <p><a href="http://transmute.industries">Transmute</a>’s Margo Johnson, co-chair of the Product Managers’ community of practice, gave a quick overview of their very generative and generous non-technical working group. In addition to producing a useful <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/product-managers/blob/main/agenda.md">open-source corpus</a> of discussion notes, presentations, and UX blotters, and the like, the group is also an important watering hole for product and user interface design thinking, covering such topics as accessibility, ethics, and adoption strategies, for products but also for new concepts of software (and better user interface patterns) more generally.</p><p>Co-chairs Paul Dunphy (<a href="http://onespan.com">OneSpan</a>) and Isaac Patka (<a href="http://bloom.co">Bloom</a>) gave a fascinating overview of the activity of their fast-moving and diligent Banking and Finance open group. Paul introduces the philosophy, focus, and working methods of the group, then Isaac overviews the invited guests to date. In addition to hearing reports from SSI researchers in the financial services space, the group is also building out a wiki of relevant regulatory events in the space, as well as opportunities in the space like the UK’s financial regulatory sandbox, the subject of their next meeting with <a href="http://evernym.com">Evernym</a>’s Andy&nbsp;Tobin.</p><p>Interim Chair Juan Caballero (<a href="http://learningproof.xyz">LearningProof</a>) gave a brief overview of the discussion group’s intentions and format. These could respectively be summarized as exploring the opportunities and access points for innovations in the healthcare space, and a recorded invited-guest series where researchers from the space offer “reverse pitches” about pain points and problems that decentralized identity might be uniquely suited to solve. As with all of DIF’s special-interest groups, the group is open to DIF non-members and interested parties can reach the chairs through the group’s <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/healthcare/blob/main/agenda.md">repository</a>, where they can also find notes and recordings of all guests to&nbsp;date.</p> Stay Tuned and Get&nbsp;Involved <p>As you can see, the DIF community has grown considerably since the last F2F, and keeps expanding into new terrains and modalities.

   As technology continues to advance across many industries, the frequency and severity of security threats have risen as well.

			<p>As technology continues to advance across many industries, the frequency and severity of security threats have risen as well. Breaches can be costly, and without a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy in place, many organizations may be left vulnerable. “In this current security landscape, the threats have only multiplied,” says Jeremy Livingston, Associate Vice President for Security Solutions Development and Chief Information Security Officer. “Many of our members have had to rapidly deploy and implement new solutions for remote learning, remote management of IT systems and devices, and teleconferencing. All of these things have brought increased risks—with attacks rising close to 3000 percent.”</p>
<p>The changes brought on by COVID-19 are testing countless businesses’ security strategies and not everyone is prepared to defend themselves against increasing threats. “Unfortunately, the threats have only multiplied as everyone moves to telework and remote learning,” says Gregg Chottiner, Vice President for Technology Advancement and Chief Information Officer, Edge. “The attack sector has increased tenfold by the ability for hackers to now target the weak links in an organization’s security posture. The average data breach cost in the U.S. last year was almost $5 million, and this number seems to be rising at around 20 percent annually.”</p>
<p>Employing Preventative Protection<br>
Developing a strong defense strategy is key and involves understanding threats and how to prevent them. “The cost of one of these breaches will far exceed most cybersecurity insurance policies,” says Livingston. “Luckily, there are many ways for us to stop that chain of attack. For most ransomware attacks, there are at least five different ways that an organization can stop that attack from occurring. This includes extensive user training, users avoiding phishing emails, and next-generation firewalls with updated block lists. Fortunately, there are many opportunities for organizations to cover all of these bases properly from a defensive standpoint.”</p>
<p>A proactive approach to cybersecurity can help boost the success of risk mitigation and allow an organization to ensure information is safeguarded over the long-term. “Many organizations often do not spend a lot of time thinking about cybersecurity until they get attacked or until their data is stolen,” says Chottiner. “Edge is trying to create awareness around security threats and show the value and cost benefit of doing this work upfront. One of the common themes in this realm is not if you’re going to be hacked, but when. In fact, there are organizations that have been already breached and are not aware of this threat because they do not have correct monitoring and logging of systems.”</p>
<p>Depending on an organization’s needs and current security profile, Edge can recommend solutions to assist in addressing specific vulnerabilities. “For some of the organizations we work with, we have made such improvements in the security measures that the cost of insurance has decreased,” shares Livingston. “Cyber insurance rates are based upon which defenses are in place versus the current risk levels and threats. We can actually help alter that equation to be more cost-effective, all without an attack even having occurred.”</p>

			<p>Effectively Navigating Risk<br>
Handling the difficult and complex nature of today’s technical environments is no easy feat, making the roles of chief information officer (CIO) and a chief information security officer (CISO) more important than ever in helping an organization navigate these challenging times. While each has different responsibilities, the CISO and CIO work in tandem to create a holistic security approach. “The CIO is responsible for the overall technology health of an organization and the CISO is a critical role in protecting data, data management, and academic and administrative computing,” says Chottiner. “A challenge we see with many organizations is they have an IT leader or CIO, but not a CISO. Many are in need of the knowledge, skills, and experience of a CISO to understand the problems and vulnerabilities of today’s systems.”</p>
<p>Livingston adds that a CISO focuses primarily on organizational risk management and works with executives to set appropriate levels for risk. They then evaluate and maintain systems and data with that risk level in mind. “The CISO brings a different skillset and security background to the organization and helps to keep the CIO more informed; allowing for more educated decisions regarding the technology that is being used and implemented. The CIO and CISO work hand in hand as partners, both keeping the organization functional and secure.”</p>
<p>Developing Cybersecurity Strategies<br>
A CISO plays an essential role in IT leadership and developing actionable cybersecurity strategies and policies, but not every organization has the ability to hire for this position full-time. To help organizations fill this gap and improve their security effectiveness, EdgePro virtual CISO (vCISO) services offers an affordable way to gain the expert insight and skills they need. “As a vCISO, we embed ourselves into the organization and work closely with the CIO or technology director,” shares Livingston. “For organizations that have budget constraints or do not need a full-time resource, the vCISO gives them the expertise they need. The vCISO performs the same functions that a normal CISO would, but at a much lower cost.”</p>
<p>vCISO services are available on a virtual, fractional, or full-time basis to meet each member’s unique security needs. “Edge’s vCISO services give members the ability to access a qualified credentialed individual to perform required services; only paying effectively for what is needed,” says Chottiner. “As part of a holistic security approach, members also have access to the Cybersecurity Health Check Program, a proactive, standards-based cybersecurity tool. Periodically assessing network security is a crucial part of a business’s cybersecurity plan and this subscription-based program generates monthly reports that provide a snapshot of network security and outlines actionable intelligence to remediate any new vulnerabilities.” Along with regular assessments, Edge’s cybersecurity experts collaborate with an organization’s team to provide knowledge of cybersecurity frameworks and create a long-term strategy that aims to improve cyber defense over time.</p>
<p>Improving Cyber Defense<br>
Edge is dedicated to helping member organizations improve their cyber defenses in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible. By using a shared services model, members can access a variety of top-notch products and services at a much lower cost. “The shared services model provides our members with a better value,” says Livingston. “Edge will take time to review an organization’s existing security measures and ensure these controls meet their organizational risk needs. We can suggest different security solutions that may be useful and help implement changes if necessary. In addition, we also provide user training for staff and faculty members in how to effectively monitor and evaluate their security posture.”</p>
<p>By developing a thorough understanding of potential risks, an organization is able to make more risk-informed decisions on how resources should be distributed to defend against those risks. “Our Cybersecurity Health Check is an affordable method for regularly revealing vulnerabilities and gaining access to a vCISO,” says Chottiner. “Edge can then help design and execute a personalized security program based on the organization’s needs and budget.”</p>
<p>For member organizations interested in establishing an Edge vCISO service or conducting a Cybersecurity Health Check, Edge’s sales team will set up an initial meeting to evaluate current needs and answer any questions. “Our process is completely collaborative and we will work with an organization’s technology director or CIO to determine the areas we need to focus on,” says Livingston. “We will give feedback, make recommendations, and perform a risk assessment to determine where Edge can provide the most value and immediate reduction in risk. We understand that finding cybersecurity staff can be a challenge or is not always possible financially for an organization. EdgeSecure aims to alleviate this problem and offer the insight, expertise, and solutions needed to create a robust cyber security plan and meet the challenges of the future.”</p>

<p>Instructional Technology as a Service<br>
In the 21st century, high-quality learning not only utilizes technology, but demands it. The science of instructional technology is not just about finding a tool to meet an immediate need, but understanding how educational or instructional technology tools fit together to meet the learning outcomes set forth by faculty, administration, and instructional designers. The EdgePro team works with your staff to not only identify what tools can meet your technical needs, but how they can be used to facilitate learning and advance the academic mission and vision of your institution.</p>
<p>Instructional Design as a Service<br>
There is far more to building online courses and programs than simply digitizing the content originally built for in person instruction. Quality online learning demands meticulous design, development, and revision of engaging and interactive online, blended, or face-to-face courses. The EdgePro team provides the pedagogical expertise to collaborate with your faculty and subject matter experts to create meaningful learning experiences for students through the creation, conversion, or expansion of online courses and programs.</p>

			<p>The Edge optical fiber high-performance network, EdgeNet, was created to give connected members an exceptional connectivity experience, pushing past what traditional Internet service providers (ISP) can offer. To meet the unique needs of Edge member organizations, this purpose-built solution was specifically designed to enhance members’ ability to deliver services to their key stakeholders, such as students, faculty, researchers, and staff. “Unlike commercial Internet providers, EdgeNet services are custom-built to support the needs of our membership,” shares Bruce Tyrrell, Associate Vice President Programs &amp; Services, Edge. “During the past year, we continued to expand the features and capabilities EdgeNet has to offer. For example, we increased the ability of our network to handle intercampus backbone capacity and have grown the number of 100 gigabit connections that we’re providing to our members for intercampus connectivity. We’ve also added Esports providers to our peering fabric, as this functionality has become an increasingly important element of the campus experience. Many institutions want to attract more students by offering real-time gaming and competition capabilities, and this update to EdgeNet has greatly increased the performance of these types of programs for colleges and universities.”</p>
<p>Over the last six months, the EdgeNet engineering team has executed plans for significant network capacity and capability growth to continue to meet the needs of members and offer strategic advantages. “Edge has extended our backbone footprint into two new points of presence at Princeton University, with added path redundancy to enhance the redundancy to our network,” shares Jim Stankiewicz, Associate Vice President and Principal Network Architect, Edge. “Edge has also upgraded to a couple of 100G ports to our Internet transit providers and we’ve added 100G circuit capability to our optical network to further improve intercampus connectivity for members.”</p>

		 
	 
   
			  
		 
	  
  
		        
	  
		 
			 
				
	 
		 
			 “Last year, we had well over two hundred attacks that were mitigated before ever reaching our members’ networks. We’ve deployed a method that dynamically detects risks and automatically mitigates with no intervention needed from the Edge networking staff or from the affected member. The member will then be notified of the mitigation, the IP address that was under attack, and the duration and size of the cyberattack.”

			<p>Bolstering Security and Mitigating Risk</p>
<p>Improving security and risk mitigation for members remain top-of-mind priorities as Edge further grows and enhances the network. “Edge maintains the DOS surveillance and mitigation system on behalf of all of our members,” explains Stankiewicz. “Last year, we had well over two hundred attacks that were mitigated before ever reaching our members’ networks. We’ve deployed a method that dynamically detects risks and automatically mitigates with no intervention needed from the Edge networking staff or from the affected member. The member will then be notified of the mitigation, the IP address that was under attack, and the duration and size of the cyberattack.”</p>
<p>Edge is compliant with the Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS) and helps members ensure their American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) database is up to date. In addition, the providers of Edge’s Internet transit service have implemented resource public key infrastructure (RPKI), which adds another level of security on top of Edge’s routing network. “These programs, like MANRS and RPKI, adopt industry-wide standards that help prevent Internet and transit service providers from unintentionally or intentionally breaking the Internet,” says Tyrrell. “Things can happen that can cause large amounts of traffic to be misrouted across the Internet and these two programs are designed to prevent those incidences from happening. As a service provider in the industry, following best practices is important to Edge and helps our members avoid service-related issues.”</p>
<p>Expanding Research Capabilities&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edge continues to expand their capability and capacity for research computing and has a dedicated research network segment within EdgeNet. “The foundation of Edge’s research network is their Internet2 GigaPOPs, where specific routing, switching, and an optical infrastructure are dedicated to the research leg of the network,” explains Stankiewicz. “This research network is physically and logically separated from the production network our members use today to get to the Internet.” Tyrrell adds, “Since the networks are logically segmented, any activity a researcher conducts on the research network that would commonly be disruptive in a normal environment will not affect our regular transport network.”</p>
<p>Edge has also been working with Rutgers University and Princeton to identify research network opportunities and create peering points with those networks, like the Eastern Regional Network (ERN). With a mission of building partnerships between research facilities, educational institutions, regional network providers, and Internet2, the ERN provides layered and transparent access to shared data and computing facilities for research projects.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Edge, Rutgers, and Princeton began discussing how to migrate Edge’s internet connections away from the existing GigaPOP provider and create New Jersey’s first Internet GigaPOP in the state. Turned on in April of this year, the access point provides 200 gigabits of Internet2 capacity. “GigaPOP is a major interconnection point with Internet2, allowing members to connect with both national and international research assets,” explains Tyrrell. This access point also contains built-in flexibility for scale and growth, with the ability to grow to 400 gigabits in the future.</p>

		 
	 

			  
		 
	  
  
		        
	  
		 
			 
				
	 
		 
			 “Unlike commercial providers, EdgeNet, partners with our members to design and build optimal services that are custom designed to support their specific requirements. Edge also brings access to existing research entities, such as Rutgers University, Princeton University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, New York Presbyterian, and Hackensack Meridian Health—coupled with our peering capabilities built into the network—to connect with regional, national, and international research networks. EdgeNet is a one-stop destination for leading-edge support, research, and resources.”

<p>The EdgeNet network supports 100 percent of member demand, where member’s traffic is never impacted by another member’s network activity. Designed with Internet transit providers and redundant nodes throughout New Jersey, EdgeNet delivers a highly available networking experience. “We’ve created a network that is highly reliable, highly available, and of high performance,” says Tyrrell. “In the event a member does experience an issue they believe is related to our network, we have several layers of ongoing support, including an Edge partner who is a managed services provider. They offer 24-hour monitoring management of the infrastructure. If they cannot resolve the issue, members have the ability to talk to our network engineers, which is very unusual in the industry. You can rest assured that you’ll be able to contact the right people to get any issues resolved.”</p>
<p>A new EdgeNet feature added this year is access to real-time network utilization reporting. Each Edge member receives a personal link to view their own connections and can provide additional visibility to an organization’s own network connections to the Edge network. “This feature helps members more efficiently troubleshoot inside and outside of their network when they’re experiencing a problem,” says Tyrrell.</p>
<p>Superior Network Connectivity </p>
<p>As one of the premier educational research networks in the country, EdgeNet offers a myriad of options for research networking. “Unlike commercial providers, EdgeNet partners with our members to design and build optimal services that are custom designed to support their specific requirements,” says Tyrrell. “Edge also brings access to existing research entities, such as Rutgers University, Princeton University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, New York Presbyterian, and Hackensack Meridian Health—coupled with our peering capabilities built into the network—to connect with regional, national, and international research networks. EdgeNet is a one-stop destination for leading-edge support, research, and resources.”</p>
<p>For research organizations who are looking to connect with other institutions, pursue larger grant opportunities, and meet their needs of high-speed research and collaboration, EdgeNet can help pave the way.

			<p>For decades, IT departments have continuously combated obsolete computer hardware and applications. Generally, the replacement of these expensive tools requires capital funds, a convenience becoming more and more scarce. The funding obstacle subsequently then leads IT staff to operating the hardware beyond its useful life, creating other difficulties and larger expenses because of limited support and the elimination of critical security updates. Enter cloud computing–the ideal solution to deliver enterprise applications and services. Cloud solutions reduce costs, increases the efficiency of an IT organization, solves storage needs, supports disaster recovery, data center reduction and many other issues, while freeing organizations from investing in capital or operational funds to replace underutilized hardware. In its essence, use of cloud solutions changes the financial equation from capital expenditures to operational costs. For example, the cloud allows customers to gain new capabilities without investing in new hardware or software. Rather, the client pays their cloud provider a subscription fee or pays only for the resources used. “The key advantage is agility: the ability to apply abstracted compute, storage, and network resources to workloads as needed, and leverage an abundance of prebuilt services,” said Gregg Chottiner, Edge’s Vice President for Technology Advancement and Chief Information Officer.</p>
<p>The ability to almost instantly scale up or down to support a workload is a critical cloud computing advantage, especially relevant and important to today’s education, government, and healthcare institutions. “Whether it’s patient, student or citizen data, the ability to access the information on any device is an important attribute,” Chottiner explains. In healthcare cloud computing, these tools allow healthcare providers to gain access to the patient data collated from numerous sources, share the information with important stakeholders and give out timely prescriptions and treatment protocols. The process also eliminates the distance between the specialists, allowing them to review cases and give their opinions, irrespective of the geographical limitations.</p>
<p>A variety of cloud options are available to users, often depending on resource needs. Hybrid cloud computing means utilizing a combination of services, generally public clouds, on-premise (on-prem) computing, and private clouds. Multi-cloud is the use of two or more cloud services from different cloud vendors and can be all-private, all-public or a combination of both. With numerous cloud services available, users have many providers to choose from including, AWS, Azure, and Google-all three of which provide on-demand availability of computer resources like data storage and computing power to their users.</p>
<p>Why Consider Using Cloud Strategy?</p>
<p>Chottiner says many organizations fail to realize how the cloud is not a place or specific technology, but a strategy. “If you’re not using cloud technology today, you’re behind your peers. There is an opportunity for an exponential increase in productivity, security, and performance that is currently being left on the table,” he explains. The important aspect to consider is the enormous amount of time technology teams often spend keeping the lights on, rather than focusing on strategic initiatives and organizational goals. Many organizations also pour time into patching and configuring hardware and rarely catch up. “The cloud allows an exponential leap in IT security without the capital spending required for on-prem IT,” Chottiner shared. “Cloud providers provide both physical and digital security mechanisms often too costly for most organizations to afford on their own. Edge offers all the tools and services to help organizations migrate to the cloud.”</p>
<p>Edge’s cloud assessment methodology helps build a business case for leveraging cloud services with accurate costs and provisioning plans based on real data from the institution’s current physical and virtual environment. The service also simplifies cloud migration and management through data analytics, competitive price modeling, and expert consultation.</p>

			<p>EdgeCloud Prepares Member Institutions with their Journey to the Cloud</p>
<p>Conceptually, migrating workloads to the cloud should be a basic “lift and shift,” but many organizations do not have an adequate cloud adoption strategy in place during their cloud migration attempts. One of the primary drivers for cloud migration is the staggered expiration of on-prem technology. However, EdgeCloud is available to all Edge members and helps an organization assess and prioritize workloads for migration to the cloud. “Edge has a proven methodology that combines several services developed to help an organization prepare for their journey to the cloud and reduce risks along the way,” Chottiner explained. “Our cloud readiness methodology is the perfect starting point.”</p>
<p>While some companies only offer cookie-cutter cloud migration solutions that claim to offer a seamless and all-encompassing migration plan. EdgeCloud provides members with a roadmap for cloud architecture and employs proven tools to make their journey easier. “When it comes to cloud computing, enterprises need a strategic and customized roadmap which will align with resources, budgets and strategic plans,” Chottiner says.</p>
<p>Edge employs proven tools to make the journey to the cloud painless using this criterion:</p>
 
 Have a solid business 
 Outline your current objectives 
 Categorize your workloads and desired outcomes 
 Estimate timeline and budgets 
 Prioritize what application to move first 
 
<p>In many cases, smaller organizations gain more efficiencies and cost savings from a cloud migration because these groups often have limited resources and budgets, eliminating operational tasks in favor of strategic projects with more value and better services to users. “Edge has the resources and partnership relationships to provide world class affordable cloud solutions for all types and sizes of organizations,” Chottiner shares.</p>
<p>Another of Edge’s differentiators is the capability to provide a purpose-built high performance and highly secure network, so Edge members can connect with the leading cloud providers. This contrasts with general Internet Service Providers that provide commodity-based networks, often with less security and less performance. For instance, with AWS, Edge has earned Strategic Partner status, which allows members to eliminate egress charges and significantly reduce costs. Edge also has a direct connection with AWS, which reduces latency for members.</p>
<p>To ease the burden of the procurement process and speed up their members’ time to implementation and innovation, EdgeCloud services can be attained through the EdgeMarket portal (edgemarket.njedge.net/home), which enables Edge to deliver consortium purchasing agreements to members. Edge members then gain access to current technologies such as cloud modeling at affordable prices and the increased ability to manage their complex technologies.</p>

			 THE CASE FOR THE CLOUD 
<p>From email, to e-commerce, to entertainment, the third party applications we use everyday have moved to the cloud. Cloud solutions deliver high performance and security for industry leaders everywhere, and the same technology can lead to positive outcomes for your organization. The cloud is the right platform to deliver the technology and services your users need if you find value in:</p>

		 
	 

			  
		 
	  
  
		        
	  
		 
			 
				    
	 
		 
			<p>Agility. The ability to move fast, experiment, and easily access the solutions you need is inherent to the cloud. With anytime, anywhere access, the cloud allows you to more quickly and effectively meet the needs of your users.</p>

		 
	 

			  
		 
	  

	  
		 
			 
				    
	 
		 
			<p>Elasticity. The cloud allows you to grow or shrink your technology footprint as needed. Deploy the resources you need on demand, increasing availability during times of high demand and minimizing consumption (and cost) when appropriate.</p>

		 
	 

			  
		 
	  

	  
		 
			 
				    
	 
		 
			<p>Security &amp; Compliance. Cloud services are built on a foundation of security. Cloud providers have designed solutions stringent security standards. In many cases, this results in a more secure environment than legacy on-premise solutions. Regulatory compliance is also key, with cloud security configured to meet standards including CJIS, FERPA, FEDRAMP, HIPAA, PCI, and more.</p>

		 
	 

			  
		 
	  
  
		        
	  
		 
			 
				    
	 
		 
			<p>Business Continuity. The always-on nature of the cloud means your users will be able to access the services they need whenever and wherever they are, as long as they have an internet connection and meet your security policies. With applications and services living in the cloud, and business processes built to take advantage of that fact, this enables your organization to operate effectively whether onsite or working remotely, no matter the surrounding circumstances.</p>

		 
	 

			  
		 
	  

	  
		 
			 
				    
	 
		 
			<p>Total Cost of Ownership. When designed effectively, a cloud computing strategy can save your institution money on the technology bottom line. As a result of the ability to provision services when and where you need them, you’ll never need to spend money on hardware refreshes designed to meet the highest possible peak demand again.</p>

			<p>Huston Joins Edge’s Board of Trustees</p>
<p>In 2002, when Scott Huston stepped onto campus as a young freshman, Stockton University gained an integral component of their future executive team. Working hard, this forward-thinker earned both his undergraduate and graduate degrees from Stockton and began his career path providing guidance at the University’s IT Helpdesk. Over 16 years later, Huston was named Stockton’s Chief Information Officer, and most recently, this innovator in educational technology was voted onto Edge’s Board of Trustees, providing Huston with another outlet for influencing additional learning spheres.</p>
<p>“I guess you could say I fell in love with the Stockton campus and community and never left,” Huston says. “I started my career at the IT Helpdesk, which taught me many things about the expectations of the higher education community, and the experience really gave me a good understanding of the entire organizational landscape.”</p>
<p>From the beginning, Huston has desired to deliver the best customer service experience possible and this mantra has followed him along his career path. He has managed numerous Stockton information technology initiatives, including the campus conversion to Active Directory, convergence and management of the Stockton unified Helpdesk, and the negotiation and purchasing of enterprise hardware and software. Huston has also helped the University’s divisions implement new IT projects and has managed the servers and services which run the applications.</p>
<p>Under his leadership, the Division of Information Technology Services team takes a proactive and collaborative approach to deliver innovative, reliable, and sustainable technologies to optimize satisfaction and desired outcomes. Huston said he also tries to stay involved in the day-to-day decision-making and processes at the University. “This way I’m never caught off-guard, and any email going to the Helpdesk still comes to me as well. I believe it’s very important for me to stay connected to the needs of our user community,” he adds. While overseeing operations, Huston works with his team to develop new strategies, programs, and procedures to promote quicker responses with improved customer service. Huston also plays a large role in the fiscal planning and budgeting for the division and has implemented many process improvements in the areas of allocation of funding and procurement of equipment for Information Technology Services. “In my role as CIO, I now provide the strategic vision and leadership for the continued development of an innovative, robust, and secure information technology environment at Stockton,” Huston shares. “We are always looking to provide fully engaging learning experiences throughout the University.”</p>

			<p>Reliance on IT During COVID-19</p>
<p>COVID-19 has been an obvious challenge on campus, but the nimbleness of Stockton’s IT department has allowed the University to overcome numerous obstacles and issues throughout the pandemic. The Fall 2020 semester features courses taught in multiple teaching modalities, including online courses, in-person classes on campus, and via hybrid classes that combined in-person and online lessons. Huston’s department had to be ready to handle each situation and make sure systems and programs were capable of each scenario. “The greatest challenge has been dealing with the ever-changing landscape of the pandemic and the reliance on IT to provide solutions to issues arising due to the situation,” he said. “IT at Stockton has been required to become even more agile and nimble during the pandemic, with a lot of out-of-the-box thinking required to solve the ever-growing situations at hand.”</p>
<p>During these very unprecedented times, Stockton made the strategic decisions to heavily leverage and upscale Zoom services, including larger meetings, webinars, and cloud phone service, along with the use of collaboration resources such as SharePoint and OneDrive. The University procured and deployed enhanced virtual desktop infrastructures to ensure students, faculty, and staff could continue their operations and still thrive despite the challenges. Huston noted how communication and connectivity to resources has been some of the biggest hardships to overcome.</p>
<p>Classroom needs have also regularly changed, especially during the fall semester. Tools beginning to become archaic have made a reappearance, such as the use of digital document cameras to provide a unified classroom learning environment. “With increased remote learning due to the pandemic, these devices have become more popular than ever,” Huston shares. “All I can say is we are spending many late nights preparing for any situation that may appear in the semester ahead.”</p>
<p>Digital Transformation in Higher Education</p>
<p>Besides being CIO, Huston has also served as an adjunct faculty member at Stockton since 2012, and in 2014, he was named the Business Faculty Member of the Year. This popular instructor enjoys remaining connected to the classroom through teaching and finds the experience gives him insight into the modern technological needs of the student body and his fellow faculty. For instance, Huston believes higher education must innovate in order to provide world-class instructional technologies. He says digital transformation must take place by using technology to assist with student retention and completion, as well as to employ advanced data analytics to ensure colleges and universities are providing students with the best educational experience possible. “I think EDUCAUSE got it right; digital transformation is all about simplifying the end user experience and technologies to support their needs, while still providing an advanced and imaginative experience for users at all levels.”&nbsp; He continues, “We need to sustain the higher education experience with information security strategies and high education affordability, because at the end of the day, the most important thing to remember is we are here for the students.”</p>
<p>The use of emerging technologies and practices aid the process for ongoing digital transformation. Stockton uses Analytics for Inclusive Student Success to create a strategic plan for their campus. Huston says the school heavily utilizes reporting and analytics to recruit, support, and empower their increasingly diverse student body, while working closely to fill equity gaps often existing in higher education. “Every CIO’s agenda should look to improve the analysis of student data, student success planning, and advising systems and predicative analytics for student success,” he added. “But as pure strategic technologies, gaining redundancy and expanding possibilities through a blended data center should be on the mind of every CIO.” However, more importantly, Huston says the growing complexity of security threats keeps him up at night. “Information Security is something you always have to be concerned about.”</p>
<p>Innovative Technologies Benefit the University</p>
<p>Currently, colleges and universities are experiencing the importance of cloud services and software as service offerings. This change is causing a shift for many institutions. “The result is a swing from capital expense to operating expense, but with the appropriate planning the benefits can be huge,” Huston explains. “Educational technology will continue to advance and transform in the future, however, there will always be underlying needs for the University community.”</p>
<p>Outside of technological resources like the HyFlex Course Model needed to overcome COVID-19 obstacles, Huston believes those colleges and universities who begin to offer multiple learning modalities simultaneously will be very important for the future university student. Ongoing, Stockton plans to continue to investigate alternate modality technologies and services with the IT team, working for the creation and production of high quality pedagogical-focused learning materials across all disciplines. “I hope the industry as a whole continues to focus on these opportunities and future technologies can be leveraged to support the HyFlex learning model,” Huston explains. “Over the last few months, I’ve been amazed watching the unbelievable creative and innovative ways Stockton’s faculty have used technology to create some excellent methods for instruction. I hope to continue doing everything possible within my means to support this type of activity.”</p>
<p>Collegiate Esports is another area where Stockton University has been a leader. In 2019, the institution had 85 student competitors spread across seven different sports and had over 350 very active community members. The Esports teams received four first place finishes in various national tournaments, putting in over 15,000 hours of utilization in Stockton’s dedicated Esports labs.</p>
<p>As Edge enters the world of Esports, Stockton’s Esports teams have had hundreds of students attending their community gaming events on campus. “The program is thriving more than ever! We have open play nights throughout the week, which was popular with students, and we hosted multiple middle and high school teams on campus for Esports related events,” he says. “We are looking forward to Edge’s continued involvement with collegiate Esports in New Jersey and their continued support of the initiatives here at Stockton.”</p>
<p>Edge is very appreciative for Huston’s willingness to contribute his skills and expertise to the overall Edge community, as he joins the Board of Trustees.</p>

<p>This episode is a deep dive on the technical plumbing of FAPI. It provides an overview of the specification, how it came to be and what it means for implementers and end-users. FAPI is a security and interoperability profile closely aligned with OAuth. It was originally intended for use in open banking scenarios and has now rapidly extended to other high security use-cases in insurance, healthcare and mobile.&nbsp; Torsten explains how FAPI navigates two challenge areas of using OAuth in open banking, what one may find within the FAPI working group initiatives, and the differences between FAPI versions 1 and 2.&nbsp; Further, Torsten dives into specific macro&nbsp; areas of FAPI, and discusses<a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/src/master/Financial_API_JWT_Secured_Authorization_Response_Mode.md"> JARM (JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode)</a>.&nbsp; He details cryptography measures such as MTLS and their relation to FAPI, his thoughts on the future of FAPI, prominent features in the specifications such Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA), and helps listeners interested in FAPI to determine what version might best suit them.</p>
<p>This podcast compliments the OpenID Foundation’s plans for technical information sharing sessions with government and private sector partners in AUS, LATAM, MENA, the EU and UK. The Foundation plans to enhance and extend the workshops we tested over the last few years with the UK’s Open Banking Implementation Entity with the goal of the workshops to provide an open forum to educate technologists on the current state of the FAPI standards and its conformance test suite and invite contributions to the evolution of FAPI-2.0</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>2021 is going to be a significant year in Identity and Data Privacy. Since the GDPR went into full enforcement in 2018, we’ve seen&nbsp; many countries rapidly change or update their Data Privacy laws. Although intended to protect the individual, the number of Data Privacy Rights has increased dramatically. And, this is compounded by the fact that emerging technologies are putting a huge burden on identity and Identity systems.</p>
<p>The world is also experiencing an acceleration of technologies that rely heavily on Identity and Identity systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, I predict there will be a need to use Identity systems to facilitate new ways for people to access services:</p>
 
 carry out financial transactions with cryptocurrencies, 
 validate vaccination and health status due to Covid-19, 
 help big tech better moderate objectionable content. 
 
<p>These are my predictions for the year ahead – share your feedback below!</p>
<p></p>
 Immunity Passports will become ubiquitous 
<p>As a result of Covid-19, many countries are looking to how they can relax travel restrictions. A cruise company recently confirmed that they will not be accepting passengers unless they have been vaccinated. &nbsp;This is very likely to be the case for many other travel companies in 2021. &nbsp;This raises the issue of Data Privacy because some of these companies will now be collecting confidential, protected health information from the customers which they need to manage going forward.</p>
<p>Technologies are being developed right now to create things like Identity Passports through which travellers can present a negative COVID test result or proof of vaccination.&nbsp; This will then be tied to their identity to determine the right to travel. This will put a significant burden on identity systems as we seek to combine health information with travel information. Identity is going to be critical in making sure that organizations can have confidence in any tests results or new data provided.</p>
 Links between Cryptocurrencies and Identity 
<p>An essential part of bringing cryptocurrencies to people worldwide is the ability to have users create and maintain digital wallets. A fundamental purpose of digital wallets is to allow the unbanked or underbanked access to digital currency systems. As a result of this, Identity and Identity verification systems will grow in significance to cryptocurrencies. &nbsp;Identity and cryptocurrencies will be tightly bound together and initiatives aimed at getting people to use digital currency in the digital wallet will depend very much on adoption of the underpinning identity systems. Data Privacy and Data Protection will become the central point for developing trust in these digital money systems.</p>
 Emerging technologies and Identity 
<p>Emerging technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality will require more information about individuals as they move around, interacting with these systems. It will be vital that users are correctly identified and ‘marked’ appropriately so that, for example, their access to certain types of services can be restricted if needed. Identity plays a big part in this, and we will see increasing amounts of data collected about individuals which need to be protected to ensure their privacy rights.</p>
 Big Tech, Identity, and Content Moderation 
<p>Content moderation by big tech companies has become a hot issue in the US and the EU. Governments are looking very closely at ‘Big Tech”s role in moderating content and support for law enforcement when investigations relate to their customer base. As a result of this, and as we’ve seen recently in the US Capitol attack, the big tech companies are being asked not just to moderate conversations but also to track people that are causing harm or planning harmful events.</p>
<p>This is likely to result in more regulation around the responsibilities of ‘Big Tech’ in this area. In many different scenarios, I can see that this will cause a considerable uptick in how tech organisations identify users – particularly if it is to be used for law enforcement reasons.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how 2021 evolves. But whatever happens, it is likely that Identity and Data Privacy will play an increasingly significant role.</p>

 ASA Automation, a German automation manufacturer that supplies companies including Walmart and Pfizer, leverages Energy Web Zero to decarbonize international supply&nbsp;chain <p>Mainhausen, Germany and Zug, Switzerland — 26 January 2021 — Today, ASA Automation and Energy Web announced a renewable energy project leveraging the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">EW Zero</a> application to help ASA source renewables for its production facilities in Germany and Chile. ASA Automation is a leading global automation and robotics manufacturer that supplies equipment and solutions to multinational companies including Walmart, Nestle, Volkswagen, and Pfizer. Companies like these with strong sustainability policies require that suppliers such as ASA use low-carbon energy throughout their supply chain. EW Zero will enable ASA to provide a verified proof that low-carbon energy was used in its facilities throughout the world to produce its products. This pilot builds on the first technical and commercial demonstration of EW Zero — <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/xrp-ledger-foundation-ripple-and-energy-web-announce-worlds-first-decarbonized-blockchain-5c3cecbff31a">Energy Web’s partnership with Ripple and XRP Foundation</a> to decarbonize the XRP&nbsp;Ledger.</p><p>“We are thrilled to welcome ASA Automation as an early adopter of EW Zero to reduce the carbon footprint of its production facilities. We hope that this pilot will set an example for how small- to medium-sized companies, often excluded from participation in renewable energy markets due to their relatively low electricity consumption, can now contribute to sustainability efforts. As ASA Automation is showing, EW Zero makes it much easier to decarbonize global, complex supply chains as required by some of the largest corporates,” said Walter Kok, CEO of Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>EW Zero enables energy buyers of any size to efficiently locate and purchase renewables around the world. The first version of EW Zero leverages energy attribute certificates (EACs). In this transaction, ASA Automation will use EW Zero to cover electricity consumption in Germany and Chile using renewable EACs. Zero will also act as a discovery tool to view available renewable supply in the markets of interest and choose the suppliers that match specific demand criteria (such as location, generation type, and installation year). In this way, ASA Automation will reduce its electricity-related emissions (Scope 2 under the GHG Protocol), which in turn decreases supply chain Scope 3 emissions for ASA’s customers. Zero will also integrate with renewable energy suppliers to showcase how local renewables platforms can leverage open-source standardized APIs to connect to EW&nbsp;Zero.</p><p>“We’re proud to become a member of Energy Web and an early adopter of such an innovative project that will allow us to make a first step towards renewable energy procurement,” said Mario Krämer, CEO of ASA Automation. “I am convinced that this is only the first step in the strategic cooperation with Energy Web and we are thrilled to become a frontrunner in blockchain-based innovation for the automation sector.”</p><p>The project will be completed in early 2021 and inform the continued open-source development of EW Zero. In the meantime, ASA and Energy Web are seeking renewable energy developers with a footprint in Europe and Latin America to participate in the project. Interested companies are invited to contact <a href="http://meerim.ruslanova@energyweb.org">Meerim Ruslanova</a> to get involved.</p><p>About ASA Automation <br>ASA Automation is engineering, building, and installing high-tech automation solutions custom tailored to suit our clients’ specific needs and their products, working from our German facility at Mainhausen, in the vicinity of Frankfurt/Main.

<p>By Sarah Drinkwater, Director &amp; Aniyia Williams, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Back in 2018, we started funding the <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/why-were-investing-in-the-rise-of-the-responsible-tech-worker-a96e74661cdf">rise of the responsible tech worker</a>. This is our effort to help tech workers and founders step into their power, and build a world in which technology makes good on its promise of improving everyone’s lives for the better: fueling an ecosystem that is equitable, ethical, and inclusive in addition to innovative.<br> <br>2020 marked a monumental shift for the movement as the techlash came of age. A<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/a-legal-roadmap-to-address-googles-monopoly-on-search-engines-effdfbcbc1f7">t Omidyar Network, we were proud to provide a roadmap</a> for the US Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, and dozens of state attorney generals to file <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/antitrust-case-against-google-roadmap-paper/">antitrust cases</a> against the largest tech companies; there was an escalating debate (and, finally, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/big-tech-did-the-right-thing-for-the-wrong-reasons-51610737986">some action</a>) around acceptable online speech; and millions of people worldwide gained a deeper understanding of the dark patterns in the devices they use everyday watching the hit documentary, A Social Dilemma. <br> <br>We’ve come a long way since US senators<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/10/17222062/mark-zuckerberg-testimony-graham-facebook-regulations"> asked Facebook how it makes money,</a> but there’s so much more to do. <br> <br>Here are the biggest lessons we’ve learned so far, and where we hope this year will take us.<br> <br>The people we’re told are “leaders” will not lead us where we need to go.<br> <br>We can’t expect technology executives to self-regulate because they have no incentive to do so. In a world in which <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">technology is inextricably bound with capitalism</a>, CEOs are beholden to their shareholders to maximize profit. <br> <br>But within those companies, there’s hope. <br> <br>Tech workers, from engineers to cafeteria staff, are pushing back and speaking up; and new founders are testing out new kinds of business models and products. Together, they are holding their employers and the industry accountable to do the right thing, not just say it.<br> <br>Yet too often these people face retaliation and get branded troublemakers. We see them as heroes. We believe these are the early stages of a massive tech labor movement, and the number of tech workers who understand the connection between their day-to-day job and its impact on society is growing. <br> <br>To help unlock their power, we’re creating space for workers and founders to come together, funding the tools and resources they need, and developing new mechanisms for accountability. <br> <br>In 2020, we launched <a href="https://ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer</a>, a tool that gives people working on tech products (including designers, engineers, or their collaborators) a practical guide to navigate and lead on complex topics such as bias in AI or outsized power.<br> <br>We helped launch the <a href="https://www.tspa.info/">Trust &amp; Safety Professional Association (TSPA)</a> to build the field and continue to elevate those working on the frontlines of content moderation. It is the first membership organization designed for trust and safety specialists, from contract content moderators to in-house engineering teams at big tech companies.<br> <br>For tech workers yearning to upskill and meet like minds, we funded<a href="https://school.logicmag.io/"> Logic School</a> to teach them about creative protest, as well as a course at Stanford for professionals on Tech, Ethics, and Public Policy.<br> <br>In addition, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ifeomaozoma/">Ifeoma Ozoma</a> joined our team as an advisor to help us consider how to strengthen tech workers’ ability to whistleblow when they see or experience something wrong in the workplace.<br> <br>The industry is missing a common vision and narrative about responsible technology.<br> <br>Last year, we discovered that “ethical tech” means<a href="https://sarahdrinkwater.medium.com/the-responsible-tech-movement-is-held-back-because-we-dont-know-what-to-call-it-9a674e867054"> different things to different people</a>. The lack of common narrative is a core challenge for the movement because it means that people haven’t gelled around a shared identity, have a hard time finding each other, and aren’t speaking the same language.<br> <br>How can you rally without something to rally around? We have to identify the harms as well as the common goals, interests, and passions to build the path forward. <br> <br>As the pandemic hit, we funded <a href="https://mobi.us.org/">Mobius </a>to bring technology leaders together and determine collective work. To help deepen our knowledge of how race and technology intersect, we funded the <a href="https://www.c2i2.ucla.edu/">Center for Critical Internet Enquiry </a>to bring on an artist-in-residence (an incredible filmmaker, <a href="https://www.invisibleportraits.com/about">Oge Egbuonu</a>). And Civic Signals, now renamed<a href="https://newpublic.org/"> New_ Public</a>, kicked off 2021 with a festival that brought together a diverse crowd of activists, technologists, artists, academics, and urban planners to consider what healthy digital public spaces should look like. <br> <br>We win together, or not at all.<br> <br>For too long, tech has moved too fast and, at that high speed, broken things. An African proverb says “if you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” Beyond needing less haste and more conversation, we strongly believe in solidarity and collective approaches.<br> <br>If this past year has taught us anything, it’s how interwoven our lives are. Wearing a mask protects ourselves, as well as others. We exist as a society and we thrive in communities.<br> <br>That’s why last year we helped launch <a href="https://coworkerfund.org/">Coworker’s Solidarity Fund</a>, the first ever mutual aid fund designed specifically to assist employees and independent contractors who have faced retaliation for organizing in the workplace. The launch is timely given both our <a href="https://omidyar.com/news/omidyar-network-announces-worker-power-vision-35-million-investment/">commitment to worker power</a> in all forms of business under our Reimagining Capitalism banner and the continued progress of tech organizing, and we hope to see more progress in 2021 with the formation of the Alphabet Workers Union and Amazon employees voting for its first-ever union in the US.<br> <br>Acting with integrity can and should become business as usual.<br> <br>We think that doing the right thing for as many people as possible (whether you call it behaving with responsibility, integrity, or ethics) will be how the business world — including the technology sector — weaves together topics such as diversity, equity, belonging, and sustainability. <br> <br>2020, and the years before it, taught us that tech’s unethical behavior leads to incredible harm. It also results in reputation, regulatory, and talent risk. The largest tech companies are seeing experienced employees as well as young graduates (like those in our <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/awards/responsible-computer-science-challenge/">ResponsibleCS</a> program) turn away from the cultures they’ve built. <br> <br>Articulating and living by strongly held values will be how future leaders make their companies appealing to customers, investors, and the most sought-after employees.<br> <br>We’re already seeing this in the startup scene, with a new class emerging, led by organizations such as <a href="https://zebrasunite.coop/">Zebras Unite</a>,* who have created a powerful identity for founders who want to build companies grounded in values and defined in opposition to some of Silicon Valley’s most harmful norms. <br> <br>That’s why our teammates on the Reimagining Capitalism team are working to shift the current corporate governance rules away from shareholder primacy towards a world that recognizes broader stakeholders, including employees and consumers. It’s why we funded <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/apply/">Ethical Source</a> and the <a href="https://corpaccountabilitylab.org/">Corporate Accountability Lab</a>, elevating their existing work which challenges the notion that open source is “values neutral” by deploying tactical, practical licensing and legal frameworks to allow developers to center values in their work. We also funded <a href="https://projectinclude.org/">Project Include</a> to investigate how the shift to working remotely has impacted harassment and toxicity in the virtual workplace, and how tech companies can create better and fairer working conditions for all. <br> <br>What Comes Next<br>Looking ahead, we see our work as enabling a diverse community of tech stakeholders to connect, collaborate, and co-create. To fuel the next stage of the movement, we need to focus on both the aspirational (envisioning together what we want) and the adversarial (pushing back against what we don’t). After all, communities are defined as much by what they aren’t as what they are.<br> <br>In doing so, we hope examples will emerge of what we — as an industry and society — want to reward, as we so often see examples of what we want to correct. Working together, we believe a new surge of people, ideas, and examples will shift tech culture. <br> <br>We’re still navigating what Omidyar Network’s role should be in the movement towards responsible tech. We aren’t here to own, we’re here to listen, empower, and contribute. We feel strongly that people who are most marginalized in our communities are critical to developing effective solutions — they have deep lived-experience and can see a clear path forward. We must find ways to hear them and respond to their needs.<br> <br> If what you’ve read here resonates, tell us what you think. If you’re already engaged in some form of this work, or want to be, then we’d love to hear what you are working on or passionate about. <br> <br>We hope you’ll join us on the journey.<br> <br>And starting February 9th, we’ll be hosting a series of community conversations to share more of what we’ve learned.

<p>This marks the first donation of a Rust “crate” (package) to the&nbsp;group</p><p>Over the years, the Identifiers and Discovery WG at the DIF has received many donations that form a vital resource for developers of DID-based systems: recently, a flotilla of complementary <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-id-wg-starting-work-on-cryptographic-secret-recovery-204117b6a2ab">secret recovery mechanisms</a>, a command-line tool for handling Verifiable Credentials that was the foundation for years of JWT work in the Ethereum community, the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/.well-known">.well-known</a> specification, and the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-common-java">/did-common-{language}/</a> series of basic libraries and tooling in various popular languages, to say nothing of the donations of drivers for the open-ended <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540?">Universal Resolver</a>&nbsp;project.</p><p>The newest donation to the I&amp;D WG archive is an implementation of <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-key.rs">did:key</a> built in the Rust language by long-time active DIF members, <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a>. In addition to being great news for the I&amp;D WG itself, it is also great news for the “target audience” of the WG: developers trying to smoothly and efficiently extend the domain of DID-based systems to new programming languages, use cases, and contexts.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@only1simonharmer">Simon&nbsp;Harmer</a> Don’t all DIDs contain&nbsp;keys? <p><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID:Key</a>, originally specified in the W3C Credentials Community Group (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>), is a DID “pseudo-method” that allows static, pre-existing, and/or pre-published public keys to function like traditional DIDs — they can be queried, stored, issued against, and resolved to return valid DID documents. These DID documents, or “pseudo-documents” if you prefer, are generated deterministically from their public keys, allowing the integration of complex key management systems involving cold storage, hardware security modules,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>This “masquerade” of wrapping external or pre-existing keypairs in the form of a valid DID is crucial to many kinds of interoperability, legacy integration, and testing. It can be a life-saver in both the early days and the home-stretch of moving to production in the messy real world of legacy systems and interoperability stress-testing.</p><p>Like the /did-common-{language}/ series, a plug-and-play library that handles all the transformations between different kinds of key and their “DID-ification” is a huge time-saver for people working in new contexts, or contexts where prior art has not yet been open-sourced. In addition to these advantages, the unique design of did:key has also been valuable in demonstrating the flexibility and universality of the DID concept itself — and that DIDs can seamlessly interoperate with systems that do require a blockchain or similar technologies.</p> Rust and&nbsp;DIF <p>Rust has earned a reputation among contemporary blockchain and web developer communities, in large part because it is so performant, controllable, and <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/book/why-rust-and-webassembly.html">versatile</a> across in-browser, server-side, and cloud environments. It plays nicely with widely different programming languages as&nbsp;well.</p><p>In particular, it has also been designed to be <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/book/reference/js-ffi.html">smoothly integrated</a> into JavaScript systems, for decades the most common language in most kinds of web development. In fact, many of today’s JS developers consume Rust/WASM libraries without even knowing they’re doing so. The libraries from Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a>, for instance, use Rust cryptographic libraries <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ursa">packaged</a> and managed by the Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Ursa</a>&nbsp;project.</p><p>One crucial distinction, however, between Rust and Javascript is that the former has a drastically different way of managing dependencies and packages. In addition to being very resource-conscious in their assembly, “crates” (as the packages are called in Rust’s native “cargo” package management system) can be imported and compiled selectively, using only what each project needs “at build”. For in-browser, edge-device, and other resource-constrained environments, this makes a world of difference compared to traditional JS frameworks like Node or&nbsp;Angular.</p><p>While the authoritative branch of the source code is being donated to DIF where it will stay open to new issues and pull requests from the DIF community, the “crate” is already available at <a href="https://crates.io/crates/did-key">crates.io</a>, and can be used directly in your project’s Cargo.toml file:</p><blockquote>did-key =&nbsp;“*”</blockquote> Extending the&nbsp;library <p>Like all code donations to DIF, there are many ways in which this library can be extended. GitHub issues and pull requests are open! So far, the key formats currently supported are:</p>  BLS12381 (G1 &amp; G2 derivations)  Ed25519  X25519  NIST P256  Secp256k1  <p>If you find this project useful in your own development, whether for compliance-testing, for supporting new verifiable credential formats like BBS+, or for extending your interoperability and compatibility reach, please leave an issue describing future features you might find useful. Better still, if you have experience with Rust/WASM, please consider getting involved and contributing features, leaving constructive feedback, or extending the specification’s documentation and implementation guidance&nbsp;notes.</p><p>We also welcome you to join and participate in the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/">I&amp;D Working Group</a>, regarding any questions or contributions to the Rust did:key implementation or one of the other work&nbsp;items!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/trinsic-donates-did-key-rs-to-i-d-wg-8a278f37bcd0">Trinsic donates did-key.rs to I&amp;D WG</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
 Watch the DigitalScot.live webinar replay&nbsp;with Julian Ranger of Digi.me to learn about the concept of ‘Personal Data Ecosystems’ and how they might be implemented in Scotland. 
<p>Digi.me offer an personal data solutions platform, that can be used for any permutation of scenarios, such as <a href="https://consentry.com/">testing and managing Covid-19 risk</a>.</p>
<p></p>
 Web 3.0 – A New Paradigm 
<p>As was <a href="https://digitalgovernment.scot/digital-healthcare-in-scotland-guddle/">reported</a> a year ago Scotland’s Healthcare systems are in a state of ‘guddle’ – Lacking strategic direction and suffering from a situation of disjointed IT as the root issue holding up Integrated Health and Social Care in Scotland.</p>
<p>The cause of this is the predilection of governments for organizing themselves via very rigid hierarchical departmental structures, from which flows equally rigid, departmental-centric IT systems, creating ‘silos’, islands of information that must then be connected to other islands to facilitate the end-to-end processes that span across all of them.</p>
<p>The best way to tackle this situation is not to create these islands in the first place, to instead design and build a holistic, single data environment. The most effective example of this is the Internet, and it will be it’s ongoing evolution to ‘Web 3.0’ that will create a ‘rising tide that floats all boats’ universal solution to the problem that Scotland can harness.</p>
<p>This is defined primarily through the emergence of a decentralized approach to applications and data. Patient records won’t be held centrally in a monolith EHR, but will instead be distributed to and owned/controlled by the users themselves.</p>
 Decentralized Data 
<p>Apps like <a href="https://digi.me/healthy-me/">Healthy Me</a>&nbsp;from digi.me are an example of this new paradigm and how the decentralized approach tackles issues common to IT, like data privacy, by distributing the workload and privacy control to the users themselves.</p>
<p>Initiatives like&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData</a>, of which digi.me plays a key role, are setting out to develop the global movement that will establish the framework for adoption of this approach, defining the methods and governance for regulating this model of data exchange.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://futurescot.com/data-sharing-concerns-raised-by-primary-care-practitioners-at-scottish-parliament-inquiry/">FutureScot reports</a>&nbsp;at a recent parliamentary hearing on Scottish digital healthcare this approach was called for:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What we should be aiming for it a central digitised record that the patient has ownership of. And I think any of the professions that are arguing for increased access to records, increased ability to write into records, we need to be mindful that we need to take patients with us on that journey and consent is absolutely essential.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Scotland’s opportunity is that while these approaches seem futuristic, through vendors like Digi.me they are implementable today.</p>

 Reimagining Capitalism Series: An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and&nbsp;Economy <p>By Audrey Stienon, Analyst, Reimagining Capitalism</p>Photo by <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/field-of-flags-at-national-mall-represents-americans-unable-to-attend-inauguration-day/2545279/">Eric BARADAT</a> /&nbsp;AFP<p>Over the coming weeks, Omidyar Network will expand on our theory of change around ideas, rules, and power and connect it to the five pillars outlined in our recently released <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Point of View</a> on Reimagining Capitalism, and the work being done by our grantees. This is the first contribution to that&nbsp;series.</p><p>Democracy &amp; Capitalism <br>This week, Joseph R. Biden was inaugurated as America’s 46th president, standing on the West Front of the US Capitol that was attacked earlier this month. With that picture still vivid in the minds of many, President Biden swore an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. In that moment, people across the country let out a sigh of relief; though our democracy has been bruised and battered, it continues. And so too can the American people continue to pursue a more perfect union. <br> <br>At Omidyar Network, we recognize that the strength of our democracy is deeply entwined with the strength of our economy. We believe that we all have a collective responsibility to defend our democracy, and we are recommitting ourselves to ensuring that our economy supports our democratic society in providing opportunity, dignity, and security to all.<br> <br>Democracy and capitalism have long stood as twin pillars under-girding American society. Their modern incarnations were both born in 1776 out of the same intellectual movement, and advance the same vision: for decision-making power to rest with the people. Just as we are united, as Americans by a common faith in the democratic values of equality, justice, and liberty, we value the capitalist promise that those who innovate, compete, and take risks will be fairly rewarded. Ultimately, capitalism is what has made possible American democracy, with its promise of shared prosperity and opportunity.<br> <br>A key debate across American history has been of how to balance the competing rights and freedoms guaranteed in each system. Adjusting this balance has allowed our government and economy to adapt to the changes in our values across centuries. However, it is clear to so many of us that the balance between democracy and capitalism is now in a dangerously precarious position. <br> <br>For years, we have prioritized the protection of capitalist rights to seek growth and profit at the expense of democratic commitment to general welfare, as enshrined in our Constitution alongside liberty and prosperity. We now find ourselves with an economy that is obviously structured in ways that exacerbate inequalities at every level. Despite a soaring stock market and rising GDP, the fundamentals of our economy are as broken as the windows smashed by the angry mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6th. Already profound gaps in income, wealth, and opportunity are widening, especially between white and Black families. <br> <br> Most of us are deeply dissatisfied with the status quo, yet feel that we lack the power to change our circumstances. This powerlessness is fundamentally undemocratic and, by extension, un-American. We must change it. <br> <br>Omidyar Network has called for a reimagining of capitalism so that we can once again strike a balance between our democratic and capitalist systems that creates an economy grounded in democratic values. Our goal is to achieve systemic change so that our society is centered on the well-being of individuals and communities, and allows for full economic, democratic, and social participation for all. Our strategy is to transform how economic systems support our society by investing in organizations and individuals working to reshape economic ideas, rules, and power.<br> <br>Replacing Old Ideas<br>Throughout America’s history, we have lived in accordance with a variety of ideas that reflected society’s values at the time — many of which were rightfully discarded as our values evolved. Over the last 50 years, a set of ideas based on individual liberty, the primacy of markets, and a limited role for government have guided our economic policies, and our views of what is possible. Those ideas were built on an even longer history of economic thinking that has perpetually excluded and devalued people because of their race, class, gender, or disability. They are not only outdated, but demonstrably false. <br> <br>We have entered a period of great uncertainty and change, in which ideas and the values that inform them are shifting toward a re-balancing of markets, government, and communities. Our New Economic Paradigm work is experimenting with new ways of thinking and talking about the economy, while seeking to align stakeholders around a coherent new vision for equitable, inclusive, and sustainable capitalism. <br> <br>Rewriting the Rules<br>At its core, our capitalist economy and the ideas that shape it are a reflection of our common values. These ideas are translated into rules which give the economy structure and which govern who can participate in markets, and how. These rules include laws and regulations, as well as norms that govern everything from contracts and property rights, to competition, to employer-employee relationships. Ultimately, the rules that govern and shape markets matter, and they desperately need a rewrite. <br> <br>Our democracy, policies, politics, and markets must be protected and shielded from manipulation and capture by those with the most money,. These rules must be rewritten to direct capitalism toward greater societal outcomes, not the interests of economic or political elites. To that end, we are also exploring ways to rewrite the rules that shape economic structures so that they can support the well-being of everyone in our society. As part of that work, we are looking at opportunities to strengthen market infrastructure, financial systems, and corporate governance norms so that companies and investors can account for their impact on people, communities, and the planet.<br> <br>Reshaping Power <br>Ideas and rules are important, but they become concrete with power. Those who wield power are most likely to see their ideas reflected in the world, to design the economic and social norms governing markets and society, and determine which rules are enforced. This is why democracy, and its ideal of equal power, is so crucial to a capitalist society. Capitalism can certainly exist without democracy, but cannot, alone, guarantee that everyone will have access to opportunities to build a dignified life. We see this around the world, and increasingly in the United States: capitalist, oligopolistic markets are manipulated by the powerful to enrich themselves while exploiting the powerless. Democracy is the critical factor that allows all people equal rights and power to have a say in how capitalism impacts their lives and, more importantly, is the only system ensuring that any person can advocate for change when the capitalist economy is not delivering the basic well-being that is their right.<br> <br>Any true reimagining of capitalism must include checks to balance the power between markets, government, and civil society. So, Omidyar Network is working to reshape how power is distributed across society and the economy. One of our key priorities is to increase worker power and strengthen grassroots movements, since we believe that the economy will only increase the well-being of everyone — businesses, working people, and communities — when working people have individual and collective agency and voice. On the flip side, we are working to ensure that those who have benefited from existing economic structures do not use their economic power to distort either markets or democratic processes. To this end, we are working to curb concentrated corporate power and monopolies, especially in the tech sector, and are exploring strategies to counter corporate influence in our government. <br> <br>Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>The interplay of ideas, rules, and power are ultimately what determine which iterations of capitalism and democracy are possible. Ideas (which reflect our values) guide how we build our society. Rules determine distribution of wealth and power. Power then determines which ideas and rules shape society, and how. It is impossible to create a better form of capitalism or democracy without tackling each at the same time. In doing so, we aim to create a reimagined capitalism that empowers all people to realize their fullest potential as our economy flourishes.</p><p>Last year, we outlined five core pillars that we believe could best support a modern and equitably economy, one committed to values that reflect the inalienable rights of all; built to be not only inclusive, but explicitly anti-racist; capable of exercising true counterweights to economic power; dedicated to fostering a rebalanced relationship between markets, government, and communities; and responsive to the unique challenges we face in the 21st century. <br> <br>We know that we cannot build this alone. It will require deep partnership with a cadre of advocacy organizations and grassroots leaders, intellectuals and academics, business leaders and shareholders, philanthropies, policymakers and concerned citizens alike. We are humbled by the work that has already been done, encouraged by the growing chorus of voices calling for change, and proud to be a part of this effort. <br> <br>Throughout our history, American capitalism and democracy held promise for upward mobility and shared prosperity. Despite the many challenges that lie ahead, we believe we can expand that promise by seizing this moment to reimagine what we can&nbsp;be.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">Reimagining Capitalism Series: An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Sarah Drinkwater, Director, Responsible Technology and Tracy Williams, Director, Reimagining Capitalism</p><a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/11/02/18/google-workers-around-the-world-protest-its-corporate-culture">Photo by Jeenah Moon</a>,&nbsp;Reuters<p>In less than three weeks, nearly 6,000 workers at a fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama will begin voting on whether or not to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. If they vote yes, they will make history as the first American union in Amazon’s&nbsp;history.</p><p>The tech giant, which employs more than 1.1 million people around the world, has so far thwarted all attempts to unionize workers in the United States. The results? “The working conditions are horrible is all I’m willing to say,” <a href="https://prospect.org/labor/amazon-warehouse-workers-in-alabama-they-work-you-to-death/">said one Bessemer employee</a>. “I support a union coming aboard, we need them&nbsp;badly.”</p><p>The efforts to organize the Bessemer warehouse are the latest in a spate of activism by Amazon employees. <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/20/20874497/amazon-climate-change-walkout-google-microsoft-strike-tech-activism">In 2019,</a> more than 1,500 Amazon workers staged a walkout to push the company to lower its carbon footprint. That was followed by a virtual walkout this <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazon-avoided-unions-25-years-heres-labor-leaders-think-soon-change/">past June</a>, in protest of the firing of several tech workers and warehouse associates who were organizing around social justice and climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>And Amazon workers are not alone. Last summer, software engineer Raksha Muthukumar also found herself in the midst of a battle with a giant tech company. Her offense? She sent her colleagues a GoFundMe list of criminal justice reform groups in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder. “The fear of retaliation has always been great, and we’ve seen retaliation, so this is our chance to protect ourselves,” <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/08/954710407/at-google-hundreds-of-workers-formed-a-labor-union-why-to-protect-ourselves">said Muthukumar</a>.</p><p>On January 4, Muthukumar joined several hundred Google employees in the formation of the <a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/">Alphabet Workers Union</a> (AWU) with support from the Communications Workers of America (CWA). Since the announcement, more than 500 additional people have joined the union, and will now be able to protect themselves with a union&nbsp;card.</p><p>Google’s employees aren’t demanding higher pay. They are fighting to overturn the fundamental concept of shareholder primacy — that Google’s primary goal should be to make as much money as possible. “We will use our reclaimed power to control what we work on and how it is used,” <a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/principles/mission-statement/">AWU wrote in its mission statement</a>. “We will ensure Alphabet acts ethically and in the best interests of society and the environment.”</p><p>This latest development comes after years of frustrated attempts by workers to unite and confront Google management on critical issues, including sexual harassment in the workplace, ethics and the responsible deployment of technology, and partnerships with controversial customers like the US Department of&nbsp;Defense.</p><p>Successful organizing drives don’t just happen. The formation of the Alphabet Workers Union is the culmination of many earlier efforts by Alphabet employees. In December, Dr. Timnit Gebru, a scholar in the race and Artificial Intelligence (AI) field and co-leader of Google’s Ethics in AI team, was ousted ostensibly due to a disagreement over her team’s research after previously speaking out on behalf of minoritized employees. Dr. Gebru’s termination was a defining moment that galvanized many Google employees on their path to forming the&nbsp;union.</p><p>This is all part of a growing movement to organize in the tech industry. Employees at tech firms Kickstarter and Glitch were able to unionize last year, and hundreds of other workers at large tech companies ranging from Microsoft and Facebook, to Salesforce and GitHub, have increased their activism.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/the-gm-score-25-billion-for-stockholders-vs-0-for-uaw-members-24fbd959331e">Omidyar Network</a> stands in solidarity with these workers who are organizing for their rights — and what’s&nbsp;right.</p><p>We believe that increased worker power provides an essential counterweight to the rising dominance of corporations. Over the past several decades, we have seen the economic power of major companies spill over into the political arena, leading to a lopsided power imbalance that has damaged not only the fundamentals of capitalism, but of our democracy as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The solution? Empower workers — from warehouse associates to software engineers — with greater power, agency, and voice at work, both individually and collectively. That goal lies squarely at the intersection of two of Omidyar Network’s key priorities: expanding Worker Power and supporting Responsible Tech Workers. In doing so, we can create a much healthier economy, one that is better for employees, businesses, consumers, and&nbsp;society.</p><p>Through our <a href="https://omidyar.com/responsible-technology/">Responsible Tech</a> work, we’re helping to <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/why-were-investing-in-the-rise-of-the-responsible-tech-worker-a96e74661cdf">provide tech workers</a> with the tools, resources, and space to ask thoughtful questions about responsible tech so they can focus on building solutions that avoid the potential downsides of technology. To that end, we have invested in organizations ranging from <a href="https://home.coworker.org/">Coworker</a>, a mechanism to helps tech workers organize, both within their companies and more broadly to the <a href="https://www.tspa.info/">Trust and Safety Professional Association</a>, to New&nbsp;Public.</p><p>As part of our efforts to <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">Reimagine Capitalism</a> and increase Worker Power, we’re fighting for labor reform policies that increase the power of all workers, and supporting new organizing models that expand worker power to a broader set of working people, whether in the gig economy, in homes, in fields, or in a conventional workplace. Some of our grantees in this area include the <a href="https://www.cleanslateworkerpower.org/">Clean Slate for Worker Power project</a> at Harvard Law School, United for Respect’s <a href="https://www.workitapp.org/">WorkIt app</a>, which uses artificial intelligence to answer workers’ questions about their rights and helps workers organize, and a new coalition focused on advancing worker power in California through policy and advocacy, narrative change, and strengthening organizing, led by the <a href="https://kiwa.org/">Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance (KIWA</a>). We also work with the <a href="https://www.forworkingfamilies.org/">Partnership for Working Families</a>, and the <a href="http://www.warehouseworkers.org/">Warehouse Workers Resource&nbsp;Center</a>.</p><p>The actions taken by working people to organize at some of America’s most influential tech companies represent a significant step forward in restructuring the social contract between tech giants, the people who work for them, and the society they serve. We’re cheering them&nbsp;on.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/omidyar-network-applauds-tech-employees-who-are-demanding-a-voice-through-unionization-ebbe3bf2b26d">Omidyar Network Applauds Tech Employees Who Are Demanding a Voice Through Unionization</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>International Consortium Bolsters European Focus on Open Source and Open Standards Development</p> 


<p>Utrecht, The Netherlands; 20 January 2021 – OASIS Open, the international open source and open standards consortium, is pleased to announce the launch of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.eu/">OASIS Open Europe Foundation</a> (<a href="http://www.oasis-open.eu">https://www.oasis-open.eu</a>). The foundation provides a strong and dedicated European focus in setting standards for open collaboration, and allows OASIS to provide long-term sustainability for European Union research projects.</p>



<p>“The OASIS Open Europe Foundation gives us a unique opportunity to work with the European Union and EU Member States to advance open source and standards projects,” said Dr. Martin Chapman of Oracle, who chairs the OASIS Open Europe Foundation. “We will leverage the global experience of OASIS Open to provide a regional focus for the OASIS community and engage in European-specific activities that promote the use of open technologies.”</p>



<p>“We are particularly excited by the diverse group of experts who will be providing leadership on the foundation’s Board of Directors,” said Dr. Carol Cosgrove-Sacks, Senior Advisor, International Standards Policy at OASIS. “They represent a remarkable range of talent from industry and academia with strong expertise in ICT standards, open source projects, innovation, research, and development, along with perspectives in new areas for open technologies such as AI and data.”</p>



<p>The OASIS Open Europe Foundation’s Board of Directors will include:</p>



  Laetitia Cailleteau of Accenture (France)  Martin Chapman of Oracle (Ireland)  Eva Coscia of R2M Solution (Italy)  Gershon Janssen, Independent Consultant (Netherlands)  Janna Lingenfelder of IBM (Germany)  Guy Martin of OASIS Open (United States)  Andriana Prentza of the University of Piraeus (Greece)  



<p>Building on OASIS Open’s European Presence</p>



<p>OASIS Open has a long history of advancing open source and open standards in Europe. OASIS standards and specifications have been used in very large, highly visible initiatives, including Europe’s most widely used standard for electronic invoices, and serve as the basis of the European Commission’s eDelivery building block that is used in some of the world’s largest international data exchanges.</p>



<p>OASIS has a well-established place on the EU’s high-level advisory committee, the Multi-Stakeholder Platform for EU ICT Standardisation (MSP). OASIS standards feature in the Rolling Plan for ICT standardisation and are routinely used in both the private and public sector throughout Europe.</p>



<p>Open source has become increasingly important as a complement or alternative to traditional standardisation. The Open Document Format for Office Applications was originally developed in Europe as a file format of open source office software and subsequently standardized at OASIS Open and in ISO. Today, OASIS Open is hosting open source work in areas like cybersecurity and blockchain. The OASIS Open Europe Foundation aims to support open source initiatives that prefer to operate in Europe with European stakeholders under EU law.</p>



<p>Open data is an emerging area of interest in the OASIS Open community, especially in Europe, due to Europe’s lead in areas such as data protection and its legislation. Like open standards, open data is a key contributor to the Digital Single Market that will benefit from new products and services based on data. Data is also a critical asset for future development of AI. The OASIS Open Europe Foundation will support the OASIS Open community as a global player in the international data space area, leveraging its reputation in areas of security and privacy.</p>



<p>About OASIS Open</p>



<p>One of the most respected, member-driven standards bodies in the world, OASIS offers projects—including open source projects—a path to standardisation and de jure approval for reference in international policy and procurement. OASIS members include major multinational companies, SMEs, government agencies, universities, research institutions, consulting groups, and individuals.</p>

<p>By Jessy Kate Schingler and Primavera de&nbsp;Filippi</p><p>Extitutional theory is an emerging field of scholarship that provides a set of conceptual tools to describe and analyse the underlying social dynamics of a variety of social arrangements, such as communities, companies, organisations, or any other types of institutions.</p><p>Extitutional theory posits that the institutional framework is just one specific lens through which we can make sense of social behaviour. Social dynamics that are not part of an institution are not unstructured, just differently structured. Specifically, institutions focus on the static and inert elements of social structures — the aspects that persist over time — whereas extitutions focus on the dynamic and mutating elements of social structures — the aspects that continuously evolve over time. Both serve as filters to observe different aspects of the underlying social arrangements. This means that if we look at structured social dynamics only and exclusively through an institutional lens, we are only seeing one part of the larger picture. Extitutional theory provides an alternative lens — and the choice to use it is a normative decision to look at another part of the&nbsp;picture.</p>Unknown author; <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=80222262">Public&nbsp;Domain</a>.<p>It is important to note that the extitutional lens is not claiming that there are social dynamics “outside” of an institution, in the Here be Dragons sense of extrapolated but as-yet-unexplored territory; it simply observes the same social dynamics of an institution from another conceptual angle. By relying on the idea that institutions and extitutions are two different interpretations of the same set of social dynamics, we can formalize the characterization of each lens, and begin to examine the underlying structuring logics that distinguish them. Since they represent two different points of view into the same social arrangement, we can also explore the structural relationships that link these two lenses. Extitutional theory attempts to formalize these different ordering logics and the interplay between&nbsp;them.</p><p>For instance, a company is generally composed of a structured set of roles: a board of directors, a series of shareholders, a CEO, a treasurer, etc. — each with their corresponding rights and duties. Instead of these formal roles, the extitutional lens focuses on the social dynamics that animate this structure, which necessarily evolve over time as individuals join or leave the social structure, and as their reciprocal relationships change. The hiring of a new CEO doesn’t mutate the structure from an institutional perspective, yet it could have a significant impact on the social dynamics of the company as whole, because of the different capacities and relationships that the CEO will establish with the other company members. These extitutional dynamics are crucial to the life of institutions, and may impact operational behaviour through culture and more informal principles and&nbsp;values.</p><p>Given that both lenses are looking at the exact same social arrangement — although focusing on different aspects of it — a proper understanding of the underlying social dynamics requires a holistic view, combining both the institutional and extitutional perspective. Indeed, one does not exist without the other: while the operations of a company or organisation are ultimately constrained by the specific rules and roles that constitute the institution, they are fundamentally fueled by the individuals assuming these roles and the corresponding relationships that make up the extitution. Accordingly, the interplay between institutions and extitutions is all the more crucial to explore in the context of complex social arrangements because the two are constantly shaping and influencing each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Extitutional theory is interested not only in the ways that individuals interact and engage with one another through relationships and rhythms, but also in how different practices of institutionalization can create conditions that stabilize and amplify, or erode and suppress, certain extitutional dynamics — and vice versa. Central to the process of institutionalisation is the concept of enclosure: the mechanism through which an institution implements increased control (or coding) relative to a particular domain. Conversely, extitutional theory contrasts enclosure with the concept of exclosure, which recognizes that certain types of enclosures appear to play a different role — that of protecting the activity within it from control and coding. Providing tools to better understand the interplay between these two mechanisms is one of the key contributions of Extitutional theory.</p><p>Extitutional theory does not assign any moral value to institutions or extitutions: neither are good or bad; yet, because of the performativity of these lenses, choosing to look at a particular social arrangement as an institution or an extitution will impact the way we interact with it, as well as the manner in which it will evolve over time. Networked technologies in particular have created dramatic new exclosures giving rise to extitutional dynamics which can’t be understood through the institutional lens alone. Hence, extitutional theory is important not because it is better than institutional theory, but because extitutions are an under-studied phenomena. Understanding extitutional dynamics, and their interplay with the more familiar tools and logics of institutions, can help us respond to the specific, unprecedented demands of human coordination in our&nbsp;era.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/an-introduction-to-extitutional-theory-e74b5a49ea53">An Introduction to Extitutional Theory</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>For the 1.7 billion unbanked adults around the world, access to financial services is extremely limited. Without even a basic savings account, economic opportunity is often limited to informal offerings such as local shopkeepers who extend credit to their customers, microfinance institutions that work to serve the last mile, and community savings and credit associations that are setup by individuals living in the same village.</p>



<p>In the unbanked world, individuals borrow a few hundred to a few thousand dollars at a time, paying back over a relatively short time frame of 12-18 months. But despite excellent credit records, they are unable to receive even similar credit facilities at local banks. This is because the data from their informal transactions is essentially invisible: the banks either do not trust the data sources, or are otherwise unable to verify the provenance of the data. </p>



<p>While this is the state of the world today, it does not have to be our future.  Kiva, a US-based nonprofit organization focused on financial inclusion, has built Kiva Protocol to bridge the data disconnect and help enable universal financial access. In 2019, Sierra Leone, a West African nation of about 7 million, launched the National Digital Identity Platform (NDIP) that used Kiva Protocol to enable fast, cheap, and secure identity verification for its citizens. </p>



<p>Kiva Protocol is built using Hyperledger Indy, Aries, and Ursa, and as implemented in Sierra Leone, allows citizens to perform electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) verifications in about 11 seconds, using just their national ID number and a fingerprint. With this verification, it is possible for the nation’s unbanked to open a savings account and move into the formally banked population.</p>



<p>To find the right platform, Kiva assessed more than 20 software stacks, both centralized and decentralized. Blockchain and decentralized ledger technologies quickly emerged as good solutions for the developing world as they enable data provenance at the protocol level and stakeholders can act relatively independently to enable their various activities in the formal and informal sectors.</p>



<p>After deep consideration, Kiva decided to use Hyperledger’s stack for identity: Indy, Aries, Ursa. While all three projects are closely related, each has a distinct mandate:</p>



  Hyperledger Indy is a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized ID with transferable, private, and secure credentials;  Hyperledger Aries is infrastructure that supports interactions between peers and between blockchains and other DLTs; and  Hyperledger Ursa is a modular, flexible library that enables developers to share time-tested and secure cryptography.  



<p>In August 2019, Kiva launched the beta of Kiva Protocol with a public event opened by the president of Sierra Leone. Since that launch, global regulators have made significant progress in terms of how they are considering digital identity and eKYC verifications. There is a growing global movement towards user-owned and -controlled data, better privacy, and more universal access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of today, Kiva is focusing on building additional ecosystem applications and services to make it easier for all stakeholders to access and use Kiva Protocol. Much of this is being contributed upstream into the Hyperledger Indy and Aires projects, with the remaining components hosted in Kiva’s repository.</p>

<p>Digital identity is now a fundamental requirement to function in a world that has shifted to remote-first. To empower individuals and to protect their self-sufficiency, the concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI) was developed. It grants the individual agency over their interactions and data by putting the data-subject back into the driver-seat.</p> Self-sovereign identity and its use-cases <p>There are plenty of potential use-cases. Our identity isn’t something we can easily explain or which can easily be summarized by single data sets. It highly depends on the context in which it operates and is different depending on the person with whom we interact. One category of use-cases is the proof of certification or qualification of an individual. This proof is required for applications for jobs, grants or the participation in special events. Depending on the requirements, an individual can collect all necessary certificates and present them directly to the relying party. Another big category of use-cases is to enable access to information, buildings or resources. When e.g. information is labeled as “internal only”, the authorized people should be able to access it. Organizations can issue credentials to the right target audience and only approve access for those individuals, which have a valid credential.</p> Wallets and&nbsp;Networks <p>Two elemental components of an SSI-ecosystem are the wallets for end-users and the networks for organisations on which issued credentials are anchored to. In this article, we will explain how these relate to each other, what their specific goals are and how they interact with each other by providing the example of the Lissi wallet and the Indicio&nbsp;Network.</p> About the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet <p>In order to store and possess the credential, an individual requires an application with a graphical user interface to receive, store and present these credentials to third parties. A wallet is a key management application, which hides all the complicated technical aspects from the user and provides the required guidance to securely interact with trusted contacts. The Lissi wallet offers an intuitive interface and provides the necessary information and flexibility to navigate through an increasingly complex digital environment. Furthermore, it automatically recognizes the network, which an organisation used to verify the authenticity of the credential. Hence, while organizations can choose a suitable network, the user is informed about the network, but doesn’t need to do anything to receive the credential or interact with the organisation. Lissi is your smart agent, which takes unnecessary workload from you, provides you with the information to make informed decisions while always offering a&nbsp;choice.</p><p>While the Lissi team is also involved in the formation of the <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion network</a> with its main focus in Europe, we recognize that organisations around the world have different needs. The networks, which are necessary to verify the authenticity of issued credentials, need to be adjusted to different regulatory requirements and the specific demands of their target audience. The network is a distributed and publicly readable database, which contains the public identifier of a legal entity. Therefore, we are committed to not only provide individuals with the choice of their favourite wallet, but also organisations with the choice of their network. We are delighted to announce that the latest version of the Lissi wallet also supports the Indicio&nbsp;Network.</p> About the Indico&nbsp;Network <p><a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio.tech </a>created the Indicio Network to meet the needs of companies and organizations that want a reliable and robust network to build, test, demo, and launch their identity solutions — all the while supported by a team of engineers with extensive experience in decentralized identity, its architecture, and its use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Indicio believes that this “concierge” approach to running a network will accelerate the development, adoption, and use of verifiable digital credentials. This&nbsp;means:</p>  Professional staffing: Indicio’s engineers are among the most experienced in the decentralized identity field and are ready to answer questions, support network operations, and help to get products ready for&nbsp;launch.  Stability for demonstrations: Indicio supports developers at every step of the way from building to testing and public demonstrations.  Cross-network test readiness: Indicio sees the future as one of interoperable credentials and networks. Its network is the perfect platform for testing interoperability by issuing and verifying on multiple networks.  Easy Node Operator onboarding: For those interested in joining a network as a node operator, Indicio has simplified the process, offers training for all levels, and a suite of network tools and resources.  <p>With the Covid pandemic driving urgent need for decentralized identity solutions, Indicio is committed to delivering superlative infrastructure and technical support, and to making decentralized identity as easy to use as possible, whether as a node operator, a developer, an issuer or a verifier.</p> About Indicio <p>Indicio.tech is a professional services firm specializing in decentralized identity architecture, engineering, and consultancy. Indicio provides expert guidance to a global community of clients on the use of verifiable credentials to build digital identity solutions. The decentralized networks and tools created by Indicio make verifiable credentials easy to adopt, simple to deploy, and reliable to use. As a Public Benefit Corporation, Indicio is committed to advancing decentralized identity as a public good that enables people to control their identities online and share their data by consent. Indicio believes in privacy and security by design, interoperability, and supports the open source goals of the decentralized identity community.</p><p>This article was co-written by the Lissi and Indicio team.<br>Cheers</p>

 Key Event Receipt Infrastructure to expand the reach of DIDs&nbsp; <p><br></p> Introduction <p>Work under the <a href="https://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> hood continues on <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>. This new type of digital identifier enables the verification that a DID comes from an authenticable source under the control of a governing entity. A DID is always coupled to a unique DID document that describes how to (i.) interact with a governing entity in a trustable way and (ii.) authenticate a DID controller.</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>This association is defined by a DID method, which can be captured directly through a dedicated namespace in the syntax of the DID. Each method defines the basic chaining and processing requirements - CRUD (create, read, update, deactivate) - for the immutable coupling of the DID and its associated DID document. A DID method specification defines both the DID method and the process of DID resolution, describing how a DID document is to be written and subsequently edited. DIDs come with a unique set of characteristics to provide a prominent solution for digital identifiers in decentralised networks, but there are cons.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">W3C DID Working Group</a> has already registered <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">84 different method types</a>, which raises questions about interoperability, scalability, and security of the current DID methodology, such as (i.) How secure are DIDs and specific DID methods?, and (ii.) Can all DID methods be trusted?</p><p>In this blog post, these questions are addressed from the viewpoint of <a href="https://keri.one">KERI</a> (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure), a novel, simple, and improved DKMS (Decentralized Key Management System) solution for digital identifiers. KERI provides a uniform solution to DID document authentication and resolution that will prove invaluable to use cases where security and interoperability are essential (e.g., for global supply chains and humanitarian applications).</p> Interoperability  DID resolution process, a security weakness <p>Each DID method aims to solve the same problem in a nuanced way by responding to a specific problem or use case uniquely by design. However, from the perspective of the user, this compromises the integrity of the network with a variance of digital assurance for each method implementation.</p><p>From the inclusion of standard Central Authorities (CAs) to the implementation of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), each solution comes with its own set of pros and cons when it comes to tackling digital security. Some rely on the human trust factor, while others rely on cryptographic assurance and, through these nuances, the DID resolution process, inadvertently, becomes a “magic box” with each specific implementation relying on different security measures.&nbsp;</p><p>If interoperability is a core requirement for a specific use case, assessing and maintaining an optimal level of security and assurance may become difficult. To achieve strong security between the DID and its associated DID document, regardless of who controls and stores the DID Document, interacting actors must assume that the result can always be cryptographically assured and, therefore, trusted. If a specific method is ever compromised, the negative connotations could be detrimental to the SSI community as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>With the ever-increasing number of DID methods, Trusted Digital Assistant (TDA) and digital wallet implementations would have to support all methods for full interoperability to be maintained.</p> Security  DID resolution process, the rise of the “Magic Box” <p>Digital security is only as strong as its weakest link. The process of obtaining a DID document for a given DID is called DID resolution and, when it comes to the DID, it is the weakest link. To create a DID, a user must first generate a public / private key pair. The DID can then be coupled to a DID document and usually within an infrastructure to enable that process. The cryptographic link enables a strong binding between the key and the DID. However, when it comes to the DID resolution process, most DID methods either rely on external sources of information or provide a limited scope on the capability and content of the DID document. There is no standard way of creating a strong binding between a DID and DID document, which compromises the security of the identifier. An example of weak binding is demonstrated by the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web method</a>, which simply points to a DID document in the public domain with a DNS (Domain Name System) resolver used for the retrieval process, e.g.:</p><p>did:web:w3c-ccg.github.io:user:alice</p><p>The DID method, a dedicated namespace in the DID syntax, currently defines the DID resolution process. As mentioned in this post’s introduction, the number of registered DID methods continues to rise exponentially.&nbsp;</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>With the rapid rise of decentralised authentication solutions appearing on the market, many different DID methods are currently active under the hood of applications and services which, for the most part, remain invisible to the end-user. Thus popularity, rather than security, has become the driving factor behind chosen DID methods. Due to this fragmentation, identifying and resolving weak security points of deployed DID methods continues to be cumbersome. Some of the method types, such as the <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DID method</a>, enable the derivation of a DID document directly from the DID itself. However, most rely on external processing to resolve the document, with the source providing a hidden "magic box" that masks the DID resolution process. To maintain system integrity, any DID method that requires external processing via a “magic box” requires trust from all interacting actors. Trust is a human trait. Cryptographic assurance, a machine trait, can often be overlooked in the presence of trust.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital security stems from the resolution process but, with the current DID methodology, a uniform standard is not available across all implementations, which can lead to fragmentation and security risks across the network.</p> How to maintain interoperability &amp; security <p>The weak binding issue between a DID and DID document can be resolved by a technological solution that provides an immutable link between the two objects. In doing so, a DID document can be cryptographically verified for correctness as there is an immutable coupling to a specific DID.&nbsp;</p> Cryptographic hash&nbsp; <p>Cryptographic assurance is provided by generating a hash of the DID document, to be used as the actual identifier. The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did:key method</a> works in this way. However, this approach is limited as there is no way of rotating the keys, revoking the identifier, or adding additional information to the DID document.</p> Key Event Receipt Infrastructure 








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p><a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a> (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) is a protocol that provides a simple set of rules on how to achieve strong bindings between the controller, identifier, and key pair, without sacrificing the functional capabilities of the identifier. It achieves this through solid security principles in its base architecture. KERI generates a type of “DID document” in the form of an appendable private micro-ledger that contains cryptographically-linked sets of events for transaction verification purposes. In doing so, KERI facilitates sapored data supply chains providing an append-only chained <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/kid0000.md">key-event log</a> (KEL) of signed transfer statements, which account for the source of the identifier and all transactions related to it.</p><p>In current KERI implementations, the genesis state of the identifier is “active” as defined by the Human Colossus model of <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/active-and-passive-identifiers">Identifier States</a>, meaning that a signing key is required to authenticate the controller. As a self-certifying identifier with an event log, KERI provides a strong binding between the DID and DID document, thereby enabling all DID identifier operations (e.g., key rotation, delegation, and interaction) to be tracked and cryptographically verified by any recipient of the identifier information. For instances where a controller's keys are compromised, a pre-rotation mechanism for key recoverability is also available. These security-rich enhancements suggest that a magic box, along with any associated weak binding issues, can be benched in favour of KERI, which promises to provide a simple, yet improved, alternative DKMS-solution for digital identifiers.</p><p>In the current version of the DID specification, location is identifiable via the method space. For example, the <a href="https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html">did:sov method</a> assigns a DID to the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin</a> MainNet ledger. Other DID methods define the resolution rules for other unique implementations. In terms of security, this level of tailor-made differentiation between use cases can become an attack vector. Having to maintain an ever-growing registry of DID methods and implementation specifics suggests a scalability issue in the current methodology. These issues are disadvantageous to the whole SSI community.<br><br>To solve these issues, KERI introduces a component called Resolver, which provides a mechanism to discover identifiers. Resolver simply maps identifiers to URLs or IP addresses where users can either obtain (or be directed to) auditable identifier event logs. The resolver relies on a distributed hash table (DHT) algorithm, known for its beneficial characteristics in autonomy, decentralization, fault tolerance, and scalability, a good example being <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> (InterPlanetary File System) or <a href="https://gnunet.org/en/index.html">GNUnet</a>.&nbsp;</p> Simple and concise <p>The beauty of&nbsp; KERI is that the user can nominate locations through the event log with full autonomy to make edits or location transfers as they wish. To highlight a prevalent issue with the current DID methodology, a DID method may assign an identifier to the Sovrin MainNet but, after a few months, the controller may wish to move it to a new location such as the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> network or an IPFS location. As it currently stands, there is no restriction on the number of identifiers that can be issued to identify the same object. The generation of duplicate identifiers for the same content despite the encoded part of the DID remaining unaltered is problematic. By removing the method space, the identifier can be used on any network, thus providing a truly interoperable solution for decentralised identifiers.</p><p>With KERI, a cryptographically-verifiable DID document is available to a recipient without requiring prior knowledge of the exact location of the object. In the absence of having to define a specific network or alternative storage location in the DID syntax, the namespace for any “magic box” method becomes redundant, along with any fragmentation issues that have arisen from the current DID methodology. In the future, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-syntax">DID syntax</a> as defined in the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0</a> specification, could evolve from …</p><p>did:&lt;method&gt;:&lt;identifier&gt;</p><p>to</p><p>did:&lt;identifier&gt;<br></p><p>The road ahead may be long, but the effort worthwhile, as the revised syntax could bring about an adoption factor where (i.) security is a primary concern (e.g., humanitarian sector) or (ii.) stakeholders for a given business process are numerous and operate in different jurisdictions (e.g., global supply chains).</p> Conclusion &amp; Further developments <p>The current generation of DIDs has introduced an innovative approach to digital identifiers, which has triggered the SSI movement. However, the inclusion of the method space in the DID syntax has led to fragmentation and weak security properties of the identifier type. These known method-space issues give the community impetus to redress them. In light of these innovative developments, now is the time to embrace KERI as an improved interoperable and secure solution for digital identifiers.</p><p>KERI is a truly secure network-agnostic decentralised infrastructure for digital identifiers.</p><p>Within <a href="https://trustoverip.org">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, a Linux Foundation Project, trustees of the Human Colossus Foundation have convened an <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Inputs+and+Semantics+Working+Group">Inputs and Semantics Working Group</a> (ISWG), subdivided into an <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Inputs+Domain+Group">Inputs Domain Group</a> (ISWG-I) and a <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Semantic+Domain+Group">Semantic Domain Group</a> (ISWG-S).

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to announce the availability of Financial-grade API (FAPI) conformance tests for banks and fintechs in Australia providing consumer data rights (CDR) compliant solutions.</p>
<p>The Foundation recently updated the FAPI conformance suite to ensure that servers following the CDR standards comply with the underlying FAPI specifications, specifically FAPI-RW. These updates include minor changes relative to the underlying FAPI-RW specification:</p>
 
 private_key_jwt must be used 
 x-v header must be sent to resource server endpoint 
 Refresh tokens must be supported 
 Returned id_tokens must be encrypted 
 For “acr” claims, a CDR-specific value is used: “urn:cds.au:cdr:2” 
 
<p>The Foundation is also announcing the availability of FAPI-RW with Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) conformance tests. PAR is an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-par">IETF standard developed within the OAuth Working Group</a> that is an evolution of the FAPI-RW’s request object endpoint. FAPI-RW with PAR avoids passing the authorization details via the front channel, which is better for privacy and avoids any size limits on URLs. This new certification service also optionally covers the new pushed authorization request (PAR) spec that CDR introduced in November 2020.</p>
<p>A number of Australian organizations have “tested the tests” against their CDR environments, finding a number of interoperability and security issues in the deployments of Data Holders – which were then addressed before they impacted a significant number of Data Recipients.</p>
<p>More information about running the new CDR and PAR conformance tests can be found here: <a href="https://openid.net/certification/fapi_op_testing/">https://openid.net/certification/fapi_op_testing/</a>.</p>
<p>A list of FAPI certified implementations/deployments can be found here:</p>

<p>Dear OpenID Foundation Members:</p>
<p>This is to update the OpenID Foundation community on our leadership transition and plans for 2021. We’ve enlisted the support of Women in Identity, IDPro and other groups to insure a broad international search and a diversity of backgrounds for the Foundation’s next Executive Director. Our search efforts are ongoing so please feel free to send your nominations to Vice Chairman Bjorn Hjelm.</p>
<p>Despite the headwinds of 2020, the awareness of the OpenID Foundation’s international technical leadership has translated into adoption momentum across working groups. Many point to the Financial-Grade APIs (FAPI) Working Group diversity of requirements and ongoing technical improvement has driven FAPI’s global adoption. The extensibility of open standards and the increasing importance of international interoperability has been a particular focus area of Don Thibeau’s for the Foundation during this leadership transition.</p>
<p>To maintain this momentum and help guide the OpenID Foundation’s new leadership, we’ve asked Don Thibeau to continue to serve, but in a new role as a Non Executive Director on the OpenID Foundation board of directors. This provides the board and its new leadership the time, continuity and experience needed to transition and grow. And most importantly, is to continue to build on the contribution of those in OpenID Foundation working groups that are the foundation of our success.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support of and contributions to the OpenID Foundation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

Chairman, OpenID Foundation Board of Directors</p>

<p>First Committee Specification from the CACAO TC</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that CACAO Security Playbooks Version 1.0 from the OASIS Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) for Cyber Security TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>To defend against threat actors and their tactics, techniques, and procedures, organizations need to identify, create, document, and test detection, investigation, prevention, mitigation, and remediation steps. These steps, when grouped together, form a cyber security playbook that can be used to protect organizational systems, networks, data, and users.</p>



<p>This specification defines the schema and taxonomy for cybersecurity playbooks and how cybersecurity playbooks can be created, documented, and shared in a structured and standardized way across organizational boundaries and technological solutions.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

<p>We have exciting news to share: CCI has a home&nbsp;now!</p><p>When the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI)</a> was formed in April 2020, we were a self-organizing group of companies and individuals, held together by a few mailing lists and working groups, to explore how Verifiable Credentials (VCs), an open standard and an emerging technology, could be used for the public health crisis unfolding with COVID-19. Recognizing our limits early on as an informal group, we quickly pivoted from developing a solution together to supporting each other to build for their local contexts. Over the course of nine months, we have seen <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dbWvs1m8uziTsbhUQv_nPofTXAyDSkxI5CZtoo1SlRY/edit?ts=5e85430a#heading=h.eu5hdldar29h">over 20 projects present their work</a> to the CCI community and developed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s7oEESllR9pa4ecXNGfougaHmDBzDBh1KHKvIsy0dPw/edit?usp=sharing">an MVP governance framework</a> that can be adapted to specific COVID-19 use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>As our work evolved and as vaccine development showed promising progress, the need to align efforts around VCs for COVID-19 and educate decision-makers on the use of VCs for COVID-19 became clearer and stronger. However, the limits of not having a formal organizational home hinder us from engaging with key stakeholders and conducting necessary development efforts. So, we began exploring options for a home in&nbsp;summer.</p><p>Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH) emerged in the middle of the pandemic, right after we started our search. There was a natural alignment between LFPH and CCI on building on open standards to ensure interoperability and developing open-source code bases of minimal-viable privacy-preserving software components to make interoperability easier and cheaper to implement. So here we are today; after achieving success with privacy-preserving exposure notification apps, LFPH officially took CCI in before the end of 2020, kicking off our journey to advance the use of VCs for public health with vaccination record as a&nbsp;start.</p><p>At the tail end of holiday spirits, we hope to spread our joy by sharing with you the invitation letter (below in italics) from Brian Behlendorf, the Executive Director of LFPH. You can find the official press release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lfph.io/2020/12/16/press-release/">here</a>.</p><blockquote>Dear CCI Community,</blockquote><blockquote>We are excited to extend this invitation to you to join <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> and work together with us to advance the use of Verifiable Credentials and data and technical interoperability of Verifiable Credentials in the public health&nbsp;realm.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> (LFPH) was founded in July 2020 as a collaborative effort to combat COVID-19 and future epidemics through building, securing, and sustaining open- source software to help public health authorities (PHAs). We started with exposure notification apps and have achieved success with <a href="https://github.com/covidgreen/covid-green-app">COVID Green™</a> and <a href="https://www.covidshield.app/">COVID Shield™</a>, which are being deployed in 4 US states and 7 countries around the world. The early achievements were made possible within such a short time frame through our merger with <a href="https://www.lfph.io/tcn-coalition/">TCN Coalition</a>, a global community promoting privacy-preserving and interoperable exposure notification apps.</blockquote><blockquote>As COVID-19 tests mature and vaccines are around the corner, we have identified an increasing demand for responsible and interoperable credentialing solutions to issue and manage COVID-19 credentials, especially vaccine records, from PHAs. Therefore, we would like to work with the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI), supporting you to build on your existing work and enabling open-source development for vaccine records or key components of it, which can be implemented widely by PHAs with the help of the CCI community. We view this as a starting point of a long-term partnership to advance the adoption of verifiable credentials for wider public health use cases, such as patient ID and patient centered information exchange.</blockquote><blockquote>At LFPH, we have been following CCI’s work; we value the resources and assets created by the community and the tight relationships you have developed with small, grassroots solution providers. We foresee the scope of our partnership to go beyond open-source software development. The nature of the problem we are solving requires us to build solutions that are interoperable, so we are committed to supporting CCI in leading work around open standards, e.g. definitions and schemas for public health credentials. We also will provide CCI resources to strengthen community and knowledge building, broaden and deepen engagement with key stakeholders (e.g. PHAs, commercial entities, software vendors, relevant identity and technical communities) and conduct public and strategic advocacy.</blockquote><blockquote>As the next step, we will join the CCI Group Update call on December 11 from 10 to 11 am ET to answer any questions you have. In the meantime, we plan to commission the following three members of the CCI Community Guidance Team to lead the migration of CCI into LFPH once the community is&nbsp;ready:</blockquote><blockquote>- Lucy Yang, Co-Lead of the Coordination and Communications Workstream of&nbsp;CCI</blockquote><blockquote>- John Walker, Co-Lead of the Coordination and Communications Workstream of&nbsp;CCI</blockquote><blockquote>- Kaliya Young, the Identity Woman, an active contributor at CCI and a super-connector in the credential community. (Kaliya made the initial connection between CCI and LFPH and facilitated the formation of the partnership.)</blockquote><blockquote>While LFPH does offer different levels of paid <a href="https://www.lfph.io/join/become-a-member/">membership</a> for companies and we welcome interested parties to join, membership will not be a requirement for individuals and organizations to participate in any CCI activities. We will strive to respect the community-driven and open nature of CCI to the maximum during migration and onwards, and only leverage LFPH’s structure and infrastructure to improve efficiencies and effectiveness.</blockquote><blockquote>This is a strong alignment of efforts between two communities that share the same vision and aspiration. We look forward to meeting you and working with&nbsp;you.</blockquote><blockquote>Brian Behlendorf</blockquote><blockquote>Managing Director for Blockchain, Healthcare and&nbsp;Identity</blockquote><blockquote>The Linux Foundation</blockquote><p>Happy New Year! We appreciate your support in 2020 and look forward to working together for a better&nbsp;2021.</p>

 2020 — How SSI Went Mainstream <p>January 12,&nbsp;2021</p> An introduction to SSI and where it came from.<br>2020 as a growth catalyst and where SSI is going.<br>A <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a> perspective. <p>Written by:<br>Chris Raczkowski — Sovrin Foundation, Chairman of the Board of Trustees<br>Drummond Reed — Evernym, Chief Trust Officer; ToIP, Steering Committee Member</p><p>It goes without saying that last year was transformational for the world. Along with pains felt by many, the challenges of 2020 were also a catalyst for positive growth. The global SSI community, dedicated to privacy-respecting digital identity, has risen to these challenges. Digital identity solutions have been called into action by governments and companies large and small to help mitigate pandemic-related public health challenges. This call to action has accelerated adoption of SSI across many use cases where it brings new standards of truly privacy-respecting digital identity control to all peoples of the&nbsp;world.</p> But first, what is&nbsp;SSI? <p>SSI is an acronym for self-sovereign identity, representing the secure, privacy-respecting digital identity model developed around blockchain technology starting in 2016. During the last five years acceptance of this model has grown rapidly. SSI utilizes best practices in open-source cryptography and decentralized computing in tandem with humanistic governance. It also helped drive development of new technology open standards such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>. While SSI incorporates a wide range of complex technology and detailed governance, its essence is captured in the opening chapter of a book that will be published during&nbsp;2021:</p><blockquote>“The best overall analogy for the decentralized identity model (SSI) is in fact exactly the way we prove our identity to each other every day: by getting out our wallet and showing the credentials we have obtained from other trusted parties.&nbsp;... With decentralized digital identity, we just do this with digital wallets, digital credentials, and digital connections.” ¹</blockquote><blockquote>SSI has emerged as a, “simple, neutral, memorable name for this new model for digital identity.” ²</blockquote> Open Source and Open Standards: Growth Engines of&nbsp;SSI <p>SSI is rooted in core principles of privacy-respecting Internet-scale identity architecture first laid out by individuals like Kim Cameron with his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352/#lawsofiden_topic3">Laws of Identity</a>, which were published in 2006. Such governance principles, combined with open-source technology advances in blockchain, cryptography, supporting software and standards, ultimately gave rise to reliable SSI infrastructure starting in 2017. Open-source development of digital identity technology, standards and principles is truly the engine of SSI&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>, a not-for-profit corporation, was established in 2016 to promote global adoption of SSI as an open standard for digital identity. Over the past five years the Foundation has operated the <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">Sovrin Ledger</a> as the best-known SSI identity network, helped advanced the most widely used SSI open-source software (Hyperledger Indy, Ursa, and Aries), published the most widely used <a href="https://sovrin.org/governance-framework/">SSI governance framework</a>, and drives SSI thought leadership in areas including data protection, financial inclusion, IoT, and government-issued ID. In its role as an originator and disseminator of open-source SSI concepts and code, the Sovrin Foundation is dedicated to supporting SSI development in cooperation with companies, organizations and governments around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>One of the most important products of this work is the “Sovrin Stack,” shown in Figure&nbsp;1.</p>Figure 1: The Sovrin Stack, developed by the Sovrin Foundation and the global SSI community, was created in early 2019 and is curated as part of the open-source Sovrin Governance Framework.<p>The Sovrin Stack was the first conceptualization of SSI infrastructure as a four-layer stack, where the lower two layers provide cryptographic trust needed for machine-to-machine communications and the upper two layers provide human trust needed for business, legal, and social interactions.</p><p>The Sovrin Stack also represents the first recognition of the critical role governance frameworks play in bridging the technological innovations of SSI with real-world policy requirements of governments, industries, businesses and individuals. In fact, as the importance of governance frameworks became more widely acknowledged, the SSI community recognized that specialized governance was needed at all four layers of the stack. During early 2020 the Sovrin Stack evolved into the Trust over IP (ToIP) stack, shown in Figure&nbsp;2.</p>Figure 2: The ToIP stack, showing how governance frameworks apply to all four layers of the stack, and also how Layer 4 can support entire digital trust ecosystems.<p>As a model for decentralized digital trust infrastructure at Internet-scale, the ToIP stack was compelling enough that in May 2020 it became the cornerstone of a new Linux Foundation project called the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP Foundation</a>. Rapid growth of ToIP Foundation membership is a testament to how core concepts of SSI architecture are strongly supported by respected governments and companies.</p><p>Emergence of entirely new organizations promoting SSI adoption is evidence of the effectiveness of the Sovrin Foundation’s open-source approach to advancing technology and thought leadership. The Foundation’s success is measured not only in by results it delivers, but in the progress of derivative and novel SSI products and services created by organizations which build on contributions of Sovrin and the global SSI community.</p> 2019: Early success ahead of unexpected crisis <p>Prior to the global public health crisis of 2020, SSI was progressing along a steadily increasing adoption curve. Start-up companies, global corporations, digital identity privacy organizations and a variety of national and regional governments (Canada, UK, US, Germany, British Columbia, Ontario, etc.) were all expanding SSI infrastructure and launching initial use cases. This advancement was based on vigorous technology development (open-source software architecture, code and standards), a robust global public identity utility (the <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">Sovrin Ledger</a>), the first comprehensive decentralized digital identity governance framework (the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/">Sovrin Governance Framework</a>), and proof of concept use cases produced by a variety of governments and companies.</p><p>Woven throughout this activity, the Sovrin Foundation acted as a convener, facilitator and beacon for the global SSI community. The Foundation’s commitment to the <a href="https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/">Principles of SSI</a>, open-source technology and identity ecosystem governance, combined with efforts to sow the ethos of SSI across a spectrum of use-cases, helped to create fertile ground for emergent applications. During this course of activities Sovrin and the SSI community unknowingly primed the world for tremendous acceleration of SSI adoption during a most unexpected year.</p> 2020: The SSI Springtime <p>As the world embarked on a new decade at the start of 2020, almost no one could have guessed what their lives and societies would look like 365 days later. Public health challenges of 2020 brought tremendous stress and grief to most corners of the world. Yet, the situation also created opportunity for unprecedented growth of technologies that could address urgent social needs. For SSI, this meant compressing what could have been a five-to-ten-year adoption process for sensitive use-cases into a period of 12&nbsp;months.</p><p>During normal times, new technology standards for critical services such as medical information credentials, travel credentials and critical worker credentials often face regulatory review and approval marathons spanning years or even decades. Fortunately, prior to 2020, the core components of SSI had already been assessed and accepted by respected companies and governments. These organizations understood that trusted digital identity must be privacy-respecting, which is a central requirement for SSI technology and governance. With solutions needed immediately for verifiable proof of medical test results, vaccination status, etc., the standards and technology developed with the support of the Sovrin Foundation and the global SSI community have been fast-tracked into&nbsp;service.</p><p>Just a few of the SSI implementations that were launched in 2020 or are pending launch in early 2021&nbsp;include:</p>  <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/publications/travel-pass/">IATA Travel Pass</a> will be the first verifiable credential capable of providing proof of COVID-19 test and vaccination status at airports around the&nbsp;world,  <a href="https://www.digitalhealth.net/2020/03/covid-19-nhs-to-trial-digital-passports-to-free-up-staff-movement/">NHS Staff Passport</a> is the first portable digital identity credential for doctors and nurses in one of the largest public healthcare networks in the&nbsp;world,  <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about/this-is-gleif">GLEIF</a> (the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation), based in Switzerland and the only global online source that provides open, standardized and high quality legal entity reference data, is <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/lei-corporate-digital-identity-verifiable-credentials-did/">committed to following the SSI model</a> for digital identity credentials for companies.  <a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Redaktion/DE/Standardartikel/SchaufensterSichereDigIdentProjekte/sdi-projekt_ssi.html">SSI4DE</a>, co-funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs, supports showcases for secure digital identities in Germany, and <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/e-personalausweis-alternative-zu-google-und-facebook-merkel-macht-digitale-identitaet-zur-chefsache/26684942.html?ticket=ST-22324660-c75hUhsrgC4moLTe3uGj-ap3">Chancellor Angela Merkel declared digital identity as a priority</a> matter during December&nbsp;2020.  <a href="https://www.memberpass.com/">MemberPass</a> brings SSI to financial services with Credit Union customer identity verification,  <a href="https://www.farmerconnect.com/">Farmer Connect</a> is realizing is vision to “Humanize consumption through technology” by enabling and empowering individual coffee farmers to more easily work with global enterprises, and reducing costs and inefficiencies for large companies to work directly with small and often remote&nbsp;farmers.  <a href="https://www.lumedic.io/perspectives/introducing-lumedic-connect">Lumedic Exchange</a> is the first network designed exclusively for patient-centric exchange of healthcare data using SSI-based verifiable credentials.  <p>While scientists and professionals in the fields of biology, genetics, immunology, medicine and public health are the superstars of 2020, SSI is also in a position to make a major contribution. Reliable digital credentials for medical test results and vaccination status, in the form of W3C Verifiable Credentials backed by privacy-respecting governance, can help societies more safely return to normal levels of social interaction and restart economies. At the same time, the SSI model will be establishing new standards and expectations for person identity data management and control by individuals.</p> 2021: Looking&nbsp;Forward <p>Unexpected urgencies that accelerated broad acceptance of the SSI digital identity model during 2020 will continue into 2021. Ongoing challenges of the global pandemic can be mitigated by expanded use cases and public acceptance of trusted digital identity. In the most forward-thinking and dynamic jurisdictions, SSI progress is anticipated in the following areas:</p>  Verifiable digital vaccination credentials to facilitate safer operations at some workplaces, medical facilities and senior care&nbsp;centers,  International travel enabled by vaccination and medical test results quickly and easily proved with the power of verifiable digital credentials,  Rollout of government-issued ID such as driver licenses in the form of digital credentials conforming to SSI standards and securely stored in privacy-respecting digital wallets on smart&nbsp;phones,  Expansion of SSI digital identity networks, along with demonstrated interoperability of digital credentials and their verification across multiple networks using smart phone apps (digital ID wallets),  Laws and regulations implemented at state, provincial and national levels which support the use of digital Verifiable Credentials for medical, financial and other&nbsp;uses.  <p>While the wellbeing of individuals and societies during this historic time rests largely on the clear thinking and actions of responsible scientists, business leaders and government leaders, SSI is also playing a significant role. The Sovrin Foundation is dedicated to supporting global adoption of SSI to help mitigate challenges of this pandemic, while advancing its mission of Identity for&nbsp;All.</p> Notes   Alex Preukschat, Drummond Reed.

<p>Release Date: January 5th 2021</p>



<p>Today, the IoT Security Foundation (IoTSF) and FIDO Alliance announced that they are collaborating to improve the status of IoT security.</p>



<p>The main aims of the collaboration are to raise awareness on the limitations of passwords for IoT devices and provide practical alternatives for product manufacturers. The goals of the collaboration will be achieved by joint messaging and providing publicly accessible materials to help industry implement password-less authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s the problem with passwords?</p>



<p>Passwords are a traditional and simple method for authenticating a user and allowing access to resources. In the past this may have been sufficient, but passwords dramatically fall short in many ways when billions of devices are expected to be connected to networks to collect and share data or provide automation – the era of IoT.</p>



<p>Although this is not a new problem, users are still finding it a challenge to manage and keep track of different accounts and app login credentials. The result is that many take shortcuts – using easy to remember (and guess) passwords, or using the same password across many accounts1. This weakens security. Now consider the growing number of home, business, medical, industrial and national infrastructure uses of IoT which bring efficiency, innovation and user benefits. IoT devices are everywhere and the trend is set to continue as <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-many-iot-devices-are-there/">this article</a> illustrates. For IoT-class products such as routers and webcams, traditionally manufacturers have opted to have factory universal default passwords2 and whilst these can be changed, a significant number remain set to the default. This makes them prime targets for botnets which weaponize devices for DDOS attacks such as the famous Mirai and its many variants.</p>



<p>This means that the sheer volume of devices is only going to exacerbate the issues experienced with passwords today. In summary, passwords are not a good solution to the requirements of IoT authentication now, or in the future.</p>



<p>How can this be addressed?</p>



<p>New standards and forthcoming regulation are helping to drive change. The ETSI 303 6453 baseline requirements for consumer IoT cyber security standard published mid 2020, has a provision for “no universal default passwords” and this standard is now being used as a basis for regulation and certification schemes internationally4.</p>



<p>Whilst “no universal passwords” is a good start for regulation5, it does not go far enough. The good news is that there are good alternatives to passwords, so they can be eliminated, and they are also better and simpler to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How are IoTSF and FIDO Alliance working together?</p>



<p>Both organisations will work together to promote the awareness and use of password-less forms of authentication and link working group activities to ensure industry can access publicly available materials when designing new products.</p>



<p>The IoT Technical Working Group of the FIDO Alliance aims to build a comprehensive authentication framework for IoT devices which provides detailed technical specifications for password-less authentication.</p>



<p>The IoT Security Foundation publishes best practice cyber security advice for product manufacturers and users of IoT systems. Its IoT Security Compliance Framework Working Group is dedicated to the creation and maintenance of the framework which guides developers through a structured process of questioning and evidence gathering. This helps companies make better products with security by design. It is in this area where both organisations intend to collaborate at the technical level to complement the advocacy of passwords alternatives.</p>



<p>John Moor, Managing Director IoTSF said, “The use of passwords for security is an outdated and outmoded security practice for the digital age. There are solutions which are stronger from a technical perspective and better from a user’s perspective. We are delighted to be working closely with the FIDO Alliance to help eliminate the use of passwords and drive better practice for our manufacturing members.”</p>



<p>Christina Hulka, executive director and COO of the FIDO Alliance said, “The FIDO Alliance mission is to reduce the world’s reliance on passwords with simpler and stronger authentication, including in IoT which unfortunately continues to rely on default or weak password authentication. We look forward to working with the IoT Security Foundation to accelerate our path toward bringing passwordless authentication to IoT.”</p>

 About the FIDO Alliance 



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="http://www.fidoalliance.org">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

				 <p>In 2020 aNewGovernance, Onecub, and Visions have participated with Capgemini in a report for the French Banque des Territoire on the state of the art for Self-Data, and personal data sharing:</p>
<p>In the context of strong digitization of activities and services, the question of control and protection of personal data is a key issue. With this in mind, in 2018 the DPMR was created to provide a framework for the collection and use of data. Also, for a trusted digital world, a new concept is beginning to emerge: self-data.</p>
<p>Self-data can be defined in a few words as «&nbsp;the production, exploitation, and sharing of personal data by individuals, under their control and for their own purposes&nbsp;» (definition given by the New Generation Internet Foundation).</p>
<p>At the crossroads of data governance and digital trust, the control of personal data by each individual is a challenge for the digital projects of European public and private players. However, the construction of such a model also depends on the ability to remove obstacles on the technical, political, legal, and economic levels. This is why the Bank of Territories is publishing a study that proposes an inventory of the ecosystem of self-data actors.</p>
<p>This document aims to provide a clear and updated vision of the actors who propose solutions to implement self-data, the brakes and levers that need to be taken into account, and initiatives that can serve as an example to embark in turn on such a project.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation plays an important role in the interoperability of Internet identity. This is to announce the OpenID Foundation individual community board members 2021 election schedule. Those elected will help determine the role the Foundation plays in facilitating the creation and adoption of open identity standards.</p>
<p>Per the Foundation’s bylaws, three individual community board members are elected. Nat Sakimura’s and John Bradley’s two-year terms are expiring this year. (George Fletcher has an additional year remaining on his two-year term.) I want to thank Nat and John for their service to the OIDF and the community at large. Nat and John are eligible to be re-elected, should they choose to run again.</p>
<p>The individual community board member election will be conducted on the following schedule:</p>
<p>• Nominations open: Friday, January 8, 2021<br>

<p>Newark, NJ, January 5, 2021 – Edge, the region’s nonprofit research and education network and technology partner, has announced a partnership with <a href="https://www.grmdocumentmanagement.com/">GRM Information Management</a> (GRM), a leader in enterprise content management (ECM) solutions. Via its <a href="https://njedge.net/solutions/edgemarket/">EdgeMarket Cooperative Pricing System</a>, Edge has awarded a procurement contract which will give EdgeMarket participants the ability to efficiently and affordably procure GRM’s solutions and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This contract award and resulting partnership is the result of a thorough RFP process, designed to meet members’ needs related to digital transformation and content management. Via its cloud-based platform, GRM provides a set of solutions and capabilities such as document management software, workflow automation, iForms (GRM’s proprietary intelligent forms technology), business process management, machine learning, and intelligent data capture, all coupled with the cutting-edge security features.</p>
<p>GRM’s comprehensive offering allows organizations to harness data and processes in order to deliver dramatic improvements in efficiency, savings and insights into data.</p>
<p>“Managing content effectively is vital to success in the digital age. The common approach to information management via legacy applications often leaves organizations with documentation in numerous locations, and struggles to find and use information efficiently,” said Christopher Markham, VP for Information Technology and Economic Advancement at Edge. “Automating access to information, updating business process and workflows, and putting people in a position to succeed is vital to successful digital transformation initiatives, and GRM’s solutions give EdgeMarket participants the tools they need.”</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to form a strategic partnership with Edge organizations and to support the group’s membership with a diverse set of software solutions. As an enterprise content management leader with deep expertise in education, public sector and healthcare, GRM is well-suited to partner with members and deliver them valuable digital transformation solutions.” said GRM VP Sales, Larry Reynolds.</p>

 Internet Shutdowns in&nbsp;2021  Rethinking advocacy strategies <p>It’s that time of the year again when expert analysts take a gaze into the future and proffer an outlook for the year ahead. In international affairs perhaps there is none as eminent as The Economist magazine’s “<a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2020/11/16/ten-trends-to-watch-in-the-coming-year">The world in 2021</a>’’ — insights that leaders in politics, business, and finance draw from to shape personal, institutional, and national agendas for the incoming&nbsp;year.</p><p>In digital rights, it is perhaps also apt to take a look at the incoming year to prepare for whatever it might throw up. An important trend to anticipate in the coming year is Internet shutdowns, and their impact on freedom of expression, political participation, and societal development, particularly in the global&nbsp;south.</p>Photo: <a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/background-data-network-web-3228704/">Pixabay</a><p>Internet shutdowns have become a common tactic deployed in the past decade by authoritarian regimes to restrict human rights and citizen mobilization, particularly around political events such as elections and mass protests. The digital rights organization AccessNow documented at least <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/#problem">213 shutdowns</a> in the year 2019 across 33 countries. In 2020 some of the countries that shut down the Internet include <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/ethiopia-enters-3rd-week-of-internet-shutdown-after-unrest/2020/07/14/4699c400-c5d6-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/31/end-internet-shutdowns-manage-covid-19">Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar</a>. For the year 2021, we get the sense it is simply a question of when, rather than if there will be Internet shutdowns. However, there is no escaping the fact that this blunt tool of human rights repression is largely a feature of countries in the global south. In Africa, <a href="https://cipesa.org/2019/03/despots-and-disruptions-five-dimensions-of-internet-shutdowns-in-africa/">research</a> by the digital rights organization CIPESA revealed a correlation between government styles and the incidence of Internet shutdowns. Internet shutdowns occur less frequently in real, functioning democracies, and more in <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1576745/african-dictatorships-shut-down-the-internet-the-most/">authoritarian regimes</a>, the research&nbsp;noted.</p><p>The persistence of Internet shutdowns in authoritarian regimes despite perennial advocacy efforts by civil society organizations perhaps suggests the need for a shift in advocacy strategies to combat it. The first evolution of advocacy strategies to combat Internet shutdowns focused on the human rights angle — appealing to the governments and corporate actors who implemented shutdowns to see that shutdowns amounted to trampling on human rights of freedom of opinion, expression, and association. No other document encapsulates this approach as <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/un-passes-resolution-condemning-internet-shutdowns/">the resolution</a> by the UN Human Rights Council stating that human rights enjoyed offline also apply&nbsp;online.</p><p>This approach did not always work, necessitating the second evolution of advocacy strategies targeting shutdowns. Rather than focusing only on the human rights angle, these strategies also highlighted the economic losses shutdowns foist on economies. Examples of this approach include research by the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/intenet-shutdowns-v-3.pdf">Brookings Institution</a>, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/kr/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/the-economic-impact-of-disruptions-to-internet-connectivity-report-for-facebook.html">Deloitte</a>, and <a href="https://cipesa.org/?wpfb_dl=252">CIPESA</a> detailing in figures the losses accruing to the economies of nations that implement shutdowns. Given that some of the countries which implement shutdowns are also among the poorest in the world, this advocacy approach held some promise. This promise was however disappointed, as it emerged that the regimes which implemented shutdowns were more swayed by the survival of their regimes than economic considerations. Occasionally there was the counter-argument proffered by some of these states that although Internet shutdowns resulted in economic losses, they were nevertheless implemented to prevent even bigger losses and the collapse of&nbsp;states.</p><p>All these bring us to a third way. If these two illustrious approaches to Internet shutdown advocacy have not been effective, there has to be a better way. In the observation that Internet shutdowns persist in authoritarian regimes and are rare in functioning democracies perhaps lies a path to effective advocacy strategies. As has been touted in recent years in development circles, what if the future of digital rights advocacy lies in its participation in broader advocacy efforts that target broader societal reforms in the electoral process, government accountability and transparency, and development? This can be achieved, for instance, by digital rights advocacy <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/news/internet-shutdowns-africa-it-being-cut-world">organizations collaborating</a> with the broader human rights community.</p><p>Internet shutdowns and other digital rights abuses do not spring out of a vacuum. Instead, they proceed from broader dysfunctional societal systems needing reform. If, in general, societies heal and reform in the broad areas of electoral processes, accountability and transparency, and development, in time this progress will seep into better digital rights standards. This approach takes time but is sustainable. The new year 2021 is another opportunity to intensify our efforts in adopting new methods in advocating against Internet shutdowns.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/internet-shutdowns-in-2021-c2a4e8dd4845">Internet shutdowns in 2021</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Rinku Lamba, Rajarshi Dasgupta, Mohinder Singh, Valerian Rodrigues &amp; Shefali&nbsp;Jha  Session <p>Indian politics had witnessed the entry of new social movements in the 1970s, adding a whole set of new issues, actors, and ways of activism to the older nationalist tradition. We suggest a similar change is now taking place, as different ways of governance and interventions aided by latest technologies are emerging in the social media. Websites, blogs, tweets, emails and online petitions are creating a new virtual space for politics, through information, propaganda, debates, appeals and mobilizations.</p><p>The proposed session will discuss this emerging field of power, critically considering its democratic potential and interrogating the political issues and ideas at stake in it. The aim is to tackle the new forms of civic and public-political engagements witnessed in the domain of social media, and analyze their implications for the theory and practice of democracy. In the process our papers would explore conceptual notions such as agency, political act and participation as well as notions of selfhood and subjectivity.</p> Plan <p>We will present four papers, with a question-answer and discussion session at the end. The papers will be addressing broadly three kinds of concerns.</p>  The first concern is to identify novel understandings of the political and political acts in the social media. We ask the following questions in this regard: What are the political issues and ideas at stake and how do they affect conventional understandings of democracy? Who are the new actors outside the fray of party-centered politics and how do they see what is political in the acts of internet-users? How are political institutions including parties reacting to the phenomena?  The second concern relates to probing the new forms of political subjectivity that are emerging in this process. The questions here include: What kind of political actor is getting shaped by the forms of political participation engendered by the social media? How does the virtual nature of practice impact on questions of location and identity as determinants of political membership and political action? Is this nature of virtual participation too fluid for the state to&nbsp;control?  The third concern relates to the forms of exclusion and inclusion that virtual participation entails. This involves questions like: What kind of social capital is necessary for talking part in the process and does it cut across cultural and economic divisions? What kinds of interest drive the social media? How does it shape the meaning of political concepts like representation and rights, accountability and political agency?  <p>It is likely that we will raise more questions than we can answer at this point. However, we think it is important to raise them all the more in keeping with the questions that make up the focus of the conference, especially, the first question of how do we conceptualize, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India.</p> Readings <p>None.</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day2.PoliticsOnSocialMedia">IRC 2016: Day 2 #Politics On Social Media : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Rinku Lamba is Assistant Professor at the Centre for Political Studies in<br>Jawaharlal Nehru University.

<p>Latest Recognition Further Demonstrates Company Protects Customers’ Identity and Personal Data by Complying with NIST 800-63 Standard</p>
<p>HERNDON, VA, January 6, 2021 – <a href="https://www.exostar.com/">Exostar</a>, the leader in trusted, secure business collaboration in <a href="https://www.exostar.com/industry/aerospace-defense/">aerospace and defense</a> (A&amp;D), <a href="https://www.exostar.com/industries/1-life-sciences/">life sciences</a>, and <a href="https://www.exostar.com/solution/electronic-prescribing-of-controlled-substances-epcs/">healthcare</a>, today announced it has been named a full service credential service provider by the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>.&nbsp; Kantara granted the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/">Identity Assurance Trust Framework certification</a> at Level of Assurance 3 (LOA 3), allowing Exostar to seamlessly continue to align with mandates issued by the Drug Enforcement Agency for the electronic prescribing of controlled substances (EPCS) by healthcare providers using Health IT systems.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to award Exostar the Kantara Full Service Trust Mark of Approval signifying conformity with the <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__kantarainitiative.org_trustoperations_classes-2Dof-2Dapproval_&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=Y-5k_vZqOdvZLAvUWnOKiF8H-wGp2ZYOUWXyn-twYHo&amp;m=7aFEaxwRdN-cHjPtQzVAjKqkQznOoDVjt0kzw3sXi3s&amp;s=5KkOB3BTk19SoVDd0inBhscVfraiJgqiJ_HIe8V20Yk&amp;e=">Kantara Classic Class of Approval</a> for digital identity requirements at LOA 3,” said Colin Wallis, executive director, Kantara Initiative.&nbsp; “This is a significant achievement and market differentiator for Exostar.&nbsp; The Kantara assessment and review process is rigorous and approval demonstrates a company’s care and respect for its customers.”</p>
<p>With this additional <a href="https://www.exostar.com/company/affiliations-certificates/">identity-based certification</a>, Exostar becomes 1 of only 3 companies to achieve Kantara’s full service designation for its <a href="https://www.exostar.com/solution/identity-credentialing-and-access-services/">identity proofing, credentialing, and authentication</a> capabilities.&nbsp; The accreditation follows an audit by a Kantara-approved third-party assessor spanning nearly 700 questions and requirements from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s 800-63 standard and beyond, across categories including security, governance, infrastructure, operations, and finance.</p>
<p>The certification remains valid for 3 years.&nbsp; With it, Exostar qualifies to work more closely with Kantara to define the future of identity and access management technology, specifically as it impacts highly-regulated industries like healthcare, life sciences, A&amp;D, and banking, financial services, and insurance.</p>
<p>This newest recognition comes as Exostar continues to extend its market leadership by leveraging its identity and access management platform and products to support critically-important secure business collaboration use cases in life sciences and healthcare.&nbsp; The firm’s <a href="https://www.exostar.com/product/secure-access-manager/">Secure Access Manager</a> anchors a community of over 15,000 life sciences organizations (including 10 of the 20 largest global pharmaceutical companies), connecting 400,000 users to more than 70 applications used in the conduct of clinical trials.&nbsp; Health IT vendors serving 75,000 physicians and other healthcare providers now rely on Exostar’s <a href="https://www.exostar.com/product/providerpass/">ProviderPass</a> as part of the EPCS process for 2 million prescriptions per month and over 80 million prescriptions since the product’s inception.</p>
<p>“The Full Service Trust Mark of Approval from Kantara offers yet another independent validation of the quality, security, and compliance of our products and solutions.&nbsp; Our prospects and customers can connect their employees, partners, and applications to our communities with even greater confidence,” said <a href="https://www.exostar.com/company/executives/">Sudeep Dharan</a>, Exostar’s Chief Technology Officer.&nbsp; “As a result, we anticipate more rapid acceleration in the growth of our communities in the months ahead.”</p>
<p>About Exostar</p>
<p>Exostar’s cloud-based platform creates exclusive communities within highly-regulated industries where organizations securely collaborate, share information, and operate compliantly.&nbsp; Within these communities, we build trust. &nbsp;More than 135,000 aerospace and defense organizations and agencies in nearly 175 countries trust Exostar to strengthen security, reduce expenditures, raise productivity, and help them achieve their missions.&nbsp; Ten of the top twenty global biopharmaceutical companies rely on Exostar to help them speed new medicines and therapies to market.&nbsp; Exostar is a Gartner Cool Vendor. &nbsp;For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.exostar.com">www.exostar.com</a>, and follow Exostar on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/exostar?trk=company_name">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/exostar">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>The invitation to comment on this specification ends January 27th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC are pleased to announce that Specification for JSON Abstract Data Notation Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment. This is the first public review for this specification.</p>



<p>JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) is an information modeling language. It has several purposes including defining data structures, validating data instances, informing user interfaces working with structured data, and facilitating protocol internationalization. JADN specifications consist of two parts: abstract type definitions that are independent of data format, and serialization rules that define how to represent type instances using specific data formats. A JADN schema is itself a structured information object that can be serialized and transferred between applications, documented in multiple formats such as text-based interface definition languages, property tables or diagrams, and translated into concrete schemas used to validate specific data formats.</p>



<p>The documents and related files are available here:</p>

 Social Movements &amp; the Limits of the&nbsp;Law <p>By <a href="https://www.zahrastardust.com/">Zahra Stardust</a>, <a href="https://www.rsatchel.com/about-roslyn">Roslyn M. Satchel</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/afsaneh-rigot">Afsaneh Rigot</a>, <a href="https://kendraalbert.com/">Kendra Albert</a> and <a href="https://www.geekylegal.com/">Micaela&nbsp;Mantegna</a></p>The Revolution card from <a href="https://www.croadcore.org/">Cristy C Road</a>’s <a href="https://croadcore.bigcartel.com/product/next-world-tarot-card-deck">Next World Tarot</a>&nbsp;deck.<p>Ten years ago, trans activist, writer and teacher<a href="http://www.deanspade.net/"> Dean Spade</a> published a piece <a href="https://legalleft.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/3.Spade_.final_.pdf">for those considering law</a>, setting out ‘what every activist should know before going to law&nbsp;school.’</p><p>In the article, Spade discusses the complicated relationship between law and social movements (including how law is used to maintain rather than undo systems) and asks what role can lawyers play in social movements, through demystifying the law to resist indoctrination and by linking legal service provision to transformative change strategies.</p><p>Inspired by this piece, 5 lawyers, ex-lawyers and legal practitioners from the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society</a> speak about their vexed relationship to the law, tensions in their practice, their strategies and tactics, and the kinds of futures they are trying to&nbsp;build.</p> <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/roslyn-satchel">Roslyn M.&nbsp;Satchel</a> <p>Media, Law, Ethics, &amp; Social Movements</p><p>Principles of justice, equity, mutual aid, and self-determination animate my&nbsp;work.</p><p>Law is content for courses I teach, as well as organizing and policy advocacy I do in communities. I teach that the law can be helpful as both a guide for protecting the vulnerable and for challenging unethical practices/laws. Simultaneously, however, I often use history to reality-test slippery slope harms created by laws that are inconsistent, cause confusion or lack predictability — particularly in relation to race, gender, sexuality, ability, national origin, language, socio-economic status, or other caste&nbsp;markers.</p><p>The relationship between law and social justice movements is one of tension and boundary challenging. The law could be an instrument to help people live in security and dignity, but instead those in power use it to entrench and fortify their power via status quo. These competing interests require juxtaposition to avoid dominant group tyranny. Those pushed to the margins must exert pressure by all necessary means. For 20 years, I’ve pushed&nbsp;back.</p><blockquote>Sometimes law is not the answer; it’s the&nbsp;problem.</blockquote><p>Sometimes law is not the answer; it’s the problem. The difficulty I often see arises when law enables/permits money and power to corrupt movements. The non-profit industrial complex has a political economy that retains power with elite gatekeepers through funding grants. These foundations broker grants to address certain social problems but rarely change social conditions or the law. As a result, Non-Government Organisations/Community-Based Organisations compete for grants (scraps) — often abandoning the mission or programming for the preferences of grantors — in order to make payroll or provide healthcare benefits for staff. Meanwhile, the government either fails to act or enacts laws that tie activists’ hands (e.g., U.S. Patriot Act). Currently, this divisive dynamic is at work in popular social movements, and we must question whether splintering is the purpose; and if so, who benefits?</p><p>Having experienced these problems professionally as a non-profit executive (as well as hating disempowering adversarial courtroom practices), I opt for alternative uses of my legal skills that shift power by prioritizing research and interventions with practical benefits to marginalized communities. I am trying to build a future where children of the African diaspora have futures as bright as (or even brighter than) they did before colonization and enslavement.</p> <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/afsaneh-rigot">Afsaneh Rigot</a> <p>Resistance and the Power of the&nbsp;People</p><p>I never wanted to study law. It wasn’t for us. Coming from Iran, moving to the UK as a refugee and living in the UK in a struggling working-class family (in a predominately immigrant BIPOC town) l quickly realised, the law was not for us. The law was about us. It was for us to bypass and navigate and not fall into the traps&nbsp;of.</p><p>In Iran the law served as a tool for a theocratic dictatorship that surveilled, imprisoned, tortured and exiled its residents, our friends, my family. In the UK it was the structures that worked to keep people like us out — on the outskirts of borders or in the margins of&nbsp;society.</p><p>The law meant barriers to jobs, financial support and opportunities to exist. It meant the police, immigration control, access issues. The law meant: you’re not safe; this isn’t for&nbsp;you.</p><p>That changed as I grew. I didn’t know about Movement Lawyering per se — but came to admire those who I now know employed it: legal aid lawyers that helped us get status when all other hope was lost; the fearless lawyers in Iran who used their in-depth knowledge against the legal system itself; those I’d read about in books who used the law as a tool to contain its own power, to cripple the structures confining groups most oppressed, marginalised and targeted. Then I was intrigued. I wanted to learn how to wield the same tool for our communities.</p><p>My favourite movement lawyering quote is from <a href="http://www.law4blacklives.org/respond">Law for Black Lives</a>: “It means building the power of the people, not the power of the&nbsp;law.”</p><p>I didn’t continue with traditional legal practice (I was working towards becoming an immigration and human rights barrister). These days, I use my access and knowledge to support communities in my region. I follow their leadership on how to build strategic movements and support their safety. I use the language of law to leverage power and hold companies accountable for harm. Most of the time the law itself isn’t useful, but my knowledge of how to navigate it&nbsp;is.</p><p>The law might not be for us, but we can do our best to stop it from being used against&nbsp;us.</p> <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/kalbert">Kendra Albert</a> <p>The Limits of&nbsp;Law</p><p>I’ve always had a weird relationship to my role as a lawyer. I didn’t go to law school because I believed in the majesty or dignity of the law, but because I wanted software engineers to listen to me. Law felt like a way to accomplish that. And somehow, at the end of law school, people expected me to be a lawyer. Turns out a law degree isn’t just humanities finishing school, it’s a professional degree. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</p><p>Fortunately, while I was in law school, my peers radicalized me. Specifically, Derecka Purnell, Kidist Keaton, and the other Black women who led the student protest movement at Harvard Law School called <a href="https://reclaimharvardlaw.wordpress.com/">#Reclaim</a>, radicalized me. I saw how lackluster the institutional response to racism was. I also saw how easy it was for White folks who the institution worked for (even self-professed liberal ones) to underestimate their own power to make change. At the same time, I was processing my own identity as a transgender person who wasn’t out (or even totally sure of their gender), and I could see all the ways in which law failed trans&nbsp;folks.</p><p>As I’ve gotten further into my legal career, I am more and more aware of the limits of law. As an attorney, I’ve embraced my role as a demystifer of legal systems (to use Dean Spade’s words). I’ve also been taught by friends and comrades, like Danielle Blunt of <a href="https://hackinghustling.org/">Hacking // Hustling</a>, how to use the power that comes with institutional affiliations for rebellion.</p><p>As a teacher, I hope to help my students understand the limits of law as a tool. I support my students by building spaces for them in hierarchical institutions with unwritten rules, while challenging them via the material I teach to think bigger about systemic oppression, violence, and our duty as people to make change. Through my teaching, I aim to pass along, at least in part, the gift I was given by #Reclaim.</p><p>Ultimately, my legal work pales in comparison to the hard work of building movements and supporting communities. So now I play a small part in making the law less of a barrier to those who are making what John Lewis called “good trouble”, and I hope to train the next generation to push further and imagine&nbsp;more.</p> <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/micaela-mantegna">Micaela Mantegna</a> <p>Law in 8-bits: Finding Joy and Creativity in the Legal Profession</p><p>My relationship with the law is ambivalent to say the least: I went to law school because I wanted to make a positive impact in the world, and becoming a judge seemed the proper way to do so. Spoiler alert! It was&nbsp;not.</p><p>Years as a Court clerk taught me a fair bit about how bureaucracy shapes organizations, preventing them from effective action and meaningful change. I come to the unsettling place of a non-conforming legal practitioner buried in one of the most archaic, formal and change-averse institutions: the judiciary. If you don’t fit, you must not acquit, but make&nbsp;room.</p><p>Law is a loose corpora of building blocks that interact to create solutions, a duality of limits and spaces for freedom. In that sense law is as much a tool as is code, and both could be equally inaccessible and esoteric for the uninitiated. Wide and open knowledge is crucial as a catalyst for change, that can be achieved by involving the communities affected by law’s frameworks before they are set in&nbsp;place.</p><p>Being lectures, podcasts or streamings, in divulgation and advocacy I found my call. And through pop culture and video games, the language to translate law and policy into something relatable and&nbsp;fun.</p><p>When presenting myself, I used to be in a “too many hats” conundrum: Should I speak as a policy researcher or from my place as a diversity activist through <a href="http://www.womeningamesar.com/">Women in Games Argentina</a>? Videogames or artificial intelligence? Media or attorney?</p><p>Before, all these facets seemed antagonistic to being a legal professional. Now I settle on defining myself as the mind of a scholar, the heart of an activist and the skillset of a lawyer, trying to use all of them for&nbsp;good.</p><p>Through an unconventional journey I came to peace of mind with my purpose: trying to inspire the rogues and the misfits to embrace the whimsical weirdness of being different and to find our place in Law and its intersections: you are welcomed and you are needed&nbsp;here.</p> <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/zahra-stardust">Zahra Stardust</a> <p>Sex, Law &amp;&nbsp;Protest</p><p>When I was admitted to practice, I was advised by colleagues to disclose my sex work experience so the Legal Profession Admission Board could consider whether I was a ‘fit and proper person’ of ‘good fame and character’. Sex work is often seen as some kind of reputational risk. But in my view, sex work is a more dignified profession than law. And sex workers have plenty to offer in legal analysis, including robust critiques of criminalisation, licensing, border patrol, policing practices and the carceral&nbsp;state.</p><p>Law makes us preoccupied with incremental change and symbolic victories. My auto-ethnographic research on pornography taught me about the perils of reformism and my background as a policy advisor taught me that an ‘evidence-base’ will only get you so far before it is trumped by political expediency and self-interest.</p><p>In law reform, wins for some mean losses for others. And it is consistently the most marginalised who are left off the agenda with the promise that legislators will return for them ‘later’, a date that never&nbsp;arrives.</p><p>Where I live, on the unceded Gadigal land of the Eora Nation, our government refuses to enter into a treaty with our Aboriginal and Torres Strait people, anti-protest legislation is on the rise and there is political backlash against trans youth. Yet the law maintains a delusion of progress.</p><p>My work has involved various strategies and interventions, from demystifying the law to legal accountability to strategic litigation. I’ve been a Legal Observer during protests for Black Lives Matter and Mardi Gras to document and record police brutality. I began the <a href="https://www.zahrastardust.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quick-Guide-to-Strip-Searches-171220.pdf">Illustrated Law Project</a>, collaborating with tattoo artists to create accessible guides to police powers, protests and strip searching. I am working with <a href="https://www.scarletalliance.org.au/">Scarlet Alliance</a>, Australian Sex Workers Association and the <a href="https://www.iclc.org.au/our-services/sex-worker-legal-service/">Inner City Legal Centre</a>, to prepare a class action of sex workers against payment processors for financial discrimination.</p><p>As lawyers, we should be thinking about how we can use our skills to further social movements. Law speaks to itself in inaccessible jargon and maintains a profoundly unjust system of race, class, gender, sexuality and ability. The real legal experts are not lawyers or academics, but the communities who witness the brunt of its operation. I want to help build a future where marginalised communities drive social, cultural and economic change and eventually dismantle institutions of law as we know&nbsp;them.</p><p>For more on movement lawyering, see <a href="https://www.law4blacklives.org/">Law for Black Lives</a>, the <a href="https://movementlawlab.org/mission">Movement Law Lab</a>, the <a href="https://advancementproject.org/movementlawyercon/">Movement Lawyering Conference</a>, or watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOxihoQVfUg&amp;feature=youtu.be">Spotlight on LGBTQ Advocacy in Lebanon</a> as part of a series on Movement Lawyering and Social&nbsp;Change.</p>The Seven of Wands from <a href="https://www.croadcore.org/">Cristy C Road</a>’s <a href="https://croadcore.bigcartel.com/product/next-world-tarot-card-deck">Next World Tarot</a>&nbsp;deck. <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/movement-lawyering-for-alternative-futures-404ba2010bf2">Movement Lawyering for Alternative Futures</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Fatema Pirone, Senior Director, Enterprise Innovation for CIBC
<p>I have the privilege of leading the Enterprise Innovation team at CIBC, shaping and transforming our bank’s stance on how we approach emerging trends and technologies. Our team is built of data scientists, designers, UX researchers, strategists and collectively we have created comprehensive projects, frameworks and a culture of innovation across our lines of business at CIBC. My role is to ensure we do not overinvest or underinvest in emerging technology and have built our innovation frameworks to tackle the banks most compelling opportunities and problems. I also have the privilege to elevate the people on my team to recognize their strong skills, provide opportunities for them to continue to grow and develop those skills, all while being able to set the vision and develop strong partnerships and sponsors from leaders in our organization.</p>
<p>I am constantly motivated by the various mindsets of the people around me, the depth of experience that everyone is able to bring to the table, and the great work that is the outcome of all of that combined! What gets me out of bed every morning is a strong cup of coffee, but also the curiosity of seeing what that day brings. The only standard on this team is that you can guarantee no two days will be the same. And that is what I love most about it.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I follow a couple of key principles:</p>
 
 Be open to new experiences. This career path was never in my plans but I happened upon it and took various roles and training to figure out what I was passionate about and where I wanted to apply myself. 
 Align yourself with great people, leaders that are willing to share their experiences and give you advice, and colleagues and employees you will take along on the journey. 
 Lastly, never turn away from a complex project – I have grown the most doing the work others found unattractive. There are always lessons to learn which I embrace. I think this is at least part of the reason why I received WXN Canada’s Top 100 Most Powerful Women’s award this year. 
 
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>It’s got to be the value and importance of advocating for yourself. I’ve been fortunate to have leaders who have supported and mentored me as I have developed throughout my own career, and I think that because of this I have seen the outcomes that are possible when you trust yourself. It can be easy to get caught up in imposter syndrome, but if I have learned anything, it is that if you can learn to believe that you have earned where you are today, that will transpire into better tangible outcomes.</p>
<blockquote><p>The most important lesson I have learnt is the value and importance of advocating for yourself.</p></blockquote>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>Digital Identity is the single most important emerging tech that will allow us to provide end to end digital servicing for our clients in the most secure and transparent (to the client) way. We need to start ensuring we embed Digital ID into every flow where client’s data is moving – internally or externally. We need to stop creating siloed solutions and rather take an holistic approach. We need to continue to make the client the center of our solutions and services.</p>
 Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity matters to me because it is the only way we create a future that is unique, that is better for all and is simply not like our history. Diversity is truly representations of all, that includes ethnicity, sexual orientations, belief systems, experience, skills, education and so on. When you have representation of all with a diverse group of people, the best outcomes are possible ~ that is where the magic lies.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
“From the Ashes” by Jesse Thistle
<p>I am an avid reader so its really hard to just recommend one – so I’ll go with one recently read called “From the Ashes”&nbsp; a memoir by Jesse Thistle. I think this book is a heart wrenching memoir and testament to inter-generational trauma that Indigenous people of Canada have experienced and are still battling. It is not the duty of the marginalized to drive the change that our society needs, rather the job of the privileged. So it is all of our duty to gain better understanding of what has happened, what the different experiences of the Indigenous communities and people are and advocate to do better. This book is a good start.</p>
 
 
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>“There is no need to grow up so fast!” I jumped in the deep-end of adulthood really quickly, I was working full-time by the time I was 17 and got married when I was 19.&nbsp; Although I do not regret any decision I made,&nbsp; I would tell my younger self to be kinder to myself and enjoy that short time one has a teenager.</p>

			<p>The technological changes affecting the academic science community are happening at a rapid pace, causing the roles of advanced cyberinfrastructure and big data to evolve on a global scale. As the Senior Director of Advanced CyberInfrastructure, Office of the Vice President for Information Technology, and Senior Research Scholar, Department of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>, Dr. Jack Brassil is witnessing this extraordinary shift in scientific research. “The cyberinfrastructure and collaboration that researchers need to conduct their work is an important driver of this change. The role of commercial cloud technologies is growing. Work that is conducted at a relatively modest scale in laboratories or in campus research facilities is shifting to include larger collaborations between many universities with increased reliance on shared infrastructure and access to massive datasets.” The transition from an older model of scientific research to a new model is occurring across the academic community, including Princeton, with many opportunities arising to leverage the Cloud to advance innovation and discovery.</p>
<p>Expanding the Reach of IT</p>
<p>Princeton is home to world-class facilities that are available to researchers across many departments and disciplines. Throughout his career, Brassil has worked at many top-notch institutions and says his role at Princeton is both an honor and a privilege. “Princeton has a commitment to excellence and advancing teaching and research. My position is unique to this institution in that the role bridges both Advanced CyberInfrastructure and the Department of Computer Science. I’m able to expand the reach of the IT organization deeper into the departments and elevate the boundaries of the service that is normally provided. Through this hybrid role, I’m embedded within various departments as they explore new programs, research infrastructures, and instruments.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brassil says closing the gap between an IT organization and academic units is vitally important to an institution. His dual-role at Princeton allows him to see university operations from both vantage points and helps him gain a better understanding of university-wide thinking, including how that aligns with the institution’s goals and objectives. Brassil spent 25 years in industrial research, primarily working with universities and start-ups, and came to Princeton three years ago from the National Science Foundation (NSF).“This experience was instrumental in preparing me for the kind of innovative work I’m doing at Princeton,” shares Brassil. “I was able to learn more about the overall national and international research enterprise and the inner workings, including policy development and fundraising associated with science research. This experience gave me a greater understanding of not just a single university, but the vast differences between universities. Now at Princeton, I’m helping the University meet the growing needs for complicated infrastructure and instruments that academics are increasingly calling for to complete their research.”</p>

Edge taking a leadership role is terrific, council members will help inform each other of what’s going on at the different institutions in New Jersey. By doing so, we’ll gain a collective understanding of group economic development and important technologies and how we can help support each other in our teaching and research missions — driving success for all.”

			<p>The Future of Cloud Technology</p>
<p>With extensive knowledge of cloud technology and the future of cloud-based research facilities, Brassil was approached by NSF to conduct a workshop at Princeton. The NSF-1934704, Workshop on Next Generation Cloud Research Infrastructure, brought together members of the academic community and industry from around the country to investigate the future of cloud computing research infrastructure. Academic members of the workshop use clouds to conduct their research, publish papers, and study datasets. The group also included service providers and cloud platform developers.</p>
<p>“Cloud research platforms have multiple uses, but the underlying intent is to allow researchers to think about how we build clouds and guide the development of future commercial clouds,” explains Brassil. “Existing commercial clouds, like Microsoft® Azure or Amazon Web Services (AWS), are designed to provide services to enterprises who want to expand their offsite computing needs. They do a great job at this, but they are not perfect vehicles for academic research. Institutions need sandboxes to determine what future commercial cloud technology should look like and try to pinpoint the specific services that are required of an academic cloud.”</p>
<p>An additional project Brassil is involved in is NSF-1923692, CloudJoin: Migrating CISE Computing Research Infrastructure to the Cloud, which investigates the integration of novel architectures into campus research computing and commercial cloud platforms. Like the workshop, this project focuses on how to build cloud computing infrastructure that is tailored to academic scientific research. “Academic research institutions host a central IT research computing organization to provide researchers with the campus tools, storage, and computing requirements they need to do their job,” says Brassil. “Those services struggle to meet&nbsp; the demands of today, especially with the need for massive computing jobs and datasets.”</p>
<p>“Academics are at a place of transition,” Brassil continues, “Moving from using extensive, local equipment on campus to shared instruments, shared computing, and commercial cloud resources.” CloudJoin is exploring hybrid clouds, which integrates on campus computing resources with commercial cloud resources. “A hybrid model provides researchers with the comfort of working with familiar, local tools, combined with the scale, reach, and collaboration opportunities of a commercial cloud.”</p>
<p>Supporting Education and Innovation</p>
<p>Princeton, in conjunction with Edge and Rutgers University, created New Jersey’s first Internet2 GigaPOP access point earlier this year. Internet2 is the nation’s premier backbone for conducting research that supports education and innovation. The Internet2 GigaPOP is the first in-state connection to the national and global research infrastructure. “Edge created a community that facilitated collaboration and helped New Jersey create a top-tier statewide network,” shares Brassil. “GigaPOP is a tremendous opportunity to consolidate resources in the state, which in the long run, will lead to better economic development and help facilitate more collaboration between universities and community colleges and the State.”</p>
<p>With the creation of this access point, Princeton, a long-time Edge member, is now connected to an advanced technology community. “This opportunity ties back to Princeton’s desire to be fully connected and engaged in local communities,” says Brassil. “As seen in other regional networks in the country, I think the potential impact on both workforce and economic development is fantastic and will help further drive innovation and discovery. This collaborative environment also creates a center of knowledge for institutions to call upon for support as they develop new cyberinfrastructure.”</p>
<p>Princeton, Rutgers, and Edge are also key participants in a NSF-funded network research infrastructure called FABRIC. The four-year project is intended to support exploratory research in computer networking, distributed computing systems, and next-generation applications. FABRIC involves network elements that are equipped with large amounts of compute and storage that are interconnected by high speed, dedicated optical links. Connecting several testbeds and high-performance computing facilities, FABRIC provides access to cutting-edge network technologies and aims to advance cybersecurity, integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence, and help train the next generation of computer science researchers.</p>
<p>EdgeDiscovery Advisory Council</p>
<p>Edge is dedicated to forging pathways for innovation and engagement among researchers and other stakeholders in the scientific discovery domain. Through EdgeDiscovery, members can pursue their research goals by accessing the advanced computing, support, training, and community engagement they need for success. The EdgeDiscovery Advisory Council was created to bring together fellow forward-thinkers and visionaries and provide a forum for supportive and informative collaboration. “Edge taking a leadership role is terrific. My hat is off to Dr. Forough Ghahramani for having the vision and insight to bring together people from different institutions to lead collaborations between universities and the State,” says Brassil. “Council members will help inform each other of what’s going on at the different institutions in New Jersey. By doing so, we’ll gain a collective understanding of group economic development and important technologies and how we can help support each other in our teaching and research missions — driving success for all.”</p>

			<p>Graduating with an Engineering degree from New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) in 2004, Christian Hartman’s plan was to dive into the world of project creation and design. While immensely enjoying the collaboration with peers and working with his fellow engineers, the self-described extrovert began to find less enjoyment with the laboratory work, testing, and diagnostics associated with some of his earlier roles. Conversely, he found quite a bit of joy in presenting and face-to-face human interaction. “I found I’d rather be the person giving the presentation and sharing the design concepts to our clients,” Hartman says. Fortunately, following a few of his internships, Hartman found opportunities to combine his technical and interpersonal skills with several companies in the private sector. He enjoyed building up franchises and teaching the businesses about technology. “My positions were all about working with people and showing the teams how technology could change and improve their businesses,” he adds.</p>
<p>These experiences brought forth connections at <a href="http://www.allianceforaction.com/">New Jersey Alliance for Action</a> (Alliance for Action). Hartman began conversing with one of Alliance for Action’s officers, who shared the organization’s mission to transform New Jersey’s infrastructure. “Alliance for Action’s positive impact on the state and its residents interested me immediately. Their mission fit in with what I wanted to do and how I wanted to move my career forward. I felt like I would be able to give back because I love this state,” he shares. Hartman began working at Alliance for Action in 2014, initially as the Assistant Vice President. In 2018, he was named Vice President and was placed on the Executive Team.</p>
<p>Hartman’s technical expertise and ability to connect with Alliance for Action’s clients was also one of the reasons for his recent invitation onto <a href="https://njedge.net/board-of-trustees/">Edge’s Board of Trustees</a>. “When Edge asked me to be a part of their Board, the invitation was an honor and seemed like a natural fit,” he said. “Our organizations often work together with research and development and many Edge members are also members of the Alliance.”</p>
<p>Providing Leadership Through Advocacy and Education</p>
<p>As Vice President, Hartman oversees several key strategic areas at Alliance for Action, devoting significant time to the areas of advocacy, education, infrastructure, capital construction, economic development, and working to unite three industries: business, government, and labor. “We bring together the big three—entities that may not traditionally see eye to eye,” he explains. “Our job is to carve out the projects and the initiatives that we believe are important economic drivers for those three sectors.” While working diligently to align the big three, Hartman also aims to grow Alliance for Action’s membership and develop fresh networking opportunities for current members. “All of our members, whether they are from business, government, or labor, are constantly seeking to expand their respective networks, so part of my job is to connect members to individuals who could potentially become a new contact which, in turn, enables both parties to grow both their bases.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>With many important strategic tasks on his plate, Hartman also finds time to be the resident technical geek on staff, guiding Alliance for Action into the 21st Century through digital and virtual interactions, communications, and interactive conferences. “We have to change the way we communicate whether the mechanism is through social media, more traditional online interactions, or via digital communication,” he explains. “I don’t think the technology evolution will ever truly end, but fortunately, I relish the concept of constant innovation.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The New Jersey Connection That Works”</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, Alliance for Action’s overall mission has been to improve New Jersey’s economy through the promotion of capital construction and infrastructure investments, calling themselves “The New Jersey Connection That Works.” With thousands of New Jersey’s top corporate, labor, professional, academic, and governmental representatives as members of the non-partisan organization, the group has been an important advocate regarding the completion of countless initiatives and projects within the state. While not always visible to the general populous, Alliance for Action plays a vital role in bettering the state’s communities, including spearheading the creation of a better transportation infrastructure, the development of 5G, all the way down to making sure there is sand on the beaches and clean drinking water flowing through the pipes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hartman says their goal is to identify areas of need in New Jersey and then direct resources to devise a solution. “No one thinks about when the light switch is flipped on or the heat is turned on in the winter, people simply expect both utilities to work seamlessly. Families aren’t necessarily concerned about where their energy is coming from; they just want their family to be safe and comfortable,” Hartman says. “Our job is to make sure everything is working behind the scenes, so the lights can come on, there is clean drinking water, working utilities, and functional transportation.”</p>

			<p>5G Becoming a Game Changer</p>
<p>Over the past few years, the term 5G has become better known and the possibilities the technology provides have become known game changers. Alliance for Action has partnered with Edge’s network to strengthen the state’s infrastructure and provide instantaneous access. Hartman believes Edge’s connections to research institutions, healthcare organizations, higher education, and non-profits, as well as their broadband backbone, provide untapped potential for 5G in New Jersey.</p>
<p>With COVID-19 accelerating trends like remote learning, research collaboration online, and working from home, many member institutions are reaching out to Edge and Alliance for Action for connection, so these necessities can be sustained and improved. “I believe our members will learn how to leverage Edge as a resource as time moves on, because they’re learning how important things like broadband and connectivity are in the real world right now, especially because of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Hartman explains. “You either are going to have to change or you are going to be left behind.”</p>
<p>Continued Partnership with Edge</p>
<p>Since youth, Hartman has been a communicator and enjoys the times he can interact with like-minded individuals. He especially appreciates Edge events and his ability to network and grow in technological education. “At the several Edge events I attended, the material was focused on cybersecurity, which is something I believe, especially in the construction industry, we need to start looking at more,” he says. This sector has incorporated wireless tools, CAD programs, and the ability to create blueprints and schematics in real time at the job sites. If these components aren’t protected, hacking can occur, and material lost.</p>
<p>Hartman also appreciates the ability to network at Edge events, which is something he immensely enjoys and is a necessity in his position at Alliance for Action. “There is enjoyment in meeting new people, because you never know when the next person could open the door for you or open your eyes to something you didn’t know about before – basically opening up a whole world for you,” he adds. Most importantly, Hartman said the value of making new connections with a diverse group of people can have enormous impact in the future. He then takes these networking opportunities and connects his members to resources. “If by going to these different events and meeting all these different people, I can break down those walls, or I can learn something about a new connection and I can help one of my members, all I’m doing is making the network that much stronger and that much better,” Hartman shares. “These connections not only help me, but will also help my members and Edge’s members. They’re getting a new contact, my member is getting a new contact, and hopefully the two of them are learning something new. Then they can move forward, and their businesses can grow from there.”</p>
<p>The connections Hartman has developed was another reason for his invitation onto Edge’s Board of Trustees. With his role at Alliance for Action, he can become a collaborative resource for both parties and increase the overall value proposition of the two organizations. As part of the Edge Board, two of the areas he will be focusing on include connectivity and security. “Protection must be provided against ransomware and viruses, and hackers have increased their efforts across the board.” Many towns, smaller institutions, and municipalities find themselves ill-prepared against the onslaught. Hartman finds comfort in the fact the Edge network provides another level of protection and additional resources to aid these groups. “I think Edge has some very interesting solutions when it comes to cybersecurity, especially the new <a href="https://njedge.net/solutions/edgesecure/cybersecurity-health-check-program/">EdgeSecure Cybersecurity Health Check</a> program,” he says.</p>
<p>Full Circle Assistance</p>
<p>Almost twenty years ago, Hartman was a student at NJIT and now he serves as a peer to the institution, which is also a valued, connected member of both Alliance for Action and Edge. He feels the preparation and real-world experience NJIT provided has played an enormous role in his own life. “I don’t know if there are many schools out there that prepares their students for the real world as well as NJIT, especially as an upperclassman and no longer just looking at the books, but you’re working in a lab and collaborating with others,” he shares. “Their ability to prepare students to transition to the workforce is unparalleled.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hartman says the transition from student to peer is strange in some ways, explaining. “When you’re a student, you look up to these folks, especially those in the administration. In my mind, they represented the true embodiment of innovation and the creation of new methods to conduct business using the latest technology,” he added. “It’s a strange thought to put yourself as a peer to Dr. Henderson or Dr. Rose—people I always looked up to. However, I finally understand the challenges these administrators face on a day-to-day basis, and I understand how groups like Alliance for Action and Edge can help their members navigate the world as universities adapt to changing students’ needs, wants, and desires—what they need in order to adapt and to survive.”</p>
<p>Now, Hartman has a seat at all these tables, using the leadership and interpersonal skills he began crafting in classrooms at University Heights, Newark, NJ. In many ways, he has come full circle, using his gifts to help members of both Alliance for Action and Edge to become game changers in the world.</p>

<p>Yuriy Ackermann, Certification Technical Manager, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>With the advancement and modifications to specifications and program requirements, certification processes and policies will need to be modified from time-to-time. With the recent changes and publication of the FIDO Authenticator Certification program as they relate to V1.4 of the Security Requirements, and the current FIDO Registry of Values specification, we are recommending currently certified servers make necessary changes.</p>



<p>It is strongly recommended that you update your FIDO2 and UAF servers in order to correctly process current and future metadata statements based on the latest updates to the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/common-specs/fido-registry-v2.1-ps-20191217.html">FIDO Registry of Predefined Values</a>.</p>



<p>The spec changes are as follows:</p>



  All previous USER_VERIFY methods have been post-fixed with _INTERNAL to identify them explicitly as INTERNAL user verification methods&nbsp;  Example: USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE → USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE_INTERNAL.<br>    New USER_VERIFY methods have been added: USER_VERIFY_PASSCODE_EXTERNAL (0x00000800) and USER_VERIFY_PATTERN_EXTERNAL (0x00001000)<br>  RS1 or ALG_SIGN_RSASSA_PKCSV15_SHA1_RAW (0x0010) IANA ALG_KEY_COSE “alg” identifier has been changed to -65535  



<p>Servers should make the following updates to support these changes:</p>



  FIDO2 servers: Update pubKeyCredParams to contain -65535 alg<br>  FIDO2 and UAF servers: Change old user verification methods values to the new post-fixed values. Example: USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE → USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE_INTERNAL<br>  FIDO2 and UAF servers: Run the conformance tools to verify support for these changes  



<p>The latest FIDO Registry of Predefined Values is now available in <a href="https://github.com/fido-alliance/conformance-test-tools-resources/blob/master/snippets/registry.js">JavaScript</a>.</p>

<p>IT departments are asked to balance the demands of keeping the lights on, security and risk mitigation, and innovating for the future, all while working within shrinking budgets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An effective cloud strategy can meet all of these challenges while providing enhanced capabilities to enable business continuity and improve IT performance. In this session, you’ll learn how you can leverage existing investment and expertise in virtualization to accelerate a transition to the cloud, build a cloud-based business continuity plan, and generate positive ROI in the process.</p>



<p>This session will feature the team at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ), who will share their journey to the cloud. TCNJ is leveraging VMware Cloud (VMC) on AWS to modernize their disaster recovery and business continuity approach. You’ll learn how TCNJ:</p>



  Identified the need to modernize their disaster recovery/business continuity approach  Leveraged VMC on AWS to make use of existing VMware investment  Retired an on-site backup datacenter, which they anticipate will save over $200k per year in operating expenses in addition to alleviating the need for future hardware refreshes

 Introduction <p><a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a protocol for building applications with user-centric, interoperable data. In <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity/">a previous post</a>, we described what IDX is and the benefits of building applications in this way. This tutorial will walk through the creation of a simple note-taking web app using decentralized technologies for authentication and data storage, allowing users to have complete ownership over their contents.</p><p>In this tutorial, we will use the following technologies:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">React</a>: a popular framework for building web applications  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-idx">IDX</a>: a JavaScript/TypeScript framework for user-centric data management  <a href="https://www.ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a>: a decentralized network for storing mutable, verifiable documents  <a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js">DIDs</a>: a W3C standard for decentralized identifiers  The finished product ✨ Environment setup <p>To get started using IDX, we'll first need to install the IDX CLI using <code>npm</code>. You'll also need to have <code>node</code> installed.</p> <code>npm install -g @ceramicstudio/idx-cli</code>  Project setup  Initial dependencies <p>We'll use Create React App with the TypeScript template to setup our project:</p> <code>npx create-react-app idx-demo-app --template typescript --use-npm
</code> <p>Then we'll add the first dependencies:</p> <code>cd idx-demo-app
npm install @ceramicnetwork/cli @ceramicnetwork/http-client @ceramicstudio/idx-tools key-did-provider-ed25519 uint8arrays</code> <p>Let's also edit the <code>package.json</code> file to add the following <code>scripts</code>:</p> <code>"bootstrap": "node ./bootstrap.js",
"ceramic": "ceramic daemon",</code> <p>Finally, as the <code>uint8arrays</code> package does not provide TypeScript definitions, let's add them to the <code>src/react-app-env.d.ts</code> file:</p> <code>/// &lt;reference types="react-scripts" /&gt;

declare module 'uint8arrays' {
  export function toString(b: Uint8Array, enc?: string): string
  export function fromString(s: string, enc?: string): Uint8Array
}</code> src/react-app-env.d.ts file Local Ceramic node <p>Let's start a local Ceramic node using the script defined, and keep it running for all the steps of this tutorial:</p> <code>npm run ceramic</code> <p>We'll also need to bootstrap the local node with the IDX documents, using the IDX CLI previously installed:</p> <code>idx bootstrap</code>  Data model <p>By using Ceramic and IDX, we can create a data model for our application that is user-centric (instead of application-siloed), &nbsp;globally available from any client on the Ceramic network, and publicly discoverable and shareable across any application(s) that a user interacts with. This is all made possible thanks to public schemas, data definitions, and the user's IDX document. Thus, by storing your application's user data in the IDX framework, it becomes truly user-centric and portable across app domains and contexts.</p>  A schema is a <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON-schema</a> document created by a developer which can be used to validate the contents of other documents simply by including the unique document identifier (DocID) of the schema.  A definition is a document created by a developer which provides metadata about the data that they want to store with the user. The DocID of the definition acts as a unique key within the user's IDX document, and is used to identify a reference (the actual contents) associated to a specified schema.  An IDX document is a document owned by a user which maintains an index of all of their data in a single place. It is a key-value store that stores mappings from definitions to references.  <p>For this notes management app, we'll use two types of documents and therefore two schemas:</p>  <code>Note</code>: this document will store the contents of a single note  <code>NotesList</code>: the entry-point document to index the list of notes with metadata  <p>We will need to create and publish these schemas to the local Ceramic node, along with a definition which allows us to interact with the notes list using IDX. This will allow our app and others to access the notes via the following path:</p> <code>User DID —&gt; IDX index —&gt; notes definition —&gt; notes list —&gt; note 1
                                                        -&gt; note 2
                                                        -&gt; ...
</code> <p>Let's create a <code>bootstrap.js</code> script that will create and publish the schemas and definition to our Ceramic node, and store the Ceramic document ID (DocID) of the definition to a JSON file that will be used by the app:</p> <code>const { writeFile } = require('fs').promises
const Ceramic = require('@ceramicnetwork/http-client').default
const { createDefinition, publishSchema } = require('@ceramicstudio/idx-tools')
const { Ed25519Provider } = require('key-did-provider-ed25519')
const fromString = require('uint8arrays/from-string')

const CERAMIC_URL = 'http://localhost:7007'

const NoteSchema = {
  $schema: 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#',

    },
    text: {
      type: 'string',
      title: 'text',
      maxLength: 4000,
    },
  },
}

const NotesListSchema = {
  $schema: 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#',

        },
      },
    },
  },
  definitions: {
    CeramicDocId: {
      type: 'string',
      pattern: '^ceramic://.+(\\\\?version=.+)?',
      maxLength: 150,
    },
  },
}

async function run() {
  // The seed must be provided as an environment variable
  const seed = fromString(process.env.SEED, 'base16')
  // Connect to the local Ceramic node
  const ceramic = new Ceramic(CERAMIC_URL)
  // Authenticate the Ceramic instance with the provider
  await ceramic.setDIDProvider(new Ed25519Provider(seed))

  // Publish the two schemas
  const [noteSchema, notesListSchema] = await Promise.all([
    publishSchema(ceramic, { content: NoteSchema }),
    publishSchema(ceramic, { content: NotesListSchema }),
  ])

  // Create the definition using the created schema ID
  const notesDefinition = await createDefinition(ceramic, {

  })

  // Write config to JSON file

    },
  }
  await writeFile('./src/config.json', JSON.stringify(config))

  console.log('Config written to src/config.json file:', config)
  process.exit(0)
}

run().catch(console.error)</code> bootstrap.js file<p>Now to run this script, we'll need to provide a 32 bytes base16-encoded string as an environment variable:</p> <code>SEED=&lt;your seed&gt; npm run bootstrap
</code> <p>If you need a simple way to create such a seed, you can use the following command:</p> <code>node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
</code> <p>Running the bootstrap script will create a <code>config.json</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder, that will be imported by our app. The schemas and definition DocIDs contained in this <code>config.json</code> file are globally unique and can be shared with other apps wanting to interact with the notes associated to the user.</p> Interacting with our data model <p>Before moving forwards with implementing our app, let's first check we can interact with our data model using the IDX CLI.</p><p>First, we'll need to create a local DID that will be used by the CLI:</p> <code>idx did:create --label=local</code> <p>The <code>local</code> alias can be used to reference the DID in the following commands, rather than having to provide the full DID string.</p><p>Now we can create a note with some text using the <code>Note</code> schema URL added to <code>src/config.json</code>. In my case this URL is <code>ceramic://kjzl6cwe1jw14atxo8ax0mrknm7xfh8pxqy24hbdrxi9nagtwoa3la5s4hf32qr</code> but it will be different when using another seed, so don't forget to change it in the example below:</p> <code>idx tile:create local '{"text":"My first note"}' --schema=ceramic://kjzl6cwe1jw14atxo8ax0mrknm7xfh8pxqy24hbdrxi9nagtwoa3la5s4hf32qr
</code> <p>Successfully running this command will display the document ID of the created note, that we can then add to the list of notes using the <code>notes</code> definition key added to <code>src/config.json</code>:</p> <code>idx index:set local kjzl6cwe1jw14almqh93rmt1mpv8h6zvyeyhh7jzlqp95kgv38c0jb5yuo8mo7w '{"notes":[{"id":"ceramic://kjzl6cwe1jw147xhyjemd6r38812gzhhexw9mj3gz2vvkimotu5xktssik2cbzp","title":"First"}]}'
</code> <p>Make sure to replace the definition key (<code>kjzl6cwe1jw14almqh93rmt1mpv8h6zvyeyhh7jzlqp95kgv38c0jb5yuo8mo7w</code> in my case) and the created note URL (<code>ceramic://kjzl6cwe1jw147xhyjemd6r38812gzhhexw9mj3gz2vvkimotu5xktssik2cbzp</code> in the code above) by the values created in your environment.</p><p>We can now check the created note and notes list can be loaded:</p> <code>idx index:get local kjzl6cwe1jw14almqh93rmt1mpv8h6zvyeyhh7jzlqp95kgv38c0jb5yuo8mo7w
idx tile:get ceramic://kjzl6cwe1jw147xhyjemd6r38812gzhhexw9mj3gz2vvkimotu5xktssik2cbzp
</code>  Application dependencies and IDX setup <p>Our app is going to use the following additional dependencies:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/idx-web">IDX</a>, to interact with the list of notes  <a href="https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui">Material UI</a> for UI components and icons  A <a href="https://www.stablelib.com/modules/_random_random_.html">random bytes generator</a>, to generate a seed   <code>npm install @ceramicstudio/idx @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @stablelib/random</code> <p>Then, let's create an <code>idx.ts</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder, implementing the logic to authenticate using a provided seed and load notes with IDX:</p> <code>import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { IDX } from '@ceramicstudio/idx'
import { Ed25519Provider } from 'key-did-provider-ed25519'

import { definitions } from './config.json'

const CERAMIC_URL = 'http://localhost:7007'

export type NoteItem = {
  id: string
  title: string
}

export type NotesList = { notes: Array&lt;NoteItem&gt; }

export type IDXInit = NotesList &amp; {
  ceramic: Ceramic
  idx: IDX
}

export async function getIDX(seed: Uint8Array): Promise&lt;IDXInit&gt; {
  // Create the Ceramic instance and inject provider
  const ceramic = new Ceramic(CERAMIC_URL)
  await ceramic.setDIDProvider(new Ed25519Provider(seed))

  // Create the IDX instance with the definitions aliases from the config

        Save
      &lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  )
}
</code> src/App.tsx file<p>We will use another component, <code>NoteScreen</code>, for displaying an existing note as the logic is a bit different from a draft, notably that we have to first load the document from Ceramic before being able to display the note contents:</p> <code>type NoteScreenProps = {
  note: IndexLoadedNote | StoredNote
  save: (doc: Doctype, text: string) =&gt; void
}

function NoteScreen({ note, save }: NoteScreenProps) {
  const classes = useStyles()
  const textRef = useRef&lt;HTMLTextAreaElement&gt;(null)

  if (note.status === 'loading failed') {
    return &lt;Typography&gt;Failed to load note!&lt;/Typography&gt;
  }

  if (note.status === 'init' || note.status === 'loading') {
    return &lt;Typography&gt;Loading note...&lt;/Typography&gt;
  }

  const doc = (note as StoredNote).doc
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;Paper elevation={5}&gt;
        &lt;TextareaAutosize
          className={classes.noteTextarea}
          defaultValue={doc.content.text}
          placeholder="Note contents..."

 BKC affiliate drafted Ethical Framework for Artificial Intelligence in&nbsp;Colombia Armando Guio Español at a Berkman Klein Center&nbsp;event.<p>Increasingly, the public and private sectors alike are working on guidance and principles for artificial intelligence (AI) development, deployment, and regulation. The Colombian government, for example, recently published a draft <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2020-12/Colombia_AI_Ethical_Framework.pdf">AI ethics framework</a>, “Ethical Framework for Artificial Intelligence in Colombia.” AI policy expert <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/armando-guio-espanol">Armando Guio Español</a>, an alumnus of Harvard Law School, an affiliate of the Berkman Klein Center (BKC), and consultant for the Development Bank of Latin America — drafted the framework for the Colombian government.</p><p>On November 24, Armando participated in an expert roundtable discussion on Colombia’s AI ethical framework and its implications for young people. The <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/bkc-policy-practice-artificial-intelligence">BKC Policy Practice on Artificial Intelligence</a> hosted the roundtable in collaboration with the Colombian government. BKC Policy Practice: AI is a public interest-oriented program, led by BKC Executive Director <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/ugasser">Urs Gasser</a>, that helps governmental, nonprofit, and private sector organizations implement AI best practices and turn AI principles into operational realities.</p><p>We spoke with Armando about Colombia’s Ethical Framework for Artificial Intelligence, the recent roundtable discussion focusing on youth, and how working at BKC informed his experience creating the framework. Responses were lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity.</p><p>You authored Colombia’s Ethical Framework for Artificial Intelligence, which creates a foundation by which Colombia’s public and private sectors can embrace AI while respecting core values such as protecting human rights and privacy. Could you briefly summarize the main&nbsp;points?</p><p>The Ethical Framework for AI describes ten principles for designing, developing, and deploying trustworthy AI systems in Colombia. Some of these principles are transparency, explainability, privacy, human control, social benefit, and the prevalence of children’s and adolescents’ rights, amongst others. Each of these ethical principles is considered from a tri-dimensional perspective: data, algorithms, and practices. When we have discussions about transparency and AI, we have different considerations when we talk about being transparent: on the use of data, on the modeling of an algorithm, or in the practices we undergo to implement this technology. Likewise, the framework also carefully considers the algorithmic chain and how principles will be applied in the design, development, or implementation of this technology. Creating the framework has been quite interesting because it has allowed us to discuss the ethical consequences of implementing this emerging technology in Colombia, pointing out that ethics are not only a matter of designing this innovation.</p><p>Additionally, the framework serves as an ethical toolkit. It provides a series of options to operationalize these principles in entities from the public and private sectors. We have proposed different methodologies such as algorithm assessment, algorithm auditing, data cleansing techniques, ethical training in coding courses, legitimacy evaluation for AI projects, and the implementation of Codes of Ethics, amongst others. We present a range of options that all entities can adopt per their convenience and own internal procedures.</p><p>Finally, the ethical framework sets a series of recommendations for the Colombian government to develop these ethical principles further. The main proposal was for the government to use this framework as a first draft to mobilize the discussion we must have as a society about using such disruptive technology.</p><p>What was the process for creating such a framework? What factored into your thinking?</p><p>The ethical framework is part of a bigger effort I have been working towards: implementing Colombia’s AI Strategy. In 2019, for example, I led the design process of Colombia’s AI strategy with Victor Muñoz, the Presidential Advisor for Digital Transformation in Colombia. This opportunity allowed Colombia to create one of the first AI Strategies in Latin-America. We defined a series of guidelines, one of them being an ethical framework. Therefore, having this framework is just one step towards properly implementing this policy that Colombia has&nbsp;adopted.</p><p>With the support of the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF), I started the task and, I must say, the challenging experience of preparing this first draft. For me, it was essential to look at the existing academic work that supported many of the principles being proposed around the world. I will highlight that the work and literature developed by BKC, especially from the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/topics/ethics-and-governance-ai">Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative</a>, was essential for this purpose. Additionally, I looked into the evidence that was developed in the last few years about the possible risks arising from the use of this technology. Case studies around the world showed the risks of using AI without proper ethical considerations. The study published by BKC about <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/publication/2018/artificial-intelligence-human-rights#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20(%E2%80%9CAI%E2%80%9D),the%20world%20before%20our%20eyes.&amp;text=Our%20project%20seeks%20to%20advance,six%20current%20uses%20of%20AI.">AI and Human Rights</a> was exceedingly relevant to this&nbsp;point.</p><p>Once I was convinced about the importance of having ethical principles, I started thinking about those principles that could become the most relevant for Colombia and our technology ecosystem. I tried to think through this from different perspectives so it could become a national framework. My experience working in different sectors allowed me to consider the interests and needs of other entities. From academia to the private sector and public entities, I wanted these principles to have a horizontal view. I have had, and still have many discussions, but this was a helpful exercise to work on a document that was convincing enough for different stakeholders. I also considered that such an effort required proper research and a quality document that allowed us to have a high-standard discussion. That was one of my main motivations.</p><p>You joined the BKC community as a fellow in 2018 and remain active as an affiliate. How did your time at BKC support your work on AI and ethics, and specifically your thinking about AI and&nbsp;youth?</p><p>Without a doubt, I would not have been able to work on this project without being part of the BKC community. When I arrived at BKC in 2018, AI was becoming a very relevant issue, but still, in countries such as Colombia, the topic was not seen as a priority. Additionally, there were many myths about this technology and its real potential. My time at BKC allowed me to understand the real features of AI, its characteristics, and how it could impact Colombia and the region. Sharing time with such an exceptional group of individuals through fellows hours, coffee breaks with colleagues from all around the world, Urs’ office and “un-office hours,” were essential for learning, questioning myself, and going beyond my initial thoughts. There were many challenging conversations, and that is only part of the Fellow experience. At the same time, I was able to discuss with many of the authors of some of the papers and research that I was reading at the time, and who were impacting my approach to these topics. That was a great privilege.</p><p>I also had the opportunity to work in the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/research/youthandmedia">Youth and Media</a> office, which was very helpful for the work I was going to develop. Not only were <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/scortesi">Sandra Cortesi</a> and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/ahasse">Alexa Hasse</a> very welcoming, but they also shared with me their research ideas, their perspectives about these topics, and the interesting and innovative things that I could do. I had never considered how important it was to design spaces to discuss with children about AI systems and how to get the most from their approach to this topic. Sandra’s advice also inspired me to explore my creativity, appreciate a multidisciplinary approach, and consider the relevance of design features in the produced documents. I also shared my desk with Youth and Media’s designers, who did an exceptional job and showed me how relevant their work was to prepare an impactful proposal. Rarely have I been as comfortable being challenged and motivated as I was during my time with the Youth and Media team. Sandra always encouraged me to think that many of these ideas were possible in Colombia, and that also motivated me to return to Colombia with this&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>BKC’s AI policy practice hosted the recent roundtable discussion about AI and its impacts on youth. What key insights did you gain from that discussion?</p><p>The first roundtable we had about the ethical framework was a very interesting discussion. From my perspective, one of the most important points is that experts from all around the world appreciated the effort of including an ethical principle specially dedicated to prioritizing the needs of children and adolescents in the way AI is being developed and implemented in Colombia. I think the Colombian framework will keep this principle and show other countries in the region and the world how important this&nbsp;is.</p><p>The discussion also showed me that the impact of AI in the future of education is tremendous. We should be aware of the potential benefits and risks and promote inclusion in AI implementation. AI can accelerate existing disparities and inequalities in this sector and in a country like Colombia, this is something we should definitely avoid.</p><p>Finally, there was also a call to consider the need for regulatory measures about AI. I find this interesting because there is no doubt the framework will impact the policy and regulatory proposals we have on this area. At the same time, prioritizing children’s rights and interests will have to be harmonized with existing regulations and international treaties that already developed this same&nbsp;concept.</p><p>What advice would you give to someone interested in policy and&nbsp;AI?</p><p>I think that someone interested in working in AI policy issues should prepare to be constantly challenged. Not only because concepts are still being developed, but the technology itself is also constantly changing. At the same time, there are high interests at stake that must be considered in every policy analysis. There will be constant pressure for something to be done, and a person working on these areas should be prepared to handle it. I will add that resilience to rapid changes is also a great skill to master if you want to work in this&nbsp;area.</p><p>Governments want to show themselves as proactive in this area. When you act as an advisor and say that there is not enough evidence to support a policy or regulatory measure, you will be questioned. Trying to convince decision makers on how important it is to wait, or to develop evidence-based policies, is not an easy task, but it is highly appreciated when this approach provides positive&nbsp;results.</p><p>Finally, I think that a multidisciplinary approach is highly desirable. Advising on AI policy requires individuals who can interact with different stakeholders and with technical experts. Presenting yourself as someone with policy expertise but who also understands the technology is helpful. I am a lawyer, and it is interesting to see after a talk or event how some people approach me and consider me a data scientist or computational engineer. I am glad that they see I have this potential and feel confident I understand what they are doing and their motivations.</p><p>Are there any resources or additional reading you would recommend to&nbsp;them?</p><p>I think that a person interested in these issues should understand the power dynamics involved in this process, the patience that is required to have an impact after a long process of deliberation, and the way policy-making process has been changing in the last decades. Therefore, I recommend them to read these three&nbsp;books:</p>  <a href="https://www.aisuperpowers.com/">AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order</a> by Kai-Fu&nbsp;Lee  <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300225679/delayed-response">Delayed Response: The Art of Waiting from the Ancient to the Instant World</a> by Jason&nbsp;Farman  <a href="https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/cost-benefit-revolution--cass-r.-sunstein?variationCode=9780262038140">The Cost-Benefit Revolution</a> by Cass R.&nbsp;Sunstein   <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/q-a-armando-guio-espa%C3%B1ol-on-ai-ethics-and-policy-9aabb756ec13">Q&amp;A: Armando Guio Español on AI Ethics and Policy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Some Reflections on the Role of Government in Trustworthy AI  Shared at the Launch Event of Colombia’s AI Ethics Framework <p>I had the honor of participating in Lanzamiento de la Ética de la Inteligencia Artifical en Colombia (“Launch of Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in Colombia”) on November 25, 2020, alongside Colombian President Iván Duque Márquez. My remarks highlight the different roles governments can (and should) play in promoting trustworthy AI. The reflections are informed by the Berkman Klein Center’s work on the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/topics/ethics-and-governance-ai">ethics and governance of AI</a> as well as ongoing learnings in the context of BKC’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/bkc-policy-practice-artificial-intelligence">Policy Practice on AI</a>, in addition to the great and vast literature on trust, technology, and&nbsp;law.</p><p>Here is the transcript of my&nbsp;talk.</p><p>Thank you very much, dear Mr. President, dear colleagues, and Colombian friends. It’s an honor to speak to you today. First, let me congratulate you on the AI ethics framework, which is an important milestone in the implementation of the national policy for digital transformation and AI. It’s been a real pleasure working with your team, Mr. President, on some of these issues that you’re talking about today. And I’ve been impressed by your leadership and your office’s expertise and wisdom. So thank you very much for all this collaboration that you’ve supported.</p><p>Please let me use the next few minutes to reflect on the role that the government can, and I would argue should, play as we work together in this multi-stakeholder fashion towards trustworthy AI. I can build upon the excellent contributions by my colleagues and previous speakers when highlighting the crucial role trust and trust-building play in this particular moment in time. If you take two steps back, I will argue that AI — as a relatively new set of technologies, at least in terms of the application areas — poses a number of trust problems or trust challenges.</p><p>I would like to highlight only two such challenges and share them with you. The first challenge is one that we are actually familiar with as a society: the moment when new technology becomes more widely available. When we introduce a new piece of technology, there is often a risky gap between what we know and what we don’t know about the technology and its interaction with society, including the unknown unknowns. And in some interesting ways, trust is a social coping mechanism to bridge this gap of uncertainty, to enable people to take a leap of faith, if you will. And indeed, as I reviewed again <a href="https://colaboracion.dnp.gov.co/CDT/Conpes/Econ%C3%B3micos/3975.pdf">Colombia’s national policy</a>, you’ve highlighted this lack of knowledge, this problem of information gap as a key barrier to the adaptation of digital technology.</p><p>Now when we look at this trust issue, one key role of the government becomes immediately clear when it comes to trust-building. Like at this event today, governments can serve the role of a convener, of an educator to inform citizens. But of course, it’s more than just sharing information about the promise of AI. Yesterday we hosted with the president’s office a roundtable, a workshop to zoom in, quite literally, we were using Zoom, on children and young people to discuss the ways how we can use the power of education through skill-building to empower the next generation, to use these technologies in meaningful ways as they navigate their lives and building their&nbsp;futures.</p><p>In addition to the role of an educator, there is a second role that has become visible already today in our conversation: governments can promote trust by setting norms. And of course, the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2020-12/Colombia_AI_Ethical_Framework.pdf">ethics framework</a> that we’re celebrating today sets the background norms upon which expectations can become stable across the many stakeholders in the ecosystem and trust can crystallize around these expectations.</p><blockquote>Building upon ethics, legal norms are needed to enable&nbsp;trust.</blockquote><p>But of course, the Colombian government also understands that ethical norms are not sufficient. Building upon ethics, legal norms are needed to enable trust. And here again, we can learn from history when we look at the role of law in promoting trust. Law can actually help to build a bridge across the knowledge gap I mentioned at the beginning. For example, by introducing transparency requirements, as previous speakers highlighted, or by introducing monitoring obligations. It is in this context, as my colleague from the World Economic Forum mentioned, why the right to explanation or the idea of explanation within AI systems is such an important trust enabler. There is another angle to law as a tool to build trust, which is perhaps less intuitive. One of the magics that law can bring to us is actually to enable trust by anticipating that sometimes trust is disappointed, and already putting into place norms and rules that should apply once trust is disappointed. And think about sanctions or liability through that lens, and suddenly you may see law is functioning in building trust in different ways and not the dominant paradigm that law is bad for innovation, suddenly a richer narrative.</p><p>Now let me move quickly to AI’s second trust problem, which is more specific to AI. I think unlike previous technologies, trust in AI doesn’t only require that the technology works. In the past, think about trains or airplanes, or whatever technical system that was innovative at some point. What was a key thing to build trust for people was that a train brings you from A to B quite safely and so does an airplane. But what we see with AI is probably a novel trust challenge. And that has to do with what AI applications do. They are involved in decision-making unlike a train. Probably closer to modern airplanes. And the question becomes whether our AI is making sound decisions that are in our interests as users. In other words, we may move from a role of functional trust, like in the age of trains and locomotives, that is mostly a cognitive matter, to a world where it’s about fiduciary trust. This form of trust actually requires trust not only cognitively, but also emotionally. And to me, this kind of trust in technology is much harder to achieve. It’s actually harder to&nbsp;earn.</p><p>And so the key question becomes again what are the roles that governments can play? I would just like to highlight two. First, I would propose that governments can serve the function of a seismograph and an amplifier. In my view, going forward, it’s important to capture the real-world feedback from how AIs are used in their specific social context — What issues emerge from these interactions? — and create a learning ecosystem within the government, and within society, to learn from these often weak signals in real-time, upgrade and revise, and adjust laws and policies dynamically. And that’s a real challenge, as we all know, for those doing work in the policy space. How can we create learning by design and build that into our governance systems?</p><p>Second, governments are themselves trust proxies. As users of AI technology, which governments often are, they can demonstrate how AI indeed can support sound, yes, better decision-making. Now, unfortunately, this is a high bar. As we know from many negative headlines these days, some of the early stories when governments started to adopt and use AI have been the opposite of a success story. So I think that means we have to choose very wisely and ensure that we can demonstrate how AI serves this fiduciary role.</p><p>Now taken together a few things become clear. Governments can and do play many different roles when it comes to AI. Governments are promoters of AI, regulators, educators, users, coordinators, researchers. And that’s good news. And I see all these roles described also in Colombia’s national strategy. It means that we have many different tools, a broad toolkit for AI governance available and the Colombian government is embracing it. But there are also challenges that may immediately affect the trust equilibrium.</p><p>First, given that AI and AI applications are so contextual, and given that so many different government agencies are involved in decision-making, it’s very hard to maintain coherence in decision-making and in communication within the government. And we know, particularly now looking at COVID, that mixed signals from government agencies have a great potential to harm trust immediately. And I think that’s a particular problem in such a complex policy area where AI transcends through restrictions and plays a role in transportation, education, health, you name it. How can we create and maintain a certain coherence in both policymaking and communication?</p><blockquote>It’s not only what decisions will be made, but also how we arrive at these value judgments […] that will be key for trust outcomes.</blockquote><p>A second complication emerges from the fact that some of the roles I mentioned may be in tension with each other. There may be even the risk of role conflict. For instance, sometimes the interests of the government as a user may be different from the interests of the government as a regulator. Now these conflicts, or at least tensions, are often not addressed in ethics frameworks or national policies. But any resolution will of course benefit from proactive dialogue. And I would argue and emphasize, it’s not only what decisions will be made, but also how we arrive at these value judgments in case of some of these roles trade-offs or tensions, that will be key for trust outcomes.</p><p>So in conclusion, and perhaps paradoxically, I think a healthy dose of skepticism towards the promises of AI might be the most productive and sensible way to work together towards trustworthy AI. I am personally and together with the BKC team, looking forward to being part of this journey of trust-building with all of you. Thank you very&nbsp;much.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/some-reflections-on-the-role-of-government-and-trustworthy-ai-7972db1aa6ab">Some Reflections on the Role of Government and Trustworthy AI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 [Pictures from Award Ceremony – September 2, 2020] 



<p>Building upon the success of the FIDO Hackathon in Korea over the last two years, we are looking at possibilities for APAC-wide (or global) Hackathon in the year 2021. We believe such a Hackathon (or challenge program) helps us engage and empower developers to accelerate service deployment with out-of-box ideas.</p>

<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/dLij9K4ObYY">Joe Shields</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/dLij9K4ObYY">Unsplash</a><p>Everyone is talking about self-sovereign identities (SSIs) and how they allow users to control their data and identity. We at Energy Web believe that this is only the first step in the journey to a decentralized application landscape.</p><p>Indeed, being able to authenticate with a certificate has been possible for a long time now but it has never been widely adopted due to technical limitations. Until recently, there’s been the need to create centralized public key infrastructure systems—with a key shortcoming being that one certificate would only give you access to one application. So while the identity might remain self-sovereign to the ID owner, it still lacks the efficiency of a more-decentralized system in which a master ID ‘passport’ could be used seamlessly across multiple&nbsp;apps.</p><p>This is because most implementations of SSI focus on the authentication portion. This is the first step and a mandatory one. But as long as there is no standardized manner to exchange profile data, this will only be a global certificate system, allowing passwordless login but not permission management. This is what we want to change with <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/">Energy Web Switchboard</a>, our <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-unveils-ew-switchboard-2f71bc82daa0">recently released</a> one-stop solution for access management.</p> Requirements <p>A permission management system—or Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)—is the basis for every Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution. It fulfills three basic functions:</p>  Authentication: Verify that the user is in possession of the credentials (in our case, the private&nbsp;key).  Authorization: List the roles that have been assigned to the user in order to do Role-Based Access Control&nbsp;(RBAC).  Accounting&nbsp;: Keep a log of the operations performed by the&nbsp;user.  <p>In order to create a decentralized version of IAM we have to enable the above functionality, while at the same time make sure our system has the following properties:</p>  Censorship Resistance: A user can use their credentials whenever they&nbsp;want.  Data Confidentiality: It must not be possible to list the users who have access to a specific&nbsp;system.  Decentralized Infrastructure: Nodes must not be able to misbehave; either they perform correctly or not at&nbsp;all.  <p>Let’s look at each one of these requirements in more&nbsp;detail.</p> Censorship resistance <p>When using a centralized system like Google or Facebook, these entities have complete control over the data that your application receives. They have little incentive to withhold information from you specifically but they could if they wanted to. And as we don’t know their motives, it is difficult to assess the probability of this occurring. Even in a system like OpenID, there is an administrator for the database and unless that administrator is you, their interests might diverge from&nbsp;yours.</p><p>Being resistant to censorship means that there is no actor in the system that has the power to selectively limit the information other actors have access to. In other words, everyone has access to the same information at the same time and there is nothing the creator of the information (or anybody else) can do about&nbsp;it.</p><p>This matters because there are a few data points that you do not want to be withheld from you when using an IAM system. You must know as soon as possible:</p>  If a permission has been revoked. You would not want to give access to someone who should not have&nbsp;it.  If a key has been invalidated. If a key has been compromised, all the permissions granted by it should be revoked or it should not be able to authenticate anymore.  If a permission has been granted. Once a permission has been granted, it must be possible to verify it every time it is presented.  <p>A blockchain fulfills these requirements by design. Since the state is kept in sync over all the participating nodes, once something has been published, it is either known to all or none of the nodes. Additionally, the cryptographic proofs contained in the transactions allow the offline verification of the&nbsp;data.</p><p>This is why all the permissions are anchored on chain. The descriptions of roles are held in an ENS smart-contract; the successful granting of a permission is noted in the DID document of the user. Each user holds their credentials and is the only one to have unrestricted access to that&nbsp;data.</p> Confidentiality <p>As an application developer, I don’t want the world to be able to make a list of my app’s users and even less, a list by roles. It is therefore crucial that when a user is granted a role, this event not be made&nbsp;public.</p><p>Centralized systems are not terrible in this use case, as they will not disclose your information to third parties but they themselves will record all the activities of your users. This is a feature of the platform. It is a tradeoff you’re willing to make in order to give convenience to your&nbsp;users.</p><p>In the EW Switchboard solution, no third party has the full list of users of an application. This is guaranteed by the permission-granting process:</p><p>What we’d like to highlight in this simplified process is the fact that it is the user who stores the claim and anchors it on chain. Also, because it is a private claim, the contents are provable but not disclosed. The user can therefore prove that they have been granted a certain privilege, but unless they elect to disclose this information, it is impossible for a third party to find&nbsp;out.</p><p>And as the users must anchor the claim on-chain themselves, there is no opportunity for an observer to make a list of the addresses added to a particular smart contract or any other indirect way to observe the activities of the IAM. The only information an observer can garner is that the user has added a claim to their DID document but not the content, origin, or nature of the&nbsp;claim.</p> Decentralized infrastructure <p>We have mentioned the Energy Web Chain and <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, which are both peer to peer networks and lack a central point of control. There is one piece of infrastructure we have not mentioned yet: the message transport between&nbsp;users.</p><p>How the user and the role admin in the above sequence diagram exchange information is through a service bus: the EW-DOS messaging component. This component is decentralized in the same manner IPFS is: there is no centralized control but there is no consensus either. Each client must pick the service node they want to connect to and if this service node does not deliver the expected service, it is the responsibility of the client to connect to a different service&nbsp;node.</p><p>As every message must be signed by the sender there is no opportunity for the service provider to alter messages in transit. Either messages are delivered as received or they are rendered invalid by the update and the recipient would notice immediately. The messaging service therefore fulfills the requirement of not being able to misbehave. It either fulfills its duty correctly or not at&nbsp;all.</p> Conclusion <p>With Switchboard, we provide application developers an alternative to centralized authentication and authorization systems like OAuth with Google and Facebook or Azure Active Directory. Obviously we still have a lot of features to add in order to compete with these established services, but EW Switchboard is the first fully decentralized IAM solution. You can use the installed version today on the EWC or deploy your own from source on any EVM&nbsp;chain.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/digging-deeper-into-self-sovereign-identity-and-access-management-e6eefbac631e">Digging Deeper into Self-sovereign Identity and Access Management</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 How Switchboard Tackles the Challenge of Enterprise Identity Management <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/fPxOowbR6ls">Matthew Henry</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/fPxOowbR6ls">Unsplash</a><p>By Ian Kelly and Nitin&nbsp;Gavhane</p><p>Nearly a decade has passed since Marc Andreeson <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">wrote</a> that software was eating the world, by which he meant that software — and ultimately the services that software and the Internet could provide — would increasingly capture value in the economy from traditional firms producing things. A list of the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/">world’s largest companies by market cap</a> suggests Andreeson was right: three of the top five — Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet — are software-centric digital enterprises.</p><p>This digitalization of the global economy has spurred a new wave of Big Data, including data associated with identities. Yet for enterprises around the world, managing identities remains a major information technology challenge.</p> Challenges in enterprise identity management <p>In traditional enterprise identity management, identity data is typically highly siloed both within and across organizations, even with respect to individual business processes. Anyone who’s had to separately on-board with two more departments at a single company—such as accounts receivable, a membership department, a software tech team, and maybe a parallel business unit located in another country—knows what we’re talking&nbsp;about.</p><p>Enterprises must aggregate, share, and synchronize identity data across databases and directory services. Despite their best efforts, this is cumbersome and inconvenient at best. Plus, managing identities with traditional enterprise IT architectures like these often leads to high administrative and maintenance costs, privacy and security risks, and high compliance costs to mitigate those&nbsp;risks.</p><p>We see four key problems with the traditional approach to enterprise identity management:</p>  Low Interoperability: Centralized systems with information silos increase friction for would-be collaborators due to proprietary processes and architectures.  Expensive Verifiability: Sharing verified attributes about users and assets (such as energy market participants and distributed energy resources like electric vehicles) is time-consuming and&nbsp;costly.  Data Protection: Policymakers globally are regulating customer data privacy and ownership via new regulations such as the EU’s GDPR and the California Privacy Act. Complying with these policies using traditional IT architectures and processes—which were not designed with customer data ownership in mind—is increasing operational costs for many companies.  Security: Even when enterprises attempt to manage data responsibly, vulnerabilities in traditional software and infrastructure systems can result in compromised data.  <p>Taking a smarter approach to identity management using traditional enterprise architectures can address these challenges in part. However, a new approach to enterprise identity management that fully embraces the concept of self-sovereignty can unlock significantly more&nbsp;value.</p> Benefits of a self-sovereign approach <p>We at Energy Web believe that an enterprise identity management architecture based on <a href="https://sovrin.org/faq/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identities</a> (SSIs) enabled by decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) presents the best solution to these challenges.</p><p>We believe that DIDs should have four essential characteristics:</p>  Decentralized: The DID-based system has no central issuing authority.  Persistent: The DID does not require the continued operation of any underlying organization.  Cryptographically verifiable: One can prove control of the&nbsp;DID.  Resolvable: One can discover metadata about the&nbsp;DID.  <p>Using DIDs and VCs to build a SSI system should address the main challenges of centralized IT approaches we described above: interoperability, verifiability, data protection, and security.</p><p>Here’s what this could look like applied to a simple example in the energy sector: managing lithium-ion batteries from cradle to grave. The system could assign a DID to each battery when manufactured and the manufacturer could issue claims regarding the battery’s model, serial number, and specifications like capacity and energy. Next, the installer of that battery could add claims related to its purchaser and location. The owner of the battery could add a claim about the transfer of ownership and, at the end of its life, the recycler of that battery could issue a final claim about its retirement. Meanwhile, during its operating lifetime, the battery could enroll via its DID in various energy markets, such as to provide grid flexibility services.</p> How EW Switchboard brings this architecture to&nbsp;life <p>We are building this system, which we call <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/">EW Switchboard</a>. It allows anyone to create a decentralized identifier based on a public-private keypair, and it provides a way for application owners to manage <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/digging-deeper-into-self-sovereign-identity-and-access-management-e6eefbac631e">authentication, authorization, and accounting</a> for their own apps. Like everything we do at Energy Web, it is not a product for sale but an open-source tool, designed for the needs of the energy sector but also sufficiently abstract to be applicable for any user or app owner — even those apps and services that do not use blockchain technology at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Switchboard is compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C v1.0 decentralized identifier and verifiable credentials standards</a> and is intended to accommodate a variety of approaches to digital identity. It uses a decentralized architecture, meaning that no one person or organization stores sign-in information or other user data or controls authentication or authorization. Each user remains in control over their own data and who has access to it. Thanks to WalletConnect, users can select from a <a href="https://walletconnect.org/wallets">large variety of existing wallets</a> to create their&nbsp;DIDs.</p><p>Let’s see how Switchboard works.</p><p>We host Switchboard at <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/">our own website</a>, meaning that anyone can access Switchboard and use it to create and manage their own DID, enroll in applications, create a DID for their devices, or perform other tasks. Developers or owners of applications can integrate Switchboard into their own apps, using it to manage user authentication, authorization, and accounting (without the user leaving the primary app) so that they need not develop these functionalities from scratch. This latter option means that users could use their DID as a single sign-in for a variety of apps, similar to how many people use their Google or Facebook accounts for single sign-in today, but remaining in control of that DID for life and independent from any one platform. It also means that application developers can focus on other functionalities in their apps and therefore deploy&nbsp;faster.</p><p>Once a user has authenticated with Switchboard, they can then use their DID to enroll in applications. This terminology is intentional: the user registers a DID once and owns it for life, and therefore that user need not re-register a new DID every time they want to use a new application. Instead, that user authenticates with their DID and then takes on specific roles in applications.</p><p>As the owner of an application, how do you ensure that users take on the correct roles? For example, what prevents an unknown user (i.e., a DID) from enrolling as the owner of a rooftop solar PV system in your app, especially if the architecture is decentralized (meaning neither you nor any other single authority dictates who has what&nbsp;role)?</p><p>To do this, Switchboard employs a system of VCs and provides an interface for you to set the roles and role governance for your application (role governance leverages <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/ethereum-name-service-ens-is-now-available-for-the-energy-web-a8d884138790">Energy Web’s Ethereum Name Service</a>). In our example above, you could use Switchboard to specify that your app includes the roles PV owner and PV installer, and that in order for a DID to enroll in your app as a PV owner that DID must have proof from a PV installer that the DID does in fact own a home with a PV system on the roof. The DID requests the installer to cryptographically sign a statement that the installer installed a PV system on that DID’s roof, and when the installer signs this statement then the DID can then present it to your app. Your app can verify that the cryptographic signature must have been added by that installer and thus allow the DID to enroll as a PV owner. Of course, you can use Switchboard to set whatever roles and requirements you wish (e.g., “a PV owner must have signed claims from the installer, the PV OEM, and from the PV owner’s distribution utility in order to enroll”).</p><p>This approach also benefits from network effects, because the verified claim is specific to the DID but not specific to the application. Continuing our example, imagine a user with a rooftop PV system wanted to enroll in someone else’s application and therefore obtained verified claims from the installer, the OEM, and the distribution utility relating to the specifications, location, and ownership of the rooftop PV system. You can, as the owner of a different application, set your app to allow any DID with those same claims to enroll as a user in your app — if the user can present the verified claims you require, it is not necessary that the user obtained those claims specifically to enroll in your app. The user does not lose the claims in the other app owner’s system, but retains them and can simply present them to your&nbsp;app.</p><p>We are releasing an <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/">alpha version</a> of Switchboard now, for initial use and feedback from our community. Our intent is then to release a beta version in Q1 of 2021, with a final production version to follow. These future versions will add functionality related to asset management and incorporate Energy Web’s concurrent work with key management solutions and distributed messaging and&nbsp;storage.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/how-switchboard-tackles-the-challenge-of-enterprise-id-management-b26f995caefa">How Switchboard Tackles the Challenge of Enterprise ID Management</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The new open-source tool offers identity and access management for users, assets, and app developers in a self-sovereign era <p>Zug, Switzerland — 17 December 2020 — Today Energy Web unveiled <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/">EW Switchboard</a>, the latest addition to its open-source technology stack, the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS). Switchboard is a first-of-its-kind identity and access management (IAM) tool for users, assets, and application developers in today’s growing self-sovereign approach to digital solutions. Although Energy Web developed Switchboard with a focus on the global energy sector and its foundational Energy Web Chain, Switchboard can be used in any sector and on any blockchain-based or non-blockchain digital solution.</p><p>To date, IAM solutions have been centralized, fragmented, and siloed. This presents challenges with respect to data privacy and security, lack of interoperability across systems, concerns about data persistence and censorship, and bloated administrative (e.g., reconciliation, KYC) and compliance (e.g., privacy, security) costs. Consumer-focused solutions such as Google or Facebook single sign-on and enterprise-focused solutions such as Google OAuth or Azure Active Directory have attempted to address some of these challenges. But a decentralized self-sovereign identity (SSI) approach offers a superior experience.</p><p>“This is a major landmark, not just for Energy Web’s ecosystem but for the future of open-source, decentralized technology,” explained Micha Roon, chief technology officer for Energy Web. “Universal self-sovereign identity is at the core of tomorrow’s digital solutions, from tracing an energy asset or megawatt-hour of renewable generation throughout its entire lifecycle to managing energy market and application access for enterprise users.”</p><p>SSI creates master identities for users and assets, avoiding constant duplication and always remaining in control of the user or asset owner (rather than third parties). An SSI comprises decentralized identifiers (DIDs) supported by verifiable claims (VCs). For example, a residential battery energy storage system manufacturer may create a DID for each battery that rolls off its production line. The manufacturer then might transfer ownership of a particular DID to a homeowner that installs a battery system at their residence, while the battery installer and the local grid operator both might attest to VCs about the battery’s capacity, location, and other&nbsp;details.</p><p>But until EW Switchboard, no organization had developed a full IAM solution that leverages SSI, DIDs, and VCs for authentication, authorization (such as for role-based access management in applications), and accounting (for logging user activity history).</p><p>“In the 20th century, an analog switchboard allowed an operator to plug and unplug various inputs and outputs, interconnecting a variety of users and endpoints. EW Switchboard is the modern, 21st century equivalent. We’ve replaced the operator with a decentralized system of autonomous self-sovereign identities, interconnecting various users, assets, and applications,” said Mani Hagh Sefat, solution architect at Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>For users, Switchboard enables them to manage their core identity and associated verifiable claims, their assets (such as solar panels, thermostats, electric vehicles, and batteries), and their enrollment in various applications and digital services (such as messaging and storage). For application developers, Switchboard enables them to define user roles and associated permissions, authorize users and assets, and log user operations.</p><p>The alpha version of EW Switchboard is <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/">available now</a>, for initial use and feedback from the community. Energy Web intends to release a beta version in Q1 2021, with a final production version to&nbsp;follow.</p>  <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/">Visit Switchboard now</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/how-switchboard-tackles-the-challenge-of-enterprise-id-management-b26f995caefa">Continue reading about enterprise ID management</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/digging-deeper-into-self-sovereign-identity-and-access-management-e6eefbac631e">Dig deeper into SSIs, DIDs, and&nbsp;VCs</a>  <p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating a low-carbon, customer-centric electricity system by unleashing the potential of decentralized, digital technologies.

<p>By Simone Hill, Senior Manager, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>Illustration by <a href="https://www.tiphughes.com/">Tiffany&nbsp;Hughes</a>.<p>In June, <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/dream-we-did-act-we-must-a-commitment-to-action-c06781f244da">Omidyar Network committed $500,000 to organizations fighting on the frontlines for racial justice</a> because we firmly believe that this work is core to our ability to create inclusive, equitable societies. While the funding is an essential step toward our vision, the way we invested was also critical to developing thoughtful partnerships with organizations already building or scaling innovations.</p><p>What does it mean to invest in justice? It begins with a clear-eyed recognition of the systemic racism that manifests within all of our systems to undermine the safety of Black and Brown people. Investing in justice means attacking the many resulting symptoms of white supremacy at their root by finding organizations working to innovate and advance holistic ways to create lasting change. It means being strategic and careful about ensuring that while we are looking for ways to address the wrongs that pervade our societies, we are not inadvertently causing more harm. With that, an awareness of our own limitations as a funder is required –– financial investments are a step at the beginning of a long-term journey towards holistic, strategic action. Finally, investing in justice means continuing to integrate racial justice with our firm-wide focus to reimagine systems: building an economy that works for all — an anti-racist economy is a <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">key pillar of our point of view</a>; realizing the promise of responsible technology; and fostering a more pluralistic society.</p><p>We searched around the country for Black-led organizations whose work combined economic, civic, or criminal justice reform with narrative shift or movement building towards racial justice. Among many organizations doing incredible work, the following five are achieving impact in ways that align with our current strategic focus.</p> Large Scale Change, Powered by Deep Networks: <a href="https://medium.com/economicsecproj/centering-blackness-the-path-to-economic-liberation-for-all-f6c2c7398281">Centering Blackness Initiative</a> <p>Spearheaded by three dynamic women of color, the Insight Center for Community Economic Development has developed the <a href="https://medium.com/economicsecproj/centering-blackness-the-path-to-economic-liberation-for-all-f6c2c7398281">Centering Blackness Initiative</a>; a lens to identify how and where economic policies, practices, and institutions harm Black&nbsp;people.</p>Graphic illustration from Insight Center’s Power Learning Community<p>A multi-pronged approach to systemic change, the Initiative is a new framework for examining and reimagining systems. It is accompanied by a set of tools, currently in development, to encourage multiracial, progressive organizations to adopt the framework. Not only will organizations be supported to develop new internal operations through this lens, but they can also adopt it for their policy advocacy campaigns.</p><p>Because narrative shift is a critical component of the Centering Blackness Initiative, the Insight Center has also launched the <a href="https://www.blackthoughtproject.com/">Black Thought Project</a> to create safe spaces in cities that center, celebrate, and protect Black thoughts and expression.</p>Black Thought Project installation <a href="http://www.blackthoughtproject.com/">www.blackthoughtproject.com</a> Systems Change in the Informal Economy: <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/">Equity &amp; Transformation</a> <p>“Black informal workers are resilient and creative, and they have constructed an informal economy to acquire a means of subsistence,” — Richard Wallace, founder, and director of <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/">Equity &amp; Transformation</a> (EAT).</p>(Right) Richard Wallace, Founder and director of&nbsp;EAT<p>Founded in 2018, EAT is the only organization in the United States, specifically focused on protecting and uplifting Black workers operating in the informal economy. Defined as a set of unregulated economic activities, the informal economy includes street vending, childcare, auto-mechanic, and moving services — activities which allow people who cannot find standard employment to make a living, but without the protection of formal labor standards.</p><p>While EAT’s work includes research and policy development to destigmatize the informal economy, the organization also educates workers about their protections. EAT spearheads and collaborates on campaigns across Chicago to improve the lives of Black workers in the informal economy. The Guaranteed Income Project, for instance, provides previously incarcerated individuals with $500 per month to help cover their bills, find homes, and ultimately, reduce recidivism.</p>EAT <a href="http://www.eatchicago.org/">www.eatchicago.org</a> Building Power through Black Leadership: <a href="https://www.jwj.org/our-work/absi">Advancing Black Strategists Initiative</a> <p>Black leadership is critical to the success of racial and economic justice movements, but while BIPOC are often the implementers of social change campaigns, they rarely drive the strategies that energize these movements. The <a href="https://www.jwj.org/our-work/absi">Advancing Black Strategists Initiative</a> (ABSI)—a joint project led by The Jobs With Justice Education Fund, in collaboration with the Black Worker Initiative at the Institute for Policy Studies and Morehouse College—is raising a cohort of Black economic-justice and labor-focused strategists to lead, develop, and advance policies and campaigns.</p><p>ABSI will provide the tools and knowledge to equip Black strategists to work from the strength of their lived experiences, to inspire participation and engagement around polices that center Black economic justice. As this new generation of Black leaders takes on bigger roles and builds and wields power across movements, they will ultimately strengthen Black institutions, advance economic democracy, and change the socio-economic conditions of the Black community.</p> Narrative Shift at the Intersection of Race and Technology: <a href="https://www.c2i2.ucla.edu/">Center for Critical Internet&nbsp;Enquiry</a> <p>While technology permeates our everyday lives, it is another system where built-in white supremacy limits both usage and accessibility by Black&nbsp;people.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.c2i2.ucla.edu/">Center for Critical Internet Enquiry</a> (a newly-founded interdisciplinary research center at UCLA) aims to use art and storytelling to reimagine technology, and in the process, champion racial justice, reframe our understanding of the role of technology in our lives, and strengthen democracy by holding those who create unjust systems and technologies accountable.</p><p>Over the next year, artist-in-residence, film-maker <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7307049">Oge Egbounu</a>, will work alongside the center’s co-directors and racial justice lead, to translate the center’s work into cultural artifacts that can resonate with a broad audience. This project creates a unique opportunity to develop cultural artifacts grounded in the center’s research that can shift narratives for mass audiences and tech workers alike, to more intentionally use and create technology in ways that do not harm&nbsp;others.</p> A Clear Path Forward: <a href="https://m4bl.org/">Movement for Black&nbsp;Lives</a> <p><a href="https://m4bl.org/">Movement for Black Lives</a> has a courageous vision: a long-term plan to shift the consciousness toward racial reckoning, and an ability to chart a clear path towards their goal. Fiscally sponsored by the Common Counsel Foundation, the Movement for Black Lives’ Black Power Rising: Vision 2024 seeks to build the social, political, institutional, and collective power of Black people by harnessing the collective power and creativity of Black people. Grounded in Black culture, the initiative aims to bring an informed electorate to the table to drive anti-racist policy&nbsp;shifts.</p><p>This strategic five-year plan will guide the coalition’s programmatic and campaign efforts to build mass support for progressive policies that center the needs of Black people. A core part of this work will equip local leaders with tools and strategies to build power within and between their organizations, scale engagement around political participation, and attack white supremacy by ensuring political representation and leadership, especially in Black communities.</p>Illustration by <a href="https://www.tiphughes.com/">Tiffany&nbsp;Hughes</a>. Restorative Justice Requires Restorative Investment <p>Why invest specifically in narrative shifting, and power-building in the intersections between movements, institutions, and Black leadership? Why look for spaces that prioritize economic justice in underfunded regions? Because we believe that this is where organizations are creating innovative, holistic solutions to specific problems that will generate the most significant returns.</p><p>In the course of identifying these organizations, we collaborated with five of our sister organizations within <a href="https://www.omidyargroup.com/">The Omidyar Group</a> —<a href="https://democracyfund.org/"> Democracy Fund</a>, <a href="https://flourishventures.com/">Flourish</a>, <a href="https://humanityunited.org/">Humanity United</a>, <a href="https://www.imaginablefutures.com/">Imaginable Futures</a>, and <a href="https://luminategroup.com/">Luminate</a> — to jointly fund two regranting organizations focused on supporting grassroots racial justice groups. Emergent Fund (a fiscally sponsored project of Amalgamated Charitable Foundation) quickly moves no strings attached resources to communities of color under attack by federal policies and priorities. Liberated Capital Fund of the Decolonizing Wealth Project (fiscally sponsored by Allied Media Projects) provides unrestricted resources through a reparations model to Black and Indigenous-led organizations to shape a future where we can all heal from generations of colonial trauma. As a result of the substantial work we’ve seen around the country, we will have exceeded our initial goal and invested a total of $1,050,000.</p><p>We believe that these investments are a significant step towards creating the world we are advancing toward in our mission as an organization. But this is only a first step. We are committed to building true partnerships with these organizations, putting our relevant resources at their disposal, and amplifying their work to a broader audience of both practitioners and funders. Investing in justice means much more than dollars; it is a whole-hearted commitment by our institution.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/an-investment-in-justice-bad462284f27">An Investment in Justice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Sexual Ethics, Tech Design &amp; Decoding&nbsp;Stigma <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/zahra-stardust">Zahra Stardust</a>, <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/about/directory/itp/140841747">Gabriella Garcia</a> and <a href="https://anthro.illinois.edu/directory/profile/egwuatu2">Chibundo Egwuatu</a> <br>With thanks to <a href="https://livia-foldes.com/">Livia Foldes</a> &amp; <a href="https://hackinghustling.org/">Danielle Blunt</a>. Images by <a href="https://decodingstigma.tech/">Decoding&nbsp;Stigma</a>.</p><p>What would tech look if it was designed by sex workers? What values would be embedded into the&nbsp;design?</p><p>A new collective, <a href="https://decodingstigma.tech/">Decoding Stigma</a>, is hoping to find the answer by bridging the gap between sex work, technology, and academia. The goals are twofold: to prioritize sexual autonomy as a necessary ethics question for researchers and technologists and to design a liberatory future in which sexually stigmatized voices are amplified and celebrated.</p><p>Decoding Stigma is the continuation of research presented by Gabriella Garcia at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University. Garcia’s thesis, <a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2020/students/gabriella-m-garcia">Shift Control, End Delete: Encoded Stigma</a>, which she explains in detail <a href="https://vimeo.com/425306305">here</a>, explores how whorephobia becomes encoded in tech design, despite the historically co-constitutive relationship between sexual labor and the development of digital&nbsp;media.</p><p>The <a href="http://patchenbarss.com/major-works/the-erotic-engine/">distribution of sexual material fiscally supported</a> the historical development of communications technology, from the emergence of photography, home video, to even cable TV as the sexual revolution of the 1970s collided with more affordable means of film production and the birth of public-access television. Money made in the erotic market of 1980s proto-internet bulletin board systems (BBSs) literally paid for the material infrastructure that paved the path toward the world wide web before mainstream consumer adoption could even be taken into consideration.</p><p>As necessary innovators, sex workers are consistently early adopters of new technologies, designing, coding, building, and using websites and cryptocurrencies to advertise. In our time of internet ubiquity, sex workers often <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2020/09/rich-famous-onlyfans-changing-sex-workers-left-behind-bella-thorne-caroline-calloway-beyonce">build up the commercial bases of platforms</a>, populating content and increasing their size and commercial viability, only to later be excised and treated as <a href="https://theconversation.com/sexual-subcultures-are-collateral-damage-in-tumblrs-ban-on-adult-content-108169">collateral damage</a> when those same platforms introduce policies to remove sex entirely.</p><p>Now, overarching policies that prohibit sexual communication, expression, and solicitation are commonplace. While some have responded to legislation such as <a href="https://hackinghustling.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SSRN-id36638982.pdf">FOSTA/SESTA</a> that prohibits the promotion or facilitation of prostitution, many of these policies go far beyond what is legally required. When Apple, the first company to “put the internet in everyone’s pocket,” <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#physical-harm">prohibited explicit content</a> under its “Safety” conditions for third-party app developers, it fundamentally equated erotic material with torture, bigotry, and physical harm. As growing numbers of people are accessing their news and information via mobile (and thus via app), content must increasingly pass Apple’s Terms and Conditions as a point of market viability.</p><p>With algorithms to detect sexual content by picking up particular words, emojis, and hashtags and recognition software that scans for nudity, body parts, and skin patches, sex is under increasing surveillance. And yet algorithms are notoriously poor at understanding sex in context. Algorithmic bias and regulatory overreach <a href="https://saltyworld.net/algorithmicbiasreport-2/">disproportionately affect sex workers</a>, even where the activities may be&nbsp;lawful.</p><p>With a lack of forums to openly advertise, share safety and screening tips, to discuss harm reduction materials or simply to find community, these policies can put sex workers in danger and have a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-70660-3_9">chilling effect</a> on the kinds of sexualities that are visible and critical sexual conversations that are speakable.</p><p>Algorithmic profiling has resulted in account shutdowns and <a href="https://hackinghustling.org/posting-into-the-void-content-moderation/">shadowbanning of sex worker activists</a>. Malicious flagging is also employed as a user strategy to deplatform and displace sex workers. Suspensions, bans, digital gentrification, and lack of access put sex workers in precarious positions and acts as barriers to participation in online space and digital economies, posing a threat to our livelihoods. Barred from using marketing tools like other workers, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-02-paypal-square-and-big-bankings-war-on-the-sex-industry.html">financial discrimination</a> is rife, where payment processes ban sex workers entirely or deemed sex work at ‘high risk’ of fraud and chargebacks.</p><p>At the same time as this erasure, surveillance technologies are capturing sex workers’ data and misusing it. Legal name policies, requirements to upload photographic identification, the use of facial recognition software by payment processors, and social media functions that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/facebook-sex-workers-stalkers-risk-danger-social-media-online-a8004446.html">‘out’ sex workers</a> to clients all heighten risks for sex workers. The mining, sharing, and sale of data pose risks for sex workers being detected by law enforcement or facing increased immigration scrutiny, detention, or deportation.</p><p>Early tech exploitation of sex workers as internet infrastructure builders has now been surpassed by the development of carceral technologies to monitor sex worker behaviour. To Big Tech, the sex worker is as indispensable as they are disposable.</p><p>It’s with all this in mind that Decoding Stigma formed. Joining up with <a href="https://livia-foldes.com/">Livia Foldes</a> of Parsons School of Design at the New School and Danielle Blunt of autonomous collective <a href="https://hackinghustling.org/">Hacking//Hustling</a> as the group’s core infrastructure, Decoding Stigma have mobilised a group of critical sex thinkers — an interdisciplinary, cross-institutional mix of folk across tech, design, law, public health, gender studies, computer science, anthropology, and clinical social work — to deconstruct and re-generate the relationship between sex and&nbsp;tech.</p><p>Part of this agenda involves cultivating an ongoing <a href="https://decodingstigma.tech/resources.html">open-source syllabus</a> that serves as a ‘living learning hub of readings, resources, citable research, articles, and teaching toolkits’, for which the group plans to hold a live edit-a-thon.</p><p>Since its inception this Fall, Decoding Stigma has also been participating in workshops on <a href="https://cscw2020datafeminism.wordpress.com/">data feminism and equitable participatory design</a> and presenting to students as part of Melanie Hoff’s <a href="https://cyberneticsofsex.melaniehoff.com/2020/10/19/syllabus/">Cybernetics of Sex</a> class, which explores what automatic control systems teach us about&nbsp;sex.</p><p>In November, the group held its first interactive workshop ‘<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fighting-surveillance-tech-with-trademark-transparency-tickets-126905819723">Fighting Surveillance Tech with Trademark Transparency</a>’ in collaboration with <a href="https://www.levendowski.net/">Amanda Levendowski</a> and <a href="https://kendraalbert.com/">Kendra Albert</a>, which explored how sex workers could search trademark disclosure databases to identify the development of new surveillance technologies that could threaten sex worker privacy, safety, and livelihoods.</p><p>In December, Decoding Stigma will host a workshop with <a href="https://www.schock.cc/">Sasha Costanza-Chock</a> of <a href="https://www.transfeministech.codingrights.org/">TransFeministTech</a> and J<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/joana-varon">oana Varon</a> of <a href="https://www.codingrights.org/">Coding Rights</a> for its first “<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/freedom-to-fcking-dream-designing-a-sex-worker-friendly-future-tickets-132323022723">Freedom to F*cking Dream</a>” workshop, which will invite sex workers and allies to envision a future where technology is built by sex&nbsp;workers.</p><p>This will be a jumping-off point for a series of conversations led by <a href="https://anthro.illinois.edu/directory/profile/egwuatu2">Chibundo Egwuatu</a>, whose doctoral research centers black sex worker activism, de/criminalization, and liberation. Because of the global and growing nature of displacement, exclusion, and disappearance of sex workers from digital space, these conversations will connect activists working and organizing around the futurity of tech and sex work across the digital divide and across&nbsp;borders.</p><p>These are just some of many steps Decoding Stigma is taking towards achieving a future of tech where sex workers can see ourselves, each other, and our communities thrive.</p><p>Taking a sex worker lens to tech is not simply about involving more sex workers in tech design, although the infiltration of sex workers into this space will no doubt shift the kinds of technologies that are imagined and built. These are fundamental questions about ethical design, participation, access, privacy, surveillance, violence, and re-visioning new&nbsp;worlds.</p><p>What would tech look like if it was designed by sex workers? Stay tuned and you might just find&nbsp;out.</p><p>To donate finances, skill-sets or other resources, propose a collaboration or workshop, or simply to join the conversation, visit <a href="http://www.decodingstigma.tech/">Decoding&nbsp;Stigma</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/what-can-tech-learn-from-sex-workers-8e0100f0b4b9">What can tech learn from sex workers?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Welcome to the last DINZ newsletter of the 2020 (Gregorian) calendar year. Recognising that as with ideas of identity, our marking of time and seasons is very much based on our cultural and sometimes geographical context.&nbsp;We’ll avoid the temptation to contemplate fake snow and warmly-clothed grey bearded characters, and instead focus on things such as the beautiful pōhutukawa bringing colour and joy to our Aotearoa landscape.<br>&nbsp;<br>Reflecting on the theme of international diversity and context, we welcome you all to appreciate and share the video session&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/biasmlopes/?originalSubdomain=dk">Bianca Lopes</a>&nbsp;prepared for our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2020/12/07/aotearoa-digital-identity-hui-taumata-2/">November Aotearoa Digital Identity Hui</a>.&nbsp;In it she explored how five different countries have tackled the opportunities and challenges of developing digital identity ecosystems. It’s a great reminder of the importance of cultural context, and was a perfect springboard for our kapa kōrero session exploring identity from a Te Ao Māori perspective.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In the same&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2020/12/07/aotearoa-digital-identity-hui-taumata-2/">link</a>&nbsp;you can also watch an up-to-the minute update of the work of the Digital Identity Transition Programme, featuring Director Alan Bell and Emma O’Connell.&nbsp;We are excited about the ecosystem potential as a New Zealand Trust Framework and accreditation system starts to take shape.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our Annual Meeting was last week, and we had the pleasure of congratulating and welcoming our newly-elected Executive Council members Russell Craig (Microsoft), Sat Mandri (JNCTN) and John Evans (TSB), and the re-elected Luke McIntyre (Mattr).&nbsp;You can view the full Council&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Looking ahead to 2021<br>A number of you have been participating in our workshop sessions on AML Reliance and Trust and Identity Research and Education. We will be continuing with this collaborative, initiative-based approach into the New Year, phasing out our old working group structure.&nbsp;<br><br>We are very conscious that there is a big information gap between those on the ‘inside’ of all things digital identity and those at the other ends of the solutions. This includes&nbsp; individual and community service users, as well as a raft of commercial and community businesses and organisations for whom information and identity management is critical. Closing the gap will be a major focus for us in 2021, and we will be asking you to join us in that endeavour.<br><br>Introducing the New Zealand Tech and Innovation Story<br>I’d also like to make a mention of an exciting new programme that NZTech is leading. The New Zealand Tech and Innovation Story is a marketing initiative that will be designed to promote and enhance our international reputation for delivering world-class solutions and present New Zealand as a compelling place for tech talent and investment.&nbsp;But to get started, we need your help!<br><br>If you could take 10 minutes to complete&nbsp;<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/THJJXNN">this survey</a>&nbsp;it would be greatly appreciated (please feel free to share amongst your network also).</p>



<p>By completing the&nbsp;survey, you are playing a part in helping shape the narrative and the way we promote New Zealand’s tech and innovation capabilities internationally.

 How do we build a world we’ve never seen before? We must change who drives the&nbsp;future. Illustration by Superside<p>By Eshanthi Ranasinghe and David Hsu, Exploration &amp; Future Sensing, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Every day we take steps which carry our attitudes and assumptions about the future. Our steps can be fearful and cautious. They can also be bold leaps made out of clear-eyed hope and raw necessity.</p><p>In this year of concurrent crises and collapses, when many ways forward seem possible, the challenge is to critically discern between pathways which wind up leading back to a broken “normal” and pathways which lead us into a future we have never seen before — one that is more equitable, just, and beautiful.<br> <br>At Omidyar Network, this kind of discernment is vital to our mission of <a href="https://omidyar.com/#focusareas">reimagining systems that shape our daily lives</a>: building an economy that works for all, realizing the promise of responsible technology, and fostering a more pluralistic society. We launched the <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/exploration-and-future-sensing-ac4ef4ae302e">Exploration &amp; Future Sensing</a> unit in 2019 to help achieve this mission. Building upon years of prior experimentation, the unit peers beyond what we know and see today by scanning for signals of change, investigating emerging trends, using scenarios to shake old patterns of thinking, and activating new collaborations. <br> <br>Much of our exploration revolves around the question: When uncertainty abounds, how do we move beyond our own biases and blind spots to build a world we’ve never seen before? <br> <br>The short answer is that we turn to community. We must center people with experience living in between worlds, or on the margins, who have honed an extraordinary capacity for imagining and building futures that are more beautiful and resilient. They’re people who have crossed cultures, borders, and identities. They have learned to live in the future and navigate its uncertain terrain often out of necessity.</p><blockquote>When uncertainty abounds, how do we move beyond our own biases and blind spots to build a world we’ve never seen before? We turn to community. We must center people with experience living in between worlds or on the margins, who have honed an extraordinary capacity for imagining and building futures that are more beautiful and resilient.</blockquote><p>In the process of engaging with a variety of foresight methods, creative approaches, and practitioner communities, we’re finding a growing group of partners and collaborators who embody a new wave of future thinking for social change. Their talent for exploring alternative futures comes from asking not just what the future could hold but also who thrives in it and how we will take action to get there together. Instead of simply extrapolating from existing systems, these alternative futurists are rooted in transformative visions of equity, access, belonging, and justice.<br> <br>It’s never been more critical to support and partner with people who are thinking more courageously and hopefully about the future. Here are four such efforts Omidyar Network Exploration &amp; Future Sensing is honored to&nbsp;support.</p> Radical Imagination with Angela Glover Blackwell <p>This podcast is a window to a more equitable future where guaranteed income, reparations, and open borders, are real possibilities.</p><p>Angela Glover Blackwell doesn’t call herself a futurist. She doesn’t issue forecasts about what 2030 and 2050 will hold. Instead, she has a remarkable track record of sensing what we need today to achieve a more equitable tomorrow, and telling stories that invite more people into that new world of possibility. After founding and leading <a href="https://www.policylink.org/">PolicyLink</a> for the past 20 years, Angela launched the <a href="https://radicalimagination.us/">Radical Imagination</a> podcast. Now entering its third season, Angela features bold innovators who remind us that change is already happening. Past episodes include conversations with Chief August Creppel on climate migration; Mélisande Short-Colomb and Ana Lucia Araujo on reparations; Walidah Imarisha on storytelling and organizing; and Tiq Milan on&nbsp;gender.</p>Angela Glover Blackwell, <a href="https://www.policylink.org/">PolicyLink</a> Founder-in-Residence and host of the <a href="https://radicalimagination.us/">Radical Imagination</a> podcast.<p>The podcast has grown as a beacon this year. “We all need the hope that comes from two things,” Angela says in one episode. “First, envisioning our way out of this pandemic; and second, seeing ourselves emerge with the collective resolve and communal spirit to create a better society than the one we had when COVID-19 hit. A society that rejects fear, divisiveness, and the perverse idea that greed will save us. A society in which we all stand together and take care of one another. This isn’t daydreaming, it’s radical imagination.”</p><blockquote>“We all need the hope that comes from two things.

This isn’t daydreaming, it’s radical imagination.” — Angela Glover Blackwell</blockquote> Next Generation Foresight Practitioners <p>This network of younger future-alert activists aims to influence how foresight is done…and by&nbsp;whom.</p>The<a href="https://nextgenforesight.org/"> Next Generation Foresight Practitioners</a> Program at <a href="https://soif.org.uk/">School of International Futures</a> released their “<a href="https://soif.org.uk/blog/ngfp-futures-manifesto-covid-19/">Futures Manifesto</a>” amidst the pandemic.<p>Foresight, the practice of investigating the future, has traditionally been dominated by a relatively small group of practitioners in Western countries with long careers in foresight methodologies. The <a href="https://soif.org.uk/">School of International Futures</a>, founded by Cat Tully, is addressing this imbalance with the <a href="https://nextgenforesight.org/">Next Generation Foresight Practitioners</a> (NGFP) Program, which believes that foresight empowers all changemakers to build a better future. The program supports emerging voices across underrepresented geographies with a fellowship award; connects them to a network of future-alert activists spanning 68 countries; and amplifies their influence by partnering with critical decision-making institutions.</p><p>For example, NGFP worked on a project this year helping the World Health Organization’s Western Pacific Regional Office to identify younger people’s visions and priorities for the future beyond COVID-19. As Pupul Bisht, NGFP’s Creative Lead and Network Weaver (winner of an inaugural award in 2018), explains, “We believe that when it comes to thinking about post-pandemic futures, supporting bottom-up agenda setting is critical.”</p> Guild of Future Architects <p>This cross-disciplinary community is remixing the art and science of collaboration to build tomorrow’s systems.</p><p>What would a water cooler for a different kind of future thinking look like? That’s one of the questions that spurred Sharon Chang to create <a href="https://futurearchitects.com/">Guild of Future Architects</a>, led by Executive Director Kamal Sinclair. Unlike how future thinking is tethered to commercial or geopolitical objectives, Guild of Future Architects seeks to “make the world more beautiful for more people” and intentionally nurtures collaborations across a diverse array of disciplines to get there. Founding members include artists, technologists, writers, as well as practitioners in health, economics, and urban planning.</p><a href="https://futurearchitects.com/">Guild of Future Architects</a> members Madebo Fatunde and Thomas DeBass hatching early concepts for Institute of African&nbsp;Futures.<p>At a recent event, teams engaged virtual audiences around <a href="https://futurearchitects.com/shared-futures/profiles">Shared Futures</a> projects incubated by the Guild, including Embodied Intelligence, a framework to help people reclaim physical agency in the age of technology and surveillance; Abundant Health, a model of health care that empowers communities to restore wellness; Institute for African Futures, a dream tank for the future of the African continent; and The Gift, a multimedia experience bridging astrophysics and social transformation. All four prototypes pointed to a future that doesn’t see today’s limitations.</p> Comuzi <p>This design studio believes minority communities must have power to shape emerging AI and algorithmic systems before harm is&nbsp;done.</p><a href="https://www.comuzi.xyz/info.html">COMUZI</a>’s Akil Benjamin, Richard Fagbolagun, and Alex<br> Fefegha.<p>Who gets to shape the future? London-based for-profit design studio <a href="https://www.comuzi.xyz/index.html">COMUZI</a> believes in a more democratic vision where minority voices have the power to influence emerging algorithmic systems rather than being erased by them. Leveraging backgrounds at the nexus of technology, design, and social justice, COMUZI’s project “Beyond Tools of Resistance” will engage community members to prototype tools for holding governments and corporations accountable as AI innovations rapidly reshape how economic safety nets, health services, and transportation systems work. <br> <br>That people should have influence over these systems should not be a radical idea, but when it comes to historically marginalized communities having that power, this thinking is often far outside of the proverbial box. “The process of petitioning and pressuring government officials for change can be very fragmented. It usually takes a moment to infringe the rights of minority voices and many months or years to seek justice,“ COMUZI’s Akil Benjamin notes. “With AI this problem increases tenfold, but imagine if communities had modern tools to accelerate or even get ahead of this process. That’s what we’re aiming to&nbsp;create.”</p><p>The Radical Imagination podcast (powered by PolicyLink), Next Generation Foresight Practitioners (program of School of International Futures), Guild of Future Architects, and COMUZI are grantees of Omidyar Network’s <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/explorations/home">Exploration &amp; Future Sensing</a>&nbsp;unit.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/listening-to-the-future-5d709ea30d7d">Listening to the Future</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/1527pjeb6jg">Samuel Ferrara</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/1527pjeb6jg">Unsplash</a><p>Zug, Switzerland — 15 December 2020 — Today, Energy Web announced that the Good Energies Foundation has awarded a grant to commercialize <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">EW Zero</a>, a digital, open-source, global market hub for renewable energy. EW Zero provides a single digital entry point for renewable energy buyers — from multinational corporations to small- and medium-sized enterprises — to discover and purchase renewable energy that meets their financial, sustainability, and corporate social responsibility requirements.</p><p>Such search/find/procure functionality is already ubiquitous online for air travel, hotels, and tour bookings. But it is almost non-existent for renewable energy procurement. There is no digital, global solution available today to buy or sell renewables directly online, making modern-day renewable energy procurement akin to the travel industry pre-Internet, with travel agents acting as gatekeepers (much like brokers and consultants act today in renewable energy markets). Energy Web intends for EW Zero to usher in a new era of renewable energy procurement.</p><p>Energy Web first unveiled EW Zero in September 2020 in a <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/xrp-ledger-foundation-ripple-and-energy-web-announce-worlds-first-decarbonized-blockchain-5c3cecbff31a">joint announcement with Ripple</a> to decarbonize the XRP Ledger, the world’s third-largest blockchain network <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/">by cryptocurrency market cap</a>. The Good Energies grant will enable Energy Web to bring EW Zero to market over the next year by commercializing the software and releasing tools that enable suppliers (e.g., renewable energy developers, owners, and operators) to post renewables for sale on EW Zero. Such integration protocols will enable companies to connect commercial renewable energy platforms — including but not limited to the various marketplace platforms built over the past two years with various Energy Web member organizations such as PTT, Foton, and Mercados Eléctricos — to ensure sufficient renewable supply is made available for&nbsp;buyers.</p><p>“Even in today’s day and age with major renewable energy commitments popping up left and right, it remains surprisingly difficult for small to medium enterprises and governments to purchase renewables,” explained Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer of Energy Web. “The Good Energies grant is a testament to the promise of open-source technologies to help solve market challenges. This funding makes it possible for EW Zero to connect local renewables marketplaces together in a single digital hub, much like Google Flights or Skyscanner does for air travel, and make it easier for renewable energy buyers to achieve their specific goals for renewables procurement.”</p><p>Renewable energy markets and underlying energy attribute certificate (EAC) markets are fragmented, with 30+ tracking systems for guarantees of origin (GOs) in Europe, 10+ tracking systems for renewable energy certificates (RECs) in the United States, 1 overarching tracking system for International Renewable Energy Certificates (I-RECs) in 35+ developed countries, and several independent national tracking systems. There are also emerging standards to support new projects in off-grid contexts and conflict zones that EW plans for EW Zero to support. One example includes the recently announced “Peace-REC” (P-REC) standard — also funded by the Good Energies Foundation — which was applied to <a href="https://www.3blmedia.com/News/First-Ever-Peace-REC-P-REC-Transaction-Drives-Renewable-Energy-Development-Africa">a first-of-its-kind transaction</a> between Microsoft and renewables sourced from emerging and fragile economies, in this case the Democratic Republic of&nbsp;Congo.</p><p>These standards and markets often depend on outdated technology and analog processes, which add cost and complexity, third-party dependencies, and overall market opacity that makes it difficult for buyers to find available options. EW Zero will help solve these various market pain points by streamlining the EAC lifecycle and providing buyers an integrated, transparent discovery platform for their renewables procurement. Initially, EW Zero is focused on renewable electricity procurement using EACs. Over time, EW Zero’s development will evolve to support bundled electricity products (e.g., power purchase agreements) and transactions of other forms of renewables including but not limited to <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/green-gas-aleapfrog-opportunity-for-a-new-low-carbon-industry-e551caf2326f">green hydrogen, green gas, and a new generation of carbon&nbsp;offsets</a>.</p><p>“Our Foundation focuses on two levers to reverse climate change: clean energy and healthy forests,” said Stephanie Jones, Programme Manager at Good Energies. “We are excited to support Energy Web for a project with transformational potential for global renewable energy markets. We hope our grant for EW Zero will help scale investments in new renewable energy projects, particularly in developing countries, by reducing market friction and streamlining I-REC and other energy attribute certificate transactions between buyers and sellers to expand clean energy access to more communities across the&nbsp;globe.”</p><p>The Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA), RE-Source Platform, International REC Standard Foundation, and EKOenergy have all agreed to serve as EW Zero Advisors to provide input that guides Energy Web’s development of EW Zero over the next&nbsp;year.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating a low-carbon, customer-centric electricity system by unleashing the potential of decentralized, digital technologies. EW focuses on our open-source technology stack — the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) — to enable any device, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy&nbsp;market.</p><p>EW launched the Energy Web Chain, the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector and the anchor of the EW-DOS tech stack. EW has also fostered the world’s largest enterprise ecosystem focused on open-source, decentralized, digital technologies. They comprise utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://energyweb.org/">https://energyweb.org</a>.</p><p>About Good Energies Foundation<br>Good Energies Foundation is a Swiss-based private foundation. It was established in 2007 as an integral part of Good Energies Inc., a private equity company specialised in investing in the renewable energy and energy-efficiency industries. Good Energies works in partnership with Porticus, the international organisation that manages and develops the philanthropic programmes of charitable entities established by Brenninkmeijer family entrepreneurs.</p><p>CONTACT<br>Peter Bronski, Energy Web<br>+1.201.575.5545 | peter.bronski@energyweb.org</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-awarded-good-energies-foundation-grant-for-new-global-renewables-marketplace-794eaa7e14e0">Energy Web Awarded Good Energies Foundation Grant for New Global Renewables Marketplace</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 <p>A DLT/blockchain independent platform to Issue and Verify certified attributes and claims, under different formats, and for any SSI system</p>
<p>With the introduction of notified eID schemas, thanks to eIDAS regulation, Europe made a big step forward in the identity management interoperability field. Yet these systems rely on centralized standard models and protocols (SAML being the most spread).</p>
<p>The enrichment of identity attribute with other types of attestations and claims, as of today, remains an unfulfilled promise: Federated Identity Model, upon which the whole eID system is based, isn’t enough agile to let new player come in and provide certified attributes services.</p>
<p>Italy is one of the main exemplifications: tough systems like SPID and CIE are gradually taking over the eID scenario, Attribute authorities, which should have provided attributes and claims about identities are, as of today, completely absent.</p>
<p>With the advent of SSI we have an extraordinary opportunity to deploy new technology standards to enrich eID: verifiable credential. Yet, we need to perfectly fit the regulatory trust model while still being compliant to eIDAS schemes.</p>
<p>But still SSI is a very complicated subject, both from the theoretical and technical point of view, mainly because it requires a deep understanding of blockchain and cryptography concepts.<br>Further on, each SSI project tends to propose its own solution as a closed platform, with no particular attention to interoperability and blockchain-independent solution approach.</p>

				 <p>An eIDAS bridge, which is a component that proposes to enhance the legal certainty of any class of verifiable credentials</p>
<p>The eIDAS bridge is a component that proposes to enhance the legal certainty of any class of verifiable credential, by incorporating the issuer’s advanced or qualified electronic signature (if the issuer is a natural person) or seal (if the issuer is a legal person).</p>
<p>Basically it allows Issuers to issue credentials that incorporate the issuer’s advanced or qualified electronic signature (if the issuer is a natural person) or seal (if the issuer is a legal person).</p>
<p>Trustworthiness in a Verifiable Credential is linked to the issuer’s DID: Verifying the identity of the issuer is paramount, since there is no binding of a DID to a real-world natural or legal person per se.</p>
<p>The main role of the eIDAS Bridge is to assist:</p>
 
 Issuers, in the process of signing/sealing a verifiable credential, and 
 Verifiers, in the last mile of the verification process, to help identifying the natural or legal person behind an issuer’s DID. 
 
<p>Its functions are:</p>
 
 Assist in setting up the Issuer’s qualified certificate. 
 Assist in signing or sealing Verifiable Credentials with the private key of a qualified certificate. 
 Assist in the verification process of a Verifiable Credential to retrieve the Qualified Certificate and verify it against the EU Trusted Lists.

				 <p>Online password less authentication based on SSI and FIDO2</p>
<p>Self-Sovereign IDentity Online (SSIDO) is an online passwordless solution for SSI users’ authentication through the standard Fast IDentity Online (FIDO2) protocols. SSIDO is aimed at consolidating both two technologies related to the Identity and Access Management (IAM). As a result, emerging SSI-enabled solutions can be seamlessly integrated with the existing FIDO2 applications.</p>
<p>The Web Authentication ceremony begins at the Application Layer between a user (Holder) and a Relying Party (Verifier) and implies an authentication assertion about the presence and consent of that previously registered user using the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).</p>
<p>SSIDO extends this PKI-based approach by introducing the Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) built upon the concepts of SSI, Distributed Ledger, Agent, DID Record (DID and DID Document), as well as Verifiable Credential (VC) and Verifiable Presentation (VP).</p>
<p>To proceed with the Authentication ceremony at the Agent Layer, SSIDO incorporates the following two components:</p>
 
 SSIDO Authenticator, an edge-side agent (Holder’s Agent) designed for both mobile devices and desktop environments. 
 SSIDO Validator, a server-side or cloud-side agent (Verifier’s Agent). 
 
<p>SSI Authenticator responds to a challenge generated by SSI Validator (VP request) with the assertion signed by the user’s private key (VP). While attesting the received assertion (VP verification), SSI Validator employs the user’s public key retrieved from the DID Document.</p>
<p>The SSIDO solution is compatible with different schemes of verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations, and it can be generalized on Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).</p>

				 <p>Open sourcing Evernym’s credential exchange platform</p>
<p>At Evernym, we have a history of open sourcing our work. Until now, we have kept the top layer of our SSI architecture proprietary. This layer provides a much easier to use SDK and platform for developers to create compelling SSI deployments compared to the lower level Hyperledger Indy/Ursa/Aries stack.</p>
<p>We want to encourage anyone to develop SSI solutions. For this reason, we will use our ESSIF-Lab grant to convert our proprietary software into repositories covered by a business source license, which itself will convert to an open source Apache 2.0 license after 36 months.</p>
<p>This will enable anyone to use and develop on our code, with all non production use permitted as well as production use up to a limit.</p>
<p>We believe this will accelerate SSI adoption, removing technical and commercial barriers to entry, by providing the world with access to the best SSI technology available.</p>
<p>Evernym’s products that are the target of this open sourcing initiative cover enterprise and consumer uses:</p>
 
 Verity: our enterprise SSI SDK and server to operate on-premise or as Saas. This performs all enterprise functions that are needed in an SSI ecosystem including forming DID connections, authentication, credential issuance and verification. 
 Mobile SDK: our app SDK to allow anyone to build Android or iOS based apps with full SSI wallet functionality. 
 Connect.Me: our mobile app that provides SSI wallet capability for making DID connections, holding credentials and sending proofs.

				 <p>TRAIN (TRust mAnagement INfrastructure): Trust Management Infrastructure Component for the ESSIF-Lab Architecture</p>
<p>Our component aims to extend the ESSIF-Framework through a global trust infrastructure that can be used to verify the trustworthiness of involved parties in an electronic transaction. The trust layer enables actors using the ESSIF-Framework to verify the root of trust of certificates used to sign credentials. In addition, the component allows for the definition, consideration, and verification of Trust Schemes compliance (e.g. eIDAS including LoAs or other Trust Schemes that can also be application/industry-specific) of involved parties. It is not dependent on a hierarchical CA infrastructure. The component builds on the infrastructure developed in the EU project LIGHTest (2016-2020, G.A. No. 700321). The trust layer is flexible, individual parties can define their own trust policies, manage and publish them. TRAIN is fully in line with the open and decentral SSI approach and complements other approaches.</p>
<p>The trust management architecture that is made possible by TRAIN enables secure, trustable digital interactions. At the same time a classical hierarchical CA-type structure is avoided – so is fraud, chaos and the pure dominance of the economically strongest actors in the system.</p>
<p>Individuals or groups (industry organizations, NGOs, etc.) of validators can define for themselves the trust standards they require. Issuers can publish to what standards they comply. The system is open, but standards for trust are transparent, as the Trust Schemes and Lists can be published.</p>

<p>By Subhashish Bhadra, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Regulators, governments, and courts have struggled to catch up with today’s rapid technological progress. That’s why Omidyar Network is exploring what it takes to reimagine our institutions.</p><p>Circa 2011, the internet was hailed as a bastion of freedom. A man in Egypt even named his newborn daughter “Facebook,” in honor of the pivotal role the social media company played in the Arab&nbsp;Spring.</p><p>Today, countries in the Global South have a litany of complaints against tech companies: privacy breaches, domestic tax evasion, inadequate content moderation, lack of free speech online, data extraction to outside the country, and much more. So, what’s changed since 2011? And why didn’t we see this&nbsp;coming?</p><p>Technology has evolved in ways we didn’t imagine, so we didn’t plan and prepare accordingly. Tech has transformed into new business lines, using the data at its disposal to create sprawling commercial empires. It has permeated governments, with law enforcement using facial recognition and other surveillance technologies. And it has fell into the hands of bad actors who used AI, for example, to create deep fake pornography.</p><p>Governments, courts, and regulators — the institutions we created to protect us — have failed to catch up; oftentimes they simply lacked the tools to counter these new&nbsp;threats.</p><p>We must catch up and look ahead. Omidyar Network believes we must reboot our institutions to set them up for success in the data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Many consequences of technological progress are unknown — and will remain so for years to come. Therefore, our institutions need to serve as “safety valves” that can identify and act as soon as harms become evident. Western democracies took centuries to develop such institutions for the industrial age; we don’t have that luxury for this digital era. Our institutions need to either move fast or risk undermining digital progress by exacerbating digital&nbsp;harms.</p><p>We have urgent concerns that public and private tech implementers must address now — like misinformation and privacy — but we must proverbially walk and chew gum at the same time. We need to tackle the immediate needs while building robust institutions for the long-term. The latter is critically important for three reasons. First, technology will keep throwing new challenges at us and we shouldn’t always be playing catch up. We need to get ahead of the curve and tackle issues in their infancy. When institutions like Parliament and courts work well, they provide forums for individuals to question how tech is rolled out. Second, most of today’s solutions originate in the US and Europe, but the same solutions may play out differently in different socio-economic contexts. Citizens need forums in which they can discuss what is best suited for them, rather than have a solution thrust from the Global North. Third, it is not just where we land that matters, but also how we get there. The path countries take on tech needs to be based on democratic norms and a respect for constitutional principles like individual liberty and non-discrimination. Those that don’t will risk being unsustainable because of possible tech lash by the people or&nbsp;courts.</p><p>That’s the “easy” part. The more difficult question is where to even start. Here’s the approach Omidyar Network is experimenting with:</p><p>We are seeking to better understand the existing laws and institutions, and how they are performing, including the entire mosaic required for a thriving digital economy: data protection, competition, taxation, transparency, cybersecurity, speech regulation, consumer protection, and more. Many of the underlying principles are context-agnostic, although their application to a country requires nuance and caution. To help guide our learning, we have commissioned multiple cross-country analyses of data protection <a href="https://omidyar.com/data-protection-and-digital-infrastructure-before-during-and-after-a-pandemic-2/">laws</a>. We have also recently funded the <a href="https://africafoicentre.org/">Africa Freedom of Information Centre</a> in Uganda to evaluate whether open contracting norms are applied effectively to government procurement of tech systems. We are curious about issues surrounding surveillance and online free&nbsp;speech.</p><p>Concurrently, we are exploring ways to strengthen the capacity of institutions that uphold these laws. Across the globe, we see that regulators struggle with low budgets and headcounts, wait for years for cases to wend their way through the courts, and for governments to belatedly apply ineffective band-aids on issues that require fundamental re-thinking. As such, we are working in different institutional contexts to understand which types of capacity-building efforts are most effective. For example, we recently funded the <a href="https://digitalrightslawyers.org/who-we-are/#:~:text=Digital%20Rights%20Lawyers%20Initiative%20is,exercisable%20in%20the%20digital%20space.">Digital Rights Lawyers Initiative</a> in Nigeria to train lawyers in digital rights litigation in the hopes it will improve the quality of technology rulings.</p><p>Finally, we are supporting digital rights organizations throughout Africa to act as checks on technological excesses of both governments and corporations. We partnered with the <a href="https://nextgenforesight.org/">Next Generation of African Foresight Practitioners at the School of International Futures</a> to generate a set of insights, signals, and scenarios that look out to 2030, and explore their implications for African institutions.</p><p>Our hope is that these investments will help us — and our many partners — answer critical questions: Which laws do we need? Which institutions can uphold them? And how can we hold institutions accountable?</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/institutions-matter-60c819d32e2a">Institutions Matter</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The activities section displays the interactions in which the credential was involved (e.g. an issuance or a proof request / verified presentation). It states all three of the above mentioned points. The Lissi wallet protocols all these interactions to increase transparency and help to stay informed.</p> Further developments <p>A protocol of interactions to monitor one’s activities is a good first step. However, the next topics, which we need to address are consent, sharing policies and the execution of GDPR&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Consent is a permission granted by an individual to a third party for a certain activity. In order to make an informed decision an individual e.g. needs to know: Who asks? Has the party the right to ask? What is done with the data? Where is it stored? All this information needs to be easily accessible for the user in order to grant or revoke consent for the use of his:her data. However, this should not be a vendor specific integration and instead needs to be discussed and formalised with other stakeholders. We are actively involved in such discussions in the Decentralised Identity Foundation (DIF) and other relevant communities.</p><p>Cheers<br>The Lissi&nbsp;Team</p>

<p>This tutorial will demonstrate how to allow users of your application or platform to encrypt secrets with a DID and store them in their <a href="https://idx.xyz/">IDX</a>. Apps and libraries can use this pattern to easily store and recover seeds, secret keys, personal information, application data, and credentials that they may need for their own systems, simply based on the ability to authenticate a DID. </p><p>Because IDX allows any data to be associated to a DID in a decentralized manner, the secrets and information stored in IDX are secure, 100% owned by the user, and can easily be discovered and accessed by any application or platform allowed by the user. (Interop!) Under the hood, IDX uses <a href="https://www.ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a> as a decentralized data storage protocol.</p><p>In this tutorial we will use the following technologies:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js">DIDs</a>: a W3C standard for decentralized identifiers  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516">JWE</a>: an IETF standard for encrypted content  <a href="https://docs.ceramic.network/modules/_ceramicnetwork_http_client.html">Ceramic HTTP client</a>: a JS client for interacting with a remote Ceramic node over HTTP  <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs/libs-idx">IDX</a>: a protocol for user-centric data management based on DIDs  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/key-did-provider-ed25519/">Ed25519 Key DID provider</a>: a library for using the Key DID method  <a href="https://github.com/achingbrain/uint8arrays">uint8arrays</a>: a utility library for converting between binary and text data   Environment setup <p>To get started using IDX, we'll first need to install the Ceramic and IDX CLIs using <code>npm</code>. You'll also need to have <code>node</code> installed.</p> <code>npm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli @ceramicstudio/idx-cli</code> <p>Then we'll start the Ceramic daemon to run a local Ceramic node:</p> <code>ceramic daemon
</code> <p>We will also need to make sure the Ceramic node supports IDX documents, using the following command:</p> <code>idx bootstrap</code> <p>Now let's create a DID and give it the label <code>local</code> so we can more easily reference it throughout the rest of this tutorial. We will use this DID for authentication when interacting with the CLI as a developer (not an end-user):</p> <code>idx did:create --label=local</code>  Data model <p>To store our encrypted secret using Ceramic and IDX, we will need two things:</p>  A JSON schema for the encrypted payload (JWE)  An IDX definition to uniquely identify our encrypted secret in the user's IDX index   JWE schema <p>We will use the following JSON schema to validate that the encrypted payloads match the JWE specification when storing them on Ceramic:</p> <code>{
  $schema: 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#',
  title: 'JWE',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    protected: { type: 'string' },
    iv: { type: 'string' },
    ciphertext: { type: 'string' },
    tag: { type: 'string' },
    aad: { type: 'string' },
    recipients: {
      type: 'array',
      items: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          header: {
            type: 'object',
            properties: {
              alg: { type: 'string' },
              iv: { type: 'string' },
              tag: { type: 'string' },
              epk: { type: 'object' },
              kid: { type: 'string' },
            },
            required: ['alg', 'iv', 'tag'],
          },
          encrypted_key: { type: 'string' },
        },
        required: ['header', 'encrypted_key'],
      },
    },
  },
  required: ['protected', 'iv', 'ciphertext', 'tag'],
}</code> <p>Using the DID previously created, we can publish the schema to the local Ceramic node. Use the <code>idx schema:publish</code> command as shown below:</p> <code>idx schema:publish local '{"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#","title":"JWE","type":"object","properties":{"protected":{"type":"string"},"iv":{"type":"string"},"ciphertext":{"type":"string"},"tag":{"type":"string"},"aad":{"type":"string"},"recipients":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"header":{"type":"object","properties":{"alg":{"type":"string"},"iv":{"type":"string"},"tag":{"type":"string"},"epk":{"type":"object"},"kid":{"type":"string"}},"required":["alg","iv","tag"]},"encrypted_key":{"type":"string"}},"required":["header","encrypted_key"]}}},"required":["protected","iv","ciphertext","tag"]}'</code> <p>Successfully running this command will display the schema URL, which will be used in the next step. In my case the URL is <code>ceramic://k3y52l7qbv1fryd65pd3dyu9dim46vx39z4bgzrrligbi5sfd0e3mwump2p6pdn9c</code> but when you run the command with your own DID, it will be different.</p> Encrypted secret definition <p>Now that we have a generic JWE schema, we need to create a unique definition for the secret data we want to store using the <code>idx definition:create</code> command. Multiple definitions can use the same schema, but each definition functions as a unique key in the user's IDX index.</p> <code>idx definition:create local --schema=&lt;schema URL from previous command&gt; --name="my secret data" --description="encrypted payload"</code> <p>Running this command with display the unique document ID for the definition, which we will need in the following step. In my case this ID is <code>kjzl6cwe1jw14adxazb6clhiiniffhkedz69mrkvi4i1miad62iwazktfiy8rgm</code> but it will be different for you.</p> Using our definition <p>Let's create a simple script that uses our definition to check if the encrypted secret is present in a user's IDX index, or create and store a new one if needed.</p> Dependencies <p>We'll need to install the following dependencies from <code>npm</code>: <a href="https://docs.ceramic.network/modules/_ceramicnetwork_http_client.html">Ceramic HTTP client</a>, <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs/libs-idx">IDX</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/key-did-provider-ed25519/">Ed25519 Key DID provider</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/achingbrain/uint8arrays">uint8arrays</a>.</p> <code>npm install @ceramicnetwork/http-client @ceramicstudio/idx key-did-provider-ed25519 uint8arrays</code> <p>Now let's create a simple script in a <code>secret.js</code> file, importing these dependencies along with <code>randomBytes</code> from the <code>crypto</code> module:</p> <code>const { randomBytes } = require('crypto')
const Ceramic = require('@ceramicnetwork/http-client').default
const { IDX } = require('@ceramicstudio/idx')
const { Ed25519Provider } = require('key-did-provider-ed25519')
const { fromString, toString } = require('uint8arrays')</code> secret.js file Ceramic authentication <p>In order to allow a user to encrypt their secret and store it in their IDX index, we will need our Ceramic client to be authenticated. Here we will use the <code>Ed25519Provider</code> requiring a 32 bytes seed that we will either get from the environment, or by generating a random one:</p> <code>function getSeed() {
  let seed
  if (process.env.SEED) {
    seed = fromString(process.env.SEED, 'base16')
    console.log('Using provided seed')
  } else {
    seed = new Uint8Array(randomBytes(32))
    console.log(`Created seed: ${toString(seed, 'base16')}`)
  }
  return seed
}</code> secret.js file<p>In order to access secret data already associated to a DID, we will need to use the same seed by setting the <code>SEED=&lt;base16-encoded string&gt;</code> environment variable, otherwise a new DID will be created.</p><p>Now let's use this <code>getSeed()</code> function to authenticate our Ceramic client:</p> <code>async function getCeramic() {
  const ceramic = new Ceramic('http://localhost:7007')
  await ceramic.setDIDProvider(new Ed25519Provider(getSeed()))
  return ceramic
}</code> secret.js file Encrypted secret interactions <p>We will now create two functions to interact with our encrypted secret: one to encrypt and store, and another one to load and decrypt, using the definition we created from the CLI. Note, make sure to replace <code>kjzl6cwe1jw14adxazb6clhiiniffhkedz69mrkvi4i1miad62iwazktfiy8rgm</code> in the code below with the definition ID you created:</p> <code>const KEY = 'kjzl6cwe1jw14adxazb6clhiiniffhkedz69mrkvi4i1miad62iwazktfiy8rgm'

async function uploadSecret(idx, payload) {
  const jwe = await idx.did.createJWE(payload, [idx.did.id])
  await idx.set(KEY, jwe)
}

async function downloadSecret(idx) {
  const jwe = await idx.get(KEY)
  return jwe ? await idx.did.decryptJWE(jwe) : null
}</code> secret.js file<p>We provide our own DID <code>idx.did.id</code> when calling <code>idx.did.createJWE()</code> so that only the authenticated DID can decrypt the created JWE payload. It's not the case in this example, but if you would like to allow other DIDs to decrypt the payload you would include them here.</p><blockquote>As an alternative to <code>createJWE</code> and <code>decryptJWE</code>, we could use the <code><a href="https://ceramicnetwork.github.io/js-did/classes/did.html#createdagjwe">createDagJWE</a></code> and <code><a href="https://ceramicnetwork.github.io/js-did/classes/did.html#decryptdagjwe">decryptDagJWE</a></code> methods to encrypt JSON data instead of binary as we are doing in this example.</blockquote> Interaction logic <p>Finally, let's create a function to implement a simple flow of checking if the encrypted secret exists and display it, or create and store a new secret:</p> <code>async function run() {
  const ceramic = await getCeramic()
  const idx = new IDX({ ceramic })
  console.log(`Connected with DID: ${idx.id}`)

  const existing = await downloadSecret(idx)
  if (existing == null) {
    const secret = new Uint8Array(randomBytes(32))
    await uploadSecret(idx, secret)
    console.log('Created secret:')
    console.log(secret)
  } else {
    console.log('Found existing secret:')
    console.log(existing)
  }
}

run().catch(console.error)</code> secret.js Running our script <p>Let's run our script a first time, this will generate both a random seed for the DID and a random secret:</p> <code>node ./secret.js</code> <p>This will log the created seed, DID and created secret.</p><p>Now let's run the script again but providing the created seed as logged above:</p> <code>SEED=&lt;base16-encoded string&gt; node ./secret.js</code> <p>The script should log the same DID and decrypted secret.</p> Full script <p>Here is the full <code>secret.js</code> script for convenience, don't forget to change the <code>KEY</code> value with your own definition ID before running it:</p> <code>const { randomBytes } = require('crypto')
const Ceramic = require('@ceramicnetwork/http-client').default
const { IDX } = require('@ceramicstudio/idx')
const { Ed25519Provider } = require('key-did-provider-ed25519')
const { fromString, toString } = require('uint8arrays')

function getSeed() {
  let seed
  if (process.env.SEED) {
    seed = fromString(process.env.SEED, 'base16')
    console.log('Using provided seed')
  } else {
    seed = new Uint8Array(randomBytes(32))
    console.log(`Created seed: ${toString(seed, 'base16')}`)
  }
  return seed
}

async function getCeramic() {
  const ceramic = new Ceramic('http://localhost:7007')
  await ceramic.setDIDProvider(new Ed25519Provider(getSeed()))
  return ceramic
}

const KEY = 'kjzl6cwe1jw14adxazb6clhiiniffhkedz69mrkvi4i1miad62iwazktfiy8rgm'

async function uploadSecret(idx, payload) {
  const jwe = await idx.did.createJWE(payload, [idx.did.id])
  await idx.set(KEY, jwe)
}

async function downloadSecret(idx) {
  const jwe = await idx.get(KEY)
  return jwe ? await idx.did.decryptJWE(jwe) : null
}

async function run() {
  const ceramic = await getCeramic()
  const idx = new IDX({ ceramic })

  const existing = await downloadSecret(idx)
  if (existing == null) {
    const secret = new Uint8Array(randomBytes(32))

    console.log('Created secret:')
    console.log(secret)
  } else {
    console.log('Found existing secret:')
    console.log(existing)
  }
}

run().catch(console.error)</code> secret.js file Use case: Encrypted seeds <p>There are many exciting use cases for storing and retrieving encrypted secrets using IDX. Let's walk through a very important one – storing encrypted seeds.</p><p>Many decentralized systems rely on public key cryptography for performing authenticated transactions, such as signing and encrypting information. In these systems, a private key (seed) is used to sign a message which can then be validated against the corresponding public key (identifier) belonging to the user. Public key cryptography allows the decentralized system to verify that an interaction has originated from a given user without requiring the use of servers. Most of these types of systems require users to manage a dedicated seed for their system, which means that as users use more systems, they have and ever-growing list of keys to manage.</p><p>This model poses many challenges to users and application developers. Here are some common questions that arise when using decentralized technologies dependent on seeds for authenticated transactions: </p>  How should I securely store this seed to make sure only the intended user can access it?   How can an app or library check if an account (seed) has already been created for a given user?   How can my app make use of multiple decentralized technologies without requiring users to manage a different seed for each one?  <p>As we have demonstrated throughout this tutorial, storing encrypted seeds directly with users on IDX using their DID can solve all of these challenges. And as the number of decentralized systems that users will need to interact with is only increasing, the need to simplify secret management in a platform-agnostic way is becoming ever more valuable. </p> What's next? <p>The examples in this tutorial were intentionally kept simple but more complex schemas could be created, for example, to store public data along with encrypted secrets to support more specific use cases.</p><p>Learn more about IDX by visiting the <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX website</a> and <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs">documentation</a>.</p><p>If you need any help or just want to say hi, join the <a href="https://chat.idx.xyz">IDX Discord channel</a>!</p>

In late November, New York-based Plug Power <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/plug-power-raises-1b-for-u.s-green-hydrogen-infrastructure-buildout">raised more than $1B</a> for a U.S. green hydrogen infrastructure buildout, including an electrolyzer gigafactory. Airbus is <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/airbus-air-fp-bets-on-hydrogen-to-deliver-zero-emission-planes">betting on green hydrogen</a> to reduce aviation emissions. Even oil giant Saudi Arabia is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201112-the-green-hydrogen-revolution-in-renewable-energy">now making big plans</a> for green hydrogen.</p><p>Industry analysts are bullish on the potential for green gases because these products are expected to help decarbonize industry segments that are harder to electrify, such as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201127-how-hydrogen-fuel-could-decarbonise-shipping">shipping</a>, <a href="https://www.irena.org/publications/2017/Feb/Biofuels-for-aviation-Technology-brief">aviation</a>, and heavy industry. Case in point: <a href="https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/m1/en/reports/2020/the-dawn-of-green-hydrogen/the-dawn-of-green-hydrogen.pdf">PwC estimates</a> that green hydrogen will displace about 37% of pre-COVID-19 global oil production by 2050 and <a href="https://www.wri.org/publication/renewable-natural-gas">World Resources Institute research</a> suggests that biogas could replace 15% of all diesel consumed by heavy-duty trucks and buses in the&nbsp;U.S.</p><p>Like the green electricity sector before it, this rapidly growing industry will need to coalesce around an agreed-upon method for tracking and tracing green gases. We see two primary paths: 1) Follow precedent set by the renewable electricity space over the past 20 years to track and trace green attributes, or 2) Leapfrog legacy methods by jumping straight to a global, open-source, digital-first architecture for green gases—unlocking significant business and carbon value along the&nbsp;way.</p> A familiar challenge from renewable electricity markets: tracking green attributes <p>Similar to global markets for renewably-generated electricity — which includes a variety of energy attribute certificates (EACs for short), such as guarantees of origin in Europe, renewable energy certificates in the United States, and international renewables energy certificates (I-RECs) in 35+ developing countries — green hydrogen and sustainable biogas markets will ultimately require an agreed-upon accounting system to prove just how low-carbon each unit of green gas&nbsp;is.</p><p>Like renewable electrons joining the generic generation mix of a power grid, green gases become ‘invisible’ once they flow — metaphorically and literally — into the fuel mix. Renewable electricity markets and green gas markets both face the challenge of retaining specialized, differentiated information in what used to be pure commodity markets. EACs provide a critical instrument for tagging the environmental attributes of these specialized products, distinguishing them from non-renewable electricity and hydrocarbon fuel sources, and tracking progress toward policy targets and voluntary sustainability goals&nbsp;alike.</p><p>In practice, EACs operate as a de facto voluntary market subsidy because companies must obtain and claim EACs to prove the impacts of their renewable electricity and green gas procurement. So, for example, companies like Airbus will depend on green gas EACs to prove the sustainable attributes of their fuel use in a credible&nbsp;way.</p> The green gas conundrum: copy proven yet imperfect renewable electricity markets or chart a leapfrog path to pure digitalization <p>Putting aside the various open questions around EAC market design, standards, and regulations specifically for green gases, there are two main routes available for implementing and managing green gas EAC&nbsp;markets:</p>  Copy the combined use of closed, siloed, legacy business and software processes from existing EAC markets, where: each EAC issuing body operates a national EAC registry that most of the time is not interoperable with other markets or countries; market participants go through registration and issuance processes that are at times manual and cumbersome; and where third-party companies facilitate trades between EAC buyers and sellers and update EAC issuer systems based on completed trades.  Take a fully integrated, digital-first approach from the outset, where: all green gas facilities, registries, and marketplaces share an open-source, underlying digital infrastructure to unlock seamless integrations with any current or future regulatory standard — enabling direct green gas EAC trading, greater market transparency, and reduced administrative costs.  <p>Given <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/digitalisation-and-energy">vast digitization efforts and growing digitization investments under way</a> across the energy sector, we at Energy Web encourage market participants to prioritize a digital-first approach during this nascent time for green gas markets. We believe such an approach will help green gas markets avoid repeating the pain points of renewable electricity markets and better meet <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/the-next-era-of-corporate-renewables-procurement-is-here-1d98dd123b8b">clean energy buyers’ needs</a> from day&nbsp;one.</p> How an open-source, open-architecture tech stack could support green gas&nbsp;markets <p>To develop digital solutions for green gases, market participants can take advantage of multiple collaborative technology development efforts already under way. Using open-source standards and technologies such as <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/middleware/did-explainer/">decentralized identifiers</a> paired with blockchain technology, we can deploy an interoperable digital infrastructure that makes it possible for any trusted asset (e.g., an electrolyzer or fuel refinery), customer, and organization (e.g., regulatory bodies) to seamlessly participate in the market for green&nbsp;gases.</p><p>In the case of green gases, such an approach leapfrogs digital solutions by:</p>  Simplifying the registration and identity management process of green gas facilities and market participants through the use of decentralized identifiers that make it easier to track and find key details about green gas facilities;  Streamlining verified green gas production tracking, trading, and environmental reporting by digitizing each part of green gas EAC issuance, trading, and cancellation lifecycle with robust, accessible audit trails (for an example, various applications in the electricity sector use this approach via the open-source <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-origin/">Origin</a> toolkit); and  Enabling a global market for green gas procurement through emerging renewables buyers tools like <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero</a>, where green gas sellers can directly post EAC supplies and sell directly to&nbsp;buyers.  <p>For a deeper dive into Energy Web’s perspective on the role of digitization and decentralized technologies in green gas markets, please review our contribution to the recently published <a href="https://www.regatrace.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/REGATRACE-D2.4.pdf">investigative Renewable Gas Trade Centre in Europe (REGATRACE) study</a> of IT system options for EU green gas&nbsp;markets.</p><p>On our side, Energy Web is hosting conversations with market participants, including various Energy Web Members, to clarify what features should be added to our technology roadmap in order to address the technical and business requirements of digitized green gas solutions.

 Abstract 

<p>XDI (XRI Data Interchange) is a new service for generalized distributed data sharing and mediation using XRIs (Extensible Resource Identifiers), a URI-compatible abstract identifier scheme developed by the OASIS XRI Technical Committee. The goal of XDI is to enable data from any data source to be identified, exchanged, linked, and synchronized into a machine-readable dataweb using XML documents just as content from any content source can linked into the human-readable Web using HTML documents today. Because the controls needed to mediate access and usage of shared data can be built right into every XDI link, the emergence of a global Dataweb has the potential to do for trusted data interchange what the Web did for open content exchange.</p>

<p>This white paper presents several examples of classic cross-domain data sharing problems, explains how the Dataweb model can provide a generalized solution, and describes the key objectives of the newly formed OASIS XDI Technical Committee <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xdi">http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xdi</a>.</p>

 INTRODUCTION 

<blockquote><p>
"I would not give a fig for the simplicity this side of complexity, but I would give my life for the simplicity on the other side of complexity."<br>
-- Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Web has dramatically simplified information access. Never in history has content been so readily available or richly linked. Furthermore, this model for distributed systems has become so compelling that the next wave has already broken: Web services—the promise of distributed applications talking to each other in XML and SOAP as easily as Web browsers and servers talk in HTML and HTTP.</p>

<p>Yet with cross-domain applications comes another complex problem: the need to share instances of the same data across multiple domains, directories, databases, and applications. There are many facets to this challenge: identification, authentication, authorization, mediation, and synchronization; all problems that were minimized on the Web because it dealt primarily with presentation of data rather than interchange of data.</p>

<p>Recently a new approach to this set of needs has emerged called the Dataweb. The Dataweb combines the key principles of Web architecture with core concepts from Web services and the Semantic Web into a solution that can be “the simplicity on the other side of complexity” for distributed data sharing.</p>

<p>This white paper presents several common distributed data sharing challenges and then explains how the Dataweb model can be applied to solve them. It then provides more details about how the Dataweb model builds on principles of Web, Web Services, and Semantic Web architectures. It closes by summarizing the mission of the OASIS XDI Technical Committee.</p>

 THREE EXAMPLES OF DISTRIBUTED DATA SHARING CHALLENGES 

<p>When talking about generalized solutions, it can be very helpful to have concrete examples of the problems they address. This section presents three examples of well-known distributed data sharing challenges that have a daily impact on personal, business, or community productivity.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 ELECTRONIC BUSINESS CARDS AND DYNAMIC ADDRESS BOOKS 

<p>One of the oldest rituals in business is the exchange of business cards when forming new relationships. One of the second oldest rituals in business is trying to update this information across your entire contact network when it changes. It is a fact of business life: people move, companies reorganize, and relationships change.</p>

<p>So it was inevitable that the rise of the Internet would spur the development of electronic business cards and “dynamic” address books—address books that accept new contacts and updates to contact data automatically, much the way Internet email servers send and receive messages automatically. In the last decade there have been no less than a dozen attempts to start Internet business card sharing networks. From PlanetAll to Plaxo, each of these has introduced a new system for exchanging and updating electronic business cards. And each has faced the same fundamental problem; like Internet email, they need to become nearly ubiquitous before their full value can be realized.</p>

<p>Typically this means standardization, and numerous efforts have tried to standardize contact data representation and interchange formats. An entire industry consortium, Versit, came together to create the vCard, a set of IETF RFCs now managed by the Internet Mail Consortium<a>^1</a>. More recently, the OASIS Customer Information Quality (CIQ) Technical Committee has been working since 2000 to develop XML vocabulary for describing customer and contact data.<a>^2</a></p>

<p>However many business card sharing networks use these open formats, so agreement on a data
representation format has not been the gating factor for their success. Rather the challenge is to make electronic business cards dynamic—self-updating across the network. Doing this interoperably means addressing three additional dimensions of complexity:</p>

 
   Agreement to a standard data interchange protocol, so that dynamic address book clients and servers can all talk to each other the same way Web browsers and servers talk to each other in HTTP. 
   Agreement to a common data synchronization model for sending updates to shared contact data, similar to that which SyncML provides for mobile devices. 
   Agreement to a common trust model for cross-domain authentication and authorization so dynamic address book servers can propagate updates across trust domains. 
 

<p>With this Rubik’s cube of interoperability challenges, is it any wonder that the problem of global business card sharing has not been solved?</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 CALENDAR SHARING 

<p>Business card exchange generally happens only at the initiation of new relationships, or when contact data is updated. But coordination of events between the contacts is ongoing throughout the lifetime of a relationship and happens across all spheres of activity—work, home, school, friends, etc. Therefore any Internet-based solution to calendar sharing must be cross-domain just like Internet email and the Web.</p>

<p>On the dimension of data representation, calendar sharing is easier that business card sharing. The element of time is common to all applications and networks, and a great deal of value can be provided even with the most limited event description vocabulary (e.g., Subject, Location, Start Time, End Time, etc.) Many standard formats have been developed to express this data, including the Versit complement to vCard called vCal<a>^3</a> and Microsoft’s format for sharing of calendaring data from MS Outlook.<a>^4</a></p>

<p>However even if data representation for shared calendaring is easier, the other three dimensions of dynamic data sharing requirements are not. To interoperate on the same scale as Internet email or the Web, calendar servers need an interoperable data interchange protocol, an interoperable and scalable synchronization model, and an interoperable trust model for protecting access to shared calendar data.</p>

<p>This last dimension is particularly crucial. Mere knowledge that a meeting or phone call is taking place between certain participants can be highly sensitive information. This aspect of calendar sharing intersects one of the hottest issues in the wireless industry: presence and availability management (PAM).<a>^5</a> Allowing one wireless user to instantly check the location and/or availability of another wireless customer is one of the most promising new features of wireless data networks. Yet it comes with an equally vexing problem: how to control the privacy and security of this data. Users must be confident they have complete authorization and access control over sharing of PAM data or they will turn this feature off altogether.</p>

<p>Therefore an interoperable trust model may emerge as the pre-eminent requirement for calendar sharing and PAM. However if this hurdle can be overcome, the payoff in personal and business productivity is enormous. The labor savings for administrators and participants in countless daily calls, meetings, conferences, and other events would be on the order of the labor savings that Internet email brought to
message delivery or the Web brought to information retrieval.</p>

 TRUSTED SEARCH 

<p>Internet search services like Google, Yahoo, and MSN are tremendous utilities for finding information. However they all suffer one universal limitation—they are limited to public data, the data that can be retrieved by automated robots from the public Web. Although these same technologies can be implemented within private networks to build private search indexes that are only searchable by authenticated users of each network, this effectively divides the universe of information into one very large public library and many very small private libraries and nothing in between.</p>

<p>This is not, of course, how access to protected information works in the real world. Some of the most valuable information comes through trusted data sharing networks that span multiple personal or business communities. Asking your network of friends for a local car mechanic they recommend, or contacting your school for the phone number of an old classmate, or searching a network of business partners for contacts to a prospective customer, are well-established patterns of trusted information sharing.</p>

<p>Precisely because such information is so valuable, some distributed communities of interest are now seeking to apply Web search technologies across their networks. Global organizations such as the Impact Alliance<a>^6</a> , the Interfaith Community Network<a>^7</a> , and the international law enforcement community<a>^8</a> want to enable searching for high-value non-public information across the network of individuals, groups, or enterprises with which they have the necessary trust relationships. In doing so they face major obstacles with currently available technologies. Specifically:</p>

 
   How can the identity of a user in one community be shared across the other communities in the network? 
   How can users control the availability of their personal profile or relationship data for searches by other communities, or by specific subgroups of a community? 
   How can trust relationships between members of a community, or between communities, be formed quickly and easily? 
   How can data sharing permissions be managed dynamically by all members of the network? 
   How can new and updated information propagate to all interested parties without being mistaken for spam? 
 

<p>Again these issues illustrate that distributed data sharing is much more than just a technology problem. The fourth dimension of this challenge—the need for an interoperable trust model—is primarily an issue of being able to quickly and easily map real-world trust relationships onto the network.</p>

 HOW THE DATAWEB PROVIDES A GENERALIZED SOLUTION 

<p>None of the distributed data sharing problems described above are new; they are simply growing more apparent with the advent of Web services. Yet Web services alone do not appear to offer a solution. For example, even if the members of a major standards body could agree on Web service definitions for a dynamic address book service, a calendar sharing service, or a trusted search service, how would it be adopted? Would every service provider need to implement each of these Web services separately? How would each of these Web services share data between each other? What would happen if there were competing Web service definitions from different standards bodies?</p>

<p>These questions highlight the fact that distributed data sharing is a generalized problem. Certain types of data (e.g., contact data, profile data, ontology data) need be shared almost universally across domains and applications. In this context, one of the core tenets of Tim Berners-Lee’s original design for the Web stands out: it was not specific to any particular type of content, application, or usage domain. Rather it was a simple, generalized model for sharing and linking documents over the Internet that could be used
for any type of content by any type of author in any information-sharing context.</p>

<p>In short, the Web was the “simplicity on the other side of complexity” for cross-domain sharing and linking of content. It solved the general problem by providing three simple standards for:</p>

 
   Globally identifying documents (URIs). 
   Representing and linking documents (HTML). 
   Exchanging documents (HTTP). 
 

<p>The Dataweb applies this same approach to distributed data sharing. The Dataweb model proposes to solve the general problem by providing three simple standards for:</p>

 
   Globally identifying data and data authorities using XRIs (Extensible Resource Identifiers), a new URI-compatible scheme developed by the OASIS XRI TC for abstract identifiers that are independent of a specific location, application, directory, or domain. 
   Representing and linking data using the XDI meta-schema, a simple XML schema that uses XRIs to identify, describe, and link distributed data in a domain-independent format called an XDI document. 
   Exchanging data using XDI service, a generalized service for sharing and synchronizing XDI documents with bindings to HTTP, SOAP, SMTP, and other transport protocols. 
 

<p>There is also a fourth element to Dataweb architecture does not have a direct corollary in today’s Web. This is the element that addresses the most challenging “fourth dimension” of cross-domain data sharing described above: human trust relationships. This element is called XDI link contracts, and to understand them, we must delve a little deeper into the structure of the Dataweb.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 DATAWEB LINKS: PIPES VS. STRINGS 

<p>Web and Dataweb architectures are so similar that the primary difference lies in one feature: while Web links can only be one-way "strings" between HTML resource representations, Dataweb links can also be two-way active "pipes" between XML resource representations. This is illustrated graphically in Figure 1:</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p>Figure 1: Web “strings” vs. Dataweb “pipes”.</p>

<p>How exactly is a Dataweb pipe different from a Web string?</p>

 
   Two-way data flow. A Web string (URI link) can only "pull" linked resources. By contrast, a Dataweb pipe can both pull and push data in either direction. 
   Persistence. A Web string is either working (it retrieves a resource) or broken (it produces an error). By contrast, Dataweb pipes can use persistent XRIs that allow the link to re-establish itself even if the target resource moves, changes its name, or changes owners. 
   Data control. Access to a Web resource is either public (uncontrolled) or private (credential-protected). By contrast every Dataweb pipe can have a "valve" on each end^an XDI link contract^that allows comprehensive, fine-grained control over all data flowing through the pipe.<a>^9</a> 
 

<p>(<a>^</a>9) Note that XDI link contracts are not required on every Dataweb link—they are only needed when it is necessary to control the flow or caching of shared data.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 DATAWEB LINK CONTRACTS: DATA FLOW CONTROL VALVES 

<p>This last feature of Dataweb links is critical to building Dataweb trust relationships. On the Web, links are "one-dimensional", i.e., they use the HTML "A" (anchor) tag to specify a single URI for a target resource. On the Dataweb, links can be full three-dimensional resources, i.e., active XDI documents that reference other XDI documents just like a real-world contract might reference items of real property.</p>

<p>This three-dimensional approach to Dataweb links can provide:</p>

 
   Active identification. A Dataweb link can contain any number of XRIs for the target resource (different XRI synonyms can be used for different identification, resolution, and data protection purposes—see below). And these XRIs can change as the target resource's context evolves. 
   Active data interchange control. A Dataweb link contract can describe the controls on all facets of the data interchange relationship between the source and target resources (see below.) 
   Active data caching. Due to the simple structure of the XDI meta-schema, a Dataweb link can optionally cache linked data just by "cutting-and-pasting" XDI documents. 
 

<p>What types of controls can XDI link contracts define? Any policy necessary to mediate a data interchange relationship. They are as flexible and extensible as real world contracts (e.g., non-disclosure agreements).</p>

<p>For example, link contracts can mediate:</p>

 
   Authentication. How are communications with the target resource authenticated? If XML digital signatures are to be used, where is the public key certificate? 
   Authorization. What privileges to which resources is the target resource granted? 
   Access control. What access permissions are granted to what data? 
   Privacy and usage control. For what purposes and under what policies can this data be used? 
   Distribution and forwarding control. To whom can this data be redistributed and for what purposes? 
   Synchronization. How will the link cache be updated if data changes in the target resource? 
   Termination. What will happen to the data when the data sharing relationship is ended? 
 

<p>Furthermore, since link contracts are themselves XDI documents, they can (like real-world contracts) govern their own revision, amendment, and deletion.</p>

<p>In sum, Dataweb link contracts permit fully distributed peer-to-peer data mediation the same way Web links permits fully distributed peer-to-peer content access. They are a solution that models (and scales to) the real world of data sharing.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 DATAWEB ADDRESSING: XRIS AND XRI SYNONYMS 

<p>After link contracts, the second most important contrast between the Web and the Dataweb is addressing.</p>

<p>Both architectures have the same fundamental premise: 100% addressability of every resource. However on the Dataweb this applies to every single item of data, down to the smallest individual attribute.</p>

<p>This is an example of how the addressing requirements for Internet-scale data sharing are more stringent than for content sharing. These requirements are covered in detail in XRI Requirements and Glossary 1.0,<a>^10</a> published by the OASIS XRI TC.<a>^11</a> A brief summary is provided in Table 1:</p>


  
    Requirement
    Web (HTTP URIs)
    Dataweb Addressing (XRIs)
  
  
    Persistence
    No standard solution for addresses that do not break when a resource moves or changes names (the Web equivalent of a database global foreign key).
    Must support both persistent and reassignable identifiers at any level.
  
  
    Unlimited delegation &amp; federation
    Supports delegation only in DNS names (e.g., the first segment of an HTTP URI —"www.example.com").
    Must support delegation of both persistent and non-persistent identifiers to any depth.
  
  
    Global contexts
    DNS top-level domains provide limited global context for an identifier. (Exceptions are restricted TLDs like ".name" for individuals and “.pro” for professionals.)
    Must support four global contexts ^ personal, organizational, general, and special.
  
  
    Cross-references
    URIs cannot be nested in other URIs to permit sharing of identifiers across domains.
    Must allow XRIs (and URIs) to be nested within XRIs to any depth.
  
  
    Self-references
    No syntax for referring to "the concept represented by an identifier" rather than an actual resource to which the identifier resolves.
    Must provide standard syntax for self-references.
  
  
    Internationalization
    Partially internationalized. IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers) in progress.
    Must be fully IRI compliant.
  
  
    Extensibility
    Extensible through new URI schemes and resolution protocols.
    Must be extensible within the XRI scheme and resolution protocol.
  

<p>Table 1: The requirements for Dataweb addressing.</p>

<p>In addition to the new capabilities of XRI syntax, XDI also supports XRI synonyms. An XRI synonym is established whenever two or more XRIs—regardless of their syntactic equivalence—are asserted in an XDI document to represent the same resource. XRI synonyms are the way XDI can maintain both human-friendly reassignable XRIs (e-names) and machine-friendly persistent XRIs (e-numbers) for the same resource at any scope—global, local, or relative. So a resource can have both multiple e-names (e.g., in different languages) and multiple e-numbers (e.g., for different data sharing and privacy contexts)—all managed automatically by how the XRIs are assigned and shared using XDI link contracts.</p>

<p>In short, XRI addressing is how XDI can solve one of the most challenging problems in enterprise application integration (EAI): mapping and translating data between domains. With XDI you can finally, "Map once, link everywhere".</p>

 DATAWEB REPRESENTATION: THE XDI META-SCHEMA 

<p>HTML was a breakthrough in network hypertext because it provided a simple, application-, domain-, and language-independent format for content representation. Without it, the Web could never have achieved ubiquity. To emulate this vital feature, the Dataweb must do the same for data representation in XML.</p>

<p>On the surface this would appear to be an immense challenge due to the enormous variety of existing XML schemas and schema languages. However the purpose of the XDI meta-schema is quite the opposite: to provide a simple, universal, “schema-neutral” format for exchanging, linking, and synchronizing other XML-encoded data (or references to other URI-addressable data). In essence, XDI is an XML "wrapper" or “descriptor” for instances of XML defined in any schema language.</p>

<p>Thus the proposed XDI meta-schema (see Appendix A) has only four XML elements (and no XML attributes) as shown in the UML relationship diagram in Figure 2:</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p>Figure 2: UML model of the XDI meta-schema.</p>

 
   Resource elements represent the authoritative copy of any XRI-identified resource. They must contain at least one XRI, but can contain any number of additional XRI synonyms. They contain only one data element, but they can contain any number of link elements, and can recursively contain other resource elements. As containers, resource elements express UML composition relationships, i.e., “ownership” of the contained resource. 
   Link elements represent a “proxy” of a resource element, i.e., a non-authoritative cached copy (partial or complete) of the original resource element. Link elements express UML aggregation relationships, i.e., “membership” rather than “ownership”. Like resources, a link must always have at least one XRI associating the resource it represents, but it can have any number of additional XRI synonyms, all of which also identify the linked resource. This is the key to building dynamic XDI data maps. 
   XRI elements represent UML association relationships. They can contain only valid XRI values (which include all valid URIs, since XRIs are a superset of URIs). 
   Data elements are the "primitives" of XDI—the edge nodes of the XDI graph. They carry the actual data payload—anything from a literal XML character string to an entire XML document. The data element uses the XML Schema "Any" content model so it can contain any well-formed XML. 
 

<p>Like HTML, the purpose of the XDI schema is to reach "the simplicity on the other side of complexity" for distributed data sharing. Despite its simple structure, the expressive power of XRIs allows instances of the XDI meta-schema to identify, exchange, link, and synchronize any XML-encoded or URI-referenceable data between any two locations or applications on the Internet.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 DATAWEB SERVICES: THE XDI SERVICE DEFINITION 

<p>Of all the components of Dataweb architecture, the one that most resembles its Web ancestry is the proposed XDI service definition. Although defined abstractly using WSDL, it is proposed to consist of the same four basic operations as HTTP:<a>^12</a></p>

 
   GET is the same universal workhorse as in HTTP, i.e., it retrieves an XDI document using an XRI. 
   SET is the equivalent of HTTP PUT, and is used to write XDI documents. 
   DELETE is identical to HTTP and is used to delete XDI documents. 
   POST serves the function of invoking any XRI-identified operation upon the posted XDI document and optionally receiving an XDI document in response. 
 

<p>The advantage of defining XDI service abstractly in WSDL is that it can be bound to any transport protocol. So even though XDI can be used "natively" over HTTP, it is equally at home using the full XML enveloping and messaging capabilities of SOAP. XDI can also be bound to SMTP/MIME as a simple way to extend structured data interchange to Internet email.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 APPLYING THE DATAWEB MODEL 

<p>Having described the Dataweb model, now let’s illustrate how it can be applied to our three distributed data sharing problems.</p>

 BUSINESS CARD SHARING USING THE DATAWEB 

<p>The first challenge is to share and link electronic business cards between dynamic address books—and do so in a way that is interoperable across domains like Internet email and the Web. As explained above, the Dataweb approach to this problem is just like the Web. Specifically, once Web servers and browsers were available, all an author had to do to begin sharing information over the Web was:</p>

 
   Obtain a Web address (if the author didn’t already have one); 
   Put up a Web site with the content (HTML pages) the author desires to publish; and 
   Start publishing the Web addresses (URIs) of these pages. 
 

<p>To begin sharing and linking data such as a business card over the Dataweb, the process is nearly identical, with the addition of one more step:</p>

 
   Obtain an Dataweb address (if the author doesn’t already have one<a>^13</a> ); 
   Put up a Dataweb site with the data (XDI documents) the author wants to share; 
   Create the Dataweb link contracts describing the terms under which this data may be shared; and 
   Start publishing the Dataweb addresses (XRIs) of these link contracts. 
 

<p>Note these last two steps: on the Dataweb, controlled resources are never addressed directly. They are always addressed through the link contract that establishes the data sharing relationship between the publisher and any subscriber. (This is sometimes called the “rights path”.)</p>

<p>Let’s illustrate this in the context of a business card sharing relationship. Say Alice and Bob want to begin sharing XDI business cards, and both of them have XRIs for their home pages at an XDI service provider. From a Dataweb perspective an XDI business card is simply an XDI document containing instances of contact data.<a>^14</a> And a dynamic address book is simply a Dataweb site (or a branch of a site) devoted to sharing and linking XDI business cards.</p>

<p>Alice and Bob can each use a Dataweb editor<a>^15</a> to create an XDI business card containing the contact data they would like to share. This is published to their respective Dataweb sites as shown in Figure 3.</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p>Figure 3: Two Dataweb sites containing electronic business cards as XDI documents.</p>

<p>Alice must next choose a “template” link contract for sharing business cards. Typically this will be similar to a real-world contract template—a standard form with different customization options.<a>^16</a> For example, it may let Alice set a default permission to permit contacts to forward her XDI business card directly to others (“introduction permission”), vs. needing Alice’s permission first. In any case, when Alice is finished customizing this template, she publishes it to her Dataweb site as shown in Figure 4.</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p>Figure 4: Alice adds a link contract for sharing her business card.</p>

<p>To share this business card with Bob, Alice sends him the XRI for the link contract. This is where XDI service comes into play. When Bob clicks this link, Alice’s XDI service provider asks Bob for the XRI of his own XDI home page. After authenticating Bob with his XDI service provider, Alice’s XDI service provider sends him Alice’s link contract. Providing Bob agrees, Bob’s XDI service provider returns a signed version of the contract<a>^17</a> and keeps a copy for Bob. Finally Alice’s service provider returns a copy of Alice’s business card to be cached by Bob’s site, as shown in Figure 5.</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p>Figure 5: Both sites have a copy of the signed contract and Bob’s site has a cached copy of Alice’s business card.</p>

<p>Providing Alice has a persistent XRI, Alice and Bob have just created a lifetime link—one that won’t break no matter how many times Alice moves, changes jobs, or even changes XDI service providers. And if Alice’s contract includes data synchronization permission, updates to Alice’s contact data will automatically flow across to Bob’s site (via an XDI update message sent from Alice’s XDI service provider to Bob’s XDI service provider).</p>

<p>Bob can share his XDI business card with Alice the same way. This mirrors the exchange of XDI documents shown in Figure 5, and sets up a second “pipe” between their two Dataweb sites to keep Bob’s business card synchronized with Alice’s cache.</p>

<p>The advantage of this model for business card sharing is that, like the Web, it is the same for all Dataweb relationships—person-to-person, person-to-business, business-to-business. The types of data and the terms of the link contract may vary, however for most common types of data sharing transactions (like business cards), the link contract is likely to be very simple and standardized.</p>

<p>This model extends within a user or organization’s internal Dataweb as well. For instance, rather than look up Alice’s phone number online at his XDI service provider, where Bob really needs this data is directly on his laptop and cell phone. If these devices included an XDI dynamic address books linked to Bob’s XDI service provider, any updates to Alice’s business card would automatically flow right down to his local devices. In essence, they become local caches of a selected portion of Bob’s online Dataweb site.</p>

 CALENDAR SHARING USING THE DATAWEB 

<p>An appointment is just another group of shared data, so from a Dataweb standpoint every appointment is simply a new XDI document that needs to be shared among all attendees. Assuming this is controlled data, however, this first requires that attendees have a contract covering this type of data. Such a contract may include options such as, “Can this contact automatically schedule an appointment on my calendar? Can they move an appointment? Can they see an appointment that they have not created?”</p>

<p>Many XDI business card sharing contracts are also likely to include calendaring sharing. Let’s say this is the case with Alice’s contract with Bob, and now Bob wants to schedule a meeting with Alice. Bob could create a new XDI appointment and “invite” Alice by linking it to her contract, as shown in Figure 6.</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p></p>Figure 6: Bob creates a proposed appointment linked to Alice.<p></p>

<p>Bob’s XDI service provider then sends the XDI appointment document to Alice’s XDI service provider. Assuming Alice handles appointment requests locally, Alice’s service provider would deliver the message to her preferred device (such as her laptop or cell phone), which would notify her as she desires (such as using an HTML email or SMS message). As with most calendar sharing systems, Alice can now accept, decline, or modify the request. If she accepts it, the result would look like Figure 7 (except that this appointment would also be cached locally on her laptop or cell phone, not shown.)</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p></p>Figure 7: Alice accepts the appointment and it is confirmed on Bob’s site.<p></p>

<p>Of course the real productivity payoff is realized when conflicts arise and either Bob or Alice needs to move the appointment. Assuming both have permission, either could modify it, and the other will receive the proposed change automatically. Negotiation over conflicts and proposing alternative times can also be automated to the extent that Bob and Alice’s respective XDI calendaring applications support this.</p>

<p>None of this is new functionality—these features are staples of workgroup calendaring systems. The breakthrough is reaching a platform- and domain-independent solution that can make Internet calendar sharing as widely available as Internet email and the Web.</p>

<p>(<a>^</a>17) This could be using an XML digital signature, or whatever other means of verification is acceptable to Alice.</p>

 TRUSTED SEARCH USING THE DATAWEB 

<p>The third distributed data sharing challenge was being able to do searches across private sites—data that is not available publicly, but that could be very valuable if searchable across a federated trust community.</p>

<p>Today’s Internet search engines compile their indexes using automated “spiders”, programs that crawl Web sites and follow the links to discover new content.<a>^18</a> Dataweb search engines will work the same way, only spiders will also crawl link contracts. In other words, on the Dataweb, data is indexed only by permission, and this permission is provided to spiders the same way it is provided to any other party,
using link contracts. In turn, Dataweb search engines will control access to these indexes by authenticating search requests with the governing community.

</p><p>To illustrate, let’s say Alice and Bob are both members of a scientific association that offers the benefit of searching across portions of member’s private profile data (for example, their plans to do future research in a specific area.) Offering this feature today would require building a special search site to index the data, creating user accounts on this site for all participating members, and requiring members to login to this site to perform trusted searches.</p>

<p>The Dataweb solution requires only that all participating members share a common link contract. This governs not only what data is searchable under what terms, but also provides each member with permission to conduct searches across the linked data. No special sites, no separate accounts, no
additional passwords. Furthermore the system can grow and evolve simply by making changes to this common contract, for example, by adding new types of data.</p>

<p>Whats more, trust communities can be now be federated by linking their contracts. So if Alice’s and Bob’s scientific association were to form an alliance with another scientific association, and the two communities wanted to offer trusted search across their combined membership, this could be accomplished simply by creating a new contract that links their respective member search contracts.<a>^19</a> Now a trusted search request from a member of either association would automatically be authenticated against both search indexes.</p>

<p>(<a>^</a>18) Google also pioneered the use of link metadata to optimize the resulting indexes.<br>
(<a>^</a>19) This contract could also establish the XRI synonym mapping if the two communities were using different XDI datatypes.</p>

 HOW THE DATAWEB BUILDS ON WEB SERVICES 

<p>Although the XDI data model is rooted in Web architecture, and its WSDL definition can be bound to other transport protocols besides SOAP, XDI is ideal as a Web service because it adheres to the classic tenets of Web services architecture: domain-independent application-to-application XML messaging using XML schema definitions, WSDL service definitions, and SOAP envelopes.</p>

<p>Thus XDI/SOAP is fully compatible with all emerging Web services standards including WS-Security, WS-Federation, WS-Inspection, WS-Routing, and WS-Reliable Messaging. So where does XDI fit with other Web services?</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 A GENERALIZED DATA SHARING SERVICE 

<p>In a world of domain-specific Web services, the role of XDI is as a utility service—a generalized Web service that can be employed by other Web services to handle common data sharing transactions. For example, say a heavy equipment manufacturer offers a suite of Web services for generating orders, accepting invoices, and monitoring inventory from its supply chain. This suite uses a set of XML schemas and WSDL service definitions customized for the manufacturer's product line and accounting systems.</p>

<p>If this manufacturer wanted to add a new supplier and its sales representatives to its supply chain, the manufacturer could offer another special Web service for accepting this supplier's account data into the manufacturer's CRM. Alternatively the CRM vendor could offer a pre-packaged Web service for doing this same task. But in either case the supplier would have to implement another Web service client for communicating this account provisioning data. If the supplier serves 25 manufacturers, this could mean implementing 25 different account-provisioning clients all for the same standard data.</p>

<p>This would become much simpler and less costly if all parties to this supply chain used a generalized data sharing service such as XDI. Then one set of XDI transactions could transfer, link, and permanently synchronize all the account data. XDI could also be used to "bootstrap" the other specialized Web services by transferring the XSD and WSDL files (encapsulated as XDI documents) necessary to configure the supplier's Web service clients. Now the manufacturer's and supplier's respective systems would be ready to begin automated data interchange at a fraction of the time and expense.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 A DISTRIBUTED DATA MEDIATION SERVICE 

<p>A standardized data interchange service not only simplifies the creation of a new relationship, it also automates many standard relationship maintenance tasks. For example, if the manufacturer and supplier described above used XDI to link their shared data, then changes in either of their configurations—prices, contracts, sales representatives, XSD files, WSDL files—could flow automatically from one's XDI servers to the other's using the mediation of XDI link contracts without any custom programming or specialized administration.</p>

<p>XDI is also a very efficient way of applying SAML<a>^20</a> authentication and authorization assertions, because in XDI every policy decision point is identified by the XRI for the authoritative link contract. And shared access control policies described in a language like XACML<a>^21</a> could be implemented within or across organizations—even throughout the manufacturer's entire supply chain—by using shared XRIs to the same XDI link contract.</p>

<p>Lastly, this is a context in which persistent XRIs—XRIs that will not change for the lifetime of a relationship—provide significant benefits. For example, suppose the supplier underwent a major reorganization of its sales force, or was bought by another vendor and changed its name. The use of persistent XRIs means all the XDI links and contracts between the supplier and manufacturer will remain intact even when the DNS names changed. Furthermore, XDI synchronization would allow changes to attributes such as titles, roles, and contact data to automatically flow between the XDI systems.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 XDI FORMS 

<p>The scenarios above raise the question of how XDI is customized for specific types of data interchange. For example, different XDI data sets are needed to provision the supplier's accounts for a heavy equipment manufacturer vs. an airplane manufacturer vs. a plastics manufacturer. How does each manufacturer request just the specific data needed by their CRM system from the supplier's XDI service?</p>

<p>The Dataweb answer is identical to the Web answer: forms. Just as a Web server can request customized data from a Web browser using an HTML form, an XDI client or server can request instances of specific XDI datatypes from another XDI service using an XDI form. The key difference between HTML and XDI forms is that the latter are XDI documents designed for fully automated machine processing. In other words, an XDI form uses machine-readable:</p>

 
   Datatypes. Instead of human-readable field labels, XDI forms use XRIs to identify the XDI datatype instances being requested (including XRI synonyms for domain-independent type mapping). 
   Link contracts. XDI forms can specify one or more XRIs for the proposed link contract(s) governing the requested data. 
   Credentials. The link contracts can also include one or more XRI-addressable authentication credentials, which themselves include XRIs for the issuing XDI authorities for verification. 
 

<p>XDI forms can also be chained together to provide workflow and multi-party data sharing transactions. In short, they are the mechanism that enables XDI to serve as a generalized solution to sharing many different types of data under many different contract terms and trust models.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 HOW THE DATAWEB BUILDS ON THE SEMANTIC WEB 

<p>The foundation of the Semantic Web—the W3C's term for a Web of machine-readable and understandable resources as opposed to human-readable content—is RDF (Resource Description Framework). RDF is an abstract model and XML syntax for expressing metadata about any URI-identified resource, from a Web page to a file to a media stream. The goal of RDF is to provide a common format for machine-understandable metadata that can be processed by any RDF-aware application.</p>

<p>Just as XDI can integrate directly with other Web services because it can be a Web service itself, XDI can integrate directly with RDF because:</p>


 
   Every XDI resource is URI-addressable,<a>^22</a> so it can be described using RDF. 
   Every RDF graph can be serialized in RDF/XML, so the resulting XML document is a resource that can be identified, exchanged, linked, and synchronized using XDI. 
 

<p>However, since both XDI and RDF represent graphs of relationships between resources, they can interoperate at an even deeper level.</p>

<p>(<a>^</a>22) Every XDI resource is XRI-addressable, and every XRI can be transformed into valid URI.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 RDF GRAPHS AND XDI GRAPHS 

<p>RDF represents all relationships using tuples—three part statements consisting of a subject, predicate, and object.<a>^23</a> For example: a book (subject) has a rating (predicate) of "four stars" (object). The descriptive power of RDF derives from the fact that any value of any property of any resource can be described using this basic construct.</p>

<p>RDF statements can also be nested, i.e., one statement can describe another. For example, you can have an RDF statement describing who said that a book has a rating of four stars. But since RDF syntax is based on tuples, doing this actually requires four tuples (a tuple for the new statement, and three tuples describing the new statement's relationship to the subject, predicate, and object of the first statement.) Known as reification, this is one of the most complex topics in RDF.<a>^24</a></p>

<p>Since distributed data sharing depends heavily on describing nested data relationships, the XDI meta-schema takes a slightly different approach. As described above, it models data from the "inside out", i.e., by starting with a Data element for containing atomic data values and then using three elements to model the three types of UML relationships in which a Data element can participate:</p>

 
   XRI elements model association relationships. The value of the XRI identifies the associated resource. 
   Resource elements model composition relationships. Resources can be nested to any depth. 
   Link elements model aggregation relationships. Links can be nested to any depth. 
 

<p>The result is a model for graphing data relationships that is optimized for generalized distributed data sharing. The key word is optimized. In theory, both RDF and XDI graphs can describe the relationships between any set of URI-identifiable resources. But each graph is optimized for different purposes. The distinction is similar to that between Cartesian and radian coordinates—either can locate any point on a plane, but certain types of shapes (e.g., squares vs. circles) are much easier to describe using one or the other.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 THE XDI GRAPH: OPTIMIZED FOR RESOURCE LINKING 

<p>In particular, the XDI graph is optimized for describing relationships between shared resources. This is the nature of distributed data sharing. Every time data is shared, a copy of a resource—a new sub-tree—is instantiated at a new location on the global XDI graph. Because this new sub-tree has an inherent relationship to the original sub-tree, it can be represented simply by using:</p>

 
   A Link element (rather than a Resource element) to represent the root of the new sub-tree, and 
   One or more of the same XRIs that described the original Resource element, now in a new context.<a>^25</a> 
   A cache of any data from the original sub-tree that is literally "copied-and-pasted" below the root Link element in the new sub-tree. 
   In cases where data sharing is controlled, a link contract as one element of the cached data. 
 

<p>The result is both a simple, efficient XDI operation and clean, relatively compact XML.</p>

<p>A second way the XDI graph is optimized for linking is the use of XRIs to identify every resource and link element. Because of this, every node in the XDI graph is directly addressable using both persistent and reassignable XRIs. In addition every node that has a global context (i.e., a globally addressable ancestor) is globally addressable.</p>

<p>A third way the XDI graph is optimized for linking is link contracts, discussed above. Every link element that needs to control its active data interchange relationship with the target resource can cache a copy of its link contract, as shown in Figure 2 above. This means each XDI link can be not just self-describing, but self-governing—an ideal architecture for distributed data mediation.</p>

<p>(<a>^</a>23) From an object-oriented perspective, this is the same thing as an object, property, and property value. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/#basic">http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/#basic</a><br>

(<a>^</a>25) Note that for privacy and data protection purposes, the XRIs at any Link node may be only a subset of the XRI synonyms used at the target Resource node (or at other Link nodes) for this resource. This is a secondary mechanism by which data authorities can control the sharing of their data.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 GENERAL XRIS AND XDI DICTIONARIES: CONCEPT MAPPING ON THE XDI GRAPH 

<p>There is a fourth way in which the XDI graph is optimized for distributed data sharing. Since data describing the same resource is often already widely distributed (such as the same registration data representing the same user on multiple Web sites), a key challenge in establishing a distributed data
sharing infrastructure is “linking it up.” This requires:</p>

 
   Establishing equivalence between the different instances. 
   Establishing chain-of-authority relationships (in XDI graph terms, this means deciding which instances are resource nodes vs. which are link nodes). 
   Adding any necessary link control metadata, i.e., link contracts. 
 

<p>The latter two problems hinge on solving the first one—mapping equivalence. XDI offers four tools specifically to help with this problem:</p>

 
   XRI synonyms, discussed above, allow multiple XRIs to be assigned to the same resource or link element. This is how the XDI graph forms a dynamic global “identity map.” 
   Persistent XRIs, also described above, enable XDI authorities to assign persistent IDs to any node in the XDI graph. Most data instances already have a persistent ID within their local data store (e.g., a database key or file system i-node). When adapted to become a persistent XRI, this ID becomes the “anchor point” around which other XRI synonyms can be assigned to build an equivalence map. 
   General XRIs can be assigned to any resource representing an instance of a shared concept (“phone number,” “shoe size,” “age,” “budget,” “whale,” etc.) General XRIs use the general context symbol ("+") designed for this purpose. There is no single global authority for general XRIs because XDI communities will self-select a common set of general XRIs the same way communities of same-language speakers naturally self-select a common set of generic nouns. (However general XDI dictionaries will be very useful in this respect.) 
   XDI dictionaries are Dataweb sites used as references by other Dataweb sites to help build shared concept maps. Except for the fact that they are entirely machine-readable and searchable, their purpose is the same as real-world dictionaries—to share resource identifiers (words) and resource descriptions (definitions) across communities of interest. Like real-world dictionaries, XDI dictionaries can be either generalized (the XDI equivalent of Merriam-Webster’s or the Oxford English Dictionary) or specialized (the XDI equivalent of Black’s Law Dictionary or Stedman’s Medical Dictionary.) 
 

<p>With XDI dictionaries, Dataweb mapping software can help automate the process of assigning XRIs and XRI synonyms to local resources, in the process building equivalence maps for linking this data with other XDI authorities. With such tools it may be possible, despite the four-dimensional challenges of distributed data sharing, to establish a global Dataweb almost as quickly as the World Wide Web formed.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 THE MISSION OF THE OASIS XDI TC 

<p>Besides the Web and XML, the roots of the Dataweb are in data addressing and linking technology originally developed by the XNS Public Trust Organization.<a>^26</a> This work was contributed to the OASIS XRI TC in January 2003 to help develop the abstract, location-independent identifier scheme necessary to support Internet-wide persistent linking and synchronization of data.</p>

<p>With the approval of the XRI Generic Syntax and Resolution Specification 1.0 as a Committee Draft<a>^27</a> on January 19, 2004, the foundation is now set for the OASIS XDI TC to develop the other specifications required for a global Dataweb. These deliverables include:</p>

 
   The XDI meta-schema for describing and linking XRI-identified resources using XML documents. (See the initial proposal attached as Appendix A.) 
   XRI resolution rules within XDI documents. 
   The XDI WSDL service definition and bindings to transport protocols including HTTP, SOAP, and SMTP/MIME. 
   The XDI service dictionary—the set of globally shared XDI resources including that can be used in XDI link contracts to define, control, secure, and protect data sharing relationships using XDI. 
 

<p>In addition the XDI TC plans to work closely with other OASIS TCs as well as other standards bodies and industry consortiums. Initially the XDI TC will be forming liaisons with:</p>

 
   The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Infrastructure Working Group to establish common use cases and ensure interoperability of TCG and XDI specifications in trusted computing infrastructure.<a>^28</a> 
   The Telemanagement Forum (TMF) to establish common use cases and requirements for using XDI as a mechanism for implementing the TMF SID (Shared Information/Data Model) component of the TMF NGOSS (New Generation Operations System and Software) program.<a>^29</a> 
   The International Security, Trust, and Privacy Alliance (ISTPA) Framework Working Group to adapt the ISTPA Privacy Framework as a reference model for XDI privacy and usage control architecture.<a>^30</a> 
 

<p>We invite other industry alliances, standards bodies, companies, and individuals interested in XDI and Dataweb development to join the OASIS XDI TC or to contact us regarding developing a liaison.</p>

 CONCLUSION 

<p>The task of establishing an Internet-wide data sharing infrastructure might appear overwhelming. However ten years ago, the idea of a global Web that put billions of linked documents at our fingertips appeared equally unthinkable. What the Web proved was that a simple, generalized model for content sharing and linking could grow exponentially as each new link was created.</p>

<p>The Dataweb proposes the same model for distributed data sharing. As shown in Figure 8, it combines the best features of the Web's linking model, Web Service's structured XML messaging model, and the Semantic Web's resource description model into an architecture that has the potential do for interoperable trusted data sharing what the Web did for open content sharing.</p>

<p>Web (HTML/HTTP) Web Services (XML/SOAP)</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p>Figure 8: The Dataweb bridges the best features of the Web, Web Services, and the Semantic Web.</p>

<p>Moreover, XDI does not displace any of the existing or emerging XML vocabularies designed to support specific applications or Web services infrastructure. Rather, it augments them by providing a common Web service for sharing, linking, and synchronizing other XML documents encoded in any XML language or schema. XDI service is designed to layer over enterprise-level data sharing solutions and standards the same way the Web layered over enterprise-level content sharing solutions and standards.</p><p>

Lumen operates a research platform that invites rightsholders, Online Service Providers (OSPs), search engines, and other online intermediaries, as well as members of the general public, to share takedown requests that they send and receive concerning online content. Lumen maintains a database containing approximately 15 million such notices, all of which have been voluntarily shared with the project by their recipients and senders. Lumen makes those notices available to scholars, journalists, and others for purposes of research and analysis.</p><p>Lumen was formed as the Chilling Effects Clearinghouse in or around 2001, in the wake of the United States’ 1998 implementation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and its safe harbor provisions. The project was founded in recognition of the fact that the DMCA safe harbor in the US would change the landscape concerning availability of online content by incentivizing platforms to remove content in response to copyright claims in order to qualify for the safe harbor, and that it would do so through a process that took place largely out of the public eye. Against that backdrop, Lumen’s goals are to facilitate research about different kinds of complaints and requests for removal — both legitimate and questionable — that are sent to online publishers and service providers; and to provide as much transparency as possible about such notices in terms of who sends them, why, and to what&nbsp;effect.</p><p>However, no existing law or regulation mandates that removal requests or demands be made public or even available for study. Thus, all of the notices in the Lumen database have been shared voluntarily with Lumen. And, those companies that have chosen to share notices with Lumen decide which types of notice, and which data fields within a notice, to share. The set of data to which Lumen has access is unfortunately therefore limited, and of commensurately limited utility with respect to drawing conclusions about the efficacy of the DMCA. It is with that backdrop in mind, and with the insight that my experiences managing Lumen have given me, that I write with a response specifically to your question 7, regarding the shortcomings of the notice-and counter-notice sending process as well as its potential standardization.</p><p>If Lumen had a motto, it would be “good policies are founded on good data.” The best way to draft well-functioning new legislation and policies regarding online takedowns is to carefully study the takedowns that have already occurred and that continue to occur. Only by fully understanding that complex ecosystem and its stakeholders, the successes and failure of existing policy, can legislators move forward in an effective way, one that will not create new problems as it attempts to solve the&nbsp;old.</p><p>I therefore propose, related to Senator Tillis’s suggestion for “regulations for the communications that OSPs must deliver to a user when their content is taken down or had access disabled” that in addition to standardization of forms, which I would support, that in contemplating changes to Section 512, drafters should consider ways to effectively incentivize those who send and receive notices to disclose those notices in ways that allow for their ongoing&nbsp;study.</p><p>Of course the devil will be in the details, but as just one example, a provision could be added to section 512 mandating that recipients of DMCA notices and any related counternotices disclose the contents of such notices, along with any action taken, to an independent third party entity. It seems less germane to have DMCA senders disclose the notices they send, but that could also be a topic for consideration.</p><p>If it received adequate funding to handle the substantial new volume, these mandatory disclosures could easily be made to Lumen, the largest current aggregator of DMCA requests, which has twenty years of history managing and facilitating research within a database of such requests. Or, a new clearinghouse entity could be created, perhaps under the auspices of the Copyright Office. In the alternative, or as an option for smaller scale DMCA recipients, there could instead be a requirement for a standardized general disclosure to the public, in the form of a Transparency Report published regularly by each recipient of DMCA notices, at least any with a registered DMCA agent. There is already ample precedent for such reports, and many larger companies publish&nbsp;them.</p><p>These Transparency Reports would be required to take a standardized form, allowing external researchers, including Lumen, to easily collect, aggregate, and compare their data for further study. Access to the “raw” data could be limited to vetted and accredited researchers, while the public could have access to a version with private and personally identifying information (PII) masked, as question 7 suggests. Lumen also has extensive experience with handling PII within DMCA notices and would be glad to consult on this topic. Any necessary redaction should be undertaken by the least-cost avoider.</p><p>Were this level of transparency regarding DMCA notices and counternotices, as well as the ultimate actions taken on them by recipient OSPs to become standard, I believe that the resulting wealth of information and insights gleaned from it would make it much easier to answer all of the other questions Senator Tillis has asked, whether initially or as part of ongoing and regular evaluation of existing laws and regulations.</p><p>Draft language on this topic might look something like:</p><p>(X) In order to facilitate ongoing research and policy analysis, any online service provider, as defined in [Section NNN], shall, upon receipt&nbsp;of:</p><p>(1) a notice per the requirements of 17 USC 512(c)&nbsp;(3),</p><p>(2)a counternotice sent per the requirements of 17 USC 512(g)(3),</p><p>(3) a subpoena sent per the requirements of 17 USC 512(h),&nbsp;or</p><p>(4) a cease &amp; desist letter sent regarding Section 1201 violation</p><p>transmit a copy of the notice, counternotice, subpoena or letter, formatted according to the criteria in[Section NNN], to the Lumen Database / Copyright Office’s clearinghouse for such documents described in Section&nbsp;(NNN);</p><p>or in the alternative, make a copy of the correctly formatted notice, counternotice, subpoena or letter available in a quarterly Transparency Report, as described in [Section&nbsp;NNN].</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Adam Holland</p><p>Project Manager — Lumen</p><p>Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp;&nbsp;Society</p><p>Harvard University</p><p>[1] The Lumen database is accessible at <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org.">https://www.lumendatabase.org.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/a-response-to-senator-tilliss-questions-regarding-his-proposed-draft-legislation-and-possible-ac1f3a0dfc74">A response to Senator Tillis’s questions regarding his proposed draft legislation and possible…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Maitrayee Deka, Adam Arvidsson, Rohini Lakshané &amp; Ravi&nbsp;Sundaram  Session <p>Up till now digital technologies have mostly served to create new markets opportunities for the large capitalist monopolies like Facebook, Apple and Google that dominate the global information economy. But what happens when the potential for disintermediation and market making that comes with digital technologies hit the bazaars for of the worlds ‘other economy,’ what Ravi Sundaram has called ‘pirate modernity.’ Indeed this is already happening in two inter-related ways.</p><p>First, the availability of cheap, copied or pirated digital goods like Shanzhai cell phones or pirated video games support a reinvigorated bazaar economy made up of small traders who eek out a living while providing informational goods to the broad popular market segments that large brands do not cater to. This is already an emerging phenomenon in India, Africa and large parts of South America, but similar forms of what Gordon Mathews and his colleagues call ‘globalisation from below’ are gaining an influence in Europe as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Second, the potential for disintermediation on the part of digital technologies like WhatsApp today and blockchain technologies in the near future provide a technical infrastructure for strengthening the organizational basis of such bottom-up markets and enable them to strengthen their standing vis-a-vis capitalist monopolies. Can the ‘pirate economy’ launch its own institution, its own capital markets and its own&nbsp;brands?</p><p>In this session we want to explore the future of bottom-up markets. What happens when traders on Delhi’s electronic bazaars can bypass middlemen connecting directly to their Chinese suppliers via WhatsApp; what happens when informal financial circuits like Hawala networks start operating blockchain technologies? Extrapolating from research on what is going on know we want to collectively imagine what the future might bring. What sort of economic social and, importantly political consequences might these changes bring about? How can we theorise this emergence and how does it challenge and force us to rethink basic categories like capitalism, markets and&nbsp;agency?</p> Plan <p>The sessions will start with presentations on traders in Delhi’s pirate bazaars, blockchain and the democratization of financial markets, impact of mobile connectivity on business and family interaction, and relationship between peer-to-peer, pirate economies, and large media corporations within cultures of circulation. The presentation will be brief (about 20 mins.) and will serve to open up discussions and constitutions form workshop participants.</p><p>Discussions will be centred&nbsp;on:</p>  What are interesting areas of study in understanding how digital technologies are changing the balance of power in the digital economy in&nbsp;India?  What is the potential of digital technologies in relation to the mediation and transformation of bottom up economic processes in contemporary India?  What are the new forms of injustices and/or imbalances are arising form these transformations?  What is the political potential in digital disintermediation in relation to markets, beyond the ‘official paradigm of ecommerce and Uber-like platforms?

<p>The Web3 ecosystem has never been more exciting, with the Phase 0 launch of Eth2, the explosion of DeFi legos, and the maturation of collaborative tools like social money, governance products, and creator platforms. All this growth requires better infrastructure and open source tooling, and there's no better time or place to support that than Gitcoin Grants Round 8!</p><p>To celebrate this, we're excited to be sponsors of the <a href="https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr8/prizes/">Grants Round 8 Hackathon</a>, where the community can support the Web3 ecosystem not just with money but with code, projects and demos that bring this technology to life.</p><p>The hackathon kicks off December 2 on <a href="https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr8/prizes/">Gitcoin</a>, and lasts until December 17. Here’s how to get started:</p>  <a href="https://t.co/edyHGiYb88?amp=1">Register for the hackathon</a>  Check out the <a href="https://gitcoin.co/ceramicnetwork">Ceramic and IDX bounties</a>  <a href="https://chat.idx.xyz/">Hop into the IDX Discord</a> for help or to share what you’re working on. We’re more than happy to help discuss your plans   Ceramic Network Bounties <p>We've partnered with other projects in the ecosystem to offer six bounties totaling more than 5000 DAI!</p><a href="https://gitcoin.co/ceramicnetwork">  @ceramicnetwork | Gitcoin  @ceramicnetwork is a organization who has participated in 0 transactions on Gitcoin  @ceramicnetwork | Gitcoin    </a><p>1. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/issue/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/38/100024328">Open Prize: Best App or Service that uses IDX</a></p><p>This is an open prize for using IDX to manage decentralized identity information or data. This can include integrating IDX into an existing project, building a new product that uses IDX, building tooling that supports or complements IDX, or any other creative implementation that makes use of IDX as decentralized identity infrastructure.</p><p>2. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/issue/snapshot-labs/snapshot-bounties/2/100024329">Integrate 3Box Profiles into Snapshot's Governance App</a></p><p>Integrate the <a href="https://docs.3box.io/build/web-apps/public-data">3Box Profiles API</a> to add social profiles to the <a href="https://snapshot.page/#/">Snapshot app</a>, adding familiarity and social reputation to this critical governance tool.</p><p>3. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/issue/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/40/100024331">Add a Discord Verification to Gitcoin using IDX</a></p><p>This bounty is to integrate IDX into Gitcoin to add a discord verification to the others already offered, and lay the foundation for a more decentralized identity and trust system in future Grant rounds!</p><p>4. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/issue/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/39/100024330">Migrate Eth.Build's Backup Feature to use IDX rather than 3Box</a></p><p>Eth.Build currently uses 3Box to backup user sessions. This bounty is to work with Austin Griffith to replace the existing backup implementation with one that uses IDX for identity and authentication alongside a storage solution like Ceramic, OrbitDB, Textile ThreadsDB or SkyDB.</p><p>5. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/issue/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/41/100024332">Add Support for new Blockchains to IDX</a></p><p>IDX supports a cross-ecosystem, cross-chain identity model by letting users link any number of blockchain accounts and key pairs to their DID. To support a new blockchain, check out this <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">blog post</a> to learn how.</p><p>Currently, Ethereum and Filecoin keys are supported. This bounty is to add support for additional blockchains. This makes the promise of a portable cross-chain identity more complete, and increases the number of apps and services that can use truly interoperable identity and data.</p><p>6. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/issue/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/42/100024333">Use IDX and Textile ThreadsDB Together</a></p><p>Build a project that makes use of IDX as an identity protocol alongside Textile's ThreadsDB. To achieve this, during onboarding you can use the IDX SDK to import or create identities, create a Textile ThreadsDB definition for your application's data, add this to users' identity index, and query their index for their data stored by your app or others.</p> IDX: An open identity system for dweb apps <p><a href="https://idx.xyz/">IDX</a> is a new cross-ecosystem decentralized identity and user data management protocol that provides for a single, unified digital identity system that works with all Web3 platforms, blockchains, and storage technologies. IDX is built on <a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>, a peer-to-peer dataweb for publishing, linking, and querying verifiable information on the open web.</p><p>By design, IDX is completely agnostic as to which wallet users authenticate with and which backend configuration you choose to build with — including any blockchain and data storage system — so it easily integrates into the rest of your stack and allows you to build truly cross-platform interoperable applications. You can save data wherever you choose, and import data from other applications!</p><p>The IDX identity framework allows you to tap into a universal decentralized identity layer that makes user and data management for your dweb app much more open and powerful. IDX provides a universal cross-platform identity (DID) for users that can be used everywhere across the Web3 ecosystem, a way to store/access public metadata such as profiles and social graphs, a way to associate your app’s data storage systems (e.g., Textile, SkyDB) to the user’s identity, a way to discover and import available third-party data sources for the user (even ones outside of the SkyDB ecosystem such as Filecoin files, TextileDBs, OrbitDBs, and much more!), and a way to publish schemas for your data so that others might easily make use of your application data within another application or context.</p><p>This decentralized, unified, and cross-platform identity infrastructure helps Web3 projects build faster and more simply. It is also the key to realizing the vision of giving users ultimate control and portability of their information across applications and networks by breaking down information silos and putting users at the center of the web. With IDX, every user gets a cross-platform decentralized identifier (DID) and an identity index document to which developers can attach various pieces of data relevant to their experience. Since IDX identities are public and permissionless, any developer can openly discover, query, and import data from an identity into their application, creating a rich ecosystem of information around each user.</p>  Good luck to all the hackers!

The world's attention has turned to healthcare this year, with many initiatives exploring the use of open data and standards. Schema.org has made a number of efforts already to contribute to the global Coronavirus response, including the creation of <a href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a> markup, improvements around events, jobs, <a href="https://schema.org/docs/cdc-covid.html">hospital reporting</a>, and other schemas to reflect our changed reality.&nbsp; <br>  This week we have invited <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/11/07/open-innovation-heroes-introducing-veterans-job-bank">longstanding</a> Schema.org collaborator Aneesh Chopra to provide an introduction to some important developments in the United States, where Schema.org is being used to improve the accuracy of information about healthcare provider directories.&nbsp; <br>  Guest post by Aneesh Chopra, former U.S. CTO (2009-2012) and President/Co-Founder of <a href="https://carejourney.com/">CareJourney</a>: <br>  Just over 9 years ago, the schema.org community <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2011/11/schemaorg-support-for-job-postings.html">launched a markup for JobPostings, </a>an important resource to meet a call to action in helping veterans find jobs that valued their skills. During the early months of the pandemic, this community responded with an important upgrade to the nation’s health IT infrastructure to democratize access more <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/connecting-americans-coronavirus-information-online/">trusted health information online</a>. <br>  Today, at an <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/news/events/accelerating-apis-healthcare-year-review-and-momentum-2021">API Summit</a> hosted by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT, Kathy Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation announced an open collaboration that builds upon the same regulations and industry standards to improve another important aspect of the consumer health navigation experience - searching for timely, accurate provider directory information. <br>  For many Americans, finding a health plan that includes their trusted providers is critically important, but often requires tedious work looking up each plan’s provider directory. Sadly, as CMS found in a recent <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/ManagedCareMarketing/Downloads/Provider_Directory_Review_Industry_Report_Round_3_11-28-2018.pdf">review</a>, nearly 50% of provider directories contained inaccuracies regarding whether the provider was accepting new patients, practicing at the address listed, or reachable via the listed phone number.&nbsp; <br>  Regulators have attempted to solve these problems by imposing penalties on government-sponsored plans for inaccurate information, but an additional solution may be at hand. A <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/interoperability-and-patient-access-fact-sheet">provision</a> embedded in CMS’ interoperability regulations requires government-sponsored health plans to publish machine-readable access to timely directory information by July 2021. In an effort to reduce administrative burdens, a multi-stakeholder collaborative is looking to both improve the quality of physician websites to include this information and to enable health plans to source timely, accurate information from them to comply with the rules. <br>  Similar to the work that was done to make it easier for consumers to find <a href="https://carejourney.com/covid-schema-playbook/">COVID announcements</a> on physician websites, such as testing availability, revised office hours or telemedicine services, this collaborative will work to standardize how to publish structured provider directory information. To further simplify the search experience, providers can now publish their website URL when updating their “digital contact information” on CMS’ <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/registry/help-details">NPPES NPI Registry</a>. <br>  Adding structured data from a provider’s website to the portfolio of tools health plans use today – including plan-agnostic reporting tools, “secret shopper” visits, mailings, and a number of emerging data-driven solutions – should result in a reduction in the administrative burden of updating physician directories. Directory maintenance is burdensome. The average practice has over 20 health plan contracts and directories to maintain with over 50% of these updates being conducted via phone or fax. According to a 2019 CAQH (Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare®) <a href="https://www.caqh.org/sites/default/files/explorations/CAQH-hidden-causes-provider-directories-whitepaper.pdf">report</a>, the average practice spends $1,000 each month for directory maintenance. Yet at the same time, physician practices find value in online marketing as a way to attract new patients, and invest an average of $650 per month to design websites and optimize search results, according to a study by <a href="https://thescript.zocdoc.com/how-much-do-other-practices-spend-on-marketing/">Zocdoc</a>. A web standardization effort will therefore have multiple benefits. It will allow physicians to more efficiently communicate useful information via search engines that can also be used to populate health plan directories and to meet regulatory compliance, thus reducing administrative burdens.&nbsp; <br>  CareJourney, with support from The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, seeks to engage public and private sector stakeholders in an effort to accelerate the development and adoption of <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a> web standards for physician information, and to curate a portfolio of tools to structure this information on a practice’s website. Our goal is to improve consumer access to provider information while lowering physician burden. We anticipate the following benefits:&nbsp;<br>  Increased consumer access to high-quality, accurate provider information, such as whether a doctor, practicing at this location, is seeing new patients from my plan.   Consistent webpage documentation and maintenance practices that are sufficient to meet health plan regulatory requirements   Improved search engine results by leveraging the structured website markup&nbsp;  This effort will benefit from the active participation of the healthcare community and we welcome additional participants to play a part in our initiative. Assistance in testing and providing feedback on the proposed web standards will be critical and extremely helpful in further promotion and adoption. Once the resulting open information and markup instructions are freely available, we welcome assistance in the widespread dissemination. Finally, we are grateful the prominent search engines are engaged in a process for site maintenance that ensures physicians keep their websites properly structured at the lowest possible administrative burden. <br>  Thank you, in advance, for your interest in advancing this important work! Please sign up <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5bMFAAOoQm-AkVtOQQFHeQvPHoWw_1CAwZ1GvMtr0Bd4ZEg/viewform">here</a> to participate!           <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

<p>By Wafa-Ben Hassine, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>I believe it can. And it must. As a human rights attorney, I come at this issue thinking about people&nbsp;first.</p><p>Whether its messaging a family member asking them to bring home a loaf of bread, or discussing next year’s business strategy with a colleague, secure encryption ensures we can have private conversations and guarantees the integrity of our communication. Users’ quick adoption of encrypted, private messaging speaks volumes of its importance: billions of users worldwide use encrypted messaging on a daily basis as an indispensable tool in their livelihoods.</p><p>While the examples above are innocuous, we know that encrypted messaging platforms can also be used for more nefarious purposes. And with these platforms’ breadth, reach, and the undetectable nature of the content of conversations, we are deeply concerned about the harms that their deployment creates. Examples include <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44856910">lynch mobs in India</a>, <a href="https://mediaengagement.org/research/encrypted-propaganda/">widespread disinformation</a> on the coronavirus pandemic in Mexico and the US, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/whatsapp-skewed-brazilian-election-showing-social-medias-danger-to-democracy">swaying election results</a> in Brazil, facilitating global <a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2019/9/13/20863489/encryption-stanford-conference-facebook-ncmec-ghq">child abuse</a>, and providing white supremacists the channels needed to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/karstenschmehl/whatsapp-groups-nazi-symbol-stickers-germany">spread Nazi propaganda</a> in Germany and the&nbsp;US.</p><p>But we can’t just blame encryption for these harms. Encryption is universally regarded as a <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/in/documentViewer.xhtml?v=2.1.196&amp;id=p::usmarcdef_0000246527&amp;file=/in/rest/annotationSVC/DownloadWatermarkedAttachment/attach_import_832e8e2a-88a0-4df2-a332-c945a30d9f8f%3F_%3D246527eng.pdf&amp;locale=en&amp;multi=true&amp;ark=/ark:/48223/pf0000246527/PDF/246527eng.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A145%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2Cnull%2Cnull%2C0%5D">prerequisite for the exercise of rights</a> like freedom of expression, and freedom to privacy online. It is a means to a fundamental end. With the Internet increasingly permeating every aspect of our lives, encryption is a technology that will not and should not go away anytime soon. Health and financial institutions also utilize encryption to ensure that individuals’ personal information is safe from identity theft and&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>We need to disrupt the status quo that materially benefits the large tech companies that provide these platforms (often for free), who then turn a blind eye to the harms they can cause. Researchers, civil society groups, and governments should be able to have select information on how the technology is operated and used — e.g. market sizes based on geography, metadata about how information travels, peak use and dynamics, etc. — all appropriately aggregated so as to protect individual privacy — so they can better understand the nature, type and impact of these harms, and ultimately, help propose ways to fix them. And tech platforms who provide these services should be ultimately accountable for ensuring their safety and&nbsp;quality.</p><p>I joined Omidyar Network to lead and support the type of work that can change that status quo. Our goal is to work with our partners to advance a robust, evidence-driven, and sensible public conversation that ensures encrypted messaging is safe, trustworthy, inclusive, and doesn’t sacrifice encryption and privacy. One that, based on my professional background, respects and upholds human&nbsp;rights.</p><p>To do that, we must start by envisioning the kind of messaging we want to see. The debate around whether we should, or should not encrypt, is a non-starter. Instead, we should ask: What kind of information do researchers need to help understand and prevent some of the issues we see? What pressure points can we identify to tilt the balance with policymakers? What does accountability look like in an encrypted ecosystem that in some instances, verifiably led to rampant organized disinformation and propaganda campaigns? What can different stakeholders do to stop the exploitation of technological gains benefitting privacy?</p><p>Answers to these questions will help us collectively conceive of more effective ways to mitigate any harmful byproducts of private, secure messaging, and begin to truly enjoy all that it has to&nbsp;offer.</p><p>As social activist and author Alice Walker said: “Look closely at the present you are constructing: it should look like the future you are dreaming.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/can-encrypted-messaging-be-safe-inclusive-and-respect-human-rights-f8ad28e53443">Can Encrypted Messaging Be Safe, Inclusive, and Respect Human Rights?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Q&amp;A covers election misinformation, content moderation, and&nbsp;COVID-19 Oumou Ly (left) interviews Joan Donovan (right) for The Breakdown from the Berkman Klein&nbsp;Center.<p>The 2020 US election was marked by misinformation and bad actors stemming from domestic&nbsp;sources.</p><p>In this episode of The Breakdown, Oumou Ly, an Assembly staff fellow at the Berkman Klein Center is joined by Joan Donovan, the director of The Technology and Social Change Project (TaSC) at Harvard Kennedy&nbsp;School.</p><p>Read the transcript, which is lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity</p><p>Oumou Ly (OL): Welcome to The Breakdown. My name is Oumou, I’m a fellow on the Assembly: Disinformation Program at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard. Our topic of discussion today continues the discussion of the election. I am joined today and thrilled to be joined today by Joan Donovan, who is the Research Director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. Dr. Donovan leads the field in examining internet and technology studies, online extremism, media manipulation, and disinformation campaigns. Thank you Joan for joining&nbsp;us.</p><p>Joan Donovan (JD): Really excited to talk about this stuff&nbsp;today.</p><p>OL: So our discussion today centers on domestic actors and their goals in purveying disinformation, and we would be remiss if not to mention that at the time it was this recorded, just last night, the president fired Chris Krebs who was the head of CISA at DHS, the agency within the federal government that takes the lead on countering, mitigating and responding to disinformation, particularly as it relates to democratic processes like elections. Joan, what do you sort of make of this late-night firing, this last-minute development?</p><p>JD: If you study disinformation long enough you feel like you’re looking through a crystal ball in some instances. So we all knew it was coming, even Krebs had said so much. And that’s because countering disinformation, it’s a really thankless job, in the sense that it wasn’t just the fact that Krebs had built an agency that over the course of the last few years really had flown under the radar in terms of any kind of partisan divides, had done a lot of work to ensure election security and cared about the question of disinformation, misinformation as it applied to questions about election integrity, right?</p><p>So CISA and Krebs [weren’t] trying to dispel all of the crazy myths and conspiracies out there, but they were doing their part within their remit to make sure that any kind of theory about voter fraud was something that they took seriously and took the time to debunk. And so it wasn’t necessarily just the kinds of tweets that were coming out of CISA, but it was really about this website that they had put together that was really a kind of a low budget version of Snopes in the sense that the website it’s called Rumor Control. And the idea was very simple which was provide [a] very rapid analysis of any conspiracy or allegation of election fraud that was starting to reach a tipping point, not everything, but things that started to get covered in different areas, covered by journalists, and to give people an anchor that says, “This is what we know to be true at this&nbsp;moment.”</p><p>Of course, as the president has come to refute the election results rather forcefully online, Krebs’ role became much more important as a vocal critic with the truth on his side. And over the last few weeks, especially the last week, we’ve seen Trump move anybody out of his way that would either contradict him in public or would seriously imperil his desire to stay in the White&nbsp;House.</p><p>OL: That makes me think of something that I think about a lot recently, particularly over the last four years, but especially in 2020, is this use of disinformation as political strategy by the GOP. It seems like one pillar of that strategy is just [a] want to spread disinformation. The second is to sort of leverage our institutions to legitimize the information that they’re spreading. And the third is just to accelerate truth to get in a matter that’s advantageous to the GOP’s particular political aims. How do you respond to that? And how do you think the information ecosystem should be organizing around that problem? That is, that we have a major political party in the United States for whom this is [a] strategy for&nbsp;them.</p><p>JD: They’re really just leveraging the communication opportunities in our current media ecosystem to get their messaging across. And in this instance when we know where the propaganda is coming from, that is it’s coming from the White House, it’s coming from Giuliani, it’s coming from Bannon, it’s coming from Roger Stone, how then do we reckon with it? Because we actually know what it is. So the concept of white propaganda is really important here because when we know what the source is, we can treat it differently. However, the difference between something like what went down in 2016 and what happened in 2020 is an evolution of these strategies to use some automated techniques in order to increase engagement on certain posts so that more people see them, coupled with serious, serious money and influence in order to make disinformation travel further and&nbsp;faster.</p><p>The third thing about this communication strategy in this moment is that the problem really transcends social media at this point where we do have our more legitimate institutions starting to bow out and say, you know what? We’re not even gonna try to tackle this, where like for us, it’s not even an issue, because we’re not gonna play into allegations that there’s voter fraud, we’re not gonna play into any of these pet theories that have emerged about Hammer and Scorecard and Dominion. And if you’ve heard any of those keywords then you’ve encountered disinformation. But it does go to show that we are immersed in a hyper-partisan media ecosystem where the future of journalism is at stake. The future of social media is at stake. And right now, I’m really worried that the US democracy might not survive this&nbsp;moment.</p><p>OL: I completely agree with you. And that is a really scary thing to think. Can you talk a little bit about sites like Parler, Discord, Telegram, Gab. Just recently after the election, Facebook disbanded a group called Stop the Steal, and then many of those followers found a new home on Parler. The Parler app then went #1 on Apple’s iTunes downloads chart. Why are sites like this so attractive to people who have a history of creating affinity around conspiracy theories?</p><p>JD: So I think about Gab, for instance… me and Brian Friedberg and Becca Lewis <a href="https://mediarep.org/bitstream/handle/doc/13283/Post_Digital_Cultures_49-65_Donovan_ea_Parallel_Ports_.pdf?sequence=3">wrote about Gab </a>post the Unite the Right Rally, because Gab really put a lot of energy into recruiting white supremacists who were being removed from platforms for terms of service violations. And they were basically saying, “we’re the free speech platform. And we don’t care what you say.” And for Gab that went overhead pretty fast, where they did have to start banning white supremacists. Because unfortunately what you get when you make a platform that emphasizes lack of moderation is you get some of the worst kind of pornography you can ever imagine, no style, no grace, nothing sexy about it just — Here’s a bunch of people in diapers, right? Like it’s just not good. And so right now these minor apps that are saying on we’re unmoderated, come one, come all are actually facing a pretty strong content moderation problem where trolls are now showing up pretending to be celebrities. There [are] lots and lots of screenshots out there where people think they heard from some celebrity on one of these apps. And it’s really just a troll with a fake account. But this moment is an opportunity for these apps to grow and they will say and do anything in order to capture that market&nbsp;segment.</p><blockquote>Right now, we’re having a crisis of stability in terms of content moderation policies.</blockquote><p>If we think about infrastructure, as all three things: the technology, the people that bring the technology together including the audiences, and the policies. Right now, we’re having a crisis of stability in terms of content moderation policies. And so people are seeking out other platforms that increase that kind of stability in their messaging because they wanna know why they’re seeing what they’re seeing and they want for those rules to be really&nbsp;clear.</p><p>OL: Picking up on that content moderation thread to talk about larger and sort of more legacy tech platforms more broadly, what is your sense of how well content moderation, and maybe even more specifically labeling efforts, work? We saw Twitter and some of the other platforms to do a pretty, I think, comparatively good job when compared with the past. Slapping labels on the president’s tweets, but that’s because there was an expectation that there would be premature claims of victory. What’s your sense of how well it minimizes virality?</p><p>JD: So we don’t really know or have any data to conclude that the labeling is really doing anything other than aggravating people.</p><p>OL: Yeah.</p><p>JD: Which is to say that, we thought that the labeling was gonna result in massive reduction and virality. In some instances you see influencers taking photos or just screenshots of the labels on their tweets on Twitter, and then you saying like look, it’s happening to me as a kind of badge of honor. But at the same time when done well, they convey the right kind of&nbsp;message.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don’t think any of us anticipated the amount of labels that were gonna be needed on key public figures, right? And so I imagine that okay, they’re gonna do these labels for folks that have over a hundred thousand followers on Twitter, or they’re gonna show up on YouTube and in ways that deal with both the claims of voter fraud, but also the virality. But it’s hard to say if anybody’s clicking through on these labels, I’ve clipped through some of them and the information on the other side of the label is totally irrelevant. That is it’s just not about the tweet or any, it’s not specific&nbsp;enough.</p><p>Which is to say that, in watching the tech hearing this week, Dorsey seem[s] to not really be committed to a content moderation policy that deals with misinformation at scale. And as a result, what you get is these half measures that we don’t really know what their effect is gonna be. And for the partners in the fact-checking world that power partnered with Facebook, they’re now under a delusion of allegations that they’re somehow partisan and they’ve been weaponized in a bunch of different ways. And so I don’t even know what the broad payout is to risk your reputation as a news organization, to do that kind of fact-checking on Facebook, where Facebook isn’t really committed to removing certain kinds of misinformation.</p><p>OL: Joan, why is medical misinformation different than other types of information we see circulating, maybe related to elections or other democratic processes?</p><p>JD: So when we think about medical misinformation, we’re really thinking about well, how quickly are people gonna change their behavior, right? If you hear that coronavirus is in the water, you’re gonna stop drinking water, right? If you hear that it’s in the air, you’re gonna put a mask on. And so the way in which people receive medical advice, really it can stop them on a dime and move them in a different direction. And unfortunately, we’ve entered into this situation where medical advice has been polarized in our hyper-partisan media environments. And there’s been some <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/01/24/qa-how-pew-research-center-evaluated-americans-trust-in-30-news-sources/">recent studies</a> that can even show the degree to which that polarization is happening that is really leading people to downplay the risks of COVID-19. And this has a lot to do with them encountering misinformation from what they might consider even trusted&nbsp;sources.</p><blockquote>Unfortunately, we’ve entered into this situation where medical advice has been polarized in our hyper-partisan media environments.</blockquote><p>And so when we think about the design of social media in this moment, we actually have to think about a curation strategy for the truth. We need access to information that is timely, local, relevant, and accurate. And if we don’t get that kind of information today, people are going to continue to die, because they don’t understand what the real risk is, they don’t understand, they don’t understand how they can protect themselves. And especially as we enter into this holiday season, where a lot of people are starting to relax their vigilance and are hoping that it won’t happen to them, that’s the exact moment where we need to crank up the health messaging and make sure that people understand the risks and have seen some form of true and correct information about COVID-19. Because I’ll tell you right now if you go on social media and you start poking around, sure there’s a couple of interstitials, or there’s a couple of banners here and there, but we can do a lot better to make sure that people know what COVID-19 is, what the symptoms are, how do you get tested, how to keep yourself safe and how to keep your loved ones safe as&nbsp;well.</p><p>OL: I’m just curious what are the sorts of data points you’ve seen that would explain why some people don’t necessarily believe information from authoritative sources about the spread of COVID-19. Why are some people inclined not to believe that authoritative information?</p><p>JD: It’s a good question. And part of it has to do with the echo chambers that they’ve been getting information in for years. We’ve started to see certain Facebook groups, that maybe it’s a local Facebook group and you’ve been in it a long time and is about exchanging like of the free list, exchanging things in your neighborhood. And then people slowly start to talk about these really important issues. And misinformation is introduced through a blog post or an article. Or I saw this on the quote-unquote news, and you find out that they’ve been watching one of these hyper-partisan news sources that [are] downplaying what’s happening. And so you kind of see it in the ephemera, but our journal, the <a href="https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/">Harvard Kennedy Misinfo Review</a>, we’ve published research around even within the right-wing media ecosystem, the degree to which someone watches a lot of, let’s say Hannity versus Tucker, they’re gonna have different associations with the risk of COVID-19, because it’s covered differently these folks that are at the same outlet. And so it’s really important to understand that this has to do with the communication environment that is designed and the fact that people are really trying when they’re sharing things that are novel, or outrageous or things that might be medically incorrect. They’re doing it in some cases out of love. They’re doing it just in case, and maybe you didn’t see this. And it’s an unfortunate situation that we’ve gotten ourselves into, where the more outrageous the conspiracy theory, the more outlandish the claim, the more viral it tends to be. And that’s an unfortunate consequence of the design of these&nbsp;systems.</p><p>OL: Thank you so much for joining me today Joan, I really enjoyed our conversation.</p><p>JD: That’s great, thank you so much. I really appreciate you doing these&nbsp;series.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-breakdown-joan-donovan-on-domestic-misinformation-da4f60296420">The Breakdown: Joan Donovan on domestic misinformation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning?</p> 
<p>I am the Director of Partnerships at Simprints, a non-profit technology company with the mission to radically increase transparency and effectiveness in global development, making sure that every vaccine, every dollar, every public good reaches the people who need them most. Practically, I lead a passionate and determined team to develop partnerships with a variety of other stakeholders within the international development space — iNGOs, technical providers, governments, etc.</p>
<p>What gets me out of bed in the morning (besides a strong cup of coffee)?</p>
<p>It’s seeing our sector throw millions of dollars into programs that simply do not reach the people they’re intended for. It may be that some of these programs are&nbsp; reaching beneficiaries and we just don’t know it but there is a data discrepancy of up to 50% in vaccination programmes. That means that we just don’t know whether or not 50% of beneficiaries received the intended services. Without real-time, accurate data linked to an individual, it’s like we’re fighting poverty and disease blindfolded. I must admit that makes me really angry </p>
<p>Simprints looks to address the “accuracy” piece by deploying biometrics to create unique IDs for each beneficiary. Our sense of purpose is really strong and the people that I get to interact with on a daily basis are an awesome, committed, smart, capable, passionate team.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I kind of stumbled my way into it!&nbsp; In my previous life I was a crisis counsellor, working with folks who were often at their most desperate – survivors of assault and trauma, people suffering with addiction or those feeling suicidal. I worked across a number of countries (Zambia, South Africa, the U.S., China) and the impact was incredibly tangible. I really loved it and sometimes I do miss the day to day buzz of that work. But I felt we were always just reacting to some of the world’s larger more systemic issues. I wanted to get involved in driving forward change that will make a real difference for the future.</p>
<p>So, I decided to shift towards the global health and international development sectors. &nbsp;The main reason we are in this space is to create greater transparency and trust around the whole issue of identity and biometrics.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>This is going to sound a real cliche but, honestly, it was to trust myself. I know I won’t get things right all of the time but being able to cut through the noise and listen to myself was a huge learning curve for me. I noticed that the more I did it, the better results I had. Even if I was still wrong, at least I could own it as my own decision instead of something that was decided for me by others</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>There are 1.1 billion people in this world that lack a formal identity. When you are working on developing identity solutions for the masses, don’t forget about those folks! There is a massive gap in the amount of data being used to underpin programmes. This can lead to complacency and an acceptance that data – and therefore resources – will be misused. We have to stop this NOW!</p>
<p>If you continue to focus on narrow proprietary solutions, we will never get a truly holistic view of the individual. And when you are talking about healthcare programmes, this can lead to life-threatening situations. For instance, a midwife working in Dhaka’s Beguntila needs a single view of her patient, complete with medical histories. Often the Mother won’t have a formal ID, date of birth or other identifier so ensuring the correct interventions are given is incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>We need interoperability across the identity sector. At the end of the day all of the work we are doing will need to intersect so anything we can do as a global community to start that work now will be key! Your people have the talent, the passion and the ideas – make sure you use ALL of them and encourage knowledge sharing appropriately.</p>
 Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Achieving global impact is never the outcome of one individual. It is achieved by having a strong collective – one that it is diverse in background, ethnicity, opinion, education, gender, sexuality, ability …. We work closely with Community Health workers on the ground because they bring knowledge and experiences that feed straight into our product development.</p>
 What book or film would you recommend to your fellow members and why? 
<p>IMy choices all lay out (in a very readable, story-like way) the incredible histories / backgrounds of some of the most effective and ground-breaking global development interventions of our time.</p>

<p>Women in Identity spoke to Erdoo Yongo, Policy &amp; Advocacy Manager at GSMA – the industry body for the mobile telecoms sector. Given the prevalence, and significance, of mobile phones and mobile technology across the globe, we wanted to know how she sees the development of ‘identity’ in this space – and whether policies and products really have the individual user at their core.</p>
 What do you love most about your job? 
Erdoo Yongo
<p>I work within the Mobile for Development department that explores how mobile technology can be used as a platform to create growth and reduce inequalities. To really understand the impact mobile can have on people, my role spans two areas: the Digital Identity programme and Mobile for Humanitarian Innovation programme.</p>
<p>My work involves uncovering the policy-related barriers that individuals face in accessing mobile services. Identity is a gateway to some of the most fundamental resources and services including healthcare. My responsibilities focus on high-level policy research. It is vital that we fully understand the different approaches governments around the world take to ID. We saw this year how COVID-19 released a whole new reliance on mobile technology. But in some countries, no ID meant no SIM – means no connection, not to family and friends and also, sometimes, not to school resources, financial support or healthcare initiatives.&nbsp; My research focuses on creating an evidence base that can be used to campaign for better access to all these vital services.</p>
<p>I am of Nigerian heritage but born and bred in the UK.&nbsp; I am very aware that we don’t connect with the concept of ID as they do in countries where a national ID is mandated by the government. In many of the countries I have researched, citizens value mobile services even more than they do basic things like food services or banking. It is a lifeline but, if it is tied to ID, it can exclude millions of people who – for whatever reason – don’t have a recognised identity.</p>
<p>So, to answer the question …. what I love most about my job is that it relates very much to the provision of vital life services. And, because very few people are involved in this kind of work, I really feel it is valued.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>It was an accident! I started within GSMA’s Digital Identity team as an intern. I stumbled across the internship through ‘The Brokerage’ – a social mobility network that focuses on providing opportunities for young people from disadvantaged communities, helping them take their first step into a professional career. Before seeing the internship, I had no idea who GSMA was or what they did. My internship lasted for just under a year but a number of opportunities arose which enabled me to progress from an intern to my current role. I feel it was a mixture of luck and positioning that got me to where I am today.</p>
 Luck???? Really ….? 
<p>OK…:)&nbsp; Maybe there was some hard work and risk-taking along the way!&nbsp; I studied Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Manchester University and was always interested in international development and humanitarian issues. So I guess being curious and not afraid to ask questions was a help! I think I was willing to take more risks too when I was younger – guess you have less to lose! I went for the GSMA internship even though it was initially advertised for 3rd year undergraduates – and I knew nothing about ‘identity’!! I’d just graduated but loved the sound of it so I went for it – and got a place!!</p>
<p>It is hard to do things that – on the face of it – look like there’s no chance of success. But what have you got to lose? I hope I retain that element of me, but it does get harder as your career develops </p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>Good question. I guess it would be “You are in control of your destiny”. When I first started at GSMA I was pretty timid. I didn’t really know what I was doing and tended to expect that opportunities would come to me from my manager. Now, 3 years in, I realise that I am the only person who can control and direct my career. If I want exposure to certain things, I need to carve out the opportunities myself.</p>
<p>To this end I now recognise how important it is to have a mentor who can help you – especially in the early years. I was one of the first interns within GSMA’s 2017 intake and it was pretty scary coming out of university and into a corporate role. I didn’t really have a mentor but do feel it would have been beneficial. I now mentor others within the GSMA and externally at Queen Mary’s University as I feel it is so important to have someone ‘safe’ who can help you chart your path.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am the only person who can control and direct my career</p></blockquote>
 What do you feel needs to change in the identity sector? 
<p>We need to attract more people into our sector. As yet, it is still a relatively unknown sub-sector of “technology” and I feel I sort of stumbled into it by accident! Most young people would just look at it and assume the only opportunities are in computing or coding. Yet here we are chatting – a Policy person and a Communications person, both working in Identity! </p>
<p>There are so many great ways you can develop your career in this sector – we just need to promote it better!</p>
 In a nutshell, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>As individuals we are all unique in our own way with different skills, qualities and ideas. In ‘identity’, we are all about the individual, yet our teams often look very homogenous. This creates an underlying tone that you need to conform and it is better just to fit in than to challenge the way we do things.</p>
<p>Greater diversity in our teams will bring a different way of looking at the world – leading to different solutions for the problems it faces.</p>
<blockquote><p>In ‘identity’, we are all about the individual, yet our teams often look very homogenous.</p></blockquote>
 What book or film would you recommend to your fellow members and why? 
<p>I recently watched the film&nbsp;Palm Trees in the Snow. It is based on the Spanish novel&nbsp;by Luz Gabas.</p>
<p>After the death of her father, a young Spanish woman embarks on a journey to discovers&nbsp;generations of family secrets. Typically, movies show colonialism from a British or American perspective, so this it was really intriguing to see it from the Spanish perspective.</p>
<p>Also … as most of the dialogue is in Spanish, it was good to practise my Spanish listening skills, though I admit I did rely heavily on the subtitles!</p>
 Finally, what piece of advice would you give to the teenage Erdoo? 
<p>Keep on getting to know yourself.</p>
<p>We go through life prioritising situations and others and we tend to lose sight of ourselves.</p>
<p>Remember that as an individual you will change, mostly without even recognising it. I implore people to continue learning about themselves – their values, goals and ambitions – it’s the only way to stay true to yourself.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Sarah Douglas
<p>I’m the VP of Global Communication and Marketing for SecureKey Technologies, a leading identity and authentication provider that simplifies consumer access to online services and applications. The idea of finding new stories to tell in an exciting way gets me out of bed in the morning, and digital identity is no different. I feel very privileged to be able to tell the digital identity story to Canadians and to showcase how we are leading the world in the ecosystem-based approach of identity. I think one of the most important skills is to be able to find and tell meaningful stories in new and creative ways that are easy to understand – which isn’t very different from the lessons I teach to my kids. Finding meaning in every story helps broaden your horizons and appreciate the unique perspectives of a wide variety of people. Every story is an opportunity to better understand the world around us.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Where I am today can be summed up in three words: determination, flexibility and creativity. I’ve done every job from being a receptionist and graphic designer, to a visual stylist and an event planner all around the globe to where I am now. There is value to be taken out of every role, and I welcomed every opportunity that came my way with open arms and an open mind. You need to be determined in finishing every task you’ve been given to the best of your ability, flexible to go down avenues you may not have considered – but that can bring you to great places – and creative enough to make the most challenging opportunities successful.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>For me, this lesson is very straightforward and applies to every aspect of my life: always be kind to those around you. People will remember your kindness, your willingness to help and your ability to go the extra mile every day. With kindness, people will be more inclined to work with you in true partnership which always delivers the best results. Ruling with kindness will take you much farther than ruling with fear.</p>
<blockquote><p>Diversity breeds creativity in a sea of digital sameness.</p></blockquote>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>My advice to any CEO, whether they’re in the identity space or not, is to know your audience. Without having a good sense of who your target audiences are at every stage of your product’s lifecycle, you’ll fall short of your goals. Messaging won’t hit home, digital and traditional marketing won’t be optimized, customer bases won’t grow as quickly, and investors won’t see your growth potential. Digital identity in particular is a challenging topic to cover – you can’t be everything to everyone right away. You need to start with individuals who understand the value-add and can act as ambassadors for your product before moving on to audiences who are less familiar with the concept. Educating new audiences takes time, and it’s essential not to rush or bypass this process.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity breeds creativity in a sea of digital sameness. Working with a diverse group of different voices and lived experiences allows you to broaden your horizons and see the world through someone else’s story. I subscribe to Miriam-Webster’s word of the day email blasts and multifarious coincidentally landed in my inbox as I wrote this. Good leaders will live their personal and professional lives in the pursuit of multifariousness, or they will always fall short.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>Read – and read a lot. I don’t align with any one genre. Much like my professional drive of telling good stories, reading good stories from any perspective and in any voice is just as important. The more you answer “yes”, the more you can learn (and I am currently reading The Year of Yes by Shonda Rhimes).</p>
<blockquote><p>The more you answer “yes”, the more you can learn</p></blockquote>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Take every opportunity that is given to you, and don’t be afraid of taking chances. I’m so proud of where I am today because I was open to opportunity. I’ve lived abroad, travelled the world and done so many things that required an open mind and a resounding “yes”.</p>

<blockquote><p>Diversity is essential not just for success – but for existence.</p></blockquote>
 Tell us a little bit about you 
Titi Akinsanmi
<p>I am a digital policy expert currently serves as Policy and Government Relations lead for West and Francophone Africa at Google.</p>
<p>I’m also the lead on Privacy for Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>I’m a published academic, with a BA in English from OAU, Ile-Ife in Nigeria; a Masters in Public Policy from University of Witwatersrand in South Africa and an LLM from Osgoode Law School (specialising in Privacy and Cybersecurity).</p>
<p>I was a Fellow at the Berkman Klein Centre for Internet and Society at Harvard from 2018 – 2020; I sit on the boards of digital economy, arts and youth development related institutions and currently serve as an advisor on the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on the Digital Economy.</p>
<p>With over 20 years’ experience in the digital ecosystem, I have learned to live my life focussed on four key principles:</p>
<p>Inspire.</p>
<p>Inform.</p>
<p>Involve.</p>
<p>Impact.</p>
 What drives you forward? 
<p>In my undergraduate years while running for election to the role of librarian, I got inspired and hooked on the famous Latin saying by René Descartes: ‘Dubito, Ergo Cogito, Cogito Ergo Sum. Or… “I doubt, therefore I think. I think, therefore I am.” Where I am today has been shaped by my personal quest to become the change that is needed. For me this has meant transitioning from focussing on the use of technology to creating the policy and regulatory ecosystem necessary to allow innovative technologies to be adopted across all of society.</p>
<blockquote><p>Where I am today has been shaped by my personal quest to become the change that is needed.</p></blockquote>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>Be courageous. Do not allow negative doubt and failure to disable you. Just tell yourself: “I am more than enough and much more” </p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>Let us rethink our approach to data: the ways we use and reuse it and, most importantly, the people and context that help generate this ‘infinite’ resource.</p>
<p>It is the 21st century, and the world is at the fingertips, ears and eyes of those that are digitally connected. Innovations in data and information technology are rapidly outpacing statutes, policies and regulations and 2020 has further entrenched the idea that our social and economic lives are fuelled by data – from video conferencing to healthcare. We have a huge opportunity but this has also brought global attention to the risks and threats (including the issue of data protection in relation to personal consent).</p>
<p>We must continue to press for privacy-based trust frameworks and put consent at the heart of our innovations.</p>
 Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity is the very life blood that enables us to create, exist and succeed! Without it we – and any other living being would cease to exist. Whether in the environment or the identity ecosystem, diversity is essential not just for success – but for existence..</p>
 What book/film would you recommend to your fellow members? And Why? 
<p>Honestly?? There are way too many to name just one. It really depends on the state of mind </p>
<p>Recommended books would include:</p>
<p>Ake by Prof. Wole Soyinka;</p>
<p>Wedlock of the Gods by Zulu Sofola;</p>
<p>The Beautiful Ones Are Not Yet Born by Ayi Kwei Armah;</p>
<p>Weep Not Child by Ngugi Wa Thiongo;</p>
<p>Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe.</p>
<p>And I love to read historical romance !!!</p>
<p>Favourite film is: Black Panther.</p>
<p>Why? These all speak of the experience of those in the minority portraying the, at times, harsh realities of their existence in a deeply divided and biased world.</p>
Black Panther. Source: Disney
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>“Be You To The Full”</p>
<p>Be courageous and you will succeed. Enjoy every moment. Be present in the present. Make memories &amp; don’t be afraid of tomorrow.</p>

<p>Ceramic Network is built to be blockchain-agnostic and multi-platform, with any key able to create and manage Ceramic documents. Ceramic documents are authored by DIDs (decentralized identifiers), which can be managed by any key. </p><p>The primary way this happens today is via <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a>, a hosted account management and authentication system for browser-based Ceramic applications. 3ID Connect allows users to onboard to applications and transact with Ceramic documents by signing authentication messages with their blockchain wallets. </p><p>New blockchains can be supported through a few simple steps to add the keys and signing methods as a valid authentication method in 3ID Connect. &nbsp;As of this writing, Ethereum, Filecoin, Cosmos and EOS are already supported with several more in progress. This tutorial will detail how to add support for new blockchains. </p><p>Try a demo of 3ID Connect <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">here</a>. This is the final part of a three-part series on 3ID Connect. Previous posts:</p>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/what-is-3id-connect/">What is 3ID Connect?</a>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-use-3id-connect-in-browser-applications/">How to use 3ID Connect in browser applications</a>   About blockchain-utils-* <p>All of the core functionality for supporting accounts from new blockchains/networks in 3ID and <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a> is provided by the <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/tree/develop/packages/blockchain-utils-linking">@cermicnetwork/blockchain-utils-linking</a></code> and &nbsp;<code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/tree/develop/packages/blockchain-utils-validation">@cermicnetwork/blockchain-utils-validation</a></code> packages. These library allows the creation and validation of public links that cryptographically bind a blockchain account to a DID method using Ceramic documents. It also allows 3ID Connect and other similar 3ID account management/authentication libraries to create these public links as well as add the blockchain account as an authentication method capable of controlling a DID.</p><p>To add a new blockchain, you will need to implement a few functions in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-3id-blockchain-utils"><code>@ceramicnetwork/blockchain-utils-*</code></a>. Before beginning, take a peek at the library to explore examples of current blockchain implementations such as Ethereum, Polkadot, and Filecoin. Then, continue with the process outlined below.</p> Fork the js-ceramic repo <p>Start out by forking the <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">js-ceramic</a></code> repository on Github. This will allow you to make changes locally to the <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/tree/develop/packages/blockchain-utils-linking">@cermicnetwork/blockchain-utils-linking</a></code> and &nbsp;<code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/tree/develop/packages/blockchain-utils-validation">@cermicnetwork/blockchain-utils-validation</a></code> packages, and then push everything up in a Pull Request once you're done.</p> Adhere to CAIP standards <p>In the interface seen below, note that &nbsp;<code>namespace</code> and <code>AccountID</code> use <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs">ChainAgnostic (CAIP) standards</a>. <code>namespace</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-2.md">CAIP-2</a> which specifies a standard id to represent any blockchain and/or network. For example, this is 'eip155' for Ethereum and 'fil' for Filecoin. <code>AccountID</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md">CAIP-10</a> which defines a standardized way to represent any account on any blockchain.</p><p>If a CAIP standard for the blockchain or network you want to add support for does not already exist, follow directions in the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs">CAIP Github</a> repo to add it.</p> Implement support for your blockchain <p>Implement support for your blockchain in the packages. See the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/blockchain/">Support new Blockchain</a> guide in the ceramic developer documentation for implementation details.</p> Open a pull request <p>Now that you have implemented the required interface and have included the necessary tests with adequate coverage, open a pull request in <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">js-ceramic</a></code>. Once reviewed, it will be merged and released.</p><p>When opening a pull request, please be sure to minimize the size of new dependencies and/or try to use libraries that are likely shared across blockchain implementations. If you include large, one-off dependencies in your PR, support for the blockchain may not be included by default in other libraries.</p> Usage in 3ID Connect <p>After adding support for the blockchain in <code>js-ceramic</code>, it is easy to use these newly supported blockchain accounts with 3ID Connect. 3ID Connect consumes this functionality through the AuthProvider which you've implemented in the <code>blockchain-utils-linking</code> package. You can use this AuthProvider directly with 3ID Connect.</p> That's it! <p>This tutorial covered how to implement support for any simple key pair account on any blockchain in 3ID Connect. However, these interfaces also allow support for more complex account implementations such as contract accounts that may support multi-sig accounts and other account or identity features. It may be possible to add support for other types of accounts in the future as well. If you have any interest in implementing or exploring these types, reach out to us on <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a>.</p> Further Reading <p>Check out the other posts in this three-part series on 3ID Connect:</p>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/what-is-3id-connect/">What is 3ID Connect?</a>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-use-3id-connect-in-browser-applications/">How to use 3ID Connect in browser applications</a>   Questions? <p>Reach out in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a> is a hosted 3ID identity management and authentication system for use within browser applications that allows users to use their existing blockchain accounts to onboard to applications, control/authenticate their DID, and interact with Ceramic documents. We covered a full overview of 3ID Connect, how it works, and various user flows in a <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/what-is-3id-connect/">previous post</a>. You can try a simple demo of 3ID Connect in a browser application <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">here</a>.</p><p>This guide will walk you through how to add 3ID Connect to your browser-based Ceramic application. It is the second part of a three-part series on 3ID Connect. Other posts include:</p>  Previous: <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/what-is-3id-connect/">What is 3ID Connect?</a>  Next: <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">Add authentication with new blockchains in 3ID Connect</a>   Installation <p>Install 3ID Connect into your browser application using npm.</p> <code>npm install 3id-connect@next</code>  Usage &amp; Authentication <p>During application runtime, 3ID Connect can help you onboard decentralized identities to your application while allowing your users to leverage their existing blockchain wallets to provide authentication signatures.</p><p>First, import 3ID Connect:</p> <code>import { ThreeIdConnect, EthereumAuthProvider } from '3id-connect'
</code> <p>Then use an AuthProvider to connect a blockchain wallet to 3ID Connect. AuthProviders typically consume a signing interface and an account or address. </p> <code>const threeIdConnect = new ThreeIdConnect()
const addresses = await window.ethereum.enable()

const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(window.ethereum, addresses[0])

await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)
</code> <p>In the future there will be support for AuthProviders using accounts from many different blockchains and services, however right now Ethereum is primarily supported. In the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">"Add authentication with new blockchains in 3ID Connect"</a> post we detail how to add support for new blockchain accounts as AuthProviders. This would allow your users to use different blockchain wallets to authenticate 3IDs in 3ID Connect.</p> Application Interactions <p>Once connected using an <code>authProvider</code>, you can begin to interact with 3ID Connect. However most often your application will not directly interact with 3ID Connect; instead you will just get a <a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js">DID Provider</a> from 3ID Connect which will allow you and your users to interact with a number of other libraries that require DID authentication, signing, encryption, etc such as <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">Ceramic</a></code>. The library consuming the DID Provider will request authentication and permission from 3ID Connect when necessary.</p> <code>const didProvider = await threeIdConnect.getDidProvider()
</code> <p>For example you can now instantiate <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-idx">js-idx</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">js-ceramic</a></code> with the DID Provider and a user can create and update Ceramic documents with their DID using 3ID Connect.</p> <code>import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/ceramic-http-client'
import { IDX } from '@ceramicstudio/idx'

const ceramic = new Ceramic(&lt;'LOCAL_CLI_NODE_OR_REMOTE'&gt;, {didProvider})
const idx = new IDX({ ceramic })
</code>  Experimenting with Ceramic <p>The simplest way to to get started using 3ID Connect as a DID Provider for a Ceramic node is by running a local node using the Ceramic CLI. To do this you'll need to install the Ceramic CLI and then you can create and update Ceramic documents for your application's data.</p> <code>$ npm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli
$ ceramic daemon</code> <p>Once the daemon is running, the Ceramic API will be available at <code>http://localhost:7007</code>.</p> Additional ways to install 3ID Connect <p>This guide demonstrates how to directly install 3ID Connect into your Ceramic application. However, 3ID Connect is also included out of the box as a dependency in the <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs/libs-web">IDX Web SDK</a>. If you're building browser-based applications and want to use the full IDX protocol for decentralized identity and user-centric data, we recommend checking it out.</p> Further Reading <p>Check out the other posts in this three-part series on 3ID Connect:</p>  Previous: <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/what-is-3id-connect/">What is 3ID Connect?</a>  Next: <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">Add authentication with new blockchains in 3ID Connect</a>   Questions? <p>Reach out in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p>

Other posts:</p>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-use-3id-connect-in-browser-applications/">How to use 3ID Connect in browser applications</a>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">Add authentication with new blockchains in 3ID Connect</a>   What is a DID? <p>DIDs is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C standard</a> for globally-unique, persistent decentralized identifiers. These identifiers have an associated DID document which contains public keys used for signature verification and encryption. There are currently more than 60+ implementations of DIDs, called methods. The primary DID method for end-user accounts on Ceramic is called 3ID.</p> DID Providers <p>DID providers are lightweight libraries that implement the standard <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844">EIP-2844</a> interface for a particular DID method. DID providers allow for creating DIDs, signing data, verifying data, encrypting data, and decrypting data. A DID provider needs to have a currently authenticated DID, then be passed to a Ceramic instance in order to allow the user to perform transactions on Ceramic. <code><a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js">3id-did-provider</a></code> provides this interface for the 3ID DID method.</p> Key Management <p>Like any other asymmetric cryptographic account, DIDs have a public identifier that is controlled by a private seed (pneumonic/private key). Therefore, building applications with Ceramic functionality requires that this DID seed is managed and protected in a secure way. When a 3ID DID is created using the raw <code>3id-did-provider</code> interface, it is up to the wallet or application developer to decide how to manage this seed.</p><p>This flexibility in DID key management is desirable considering the many different runtime environments where you might want to build a Ceramic application. For example in a React Native application, you might want to use the device's local storage to store a 3ID seed. Alternatively, you might want to implement your application using a custodial key management solution so users don't need to worry about keys at all.</p> 3ID Connect: A hosted 3ID wallet for browser apps <p>3ID Connect is a secure DID wallet purpose-built for Ceramic browser applications which offers all the <code>3id-did-provider</code> interfaces, but wraps them in a novel solution to key management and authentication using one or more blockchain wallets that your users already have. By using 3ID Connect, neither users nor developers need to worry about managing DID keys and instead users can rely on the key management of their blockchain wallet(s) to protect their DID seed.</p><p>During the process of onboarding to an application, 3ID Connect makes it seamless for users to create a 3ID, permission one or more blockchain accounts to authenticate/control their 3ID, and grant applications permissions to utilize their DID in various ways using signatures provided by this blockchain account. Instead of needing to provide the raw <code>3id-did-provider</code> to your application's Ceramic node in order to transact with the user's Ceramic documents, you can simply pass 3ID Connect as the user's DID provider.</p><p>This multi-account-to-one-DID model provides resilience against identity loss while offering additional security benefits. When more than one blockchain account is connected to a single DID, the only way a user could ever lose control of their DID is if they simultaneously lose control of all of their blockchain keys. This type of catastrophic key loss scenario is highly unlikely and improves security by delegating and distributing DID key management to all of a user's blockchain wallets. Additionally since each blockchain account is considered an equal "owner" of the DID, any account can remove any other account at any time. This allows a user to deprovision an account in the case that particular wallet account is compromised or lost, without losing their DID.</p><p>3ID Connect also provides many other benefits:</p>  Intuitive data consent management screens let users know which permissions they're giving to the application  Simplified user onboarding flow removes DID creation and key management friction, and remembers which permissions a user has given to an application on future visits so they don't need to sign unnecessary messages each time  Users can publicly link their blockchain accounts to their DID, which allows data associated to the DID (such as linked profiles, social graphs, verified social accounts, other blockchain accounts, application data, etc.) to be resolved by simply looking up the blockchain account   How it works  Architecture <p>3ID Connect is a hosted 3ID account management application that runs in an iFrame window alongside any applications which have <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-use-3id-connect-in-browser-applications/">installed the 3ID Connect library in their app</a>. The 3ID Connect library communicates with the iFrame application over an RPC interface. It implements RPC calls to support functionality in 3ID Connect and most importantly relays any DID provider calls from the application to the <code>3id-did-provider</code> instance running in the iFrame. </p><p>The iFrame application uses <code>3id-did-provider</code> , <code>js-ceramic</code>, and <code>js-idx</code> in combination to support all keychain and identity management operations. It also connects to a community Ceramic node managed by the <a href="https://3box.io">3Box Labs</a> team, to persist all 3ID and IDX related Ceramic documents. The 3ID Connect application is hosted on AWS under the <code>app.3idconnect.org</code> domain.</p> Key Management System <p>3ID Connect uses Ceramic, the 3ID DID provider, the <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX identity protocol</a>, and blockchain wallets to manage the DID's seed and authentication data in a secure, decentralized manner. The various components of this system are outlined below.</p><p><code>3ID DID Method</code>: An implementation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) stored on Ceramic. 3ID Connect uses 3IDs as end-user identities.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js">3id-did-provider</a></code>: A DID provider interface for the 3ID DID method.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">js-ceramic</a></code>: A node that implements the full Ceramic protocol. 3ID Connect connects to this node over an HTTP API and uses it to store 3IDs, as well as other documents described below.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-idx">js-idx</a></code>: A JavaScript/TypeScript library which implements the IDX decentralized identity protocol for keeping track of data associated with a DID in a decentralized manner.</p><p><code><a href="https://idx.xyz/docs/concepts/index">IDX Index</a></code>: A key-value store document which contains an index of a DID's personal information. This document is stored on Ceramic and a reference to it is included in the DID document of the <code>3ID DID</code>.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-20/CIP-20.md">3ID Keychain</a></code>: A document which stores copies of the DID's seed encrypted to their various authentication methods. This document is stored on Ceramic and a reference to it is included in the DID's <code>IDX Index</code>. When a user authenticates with a blockchain account in 3ID Connect, this DID seed is decrypted inside the iFrame.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-21/CIP-21.md">Crypto Accounts document</a></code>: A document which stores a list of blockchain accounts that are publicly linked to a DID, along with their <code>CAIP-10 Link</code> proofs. This document is stored on Ceramic and a reference to it is included in the DID's <code>IDX Index</code>.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-7/CIP-7.md">CAIP-10 Link document</a></code>: A document which acts as a proof that publicly binds a blockchain account to a DID. This document is stored on Ceramic and a reference to it is included in the DID's <code>Crypto Accounts document</code>.</p><p><code>iFrame localStorage</code>: A local store which stores a decrypted copy of the DID's seed (which permanently resides inside the <code>3ID Keychain</code>) under the 3ID Connect domain, and permissions granted to each application under each application's domain. These secrets are stored in the iFrame for convenience and user experience. Even if all data is lost from the iFrame it can always be resynced from the <code>3ID Keychain</code>, using the path <code>3ID &gt; IDX Index &gt; 3ID Keychain</code>.</p><p><code>Blockchain wallets</code>: Key management and signing solutions for accounts on blockchain networks. These providers are used for user authentication and permissions management in the 3ID Connect system. They are used to sign messages, and encrypt and decrypt the DID's seed which is then stored in the <code>3ID Keychain</code>. 3ID Connect currently supports Ethereum wallets, but any blockchain that supports deterministic signatures can easily be added. See <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">this tutorial</a> to learn how to add support for accounts from a new blockchain in 3ID Connect.</p> 3ID Connect User Flows <p>In the next post, "<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-use-3id-connect-in-browser-applications/">How to use 3ID Connect in browser applications</a>," we guide you through installing 3ID Connect in your application. In the section below, we walk through some of the most common user flows that your users can experience while using 3ID Connect within your application. These flows will shed light on how the various components of the key management and authentication system described above work together. Try a simple demo app that includes 3ID Connect <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">here.</a></p><p>Users of your application will encounter one of a few 3ID Connect flows depending on: 1) whether or not they already have a 3ID linked to their blockchain account; and 2) whether or not they have previously used their 3ID with your application. </p><p>Here are the four different flows described in this section:</p>  The blockchain account has a 3ID, and the 3ID has previously used this domain.  The blockchain account has a 3ID, but the 3ID has not yet used this domain.  The blockchain account does not have a 3ID, and the user wants to create a new 3ID.  The blockchain account does not have a 3ID, and the user wants to connect to an existing 3ID.  <blockquote>Some of the examples below show 3ID Connect being used with the MetaMask browser extension wallet on Ethereum, but any other wallet on any other blockchain would have a similar flow.</blockquote> Onboarding Flow 1 <p>The blockchain account has a 3ID, and the 3ID has previously used this domain.</p><p>If the user's blockchain account already has a DID, and if they have already provided your application's domain with the permissions that are being requested during a previous session, the user will automatically be authenticated into your application. No action will need to be taken on the user's part and they won't see any 3ID Connect windows. Because 3ID Connect had stored the keys and permissions in iFrame localStorage from a previous session, they will be used for this session and all future sessions.</p> Onboarding Flow 2 <p>The blockchain account has a 3ID, but the 3ID has not yet used this domain.</p>The 3ID Connect permissions screen will appear in the corner of your browser window.<p>If the user's blockchain account is already connected to a 3ID (likely from using 3ID Connect in a separate application) but they have not yet provided your application with the permissions that you're requesting, then the user will see a 3ID Connect permissions window. After clicking "Continue", the user will be authenticated. </p> Onboarding Flow 3 <p>The blockchain account does not have a 3ID, and the user wants to create a new 3ID.</p><p>If the user's blockchain account does not have a 3ID, they will be prompted with a 3ID Connect new account window which provides them with the option to "Create new 3ID" or "Link existing". If the user clicks "Create new", behind the scenes 3ID Connect will perform a series of actions to initialize a new 3ID and connect their blockchain account to it.</p>The 3ID Connect new account screen<p>First, 3ID Connect creates a new 3ID enabled with IDX.</p>  Create a new 3ID DID on Ceramic  Create a new IDX Index on Ceramic  Create a new 3ID Keychain on Ceramic  Create a new Crypto Accounts document on Ceramic  Store the DocID of the IDX Index inside the 3ID  Store the DocID of the 3ID Keychain inside the IDX Index  Store the DocID of the Crypto Accounts document inside the IDX Index  <p>Next, 3ID Connect adds the blockchain account as an authentication method for the 3ID.</p>  The user is prompted to sign a message with their blockchain account that says: <code>Add this account as a Ceramic authentication method</code> (see above). From the resulting signature, an encryption key is deterministically derived. Because determinism is used to derive the encryption key from the signature, the user is always able to regenerate this encryption key wherever they can sign the same message with this same blockchain account.  3ID Connect encrypts the seed of the DID with this derived encryption key (called an <code>authMethod</code>).  3ID Connect stores this encrypted seed in the 3ID Keychain document on Ceramic.  <p>Lastly, 3ID Connect publicly links the blockchain account to the 3ID.</p>  The user is prompted to sign a message with their blockchain account that includes their DID (see above). 3ID Connect then uses this signed payload to create a CAIP-10 Link document which binds the blockchain account to the 3ID.   3ID Connect stores the DocID of the CAIP-10 Link document inside the DID's Crypto Accounts document.  <p>After the user has completed the steps above, they will now have a new 3ID that can be controlled by a blockchain account. Upon completion, they will see the 3ID Connect permissions window. Once approved, the user will be authenticated. </p> Onboarding Flow 4 <p>The blockchain account does not have a 3ID, and the user wants to connect to an existing 3ID.</p><p>If the user clicks "Link existing" instead of "Create new" when they see the 3ID Connect new account window, they will enter a flow where they connect their current blockchain account to an existing 3ID. </p><p>To accomplish this, 3ID Connect will redirect the user to an external domain where the user can: 1) see their other 3IDs currently managed in their 3ID Connect window; 2) search for 3IDs not currently in the 3ID Connect window; and 3) manage the account linking process. By default, 3ID Connect will redirect this flow to the domain of an 3ID identity management application (to be announced).</p><p>Behind the scenes, this flow will then execute the second and third steps outlined in Flow 3 to add the blockchain account as an authentication method for the 3ID, and publicly link the blockchain account to the 3ID.</p><p>Once the user has completed these steps, they will be redirected back to the original application domain and see the 3ID Connect permissions window. Once approved, the user will be authenticated.</p> Security Considerations <p>The current implementation of 3ID Connect makes a number of usability and security tradeoffs. The development team has a list of planned security improvements for the future, but here are a few things to be aware of with 3ID Connect as it's implemented today: </p>  While the code is open source, the application is still hosted by 3Box Labs. In the future this could be hosted on IPFS and resolved through ENS or IPFS.  Key material is kept in iFrame local storage. While it is sandboxed and we restrict any third party JavaScript from running in the app, local storage is still vulnerable to known attacks.  Phishing attacks and/or malicious websites could impersonate 3ID Connect screens and/or have the user sign a message that allows that attacker to access their DID kept in the iFrame.

<p>The truth is that women don’t self-promote as much as men. But they should and here’s why – Your personal brand is valuable. Demonstrating your expertise consistently will create both career and business opportunities. When your true talents are understood, recognised and noticed, it’s far more likely you’ll be tapped on the shoulder for relevant and interesting assignments&nbsp;or opportunities – you will stand out from the competition.</p>
<p>In 2019 Harvard Business Review (HBR) ran a detailed <a href="https://hbr-org.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/hbr.org/amp/2019/12/why-dont-women-self-promote-as-much-as-men">study</a> where they&nbsp; found a large gender gap in self-promotion —men rating their performance 33% higher than equally performing women. To understand what’s driving this gap, HBR looked at two factors that might influence one’s level of self-promotion: confidence (you may be unsure of your actual performance) and strategic incentives (you may talk up your performance to get a raise or promotion).&nbsp; The HBR results found that men engaged in substantially more self-promotion than women. For example, despite the fact that men and women performed equally well in the given test, men rated themselves an average of 61 out of 100 while women only rated themselves a 46 out of 100. This self-promotion paid off: workers who rated their performance more highly on the 0 to 100 scale were more likely to be hired and offered higher pay.</p>
<p>Many women may feel uncomfortable talking about their accomplishments and promoting themselves directly. But there are other ways to show your skills and knowledge when building a personal brand. Content curation and creation is a good way to share your ideas and build a positive reputation at scale. I would also suggest having a personal LinkedIn strategy that really amplifies your brand and demonstrates your knowledge whilst often helping others.</p>

<p>One of the quickest ways to build your personal brand is by growing a LinkedIn network – reaching out and connecting with your peers, thought leaders, alumni, clients and prospects. Once you have a high value group of people to talk to, you should invest time into sharing your insights and knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a member/supporter of <a href="https://womeninidentity.org/">Women in Identity</a> can play a very important role in helping you to become part of a well-established community.&nbsp; Being part of a group like WiD means that others will help you to shine and “raise you up” which can often be the lift that we all need.&nbsp; This is where “not for profit” organisations really help us to broaden our horizons by giving us access to mentors, coaches, leaders and other members who can inspire us!&nbsp; So, congratulations on being part of something so much bigger that will not only help you but will help so many others too, collectively making a difference by changing hearts and minds on such an important issue.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;Your personal brand is valuable</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are my quick tips for building your personal brand on LinkedIn and getting yourself noticed in an already crowded marketplace:</p>
 
 Optimise your LinkedIn profile page – Spend some time and energy bringing your profile to life. Talk to the challenges you solve for clients, your unique skill set and your deep expertise. Complete the ‘featured’ section on the profile page – add your capability statements, video interviews, articles and press releases.<br>
Remember you are trying to stand-out from 690 million members on the platform! 
 Personalise your Connection Strategy on LinkedIn – It is time to identify who you need to talk to on the platform and get yourself in front of them. Think carefully about who the players are that need to see you and hear you in their feed. Once you have identified this group of people, you need to sit down and reach out individually sending personalised and authentic ‘connection requests’. 
 So, you now look good on LinkedIn and you now have a growing relevant audience. It is time to socialise. Put some time in your diary 3 – 4 times a week to get active on LinkedIn – not just ‘liking’ posts, actually engaging with content and sharing your insight and knowledge – this will be what sets you apart. And if you really want to go next-level share a high value piece of content (once a week), wrapped in smart commentary, tagging authors and publications and adding hashtags – this is a sure fire-way to really build credibility and thought-leadership. 
 
<p>These 3 steps when done well and with consistency will really assist with that all-important personal brand amplification. If you want to become known as an industry expert with a strong point of view you need to embrace a personal branding strategy. I know from working with many senior industry leading women that those who take on LinkedIn marketing head-first are a step ahead of their competition regardless of the gender.</p>
<p>I urge you all to jump onboard.</p>

This is useful for different use cases and enables a new way of identity management.</p> Networks — the backbone of information verification <p>While the information exchange is conducted via encrypted peer-to-peer connections, a verifier requires a mechanism to verify the truthfulness of the presented information. To allow verifiability, distributed networks are used, which contain information to identify the issuer of identity information. When a credential is issued, it is signed by the issuer enabling asynchronous verifiability for verifiers. While the Lissi team is one of the driving forces of the IDunion network, we also support other networks.</p> Networks, which are currently supported by the Lissi&nbsp;wallet:  IDunion test <p>The IDunion test network is operated by the IDunion consortium consisting of private and public partners.

<p><a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a cross-ecosystem decentralized identity protocol that enables users to own their personal information and content as part of a global, open data network. The IDX framework allows developers to build safe, secure applications using user-owned identity and interoperable data. </p><p>The IDX identity protocol is compatible with a variety of data storage backend technologies including <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>, <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skydb-a-mutable-database-for-the-decentralized-web-7170beeaa985">SkyDB</a>, <a href="https://textile.io">Textile</a>, <a href="https://orbitdb.org">OrbitDB</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io">Filecoin</a>, among others - so you can store your application's data in whichever storage stack is best suited to your needs. By using IDX identity with your backend, not only can you can give users control of their information, but you can also import any other data that was created on any other application or domain that also uses IDX - even if they stored their content in an entirely different backend technology!</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y36JvYXwrw&amp;t=7s">This workshop</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/web-playground">associated Github library</a> show you how to easily build browser applications that utilize IDX for identity and SkyDB for data storage.</p> Video Tutorial   Web Playground <p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/web-playground">web-playground</a></code> is the library used in this workshop.

 IntellectEU leverages EW Flex to win Vattenfall’s ‘Balance the Grid’ Challenge at Odyssey Momentum hackathon <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/fPgooLPQB2Y">Micael Widell</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/fPgooLPQB2Y">Unsplash</a><p>Antwerp, Belgium and Zug, Switzerland — 18 November 2020 — Today <a href="https://intellecteu.com/">IntellectEU</a>, an international technology company focused on digital finance and emerging technologies, announced that it won last weekend’s ‘<a href="https://www.odyssey.org/hackathon-2020-vattenfall-challenge-balance-the-grid/">Balance the Grid</a>’ challenge sponsored by Vattenfall at the Odyssey Momentum hackathon. Swedish multinational energy company <a href="https://group.vattenfall.com/">Vattenfall</a> has committed to “fossil-free living within one generation.” For the Odyssey Momentum challenge, Vattenfall asked applications to address “the challenge of incentivizing consumers to communicate energy demand and production to allow all stakeholders to balance the grid.” IntellectEU built its winning submission atop <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-flex/">EW Flex</a>, a suite of software development toolkits that provides the framework to register, clear, dispatch, and settle millions of assets in power&nbsp;markets.</p><p>“Vattenfall’s goal — to ‘enable the entire energy sector to transition from an ego-system to an eco-system, where everyone and anything is incentivized to share demand AND production of green power — is 100% aligned with our focus here at Energy Web: to enable any device, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market,” explained Jesse Morris, CCO of Energy Web. “We’re honored that IntellectEU chose EW Flex as the foundation for their award-winning submission and we congratulate their entire team on a well-deserved win.”</p><p>At Odyssey Momentum, Vattenfall was more-specifically looking for a solution that enables distributed energy resources (DERs) to replace today’s big fossil-fueled generation units as the main source of flexibility in balancing markets. Vattenfall recognised that just having a technical scalable solution won’t cut it. The underlying trust framework between flexibility providers and the grid operator is just as crucial. Given the importance of having a stable grid at all times, grid operators will only open up the balancing market to newly participating assets if they have sufficient certainty these assets will actually deliver when activated.</p><p>IntellectEU solved this problem by extending EW Flex’s functionality with two features:</p>  After DER device registration in a Flex-based asset registry, the asset owner initiates a remote qualification test with the grid operator (or any other trusted service provider). During the test, the service provider checks the asset’s dynamic behavior by sending a series of setpoints to the asset. Based on real-time metering data, the service provider assesses if the asset is capable of delivering the requested type of flexibility. If successful, the service provider can authorize the asset to offer its flexibility to the balancing market. This extension allows massive, automated, and remote onboarding of small DERs to the flexibility market in a scalable manner — including solar smart inverters, batteries, thermostats, heat pumps, and electric vehicle charge&nbsp;points.  Further, each flexibility asset is enriched with a reputation score. This reputation score is a dynamic attribute that is updated after every time period the asset was activated. By comparing actual real-time metering data with the activation signal, the reputation score for the asset is adjusted. When the asset operates within certain margins, its reputation score will increase; failing to deliver the required flexibility would lower the reputation score. The grid operator could then take the reputation score of the assets into account — alongside other variables, such as unit price — when contracting the required flexibility for each time period. This would be accomplished by constructing the merit order of all flexibility bids based on the weighted sum of the price and the reputation score of each asset. Since a good reputation score increases the probability to be contracted at attractive prices, all assets are incentivised to deliver when activated.  <p>Although this represents IntellectEU’s first big foray into the energy sector, it is not their first time focusing on climate solutions. IntellectEU previously partnered with the Demex Group, risk advisors leveraging advanced technology and rich data to manage climate-driven financial volatility, to implement workflows in DAML (a programming language for decentralized applications that run on blockchain and other distributed ledger technology).</p><p>“Our goal during Momentum was to not reinvent the wheel, but to build further on what’s already out there. Building on top of EW Flex proved to be the right choice for us, the existing framework takes care of most of the difficulties related to integrating millions of DERs into energy markets, which allowed us to immediately focus on solving our specific challenge: build a balancing market that is scalable, but still guarantees trust between the TSO and the almost anonymous DERs,” said IntellectEU’s Thomas&nbsp;Smets.</p><p>Energy Web <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/austrian-power-grid-and-energy-web-foundation-launch-proof-of-concept-to-use-distributed-energy-d9a378f5f5ee">unveiled EW Flex in January 2020</a>, as part of a major partnership with transmission system operator Austrian Power Grid to similarly tap into the potential of DERs for that country’s electricity flexibility markets. Since then, Energy Web has rolled out numerous enhancements to its EW-DOS tech stack, including most recently the <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/xrp-ledger-foundation-ripple-and-energy-web-announce-worlds-first-decarbonized-blockchain-5c3cecbff31a">launch of EW Zero</a>, an application to find and digitally source verified, emissions-free renewable energy globally.</p><p>About IntellectEU<br>IntellectEU is an international technology company focused on digital finance and emerging technologies.

 Deutsche ErdWärme Joins Energy Web, Brings Carbon-free Geothermal Energy to Germany’s Energy Transition <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/mKtRlysoims">Enzo Lo Presti</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/mKtRlysoims">Unsplash</a><p>Karlsruhe, Germany and Zug, Switzerland — 18 November 2020 — Today Energy Web announced that <a href="https://www.deutsche-erdwaerme.de/ueber-uns/">Deutsche ErdWärme</a> (DEW) has become its newest member. Founded in 2015, DEW has quickly become Germany’s largest private developer of geothermal energy plants, spanning heat, electricity, and combined heat-and-power projects.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/geothermal-energy-germanys-largely-untapped-renewable-heat-source">Clean Energy Wire</a> called geothermal energy “Germany’s largely untapped renewable heat source.” Despite strong potential, geothermal has to date contributed only small percentages to the country’s heating and electricity needs. For example, deep geothermal contributes just 0.1% to heating and cooling, while shallow geothermal adds only another 1.2%. But with DEW at the forefront, that all could&nbsp;change.</p><p>Germany has the potential to increase deep geothermal 100x by 2050, from 1.2 TWh of heat generation today to more than 100 TWh in three decades. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.agora-energiewende.de/fileadmin2/Projekte/2016/Sektoruebergreifende_EW/Heat-Transition-2030_Summary-WEB.pdf">analysis from think tank Agora Energiewende</a> forecasts that the number of shallow geothermal units could rise from 420,000 today to 2 million or more by&nbsp;2030.</p><p>DEW’s geothermal development is focused on the Upper Rhine Valley in southwest Germany, along the border with France, a region with some of the best geothermal potential not only in Germany, but also all of mainland Europe. In nearby Bavaria, the government is <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/aiming-for-climate-targets-germany-taps-its-geothermal-potential">looking to geothermal</a> to help meet its ambitious climate targets; Munich is looking to geothermal to make its entire heating system carbon-neutral by&nbsp;2040.</p><p>“Geothermal energy is a unique renewable energy as it provides baseload energy. Our plants can both produce heat and electricity and are therefore highly flexible,” said Herbert Pohl, PhD, CEO of Deutsche ErdWärme. “This flexibility is something we also expect and need from a decentralized future energy system. In order for this to succeed, we want to be actively involved in the solutions and see Energy Web as an excellent platform.”</p><p>In fact, a <a href="https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/study-in-germany-on-flexibility-of-combined-geothermal-heat-and-power-generation/">recently released study</a> from Germany’s Federal Environment Agency confirms exactly that. It sees geothermal as an important source of zero-carbon, flexible energy to complement variable renewables such as wind and&nbsp;solar.</p><p>“Our mission is to accelerate a low-carbon, customer-centric electricity system with blockchain and other decentralized technologies. We have seen again and again the need for flexibility to be a key part of the future electricity system,” explained Jesse Morris, CCO of Energy Web. “Many times ‘flexibility’ translates into battery energy storage, but geothermal has tremendous potential to support wind, solar, and other renewable energies. We’re proud to welcome Deutsche ErdWärme into our ecosystem.”</p><p>Today’s announcement comes on the heels of several major developments in Germany and neighboring countries. Last month, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/dena-selects-energy-web-to-build-prototype-identity-registry-for-germanys-energy-market-2580f53b2d20">Energy Web announced</a> it had been selected by DENA, the Germany Energy Agency, to lead on development of a blockchain-based identity register for energy assets. Weeks earlier Energy Web <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/elia-group-and-energy-web-launch-multi-year-strategic-partnership-be2c5d87395f">announced a multi-year strategic partnership</a> with longtime member Elia Group, whose subsidiaries include transmission system operators in Belgium and Germany. And at the beginning of this year, Energy Web <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/austrian-power-grid-and-energy-web-foundation-launch-proof-of-concept-to-use-distributed-energy-d9a378f5f5ee">unveiled a partnership</a> with Austrian Power Grid to use a blockchain-based solution to tap into distributed energy resources for that country’s grid flexibility market.</p><p>DEW’s portfolio includes three development projects in Graben-Neudorf, Waghäusel, and another one close to the company’s headquarters in Karlsruhe. Deutsche ErdWärme is actively working to expand its portfolio.</p><p>About Deutsche ErdWärme<br>Deutsche ErdWärme is Germany’s largest private developer of geothermal energy plants. The company, founded in 2015, is based in Karlsruhe in the heart of one of the most promising regions for the development of deep geothermal energy in Germany — the Upper Rhine Valley. Equipped with several mining permits, Deutsche Erdwärme intends to realise up to twelve geothermal energy projects in the coming years and thus will contribute to a decentralised, reliable supply of carbon-free heat and electricity for the region in the near&nbsp;future.</p><p>The team of Deutsche ErdWärme consists of various experts who have many years of experience in their fields and cover all relevant areas of project development of geothermal energy plants: geology, drilling technology, power plant construction and project management. Over this the company relies on open and transparent communication throughout the entire development process in order to achieve the highest possible acceptance for its geothermal energy&nbsp;plants.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating a low-carbon, customer-centric electricity system by unleashing the potential of blockchain and decentralized technologies.

 Introducing the Lissi Mobile Wallet&nbsp;2.0 <p>TL:DR:</p>  The Lissi wallet 2.0 enables you to establish private peer-to-peer connections to third parties and exchange identity information.  It is developed by the Lissi Team within the Main Incubator GmbH, the research and development unit of the Commerzbank group.  The Lissi wallet 2.0 is available for <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.lissi.mobile.android">Android</a> and iOS (<a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">via testflight</a>).   Wallets: A tool to participate in a digital&nbsp;society <p>With an increasing digital life the importance of trusted digital relationships is paramount for a functioning society. However, to establish reliable communication channels via the internet, it’s necessary to re-invent digital identity. The Lissi team has dedicated the whole year to create an outstanding user experience for the Lissi mobile&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>An identity wallet provides the user with a user interface to receive, store, manage and share credentials as well as establish trusted connections to third parties. Self-sovereign wallets store all the data on the device of the user and handle the necessary technical aspects in the background. The application empowers individuals to take back agency over their digital lives and provide choice for their interactions.</p> The story behind the Lissi&nbsp;wallet <p>Lissi provides software components for individuals and institutions to gain data sovereignty. This includes our Lissi wallet, which we want to introduce in this article as well as our institutional agent. Lissi is a brand of the Main Incubator GmbH, which is the research and development unit of the Commerzbank group. We have been actively involved in the identity community for years and initiated and lead the <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/utility-foundry-wg/blob/master/workflow/stories/IDunion.md">IDunion consortia</a>, which is fostered by the German Government. While we develop the Lissi wallet internally together with the Commerzbank AG, we co-develop the institutional agent together with the Technical University of Berlin, ING-Germany, Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Bundesdruckerei GmbH. If you want to test our institutional agent feel free to contact us via info@lissi.id.</p>Lissi Logo<p>The main incubator already developed a prototype called “Chain ID” in 2017, however it wasn’t user-friendly and well structured. Based on these learnings the first version of the Lissi Wallet was published early 2020. After that we conducted countless code-reviews, improvement processes, design reviews and feedback-cycles to come up with the status quo of the Lissi wallet. Additionally, we tested the Wallet in an UX-lab with experts in the field of user experience (UX) to identify potential problems and further improve the user-friendliness of the&nbsp;wallet.</p> A feature rich user experience <p>The wallet can be used to establish private peer-to-peer connections to third parties and exchange identity information. This information can either be self-attested, verified by a third party or a privacy preserving statement. The wallet illustrates all collected credentials directly when opening the wallet, but also offers a credential carousel, which can be used to get additional information about a particular credential, such as the attributes and the activity. The activity creates the necessary transparency for the user and records when a user shared information with a third party. The credential images illustrated below currently only work in combination with our institutional agent. However, we are looking forward to participating in standardization efforts of such images with the international community.</p><p>The application is separated in two parts. On the left side the user has the wallet, which contains the collected credentials and on the right side the contacts. This product design is not only easy to navigate, but also streamlines the user experience and decreases the initial complexity for the&nbsp;user.</p><p>Furthermore, the Lissi wallet also offers multiple privacy preserving features. These statements (e.g. income &gt;= 40.000 Euro per year) are called zero knowledge proofs or predicates. They don’t reveal the actual information (e.g your exact income), but instead only confirm that the information is equal, above, under or exactly a certain threshold (e.g. 40.000 € per year). Another feature we already implemented is selective disclosure, which enables third-parties requesting information (also referred to as verifiers or relying parties) to only request a subset of attributes of a credential. When somebody wants to identify you and you show your electronic identification (eID) it’s e.g. not always necessary to also convey your&nbsp;address.</p> The status quo and the road&nbsp;ahead <p>This is a beta-launch, hence it’s for testing purposes only. Some functions still need further adjustment and the app might not always perform as expected. This enables interested parties to test the Lissi wallet in their use-case pilots and allows us to get direct feedback to further iterate on the product. A productive version is planned for early&nbsp;2021.</p><p>You can now download the Lissi wallet for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android">play store</a> (Android) and<a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY"> testflight </a>(Apple iOS) and test it with either our institutional agent or one of the many other providers. Because we don’t lock you in our ecosystem and there are many other great SSI software providers, which we are actively working together with to enable seamless data portability and interoperability between different vendors. Should you have any comments or suggestions for feature implementations let us know via <a href="mailto:feedback@lissi.id">feedback@lissi.id</a>.</p>

<p>ID2020 is proud to welcome UK-based BLOK Solutions as its newest Alliance&nbsp;partner.</p><p>Based in London, <a href="http://blok.solutions">BLOK Solutions</a> was founded to help enterprises understand and address their business challenges with flexible, innovative solutions that leverage blockchain and other digital ID technologies.</p><p>Their solutions range from digital wallets for the banking sector, which enables financial institutions to comply with KYC/AML regulations, to an application developed to help monitor progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals by tracking the build-up of plastics in the oceans and changes in land use and the landscape.</p><p>Their most recent solution, BLOK Pass, offers individuals a self-sovereign record of their COVID-19 test results and other risk factors. The technology was developed under the company’s biotech arm, <a href="https://blokbioscience.com/">BLOK BioScience</a>.</p><p>Initially envisioned as a means to help businesses and governments manage the safe and incremental return to public life in the midst of the pandemic, BLOK expects the application to be applied more broadly in the future to support immunization certificates and other medical test&nbsp;results.</p><p>BLOK Solutions chief technology officer, Areiel Wolanow has been appointed to serve on the ID2020 Technical Advisory Committee. An expert in distributed ledger technology, financial inclusion, and alternative banking and insurance models, Wolanow has addressed the G20 and other major world forums and advises central banks, financial regulators, and the UK Parliament on issues related to blockchain and financial inclusion.</p><p>“We are delighted to welcome BLOK Solutions to the ID2020 Alliance and applaud their commitment to privacy-protecting, user-controlled digital identity,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “We are grateful to Areiel for agreeing to serve on the Technical Advisory Committee and look forward to leveraging his extensive experience in this new&nbsp;role.”</p><p>“Times of crisis, like this pandemic, are pivotal for technological advancement. But they also present a concrete risk: that this very technology may be distorted and abused under the guise of combatting a common enemy,” said Wolanow. “We’re seeing this dynamic at play around digital ID, which we consider a basic human right. It’s hard to overstate how crucial it is that we get digital ID right and ID2020 has been a beacon, steering us towards this end. I’m incredibly happy to see BLOK joining the Alliance and thoroughly proud of this appointment to support ID2020 in this&nbsp;cause.”</p><p>We are excited to welcome BLOK Solutions to our community and look forward to collaborating with them toward a future in which all people have better forms of ID that are privacy-protecting, user-controlled, and interoperable.</p><p>###</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p><p><a href="http://www.id2020.org">www.ID2020.org</a></p><p>About BLOK Solutions</p><p>BLOK Solutions is a global technology company focused on accelerating the implementation of blockchain into real-world enterprises.

<p>Collaborating on next-generation standards</p><p>DIF is proud to announce that it has entered into a liaison agreement with the OpenID Foundation (<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>). This provides a mechanism for both parties to work together on areas of mutual interest, allowing working groups to align and coordinate through dual-members. The first major collaboration, which has already been underway for weeks, is a process for revising the Self-Issued OpenID Connect (SIOP) <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">chapter</a> of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">specification</a>. This revision takes place in the AB/Connect working group of OIDC, which focuses at any given time on extending the core OIDC specification.</p><p>Given the foundational nature of this collaboration (and the potential for breaking changes or mental-model shifts in the next major version), the work on DIF’s Self-Issued OpenID Connect Provider DID Profile working draft, referred to colloquially as “did-siop,” has been paused. It is expected to resume, still housed as a work item in DIF’s DID Authentication<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html"> Working Group</a>, after the work on the new SIOP specification in AB/C is finalized. Other collaborations on OIDF work items are also expected.</p><p>DIF members from the group are actively contributing to the new version of SIOP specification through OIDF’s structure and channels. If you are interested in advancing or contributing to this work substantially, you are very welcome to join the calls, details of which you can find <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">here</a>. If you are not a member of OIDF, you may contact the chairs of the DID Auth working group, or the DIF’s Liaison Officer to OIDF, which are listed at the bottom of the working group’s<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html">&nbsp;webpage</a>.</p><p>NOTE: The latest version of the “did-siop” specification has not been approved by the DIF steering committee; it is currently paused at v0.1 and remains an unofficial Working Group Draft at time of&nbsp;press.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093">DIF &amp; OIDF</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The DEON project focuses on the application of blockchains to secure data sharing in private networks and was initiated in 2018 in the wireless and sensor networks laboratory at the Yale Institute for Network Science. The use case of off-grid communication networks was identified with the goal of enabling their full decentralization in terms of data management and identity management. Off-grid (communication) networks are peer-to-peer networks that are autonomous, without super nodes and not dependent on the Internet’s physical infrastructure. Several recent developments like goTenna[1] and the Beartooth[2] offer standalone wireless devices that could be used to form local peer-to-peer networks. Other developments like the well-known Guifi community network[3] in Catalonia, Spain, are community-led paradigms in that space. Although these networks promote decentralization, openness, and fairness, they rely on legacy, centralized technologies for specific parts of their architecture like data and identity management. The integration of blockchains into off-grid networks appeared promising since blockchain provides attributes like transparency, privacy, distribution of governance and decentralization that are highly desirable in off-grid networks.</p>



<p>We chose Hyperledger Fabric as the framework to build our architecture because of its flexibility, performance and the potential we saw behind this huge community of enthusiasts and developers to further advance the technology. After we got familiar with the framework, we identified a key missing aspect: a decentralized identity management component. Unlike the rest of Fabric’s architecture, its native identity management is centralized and based on Certificate Authorities. So we came across the following questions: “which of the nodes in the network is going to host and manage the CA?”, “can we stick with the initial plan of having equal nodes?”and “how can we preserve the decentralization of off-grid networks if we rely on centralized nodes?”</p>



<p>Looking at the rest of the Hyperledger ecosystem, we found that Hyperledger Indy and Aries enable decentralized identity management. We could transform the centralized CAs of Fabric to a distributed CA entity, aka the Indy ledger, so that they are accessible by all nodes but not hosted by a specific one. This approach would work like a distributed oracle of trust in the network but necessitated some changes in Fabric and other extensions in the entire stack to bring DIDs into the “Fabric world.”</p>



<p>Approach and proposed architecture</p>



<p>The first Fabric extension identified as necessary for the integration was an Indy-based MSP to verify identities, signatures and transactions signed by DIDs. In addition, we had to enable the Fabric SDK (Go) to sign transactions using DIDs. For the Indy/Aries part, we leveraged the Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent (aca-py) [4], which is deployed in each node of the network and serves as both the verifier and the issuer in the network. On one hand, it signs Fabric transactions using DIDs and issues credentials to the users of the network, and on the other it verifies proofs and transactions signed by DIDs. The DEON Core Service leverages Fabric private data collections and an interface to IPFS to expose a REST API for secure, transparent, fast and privacy-preserving data storage. An overview of the integration is shown in the figure below. The proposed architecture can be employed by off-grid networks of any kind, from IoT to communication and inter-enterprise consortia networks, for enabling self-sovereign identity and user-centric data sharing.</p>




Figure 1: HL Fabric-Indy/Aries integration




<p>Project outcomes and future work</p>



<p>The work started as a joint effort between the wireless and sensor networks lab of Professor Leandros Tassiulas at the Yale Institute for Network Science and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which put its expertise in decentralized identity to work in the development of the identity parts. Part of the work and initial benchmarks of the architecture deployed in off-grid settings are presented in the paper “A Blockchain-based Decentralized Data Sharing Infrastructure for Off-grid Networking[5].”</p>



<p>Currently the Yale team is working on improving the code to make it more usable by others as a standalone solution for integrating Fabric and Indy/Aries. The team is also working on feature enhancements for the DEON platform, such as supporting Fabric v2, updating DEON identity agents to the latest version of the aca-py agent, extending the DEON REST API with admin functionalities and finally looking for new applications of the platform. The code of the project can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/off-grid-block">https://github.com/off-grid-block</a>.</p>

 Tanveer Hasan &amp; Rahmanuddin Shaik  Session <p>Wikipedia is a group project, and people in the group need to have separate pages to discuss changes and improvements to Wikipedia’s content, be that an article, a policy, a help page, or something anything else. Reading these discussion pages is a vastly rewarding, slightly addictive, experience. Sometimes reading Wikipedia can ruffle feathers.</p><p>E.g. 1:</p><p>The song, Jana-gana-mana, composed originally in Bengali by Rabindranath Tagore, was adopted in its Hindi version by the Constituent Assembly as the National Anthem of India on January 24, 1950. It was first sung on December 27, 1911 at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress. [1]</p><p>Whereas Wikipedia entry of National anthem mentions&nbsp;thus:</p><p>“Jana Gana Mana is the national anthem of India. Written in highly Sanskritised (Tatsama) Bengali.” [2]</p><p>E.g. 2:</p><p>Are these beautiful waterfalls on the Kaveri River located in Tamil Nadu — or on the border between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka — or in Tamil Nadu on its border with Karnataka? Or is it really the Cauvery river, and Hogenakal Falls?&nbsp;[3]</p><p>Whatever you believe, be sure to bring a (Google) map to the debate, and point out that your opponent’s sources are not RS or&nbsp;NPOV!</p><p>E.g. 3:</p><p>Born of Serbian parents in a part of the Austrian Empire, which a short time later became a part of the Hungarian half of Austria-Hungary and is now in Croatia. He eventually became a naturalized citizen of the US.&nbsp;[4]</p><p>So was he Serbian? Croatian? Austrian? Austro-Hungarian? Istro-Romanian? Jewish? American? Martian? You decide! But don’t forget to leave an edit summary saying how pathetic it is to choose any other version. (Guess who are we talking about?) Clue: He is inventor par excellence.</p><p>In this day and age where information is often a touch and go process, a forgotten mode, a solitary quest towards creating knowledge sounds romantic (almost). Networked collaborations (such as Wikipedia) which have created knowledge sites have led to democratic interpretation and assimilation of such knowledge. They also as a basic necessity have sprung up various modes of annotation, verifiability of the Knowledge thus produced and utility quotient of the same. After all, why create and hold on to information that no body really cares&nbsp;about.</p> Plan <p>In this discussion session, the co-leaders of the session shall attempt to peel out the benign face of the visible Wikipedia page(there is a hidden world out there) and discuss the political, technological and social contours of information available on Wikipedia. We shall take the participants through the various stages of discussion about a Wikipedia page and how discussions tend to alter the course of an article. How false consensus is proposed, consent is manufactured and how these efforts are usually defeated by ‘Answer People’ and ‘Vandal Fighters’. It is no less of a war than the one between information and mis-information. The discussion on, calculus, for instance, was host to some sparring over whether the concept of “limit,” central to calculus, should be better explained as an “average.”</p><p>This discussion session brings to the table questions of legitimisation of knowledge and the inherent hierarchies that operate even within open networks of collaboration and offers a critique on consumption oriented knowledge production. The session also aims to ask questions around knowledge as an agent that has levelled some of the earlier existing contours but has introduced some of its own and how that has changed our usages and shapes our experiences.</p><p>The session will involve an edit-a-thon on a topic that will be selected by the co-leaders of the session and live commentary on the discussion pages will be tracked for further analysis. The session intends to build a dialogue towards attempting to problematise the questions of the starkly hierarchical and segmented experiences that have played a significant role in production of knowledge in the era of new knowledge practices. The session also will question the ‘best practices’ in building consent in the present global techno-economic contours of the internet, and its effect on academic spaces, creative practice and intervention.</p> Readings   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Using_talk_pages">Using Talk&nbsp;Pages</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines">Talk page guidelines</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial/Talk_pages">Tutorial on Wikipedia talk&nbsp;pages</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_talk_pages/1">Introduction to talk&nbsp;pages</a>  <a href="https://cis-india.org/raw/www.networkcultures.org/_uploads/%237reader_Wikipedia.pdf">A Wikipedia Reader (pdf, 6.6&nbsp;MB)</a>   Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day2WikiShadows">IRC 2016: Day 2 #Wiki Shadows : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Tanveer Hasan works with the Wikimedia Foundation.

Energy Web will also join IWA’s Sustainability Business Working Group, an issue-aligned working group focused on carbon emissions and related&nbsp;themes.</p><p>As a member of the IWA, EW will collaborate with the organization’s global member base to set the standards for building distributed applications, including appropriate frameworks for tokenizing items of value, writing contracts over those tokens, and privacy-preserving analytics of multi-party data. EW’s Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) is anchored by the Energy Web Chain, which includes a native utility token, the Energy Web Token (EWT). In addition, many of its software development toolkits, such as EW Origin for renewable energy markets, apply a multi-token approach for handling the fungible and non-fungible aspects of digitalized assets such as energy attribute certificates (EACs) that serve as the verified ‘proof of purchase’ for renewable energy.</p><p>“The energy sector is not an island. Though the Energy Web is rooted in the world’s electricity grids, we naturally interface with many adjacent sectors, such as telecom for a fast-growing fleet of IoT-connected distributed energy resources and finance for settlement of grid services,” explained Jesse Morris, CCO of Energy Web. “Membership in the InterWork Alliance is a great way for us to interface with like-minded organizations in a variety of sectors, to ensure that we’re all building solutions that can ultimately work together as part of a bigger&nbsp;whole.”</p><p>IWA frameworks will enable businesses to create standardized token definitions and contracts in non-technical, business terms, and then turn them over to developers for coding on any platform of choice. The Alliance’s focus areas&nbsp;include:</p>  The Token Taxonomy Framework: provides a common language and toolset that enables multiple parties to agree on the definition of a token and how its value can be exchanged or&nbsp;used  The InterWork Framework: allows businesses to compose multi-party contracts from clauses that directly correlate to the token standards, enabling communication protocols to be defined and connected to framework components regardless of the eventual technology deployment  The Analytics Framework: enables organizations to derive additional business value from a privacy-preserving analysis of multi-party contracts, and shared data schema for value-add AI services and market-driven data reporting  <p>About the InterWork Alliance<br>The InterWork Alliance (IWA) is a non-profit, member-led organization creating platform-neutral specifications and trusted certification to define how digital token business processes can interwork regardless of location or market segment. By focusing on real-world projects, market requirements, and performance metrics, the IWA will define tokenization and interworking standards to drive business-level interoperability, multi-party interchange, and trust across applications and networks. Our global membership includes leaders, adopters, innovators, developers, and businesses representing the best practices for every use case the token-powered ecosystem has to&nbsp;offer.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://interwork.org/">https://interwork.org/</a>.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating a low-carbon, customer-centric electricity system by unleashing the potential of blockchain and decentralized technologies.

<p>As the world struggles to contain the global pandemic, cybercriminals are launching their attacks and taking advantage of the anxiety and uncertainty that people are feeling. They impersonate trusted authorities or brands to mislead their victims. This is not surprising as cybercriminals are always on the lookout for opportunities and vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity ranks amongst the top ten global risks, and reducing cyber-risk exposure has become a priority for business leaders, according to the <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Risk_Report_2020.pdf">World Economic Forum’s 2020 Global Risks Report</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, cybersecurity and technology experts overwhelmingly agree that reliance on passwords should be reduced if not totally scrapped: <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Passwordless_Authentication.pdf">80 percent</a> of all data breaches involve weak or stolen passwords, and <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Passwordless_Authentication.pdf">29 percent</a> of all attacks leverage the latter.</p>



<p>The use of passwords poses many challenges. As we increasingly live our lives and perform mission critical work online, safe access to connected devices and online services is more important than ever. The need to raise authentication standards and reduce reliance on passwords is now more urgent than ever.</p>



<p>APAC Marketing Forum</p>



<p>Since 2012, the FIDO Alliance has been working with organizations across Asia Pacific (APAC) to reduce the reliance on passwords and encourage the adoption of simpler and stronger approaches to authentication. Today, we have close to 40 members from both the public and private sector in this region.</p>



<p>Recently, more than 30 representatives from these member organizations got together for the very first FIDO Alliance APAC Marketing Forum (AMF). The AMF, held virtually, was an informal marketing related discussion.</p>



<p>The event provided a platform for members to connect, learn about each other’s markets and share best practices. It facilitated communication and cooperation amongst members, and the authentication industry as a whole.</p>



  



<p>Recent Initiatives in APAC</p>



<p>FIDO members in APAC also have made tremendous progress in recent months.</p>



<p>Companies that deployed FIDO authentication include PrivyID in Indonesia, and Japan-based NTT Docomo and KDDI. Furthermore, VinCSS became the first company in Vietnam to develop FIDO2-certified strong authentication servers.</p>



<p>FIDO also was included in official standards documents developed by the Taiwan Association of Information and Communication Standards (TAICS) and SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) Taiwan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also in Taiwan, the Taiwan-Cathay United Bank has added the FIDO logo to the latest version of its app, which was released to customers in August.</p>



<p>Additionally, we had successful events like the FIDO Security Key Support Campaign, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jnhklee_in-the-afternoon-of-july-1st-2020-a-mid-term-activity-6684348243301822464-d8Rv/">2020 FIDO Hackathon</a> – Goodbye Password Challenge that offered member organizations opportunities to interact with each other despite physical distancing.</p>



<p>Activities in the Pipeline</p>



<p>Moving forward, we aim to organize more of both digital and onsite collaborative marketing events where members can promote their innovations and share case studies. Currently, planned initiatives include:</p>



  FIDO Alliance virtual AMFs to be organized once every quarter, where post discussion updates will be shared through the FIDO Blog  FIDO Alliance quarterly member newsletter&nbsp;  Updated FIDO Alliance orientation material with contents customized for the needs of APAC members  



<p>We look forward to seeing you at the next virtual meeting in October!</p>



<p>—</p>



<p>If you wish to take part in these exciting new initiatives, or have any inquiries, please do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:tsuchiya@fidoalliance.org">tsuchiya@fidoalliance.org</a>.</p>



<p>By joining AMF, you will not only get to connect with key authentication players in APAC, but also gain benefits of participating in FIDO branded awareness and promotional activities together with global champions.</p>

<p>Tangem, a CCI participating company extended the use of their NFC-enabled cards from storing digital currencies to verifiable credentials</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-loperfido/">James Loperfido</a>, Director of Business Development @<a href="https://shop.tangem.com/">Tangem</a></p><p>Edited by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/celiayeung/">Celia Yeung</a>, Chief Marketing Officer @<a href="https://shop.tangem.com/">ID Lynx</a>; Coordination &amp; Comms&nbsp;@<a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">CCI</a></p>Photo from shop.tangem.com<p>We are all painfully aware of the economic and social restrictions imparted on us as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to reopen offices, restaurants, local private and public facilities — and most importantly, international borders — will likely require a flexible, interoperable, and ubiquitous system that preserves individual agency and privacy. The <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</a> (CCI) focuses its efforts on supporting technology projects that work to meet these requirements through the utilization of W3C compliant ‘<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs)’, a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified.</p><p>To contain further spread of the virus and restart the economy effectively, broad access and participation in contact tracing, testing, and other programs are necessary, and a reliable system for managing vaccination records is critical when vaccines become available. Many countries or health institutions are still using traditional approaches like paper certificates, email, and websites to communicate proofs of COVID-19 status of their citizens. However, new digital alternatives, which are cryptographically secure and privacy-preserving — that ensure veracity, portability and interoperability — are emerging.</p><p>As always, new technologies come with new challenges. One of the key success factors of implementing mass verifiable health credentials for targeted groups or the general public, like COVID-19 testing or vaccination results, is the availability and accessibility of the technologies. This means the issuing parties of the credentials, i.e. government authorities or health institutions, should consider and provide solutions to individuals who are less tech-savvy, don’t have constant internet access, or simply do not own a smartphone. Otherwise, their rights and needs to re-engage in society will be limited. Ideally, from a public safety and disease control perspective, someone with a digital or physical wallet that contains their verifiable COVID-19 test results or vaccination credentials could potentially grant them access to private and public facilities or places, such as hospitals, stadiums, nursing homes, train stations, airports, etc, without worries of spreading the virus further. This could be a crucial solution for people to resume their lives socially and for the government to restart the economy locally and globally.</p><p>To that end, <a href="http://tangem.com">Tangem</a>, a Swiss company that enables universal access to digital assets, has been working diligently to expand the capabilities of its NFC-enabled card. Originally intended for personal custody and payments, the card can be used as a physical wallet/storage of digital ID in the form of Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Tangem has a vertically integrated technology stack that is a unique combination of card-based hardware, firmware, and mobile applications capable of signing transactions directly to almost any database. It presents a physical solution for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) that is conformant to FIDO and W3C standards. With respect to COVID-19 mitigation, this inexpensive hardware wallet enables anyone to physically take ownership of their own testing history, vaccination records, and other credentials to ensure no one is excluded by this new technology.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/YDLF3Ce2czs">This video demonstration</a> shows a reference UX flow with Tangem’s own ID application. However, the functionality of the Tangem cards can be embedded in any mobile app through open source SDKs. Tangem continuously seeks enterprise partnerships to bring innovative solutions to the market and has considered the needs for interoperability and flexibility in its products’ deployment. Its involvement in the CCI is no exception.</p><p>Tangem participates in CCI for a few reasons. Firstly, Tangem believes in the foundation of SSI as a precursor to irrevocable civil rights and liberties. Its potential to create interoperability through global standards allows for flexibility and portability among systems and solutions by which all will benefit. Most importantly, CCI is seeking to solve a critical issue that can potentially result in reopening borders, offices and public facilities more quickly and spurring economic activities in a way that respects individual privacy. Thus, Tangem seeks to partner with software providers and solutions that need a physical component capable of offline issuance/verification/presentation of&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>Storing VCs in a hardware wallet controlled by the holder has invaluable implications. Agency, control, selective disclosure, and portability are critical factors in the issuance, verification, maintenance, and presentation of digital identity credentials. Like a physical ID card, these qualities can now be imparted to anyone in the world, even if they do not have a smartphone or constant internet access. Ubiquitous distribution, as we now know, is a prerequisite for solving supranational problems like COVID-19 credentialing given the important role SSI plays in making these credentials universally acceptable. Presenting a COVID-19, or any credential, is as simple as tapping a Tangem card to any smartphone with relevant applications. Physical entry and secure access controls are solved with a powerful and simple UX because of the affordable price&nbsp;point.</p><p>The convergence of identity and payments is a foreseen phenomenon in the digital asset space and Tangem aims to enable self-sovereignty, privacy, and utility to individuals around the world. The unique value proposition of the hardware-based wallet is that the keys or DID can be self-generated within the chip using only the passive power of NFC contact. Therefore, no trusted manufacturing environment is required and dependents can rest assured that the DID or keys are unique and cannot be extracted. By doing so, Tangem hopes to leverage trustless attestations and uniqueness such that identity at a global scale can be easily solved. Currently, Tangem has several public use cases including the National Bank of Cambodia on Hyperledger, Aurus (tokenized gold), <a href="https://tangem.com/new-balance-sneakers-go-digital/">New Balance Real Chain</a> (product authenticity).</p><p>To learn more about Tangem through a live demo and Q&amp;A, please join the upcoming CCI use case group call at 10 am ET on Tuesday, November 10. If you are not an existing member of the group, you can sign up by sending an email (no subject line or body text) to <a href="http://main+subscribe@usecaseimplementationCCI.groups.io">main+subscribe@usecaseimplementationCCI.groups.io</a>, or you can register only for the bi-weekly calls by <a href="https://forms.gle/7kNdCYnyqbUJ2AJB9">filling out this form</a> to receive a calendar&nbsp;invite.</p>

<p>By Mike Kubzansky, CEO, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>2020 has challenged and consumed us — as individuals and as a society. From the pandemic to politics, to the severe economic downturn and the desperate cries for Black lives to matter; too many across the country and around the globe are struggling — financially, physically, and mentally.</p><p>We are at times scared, or angry, or resigned, and a pervasive sense of helplessness underpins so much of current daily life, across whole swathes of society. Yet so many people have remained remarkably resilient and resolute. We have donned our masks and taken to the streets to peacefully protest, help at food banks, or simply serve as poll watchers. We have prayed, meditated, eaten (and then tried to exercise) our way through this year of chaos and uncertainty. Several of us even got new animal companions to</p><p>While everyone has different coping mechanisms, there is one thing I hope we all do:&nbsp;vote.</p><p>As political scientist Larry Sabato said, “Every election is determined by the people who show up.” Whether it’s by mail, drop box, in person, early, or on election day (masked, of course), we must all show up. We believe deeply in democracy. It is the bedrock of this nation, and it will only be of, for, and by all the people if we all vote. That’s why Omidyar Network signed <a href="http://adayfordemocracy.com/">A Day for Democracy</a> pledge to give our staff in the US time off to vote and do their civic&nbsp;duty.</p><p>And when voters do their civic duty, their votes must be counted. We are proud of the work of our sister organization, <a href="http://democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a>, and many of our grantees like <a href="http://communitychangeaction.org/">Community Change Action</a>, <a href="https://demosaction.org/">Demos Action,</a> <a href="http://citizen.org/">Public Citizen</a>, and <a href="http://jwj.org/">Jobs With Justice</a> for their ongoing efforts to dismantle barriers to voting, so that everyone who is eligible can vote with ease — <a href="http://www.protecttheresults.org/">and can trust that election outcomes are legitimate</a>, so that we have genuine majority rule by a full and fully empowered electorate. It’s also why I signed on to <a href="https://medium.com/world-justice-project/a-joint-appeal-to-protect-the-rule-of-law-in-the-2020-u-s-elections-1f1f6876b351">World Justice Project’s letter</a>, along with a number of other foundation presidents, demanding that the rule of law is protected to ensure the security and integrity of the elections.</p><p>We cannot let expediency outweigh accuracy. We must be patient as election officials do their jobs and count every vote, even if it takes extra time before a winner is declared. Ensuring that every vote is counted will enhance the legitimacy of the election and strengthen our democracy.</p><p>While democracy is not a focus area for Omidyar Network — nor is improving its functioning our mission — it weaves through much of our work to strengthen technology and the economy. And pluralism, if true to its ideals, should have spillover benefits that improve democracy.</p><p>In Responsible Technology, we know that online platforms with outsized power can ravage our democracy by allowing unfettered hate, bigotry, racism, antisemitism, and disinformation to run rampant. We support organizations leading the <a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/">#StopHateforProfit</a> campaign to call on Facebook to change its policies that inflame intolerance and undermine democracy. We also support <a href="https://graphika.com/">Graphika’s</a> investigations into domestic disinformation and potential foreign interference in the 2020 election, as well as its partnership with the <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/">Election Integrity Partnership</a>, which identifies instances aimed to “prevent or deter people from voting or to delegitimize election results.”</p><p>In our call to <a href="https://omidyar.com/our-call-to-reimagine-capitalism-in-america/">reimagine capitalism</a>, we recognize that democracy and the economy are fundamentally intertwined. We cannot address one without taking into account the other. Concentrated economic power too easily spills over into political power. That has resulted in policies that prevent the economic interests of the many from being fulfilled. We are working to address these imbalances, and support communities, working families, and small businesses to have greater power and voice in the economic decisions that impact their&nbsp;futures.</p><p>We also cannot reflect on American democracy without reflecting on race. The US is still not living up to its democratic ideal in which all people are created — and treated — as equal. In addition to the continued horror of the 164 Black individuals who have been killed by police through August, we see every day continued work <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/poll-prri-voter-suppression/565355/">to disenfranchise and suppress voting by Black and brown voters</a>. So it’s not surprising that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/us/election-nonvoters.html">some voters drop out of the system and choose to simply not participate</a> — real change has been too slow to&nbsp;come.</p><p>We know that change won’t always happen as quickly as we would like — or many times need — but it will happen. Voting is the first step on this journey toward a more just and equal&nbsp;future.</p><p>As President Obama said in Philadelphia at a rally last week, “Voting’s about using the power we have, and pooling it together to get a government that’s more concerned, and more responsive, and more focused on you and your lives and your children, and your grandchildren, and future generations. And the fact that we don’t get 100% of what we want right away is not a good reason not to vote. It means we’ve got to vote, and then get some change, and then vote some more, and then get some more change, and then keep on voting until we get it&nbsp;right.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/keep-voting-until-we-get-it-right-88e3cb4611ab">Keep Voting Until We Get it Right</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

For instance, our interoperable solution allows airports and airlines to implement the ID verification process without asking travelers to re-enroll information for each trip or sacrifice the privacy of sensitive information, enabling airports and airlines to provide the best experience for customers and employees.</p>
<p>Coming soon, Airside will also enable the sharing of verified COVID test results. Individuals can easily add their verified results to the new Airside App directly from a certified lab and securely share the results with an employer, travel operator, venue, and more. These organizations gain confidence that test results have not been tampered with and are compliant with local public health requirements, and worldwide privacy regulations.</p>
<p>Since 2014, our award-winning Mobile Passport App expedites a safe process through U.S. customs by U.S. and Canadian passport holders. Mobile Passport is the first app authorized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (U.S. CBP) and is trusted by over nine million people.</p>
<p> 3. &nbsp; &nbsp; In what ways does your service/product push beyond the state-of-the-art? </p>
<p>Privacy and security are at the core of everything we build, and now, more than ever, the integrity of our virtual selves is of the utmost importance. We see how identity theft and identity fraud have skyrocketed with the rapid need for technology during COVID-19. While there may be other ways to verify and share IDs and other personal information, Airside does so in a way that is user-controlled and consent-driven, putting the individual in control of their data. This mitigates health and security risks that come with tedious and often inconsistent paper processes, human intervention and low-grade technology.</p>
<p>Our products and services build a connection of digital trust between people and the organizations with whom they share their ID(s). What’s more, Airside cannot access, does not own, and will not sell the information transmitted using our network. We only keep transaction records (which do not contain any personal information) for audit purposes.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; Where do you see the market trending in the mid/long term and how do you see your product/service playing into it?</p>
<p>The paradigm for digital identity has shifted and Airside is uniquely built in such a way to lead the industry with the highest levels of security and privacy standards. Digital identity now serves a critical function for everyday tasks. People are digitally sharing everything, from driver’s licenses and passports to school records and gym memberships. At the same time, the general public is becoming more aware and empowered by well-known privacy regulations, like GDPR and CCPA. Biometrics, for instance, is no longer a topic for tech-savvy early adopters. There is an immediate need for it and the secure transaction of all personal information. So, while people will continue to seek more virtual opportunities to conduct certain transactions, they’ll increasingly look for organizations or businesses that keep them safe, physically and digitally.</p>
<p>A lot of industries hit by COVID-19 are going to rebound and those who commit to personal data rights will do so faster than others. We’re eager to work with industries seeking to keep their employees and customers safe and healthy using our secure, scalable solutions to manage personal information with transparency.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; Why were you motivated to join Kantara Initiative and how do you see it helping your organization specifically, and the digital economy as a whole?</p>
<p>Airside has great respect for Kantara Initiative’s work to make our complex, connected lives ones that are user-centric, consent-driven, and ultimately, built on trust. We were motivated to join Kantara Initiative to help us establish an architecture where a clear, unambiguous information exchange can take place. Using Kantara’s Consent Receipt specifications, we are able to offer our partners a service that eliminates the need for centralized databases of personal information and greatly simplifies their compliance requirements. This also provides our network members with clarity of the scope of their personal information and control as to when, how and with whom to share it in a focused, deliberative manner.</p>
<p>It’s a huge step when we can bind our secure and convenient technology with first-class privacy and data protection principles, as standardized by Kantara and echoed in various data protection laws, regulations and international standards. Being together in the global, thought-leading digital economy with Kantara means that Airside’s digital identity privacy network has put the highest levels of privacy assurance and interoperability into real-life practice.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; What other significant aspects about your organization (service/product) should our global community know about?</p>
<p>Airside has always believed that privacy is a human right and builds secure and convenient digital identity technology in a manner that protects personal information and meets privacy regulations around the world accordingly. We promise to lead and innovate with our core principle, “Privacy First. Human Always.” Everyone deserves to be treated with equality, respect, and dignity because, ultimately, our true identity is as a human always.</p>

				 <p>aNewGovernance supports officially the living-in.eu initiative promoted by the European Commission, the European Committee of the Regions, European Network of Living Labs, Open and Agile Smart Cities (OASC) and Eurocities. “This is a natural fit, declares Eric Pol, Chairman of aNewGovernance. We promote human-centric data infrastructure, where citizen are empowered and can share their data in a managed, fair and transparent way, and where data holders are accountable. By definition, cities are the closest to citizen, delivering trusted daily services, from Mobility and Education to Energy and Culture. It seems reasonable that the City we live in can act as an independent data aggregator. We look forward to helping develop new services for citizen within cities across Europe!”</p>

				 <p>In times when cities and communities are looking to digital solutions to tackle a growing range of interconnected challenges, we must boost these efforts through a ‘European Way’ where digital solutions help to create places where people enjoy living and working.</p>
<p>Digital solutions are broad and include approaches to smart urban mobility, energy efficiency, sustainable housing, digital public services, and civic-led governance. Large-scale uptake and upscale of these solutions are crucial to help our cities and communities meet their climate targets and reduce their environmental footprint, while fostering citizen participation and bringing prosperity to all types of business, including SMEs and start-ups.</p>
<p>Through co-creation with citizens, we aim to bring the economic and social benefits of this transformation to all local communities and implement an inclusive digital Europe, with powerful digital services, technologies, infrastructures and skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			   
				
				
				 <p>6 PRINCIPLES OF LIVING-IN.EU:<br> • a citizen-centric approach;<br> • a city-led approach at EU level;<br> • the city as a citizen-driven and open innovation ecosystem;<br> • ethical and socially responsible access, use, sharing and management of data;<br> • technologies as key enablers;<br> • interoperable digital platforms based on open standards and technical specifications, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and shared data models. </p>

<p>By Jesús Salas, Associate, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>American consumers are increasingly concerned about privacy and data security when purchasing new products and services, which may be of a competitive advantage to companies that take action towards these consumer values, a new Consumer Reports (CR) study&nbsp;finds.</p><p>The new <a href="https://thedigitalstandard.org/downloads/CR_PrivacyFrontAndCenter_102020_vf.pdf">study,</a> “Privacy Front and Center: Meeting the Commercial Opportunity to Support Consumers Rights,” from CR’s Digital Lab with support from Omidyar Network, looks at the commercial benefits for companies that differentiate their products based on privacy and data security.</p><p>The report lays out a succinct timeline for the evolution of consumer attitudes toward privacy that culminates with a clear call to action for innovators. Through their comprehensive research methodologies, CR has been able to draw out the nuance around when, why, and how much privacy and security features matter for individuals looking to use and buy security cameras, connected cars, smart speakers, and other products. The report also contextualizes the role that both rule-making through regulation and the supply of better products can have to meet the growing market&nbsp;demand.</p><p>“This study shows that raising the standard for privacy and security is a win-win for consumers and the companies,” said Ben Moskowitz, the director of the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. “Given the rapid proliferation of internet connected devices, the rise in data breaches and cyber attacks, and the demand from consumers for heightened privacy and security measures, there’s an undeniable business case for companies to invest in creating more private and secure products.”</p><p>Here are some of the key findings from the&nbsp;study:</p>  According to CR’s February 2020 nationally representative survey, 74% of consumers are at least moderately concerned about the privacy of their personal&nbsp;data.  Nearly all Americans (96%) agree that more should be done to ensure that companies protect the privacy of consumers.  A majority of smart product owners (62%) worry about potential loss of privacy when buying them for their home or&nbsp;family.  The privacy and security conscious consumer class seems to include more men and people of&nbsp;color.  Experiencing a data breach correlates with a higher willingness to pay for privacy, and 30% of Americans have experienced one.  Of the Android users who switched to iPhones, 32% indicated doing so because of Apple’s perceived privacy or security benefits relative to&nbsp;Android.  <p>The study draws from a nationally representative CR survey of 5,085 adult U.S. residents conducted in February 2020, a meta-analysis of 25 years of public opinion studies, and a conjoint analysis that seeks to quantify how consumers weigh privacy and security in their hardware and software purchasing decisions.</p><p>Omidyar Network is honored to support this endeavor to both understand and inform the commercial case for investments in security and privacy-enhancing technology. While privacy should not be turned into an out-of-reach luxury, these findings do present an opportunity for companies to be among the first to differentiate and capture market share or leverage consumer’s willingness to pay in the short-term. Over time, we expect many privacy and data security features to become “table stakes,” in which case first movers will innovate and raise standards further.</p><p>Supporting efforts like this is key to our vision of enabling responsible technology that promotes well-being and individual liberty. To accomplish this, we support different levers that drive competition and innovation while safeguarding to manage risks and unintended consequences.</p><p>CR also recently launched an updated and expanded website for the <a href="https://thedigitalstandard.org/">Digital Standard</a> with Omidyar Network joining as a strategic partner. The Digital Standard is an evolving, open source framework used by independent testing organizations, researchers and product teams to evaluate how technologies respect consumers’ privacy and security interests. It serves as a resource for companies looking to implement and take action on stronger privacy and security, as well as ownership and governance.</p><p>We encourage innovators to leverage and enhance this tool to collectively raise the standard on technology, and grow a culture of responsibility within companies overall.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/privacy-front-and-center-meeting-the-commercial-opportunity-to-support-consumers-rights-be9dda3f358a">Privacy Front and Center: Meeting the Commercial Opportunity to Support Consumers Rights</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Omidyar Network’s Statement on US v. Google, Filed Today by the US Department of&nbsp;Justice <p>Today marks a new chapter in the long history of US enforcement of antitrust law. The filing of this lawsuit is recognition that digital platforms, namely Google, have used illegal and improper means to maintain their dominance.</p><p>Over many years, Google has exercised tremendous control over the marketplace of online search. This complaint makes a strong case for how Google manipulated the online search market by paying billions to secure default positions on browsers and mobile handsets to exclude rivals, by denying interoperability to challengers, and by preferencing its own products and services in search&nbsp;results.</p><p>The DOJ did not sue Google because it has grown large or successful. Rather, the investigation yielded sufficient <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/a-legal-roadmap-to-address-googles-monopoly-on-search-engines-effdfbcbc1f7">evidence</a> to show Google has violated US antitrust law — a set of rules that apply to everyone, and are designed to make sure all of us benefit from free markets and fair competition.</p><p>The ideal outcome of this lawsuit is the restoration of competition and safer, more innovative choices for consumers in the online search market. We know that Google’s profit motive influences the content they deliver. Google searches often lead people to Google’s own goods and services, to those who pay Google for our attention, and down rabbit holes of misinformation, hate, and extremism. All of these “results” bolster time spent on the platforms and Google’s revenues. Surely, other search engines, if not excluded from the market, could design algorithms that were safer and more consistent with society’s values.</p><p>Today’s filing is an important first step in enforcing existing laws governing Google’s improper past conduct. But this journey is not over; the legal process could take many years to resolve, and other concerns will need to be addressed. For example, Google also used its online search dominance to develop another illegal monopoly in the digital advertising market. Americans deserve and expect that Google will be held accountable for all of its anti-competitive and otherwise harmful conduct as well as prevented from engaging in similar abuses in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Consumers, competition, our economy, and our democracy have already paid too high a price for what are seen as “free” services. Undoubtedly, Google has provided valuable, innovative services that have become essential to everyone’s lives, creating the foundation for how we live, work, and play. And like other necessities that are embedded in our lives — power, water, cars — technology companies should be held to the highest standards. However, if left <a href="https://omidyar.com/uncheckedpower-the-root-of-big-tech-issues/">unchecked</a>, Google’s practices will continue to create serious consequences for advertisers, publishers, foreclosed technological rivals, and the&nbsp;public.</p><p>To that end, and alongside this case, we call for federal attention toward the ad-tech stack and support for state-level antitrust cases directed at other aspects of Google’s sprawling businesses. Because antitrust action alone will not restore competition to these markets, Congress should also continue to pursue the development of <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3429">new laws and&nbsp;rules</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/omidyar-networks-official-statement-on-united-states-et-al-78d7390fd8c">Omidyar Network’s Official Statement on United States, et al.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The world of digital identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) is evolving quickly, giving much cause for optimism. Standards are starting to connect and move towards functional interoperability, governed by testable protocols. Most of this work is happening on the level of VCs. However, DIDs and their infrastructure are also starting to converge and mature as an extensible-yet-interoperable technology.</p><p>Adoption by markets, standards bodies and regulators is largely contingent upon provable security and provable interoperability, so these promising developments cannot come soon&nbsp;enough.</p><p>The Digital Identity Foundation (DIF) is very proud to be hosting one particular research and development project that could prove pivotal in this process. It is currently a work item of DIF’s <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>. However, a charter for an autonomous working group will be available for review at <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">#IIW31</a> this week (20–22 October 2020) to facilitate broader participation. The project is called KERI and it is a project that could only be developed in the open, for the public good and for the widest, quickest adoption.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pucelano">Fernando Santander</a> But first, what is&nbsp;KERI? <p>KERI stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. A “key event” is a discrete event in time that involves public/private keypairs, often called blockchain identities or cryptographic identities. These events can be generalized as inceptions (creations), rotations, and signing events: the three kinds of events for which KERI generates and handles receipts. In other words, key events are cryptographic events in the history of an identifier.</p><p>Importantly, everything else a decentralized identifier says, does, or refers to is not a key event. As KERI is deliberately laser-focused on key events only, we can call these other events non-KERI events. The real world consequences of a signature or rotation are out of scope and method-specific to boot. KERI is only interested in the most universal aspect of interactions between keys and cryptographic systems, i.e. the cryptography that allows drastically different DID systems to trust each other’s security guarantees.</p><blockquote>“DID Methods exist to solve a trust issue. This does it in a different way.”</blockquote><blockquote>Charles Cunningham (Jolocom GmbH, Rust development lead for&nbsp;KERI)</blockquote><p>Each key event produces a receipt containing only checkable signatures of key event information. Nothing more. Receipts are threaded into logs tracking the history of each identifier, which is similar to a traceable audit trail of hashes — useful for confirming but not for deducing the underlying key material. These threads are compiled into logs that are shared and replicated according to a consensus algorithm and a logic of trust thresholds that creates a fabric of shared history between&nbsp;nodes.</p> Is KERI a blockchain or a DLT? No. Does it replace blockchains? Also&nbsp;no. <p>The trust fabric created when KERI nodes share and propagate key material records&nbsp;might</p><p>sound redundant to the blockchains where all of today’s DID methods store their key material chronologically. To a degree, this is true: each log containing the history of one key is a “microledger,” like a blockchain with only one participant. Inception and rotation events in all of today’s DID methods are stored in a chronological distributed ledger which can be crawled to create a log of these key events by DID. So, why the redundancy? Why replicate a subset of the blockchain’s capabilities and features in a distinct blockchain-like infrastructure just for key material?</p><p>The answer is simple and manifold: blockchains enable many features outside the scope of KERI. These features bring with them complexity, diversity, scale costs, and trust issues. Within KERI’s scope, however, only some of a blockchain or distributed ledger technology’s (DLT’s) features are necessary. Total ordering and double-spend protection, for instance, are hallmarks of distributed ledgers, but hardly justify the added complexity here.</p>Subset of blockchain/DLT capabilities required by KERI (<a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/KERI2_Overview.web.pdf">Dr Sam Smith</a>,&nbsp;2019)<p>Working backwards from a short list of security features, KERI infrastructure can be a much more performant, minimalist distributed ledger system. It is still in the family tree of blockchain, DLTs and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), but it is closer to a sidechain or a trans-blockchain interoperability mechanism. In use cases where all that is needed is a self-certifying, widely-portable identifier, KERI can stand alone as a lightweight DID method. In combination with a traditional DID Method, KERI can increase key management options and strengthen security guarantees by raising a red flag at the first discrepancy between the two parallel and redundant systems.</p><p>As a scaling mechanism, KERI can also take away some of the traffic and complexity from the underlying blockchain. In implementations where key management and state maintenance (record keeping about keys that rotate over time) are entrusted directly to the KERI mechanism, these functions can be operated much closer to the edge and replicate after a slight delay. This might be a totally acceptable trade-off of efficiency for latency in many use cases. For example, a roundtrip write-and-wait-for-finality transaction on a global blockchain makes no sense in a low-connectivity Internet of things (IoT) use case, where double-spend is a non-issue.</p> KERI is both an interoperability mechanism and a standardization incentive <p>More importantly for the DIF, however, is another major feature of KERI: it could become the foundation of massive interoperability and portability at the infrastructure layer. What’s more, if adopted by enough major players, it could even speed up the standardization process of DIDs themselves. By offering a minimum level of security guarantees shared across all participating methods, it would simplify the security review process for both individual DID methods and for interoperable DIDs as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>By abstracting out the universal, minimal set of key functions, a KERI log that spans multiple ledgers or methods is just as verifiable as one that does not. This means that&nbsp;anywhere</p><p>self-certifying KERI identifiers are accepted, an identifier’s history can stretch back further than the existence of KERI. Plus, that history can include so-called “portability events”, where an identifier is deactivated on one ledger and re-activated on another. Method-specific features or records might still need to be exported and imported. The core proof of control function of a DID, however, would be universalized in a way that enabled massive portability.</p><p>This same universalizing effect of sharing a security vocabulary across all participating DID methods has the added benefit of being able to guarantee certain security features in any KERI-compliant system. Since KERI also lends itself to simple compliance tests, and since KERI logs give a benchmark against which to test method-specific and blockchain-specific security, this is a small leap for each DID method and a giant leap for standardization and security engineering.</p> KERI’s history: from whitepaper to community incubation <p>So far we have been highly technical in our explanation of the project. A careful reader, however, may already have caught the community commitment implicit in phrases such as “KERI-compliant” and “participating DID methods.” KERI is only useful if the major DID methods incorporate it, or if the set of participating DID methods becomes congruous over time with the set of major DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>It is, in a nutshell, a community project of alignment as much as a technological innovation: an agreement on the security model for the common core functionality shared across all DID methods, allowing much variety and extensibility to be preserved by the participating DID methods. Decentralized identifiers have been very decentralized in their design and governance from the beginning, with a high degree of extensibility and flexibility within the fiefdom of each DID method and its governance. KERI has been gathering steam for over a year as a countervailing force, potentially making all DIDs function in an end-verifiable and thus universal way.</p><blockquote>“Investing in KERI is investing in interoperability, standardization, and cross-community security guarantees.”</blockquote><blockquote>Dr Sam Smith, author of the KERI whitepaper and project&nbsp;lead</blockquote><p>In large part, the roots of KERI lie in debates within the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a>. For years it has been discussing the “shalls” and “mays” that define a W3C-compliant DID method (and thus a DID system). In practical terms, this process specifies what each DID method can and must assume about other DID methods for such a decentralized and open system to make appropriate security guarantees.</p><p>KERI’s creator and the author of its whitepaper is Samuel M Smith PhD., a pioneering technologist in multiple fields, including automated reasoning, distributed systems, autonomous vehicles and blockchain protocol design. Dr. Smith has been refining and experimenting with such a cross-method mechanism since 2019, presenting at every meeting of the biannual Internet Identity Workshop. First came some core principles and requirements of a key infrastructure at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/OffChain_(PKI)_Key_Management_%E2%80%93_Revocation_Rotation">IIW28</a>, then at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI:_1_Universal_DKMI_Root(s)_of_Trust_Decentralized_Systems_Primitires_%26_DKMI_Last_Mile_of_Trust">IIW29</a> a series of sessions about different aspects of a hypothetical system of witnesses that could replicate logs. For <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_(C)_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">IIW30</a>, Dr Smith brought more concrete sessions on finer points and even the roadmapping session that became the DIF working group. Along the way, he has iterated an ever-growing <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">whitepaper</a> describing and explaining all of&nbsp;this.</p><p>Now, however, Dr Smith has moved the project into the DIF under the auspices of its <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a> where he sits as co-chair. Asked about the decision, Dr Smith said, “DIF was a natural choice because I wanted the work to happen quickly but in the open, with participation from the greatest number of companies and innovators across various communities.”</p> KERI’s contributors: join&nbsp;us! <p>Foremost among DIF contributors is, of course, Dr Smith, who brings to his KERI design work more than a decade of engineering experience with scale and high-performance systems. Much of this work, focusing largely on AI and streaming/scaling projects, was done through his Python-centric consulting company <a href="http://prosapien.com">Prosapien.com</a>. He has also worked with Consensys, contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/reputage/seedQuest">Seed Quest</a> project among others, soon to be donated to&nbsp;DIF.</p><p>Berlin-based <a href="https://jolocom.io/">Jolocom GmbH</a> has been a major interlocutor in the early development of KERI, since before the creation of the working group at DIF. Jolocom’s Charles Cunningham is the working group’s lead Rust developer, who has written a highly interesting post about mental models of <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/how-keri-tackles-the-problem-of-trust/">How KERI tackles the problem of trust</a> from a developer’s point of view for the Jolocom&nbsp;logbook.</p><p>Representing <a href="https://www.spherity.com">Spherity GmbH are the working group’s lead </a>JavaScript developer and note-taker. Spherity’s founder, Carsten Stöcker, has written a detailed piece for his company’s blog which called KERI “<a href="https://medium.com/spherity/introducing-keri-8f50ed1d8ed7">a more performant ledger for trusted identities</a>.”</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation, a Swiss-based non-profit, has been co-developing on the Rust side as well, working in parallel and providing input on the design considerations. The Human Colossus Foundation has also put substantial energy into promoting and socializing KERI in the Trust-over-IP Foundation, the MyData community and in the Sovrin community, including featuring an hour-long KERI <a href="https://vimeo.com/459348260">session</a> prominently in a half-day <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/invitation-core-public-utility-technologies-for-a-next-generation-internet">mini-conference</a> it organized.</p><p>At IIW31, the KERI developers will be demonstrating their initial work to date while there is still the opportunity to get involved and determine the course of KERI as the project moves from direct mode (two-party) to witness mode (multi-party, distributed consensus). Many sessions are planned for IIW, ranging from introductions to technical discussions to use-case and requirements gathering for KERI-based ideas. Additionally there will be a live demo of the working direct-mode prototype.</p><p>Introductory reading and video materials are collected at the main DIF <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">repository</a>, but even if you don’t watch them in advance (or fully understand them if you do), there are many ways to get involved and make this community project stronger and more&nbsp;diverse.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/keri-for-every-did-a-microledger-f9457fa80d2d">KERI: For every DID, a microledger</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>When the ToIP Foundation launched in May 2020, our mission was to define a new model for achieving trust online—a model that breaks away from the thousands of siloed solutions for secure, privacy-enhancing digital identity and trust that do not work with each other. This lack of interoperability costs billions of dollars per year in complicated and time-consuming integration and hinders adoption by the very customers we are trying to serve.</p>



<p>Our goal is to drive adoption of a new model for digital trust based on open standard digital wallets and digital credentials that are every bit as interoperable as the physical wallets and paper or plastic credentials that we use every day—to do everything from getting on a plane to entering a hospital to signing a mortgage. As these new tools emerge as the primary mechanism for contactless identity verification, payments, and other online transactions, they will become as essential to our digital lives as browsers and email clients have become to the Web today.</p>



<p>As that happens, it is critical to avoid recreating the vendor-lock in and fragmentation of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser wars</a>” that hindered the early days of the Web. Interoperable solutions that avoid vendor lock-in are paramount for a vibrant digital marketplace where consumers are free to choose their preferred digital wallet software from a variety of vendors and use digital credentials from any issuer as they choose.</p>



<p>The need for market-driven interoperability</p>



<p>Open standards alone do not produce interoperable market solutions—there are too many ways interoperability can still go off the rails. Testing labs are another step in the right direction—but vendors need incentives to use them, and those incentives can be scarce in a new market.</p>



<p>The ToIP Foundation recognized that, as our economy grows increasingly digital and collaboration tools grow steadily more powerful, there is a new path to interoperability: tapping market dynamics to drive incubation and adoption of truly interoperable solutions.</p>



<p>With this approach, vendors and customers voluntarily work together to develop interoperability testing requirements designed to meet explicit customer needs in the market. Vendors then satisfy those requirements by passing these interoperability tests with production-ready software.</p>



<p>Introducing the ToIP Interoperability Profile (TIP)</p>



<p>To facilitate this new approach to market-driven interoperability, the Technology Stack Working Group of the ToIP Foundation developed the <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/technical-stack-wg/blob/master/TIP_LIFECYCLE_MANAGEMENT.md">ToIP Interoperability Profile (TIP)</a>. A TIP represents a specific combination of technologies that span each of the four layers of the ToIP technology stack in order to meet the requirements of a set of target customers in one or more digital trust ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>TIPs can be designed, refined and supported by multiple vendors and customers wishing to collaborate on interoperability. A TIP typically includes the following elements critical to customer success:</p>



  Use cases capturing the specific requirements of customers in one or more digital trust ecosystems.  Design principles that must be clearly defined when combining technology and business policies to formulate a solution architecture.&nbsp;  Documentation that clearly communicates the design, architecture, features, and benefits of a TIP to the digital trust ecosystems targeted for adoption.  Best practices and implementation guidance for adoption of a TIP, including how to incorporate policies from the ToIP governance stack.  Interoperability tests that enable vendors supporting the TIP to be certified for verifiable interoperability.  Adoption metrics and case study references that provide quantifiable evidence of the real market impact.  



<p>TIPs harness market forces to drive convergence on interoperability</p>



<p>Each TIP consists of two types of components:</p>



  Fully-standardized components of the ToIP stack. These components, called ToIP Standard Specifications (TSS), are standards that have already gained Foundation-wide approval.&nbsp;  Custom components that are specific to a TIP. Some places in the ToIP stack do not yet have agreed-upon specifications. For these gaps, a TIP must specify how it fills the gap via an open community specification that can be implemented by any vendor or open source project.  



<p>A conceptual “lego block” picture of a complete four-layer TIP—showing how it is constructed from a combination of standard TSS components and custom TIP-specific components—is shown in the figure below.</p>



  



<p>Launching the Saturn-V TIP</p>



<p>The first TIP published by the ToIP Technology Stack Working Group is named for the historically significant multi-stage rocket platform, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V">Saturn-V</a>. This TIP emerged from work begun at a 2019 Connect-a-Thon event held by the Hyperledger Indy community. When the ToIP Foundation was launched in May 2020, ToIP members including Commerzbank (Main-Incubator), esatus AG, Evernym, IBM, Trinsic and idRamp recognized the opportunity to coalesce their collaboration into a TIP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the ToIP Technology Stack Working Group was formed, it established the criteria for managing the lifecycle of TIP from incubation through design, demonstration, acceptance and adoption. The Saturn-V collaborators then proposed their TIP following this process and it was formally accepted as a Draft Deliverable by the Technology Stack Working Group at their 24 August 2020 meeting.</p>



<p>The next stage: mission-critical collaboration on interoperability testing</p>



<p>All the vendors participating in the Saturn-V TIP actively pair with developers from other participants to work through agreed-upon test plans. Having the Technology Stack Working Group oversee the TIP development life cycle on behalf of all participating vendors ensures a more transparent and robust joint testing project than a typical multi-vendor “plug-fest”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the technologies used for the Saturn-V TIP are Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries at<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack/img/fig-1-toip-full-stack-2020-05-06.png?raw=true"> layers 1-3 of the ToIP Technology Stack</a>, the open source Aries Test suites will be used as the baseline for all test plans. Participating vendors are currently tackling the following stages of the Saturn-V Interop Test Plan One:</p>



  Self-Validation against Aries Protocol Test Suite for Aries Interop Profile v. 1.0  Peer-Validation
 
 Core Aries Interop Profile v. 1.0 (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile">Aries RFC 302</a>), which supports DID connections, issuing credentials, and fulfilling proofs 
 Connectionless Proofs using the Service Decorator (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0056-service-decorator">Aries RFC 56</a>), 
 HTTP over DIDComm (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0348-transition-msg-type-to-https">Aries RFC 348</a>). 
 
  



<p>Future missions</p>



<p>Once Test Plan One is complete, TIP Participants will define Saturn-V Interop Test Plan Two which intends to minimally include peer-to-peer validation for:</p>



  Core Aries Interop Profile v. 2.0 (content and scope not yet defined by community)  Out-of-Band Protocol (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0434-outofband">Aries RFC 434</a>)  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness">End-to-End testing the Aries Agent Test Harness</a> (contributed by the Government of British Columbia)  



<p>Once these stages of interoperability testing are completed, the Technology Stack Working Group will be able to assess whether component specifications of this TIP meets the criteria to become a TSS. If so, these will be advanced to become their own Draft Deliverables for ultimate approval by the Working Group and then the ToIP Steering Committee.</p>



<p>Please join us</p>

<p>In December last year members elected the first Digital Identity NZ Executive Council. The Council is the governing group for the association; providing guidance and direction as we navigate the developing world of digital identity in Aotearoa. Each Council member is elected for a two-year term, with elections held annually and results notified at the Annual Meeting in December. As&nbsp;we approach the end of the year it is time for us to call for nominations for the Council seats coming up for re-election.</p>



<p>This year we have&nbsp;four&nbsp;positions up for election, two each in the Major Corporate and SME/Startup categories.<br><br>When we formed the Executive Council last year we asked that you consider electing a diverse group of members who reflect the diversity of the community we seek to support. You did that. The power of that diversity has shone through in the work of the Council this year, especially as we consider the importance of Te Tiriti in a well-functioning digital identity ecosystem.<br><br>As the Council has reflected on its own makeup we have identified a number of areas where diversity would continue to improve our ability to serve the community. We would particularly welcome nominations from those involved in healthcare and kaupapa Māori organisations. We are also encouraging nominations from young people from within your organisations, as a youth perspective is incredibly important and pertinent to the work we do.<br><br>Once elected in December, one of the first duties of the new Council is to elect leadership roles. David Morrison has held the Chair role since our inception in 2018, and is an exceptional Kaiārahi (guide/counsellor/leader). David’s term on Council extends to 2021, and he has indicated that he is likely to step down from the Executive Council at that time. Our plan this year is for the Council to select two co-chairs to aid in a smooth transition. The opportunity to chair is open to any Council member, and we encourage any who have a desire and passion to serve in this way to make themselves available for nomination.<br><br>2021 is a pivotal year for digital identity with the introduction of the Digital Identity Bill and further development of the ecosystem. We are looking forward to some stellar nominations to help us in exploring and pursuing the best opportunities for Digital Identity NZ to make a positive difference in 2021 and beyond.</p>



<p>Executive Council Nominations</p>



<p>There is now an opportunity to put yourself forward or nominate someone else for a role on the Digital Identity NZ Executive Council. This year we have vacancies for the following positions:</p>



  Corporate&nbsp;– Major (2&nbsp;positions)  SME &amp; Start-up (2&nbsp;positions)  



<p>The nominees for the above positions must be from a Digital Identity NZ member organisation, and be from the same Digital Identity NZ Group that they are to represent on the Executive Council.<br><br>All nominations must be entered into the&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/3LRhbYXTWgVKx4Km8">online form here</a>&nbsp;by 5pm, Thursday 5 November 2020.</p>



<p>Digital Identity NZExecutive Council roles and responsibilities include:</p>



  Direct and supervise the business and affairs of Digital Identity NZ  Attend monthly Executive Council meetings, usually two&nbsp;hours in duration (video conferencing available)  Represent Digital Identity NZ at industry events and as part of&nbsp;delegations  Assist with managing and securing members of Digital Identity NZ  Participate in Digital Identity NZ working groups and projects  Where agreed by the Executive Council, act as a spokesperson for Digital Identity NZ on particular issues relating to working groups or projects  Be a vocal advocate of Digital Identity NZ  



<p>Online Voting</p>



<p>Voting will take place online in advance of the meeting. The results will be announced at the Annual Meeting. Please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2020/10/Digital-Identity-NZ-Charter-September-2020.pdf">Charter</a>&nbsp;for an outline of Executive Council Membership and election process. Each organisation has one vote that is allocated to the primary contact of the member organisation.</p>



<p>Annual Meeting Details</p>



<p>The Annual Meeting is scheduled for 9.30am on Thursday 10 December 2020 and is to be held via Zoom. Register for the event&nbsp;<a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_sPfcBDJ2SR6gkCkU5PGoiA">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What standards are and what it means to make them&nbsp;openly</p><p>I<a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76">n our last post</a> in the series, we drilled down into a granular definition of “open-source” development and the thinking that goes into a choice of license. In this post, we drill down into what “standards” are, and the characteristics of an “open process” for developing standards. Supporting these open standards is where the bulk of DIF’s efforts and resources are focused. In the next post in the series, we will turn to how open source and open standards work together to create new business models and strategies with real-world consequences for cooperation, “coöpetition,” and healthy&nbsp;markets.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jimquenzer">Jim&nbsp;Quenzer</a><p>It is worth noting up front that the term standard has two slightly different usages. One is related to quality assurance or business process compliance — think of marketing that references “the highest standards of _____ ”. This refers to specifications and metrics used to grade outputs in a regulated industry or sector, like “Grade A Beef”. These are set and enforced by some combination of regulators, private-sector auditors and industry associations. Outside of software, this is usually what people refer to by “standardization:” and a specialist in any industry can wax eloquent on the politics and the consequences of decisions by standards bodies fixing those specifications and&nbsp;metrics.</p><p>In software and other IP-driven industries like medicine or engineering, standards have more to do with control and portability of data, enforcing measurable compatibility with the products of others. A common metaphor for this kind of standardization is the width or “gauge” of railway tracks — how far apart the rails are is a somewhat arbitrary decision but if they are different between two countries or regions they will have completely distinct rail systems. Software standards work much the same way, and for this reason standardization is often a prerequisite of procurements from government or substantial investments in the private sector. No one wants to invest in locomotives if all the places they want to take it… use different rails.</p><p>In the software world, as in the world of trains, standards define a given market for products and services. Compliance tests make objective (and far less controversial) the question of whether or not a given product meets a given set of requirements. Explicitly-defined, testable protocols make products provably swappable and/or interoperable. Open standards processes try to define those tests and protocols in the open, with input from initial and future contenders in that market, speeding up the timeline to legitimacy by incorporating major players and incorporating widely-sourced input.</p> Standards processes, as inherited from tangible industries <p>One way to explain standards processes is to begin with some examples in the physical world, which we learned about as matters of fact in our education. These evolved to support the creation of precise manufacturing methods and to support more seamless commerce, giving stability and safety to commodity markets. Weights and measures are classic standards that support for both: after all, there is nothing natural about our units of measure or currencies, as anyone who’s used both metric and non-metric measures knows all too well. How long is something? How heavy is something? How much liquid is in a gallon or&nbsp;liter?</p><p>Standardizing these kinds of measures was a quantum leap for commerce and mercantilism: it gave everyone a common reference point and enabled accounting systems (and “ledgers”) of vastly wider scope and simplicity. The fact that standards have been decided at the international level means it can happen on a global scale. The metric system, for example, is defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, an international standards development organization (<a href="http://unicode.org/faq/sdos.html">SDO</a>). There is little debate in 2020 about what a gram is (it’s the weight of one milli-liter of water), but things like tolerance or accuracy in weighing and marking system is still an ongoing matter of debate and specification carried out&nbsp;there.</p><p>Another physical world standard is the <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691170817/the-box">shipping container</a>. A whole global infrastructure has been built around this standard-sized container that allows it to be put on truck beds, shipped on train cars and put in ships that go around the world. It also means if you can fit whatever your thing is inside that box it can get to almost anywhere in the world because there is a standards based infrastructure that can handle it. Massive economies of scale (which have terraformed geopolitics by enabling high-throughput, high-efficiency global trade networks) are unlocked by this kind of standard, which enables the movement of containers (in most cases with no knowledge, or no direct knowledge, of what is inside them) to become a kind of commodity whose price stabilizes and steadies far-flung trade. The analogy to the “packets” or “data points” of modern information technology has been a mainstay of thinking about software business models for decades, and W3C Verifiable Credentials are <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">no exception</a>.</p><p>Similar standards also govern the electricity coming out of the walls in our houses, which has become so reliable and ubiquitous over the last century that few people outside of the relevant industries think much about it, or how dangerous it would be if standards were loosened. The “amount” (load and speed) of electricity, as well as the physical form factor of plugs, wiring, and circuit boards are all standardized at the national or regional level. This creates regional economies of scale in both the delivery of energy as a resource and in the manufacturing of electricity-powered products. Indeed, much of software engineering as an academic discipline and a labor market, as well as many standards around data and their governing standards bodies, evolved out of the electrical and communications infrastructure that preceded the advent of modern software.</p> Standards processes, for bits and&nbsp;bytes <p>Digital technology also needs explicit and testable standards, deliberated by specialists and engineers in a transparent process for the common good and for the stability of huge systems of capital and human effort. As the internet has evolved, the bulk of this effort has focused on the definition of common protocols that allow information to be exchanged by different computer systems, potentially written in very different languages and operating across very different topographies, with very different inputs and automations and governance structures.</p><p>The protocols that make up the modern internet were originally created by the group that began building the ARPA network. In 1986 the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Forcehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force">IETF</a>) formed and it is still the steward of many key protocols that form the basis of much of the internet, particularly around security and load-balancing at massive, infrastructure scale. The <a href="http://w3c.org/">Worldwide Web Consortium</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">W3C</a>) was formed in 1994 and works to develop the software standards for the World Wide Web’s core technologies: browsers and&nbsp;servers.</p><p>One example we all use every day is E-mail, or as it was once known, “electronic mail”. How addressing and discovery can work, the limits and parameters of a universally-recognizable address, etc are all written up in authoritative specification documents. Colloquially, these documents are often referred to as “the standard,” or “the RFCs” (“Request[s] for Comment” referring to the collective editorial process by which standards are written). Email is typical, however, in that a patchwork of multiple interlocking protocols are actually required to send and receive&nbsp;emails.</p><p>Although this list of protocols needs to move slowly to give the end-consumer stability and assurance, the list is actually in a state of permanent minor flux, as individual protocols are iterated and upgrades, support for older versions fades away, and now protocols are added that take advantage of security or performance enhancements reaching critical mass elsewhere. For decades, the dominant protocols in email have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)</a>, and underlying handshake/transport protocols like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a>. As you can see clicking any of these links, the “standard” (current best practices and specifications) are compromised of a patchwork of iterating and component specifications with a more narrow scope, allowing for a kind of modular and incremental evolution allowing markets and applications to phase components and subsystems in and out over time without interruptions to service or sudden changes in user experience.</p><p>Another example we use every day is “web standards,” i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>. These protocols are the standards that let any web server present information according to prescriptive formats which will be displayed in roughly the same way by any compliant web browser. Here, as in weights and measures, or electricity, there are always slippages and margins for error, though, as any front-end developer can tell you) This enables a diversity of web servers and a diversity of browsers. There are of course open source examples of each (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server">Apache Server </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox Browsers</a> being two examples) but there are also proprietary versions of them as&nbsp;well.</p><p>To many observers, the degree of openness in the codebase matters less than the diversity and complexity of organizations involved in the governance of the protocols: in this regard, control of “browser standards” might be endangered by increasing market power on the part of browser vendors owned by private entities that also have outsized and direct control over operating systems and app store platforms, upon which any competing browser would depend directly. Neither open source nor open standards are a guarantee of a healthy and open market, although both generally contribute to that&nbsp;end.</p> Standards and Proto-standards <p>Standards development is generally a slow process taking years, driven by a balance between (rough) consensus between stakeholders refining and iterating requirements and running code against which these requirements can be measured or considered. Depending on the context, stakeholders can include vendors or commercial actors, regulators, consumer advocacy groups, affected industries, and/or individuals. The terms “running” and “code” both cover a lot of territory, but it would be impossible to arrive at a standard without at least two independent, functioning pieces of code that have been tested, audited, and hardened, ideally by some deployment at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>In some cases, this is where an open standards process begins: two maximally independent implementations decide to cooperate for greater adoption and maturity, and seek out a venue for the relevant stakeholders to debate the merits and trade-offs of their current codebases and future variations or possibilities. Different standards bodies can be more or less public in their processes, more or less transparent in their results, and more or less complex in their rules of engagement: indeed, some operate according to a rulebook as complex as that of a parliament, and a style guide as exacting as an academic institution.</p><p>For the most open of standards, however, it is possible to work in the open, deliberatively and transparently, long before this “first” step. Working in an industry group, trade association, or other neutral venue can speed up the work towards a standards by front-loading the collaboration, peer-review, market-testing, and process legitimacy needed to get an idea ready for the market and standardization sooner. These “pre-standards” venues are like containers where all those participating have signed an IPR agreement up front that means their work is unencumbered by patents or royalties and safe from being front-run or patent-trolled.</p><p>The products of these pre-standards processes are often called “pre-standard specifications” or “proto-standards” (if they are more ambitious and protocol-shaped). Groups that develop proto-standards often have explicitly-defined processes for how to publish a proto-standard, as well as when and how to hand off a sufficiently matured proto-standard to an SDO process for more formal and authoritative standardization.</p><p>We should not overstate the distinction between standards and pre-standards, however: there are many shares of grey in between. “Standards-track” and “non-standards-track” specifications alike can be more mature or legitimate depending on the parties involved, the pertinent SDOs (or lack thereof), and of course the process used to create them. For this reason, work items and working groups at the DIF avail themselves of multiple procedural options and tailor their processes to the context, which is why “scoping” and “chartering” processes can take months to hammer out between organizations and their legal departments. This is also specifications developed at DIF without being further hardened in a more formal standards body can sometimes be called “standards,” in the sense that they are adopted in the industry and function as standards. How the market and the relevant industries treat, and trust, and rely on a specification is the ultimate judge of when it can be called the authoritative text for a standard process or procedure!</p><p>In our next drill-down, we’ll go into more detail on DIF’s processes, how you can get involved, and what decisions go into assuming an active role in a working group or work&nbsp;item.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-standards-e745d84d0495">Drilling down: Open Standards</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				<a href="https://www.sitra.fi/en/publications/towards-trustworthy-health-data-ecosystems/#foreword"></a>
			  
				
				
				 <p>In the spring of 2020, Sitra and aNewGovernance published their “35 proposals to make the European data strategy work” as a response to the European Commission Communication “A European strategy for data”. This new data strategy was part of a wider package of strategic documents that also included a communication entitled “Shaping Europe’s digital future” and the “White Paper on Artificial Intelligence – A European approach to excellence and trust”.</p>
<p>Those papers call for a move from platform-centric to human-centric data infrastructure, with an underlying concept: TRUST. This is particularly true in Health. With the ageing of the population, the raising costs of healthcare and the current pandemic, it is high time to shift the paradigm of Health and centre it around individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aim of this paper from Sitra is to encourage us all to rethink the role of the individual in healthcare systems. It is intentional that there is no clear discipline in focus in this paper. The future is made today and it needs to be made in dialogue with a variety of stakeholders. High-level experts contributed to this paper and commentators all had very different views on the field of health and well-being: only by working together can we make the European data strategy work for us all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sitra is now leading the European Commission Joint Initiative on the European Health Data Space*. aNewGovernance looks forward to participating to this great enterprise for the benefit of the European citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*: Mission Statement of the “Towards the European Health Data Space (TEHDAS) Joint Action” – The Joint Action helps member states and the Commission develop an ecosystem where health data is shared more freely, boosting the wellbeing of citizens, the public health system, treatment of illnesses, and the research and innovation activities in Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future, citizens, communities and companies in Europe will benefit from a protected, secure and seamless access to health data, regardless of where it is stored.</p>

<p>A crash-course in the complex world of variously-open software licensing</p><p>The ostensibly binary distinction between “open” and “closed” software gets bandied about in many contexts, often in a dangerously simplified form, as though there were only two, mutually-exclusive options. It can also be extended to standards in an imprecise or oversimplified way. Sometimes people refer to groups like DIF “working on open-source standards,” but speaking precise, no such thing&nbsp;exists!</p><p>Only software code can be open-source, since after all, “source” is short for “source code” (pre-compiled software). Standards, whether open or not, are not code — instead, they are functional definitions and specifications that define and specify protocols that one application (or code base) uses to talk to another (or code base). Each standard can be understood as a benchmark for testing specific implementations, dividing existing and future codebases into those fully, partly, or non-compliant with its requirements.</p>“Lean Startup workshop” in Amsterdam, by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@epicantus">Daria Nepriakhina</a><p>Code, whether open-source or not, can implement or “build to” a pre-existing standard, which can be developed in a variously open or closed manner; there is no inherent link or dependency between the openness or rigor of the two processes. Similarly, a standard can be “written around” one or more existing implementations, in such a way that the existing code is definitively compliant with the resulting standard tailored to it. This latter operation is an important function in open-source communities, in that it invites future developers to make new code that will be interchangeable or interoperable with that precedent. Even if that pre-existing code is closed, the resulting standard can be of great use to open-source development, particularly if the process used to write it was also “open” and participated in by the designers and implementers of that closed-source precedent.</p><p>In this series of three brief explanatory posts, we’ll first explain open-source development as a process rather than defining it by its results. In the next post, we will explain the characteristics and optionalities of an “open process” for developing standards. Supporting these open standards is where the bulk of DIF’s efforts and resources are focused. Lastly, we will turn to how open source and open standards work together to create new business models and strategies with real-world consequences for cooperation, “coöpetition,” and healthy&nbsp;markets.</p> Source Code and Intellectual Property&nbsp;Law <p>At their lowest level, computers are just machines that exercise millions of structured computations every second. They take inputs, perform computation, and produce&nbsp;outputs.</p>(public domain)<p>These computations can be combined into complex structures of data and decision-making called “programs” that interface with humans to make useful and meaningful outputs. At the lowest level, these computations still look like oceans of 1s and 0s to the untrained eye, but decades of refinement of operating systems, programming languages, scripting languages, and other abstractions make it easy for engineers to deal only with “source code” as a kind of human-readable abstraction at higher levels. This is “compiled” into more efficient, machine-readable “binaries” (ones and zeros) that can be deployed to standardized hardware in the real world where it is “run” (live software is often referred to as “runtime”).</p>by <a href="https://scs.senecac.on.ca/~chris.szalwinski">Chris Szalwinski</a> from <a href="https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~btp100/pages/content/compi.html">The C Program</a> is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/ca/">Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Canada&nbsp;License</a>.<p>Because it is human-readable and because licenses apply to compiled binaries and functional software in specific jurisdictions, the software industry has largely applied practices analogous to academic “peer review” for sharing and critiquing core pieces of source code. This complicates the open/closed distinction further, since a closed-source project and a licensed binary might still offer key components up for review through github or other channels traditionally used for open development. Furthermore, the many gradients between complete “open” or “closed” software depends on the ownership and licensing of a given piece of software, which can evolve over time or differ in its enforceability across jurisdictions. Like all legal matters, mileage may vary and always consult a licensed&nbsp;expert!</p> A thumbnail history of licensing <p>There is a range of different licensing regimes for source code. Among open-source licenses, different functions can be enabled or facilitated independently of one another: external review, attribution, innovation, maintenance, and even revenue-sharing and other conditions on business practices.</p><p>Proprietary code bases are released under closed-source licenses, which are optimized for secrecy, exclusivity, and/or sale of the results through licensing-based revenue models. For decades, this was how Microsoft licensed not only its proprietary stand-alone software, but even the bulk of the Windows operating system. The licensing landscape is much more diverse today, but before the 1990s very little commercial software was developed in the open or had its source code published after the&nbsp;fact.</p><p>The culture of academia is one of sharing and publishing intellectual work for peers to see and review — open peer-review is as central in academic computer science as it is in the hard sciences. The internet was originally imagined, architected, prototyped, and built by academics, and tinkerers, primarily supported by military and government funding. These three cultures (the military, academia, and independent “hacker”/tinkerer types) formed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet_Galaxy">basis of internet culture</a>. A fourth culture was added later when the general public’s access to the internet evolved into a massive commercial industry in the early&nbsp;1990s.</p><p>For our purposes here, we can limit ourselves to the fairly direct link, sometimes biographical, between the anomalous, non-commercial origins of the internet and the development of the open-source movement within the software industry. One “origin myth” that exemplifies this link is the story of a young Richard Stallman, then working in an early Artificial Intelligence lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who wanted to customize some printer software for an expensive new printer shared across all the floors of a busy research building. To do so, he needed to get the source code from the manufacturer, which he had done to customize the previous “workhorse” printer in the same building.</p><p>The manufacturer of the new model, however, surprised Stallman by refusing to hand over the code on grounds of licensing and intellectual property rights. Stallman, to whom the motto “software wants to be free” is often misattributed, often <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565925823">credits the incident</a> for his deeply-held belief that the end-users of software have a right to modify and participate in the software they use, whether they paid directly for it or benefited from the procurements of governments. To this day, the details and boundaries of this right are still being debated, not only in open-source requirements for government procurements, but also in “right to repair” laws that extend these rights into the domain of hardware and the physical (and 3D-printed) world.</p> Varying degrees of “Software Freedom” <p>Stallman went on to found the Free Software Foundation and play a pivotal role in the elaboration of an open-source (and “free open source”) movement. He also created the first GNU Public Licence (GPL), still a major and influential family of licenses. All versions of the GPL have within them some version of these 4 essential “freedoms”:</p><blockquote>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (“freedom 0”).</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (“freedom 1”). Access to the source code is a precondition for&nbsp;this.</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (“freedom 2”).</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (“freedom 3”). By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for&nbsp;this.</blockquote><p>Honoring these four freedoms textually and fully can make it very hard to sell software commercially for many reasons, salient among them that freely-available source code in a major language is trivial to compile into functioning binaries; commercial or “closed” software is generally sold as compiled binaries, keeping the source code&nbsp;secret.</p><p>Furthermore, many early open-source licenses like GPL explicitly forbid so-called “enclosure” of the code, i.e., incorporating pieces or subsets of the licensed code into a new, close-source product. Anti-enclosure licensing is often referred to as “copyleft” (because it prohibits future copyrighting!) or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_license">viral</a> licensing,” since it cannot be mixed and matched with other licensing without overriding more restrictive licensing. This severely limits commercial potential of “forks” or derived variants. The entire Linux family of operating systems are licensed this way, which keeps Linux development squarely in the camp of maximally-open development throughout.</p><p>Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, the open-source movement grew and at some point the software industry could not afford to ignore it, even if directly participating with licenses like GPL was not feasible for most companies of any size. This period saw the first “compromise-licenses” and hybrid open/closed business-models evolve around them. Many of the licenses still popular today date to these early experiments. For instance, the license originally created for the University of California, Berkeley’s fork of Unix, and still known today as the Berkeley Software Development (BSD) license, is one such “commercially lenient” open-source licenses. These licenses allow developers to take code that was originally open, make significant changes to modified versions of it, and license or even sell those under more classically commercial licenses.</p><p>Similarly, more lenient variants of the Apache and MIT licenses date to this period as well. It is worth noting that Apache web servers were one of the first open-source pieces of software that replaced a dominant commercial product. Apache web server software reaching a dominant position in the previously closed-license, commercial niche was a watershed moment for open-source software.</p><p>Apache is often held up, alongside Linux, as an example of where open-source software optimizes for standardization and safety of mission-critical infrastructure, largely due to the thorough and ongoing auditing and maintenance enabled by its core components being completely open to review, testing, and improvement proposals. Conversely, however, some historians of software development point out that allowing enclosure to the degree that Apache licenses do can lead to simultaneous or “parallel” development of various (partially closed-source) forks to evolve in tandem according to various divergent business agendas. Over time, this can splinter development, wicking off talent, attention, and manpower into closed development and creating a major coordination problem for the open-source “parent” of the family tree. In the most severe cases, this can greatly diminish and forfeit the standardization and security gains that made sharing an open-source parent so desirable in the first&nbsp;place.</p> Today and&nbsp;Tomorrow <p>Today, cloud-based business models and Software-as-a-Service have revived and expanded the toolkit for closed-source development, and in turn breathed new life into the debate about how hybrid models could make open-source infrastructure sustainable by revenue shares from closed-source products that depend on it. Similarly, the so called “cloud loophole” in older GPL licenses, whereby software could be run but not “distributed,” was closed by the newer <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">Affero GPL</a> that applies to cloud environments.</p><p>Another interesting frontier in the evolving licensing landscape is being opened up in recent years by distributing computing and distributed ledgers. One key assumption of traditional licensing is that software runs on a finite set of distinct pieces of hardware, with ownership and liability that follow straightforwardly from there. Distributed computing, however, where computation work is spread out over a more diffuse and indeterminate numbers of computers, which might have limited or no insight into the “big picture” of the software they are running, muddy the waters even further than traditional cloud environment. On the radically open side of the spectrum, the distributed-computing ecosystem project HoloChain has innovated the <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/understanding-the-cryptographic-autonomy-license-172ac920966d">Cryptographic Autonomy Licence </a>to empower users (and the software running in their name) by protecting them with encryption.</p><p>New forms of “confidential computing” and encrypted, self-sovereign networking take this even further, making the boundaries of software and runtime environments similarly porous. Attempts at licensing for these new topographies have been <a href="https://sdtimes.com/os/osi-co-founder-leaves-initiative-over-new-license/">controversial</a> at times, but they are also an important precedent and context for work happening in the DIF, such as that of the Secure Data Storage <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">working&nbsp;group</a>.</p><p>There are even more radical experiments and movements happening in the open-licensing problem space, which would restrict usage not [only] according to commercial terms or enclosure, but according to non-monetary and non-licensing rubrics as well. For instance, the “ICE breaker” <a href="https://icebreaker.dev">project </a>has brought more attention to the movement to license software according to so-called “<a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/licenses/">ethical licenses</a>.” These restrict derivative use anywhere it can be proven to support of human rights violations, such as in military applications or for “predictive policing” and other use-cases that run afoul of international authorities on human rights and discrimination. The provisions or triggers for such licensing might be as hard to enforce as international human rights law (i.e., very hard), but it sends a signal that specifications and standards from other disciplines such as human rights law and ethical philosophy might someday find their place among the commercial and attribution clauses in open-source licenses.</p> Further reading <p>All code developed under the DIF umbrella is strictly open source, and while DIF accepts donations of previously-closed source code, it is expected that all ongoing iterations of them will take place in the open. The original vision for DIF as a project within the <a href="https://www.jointdevelopment.org/about1.html">Joint Development Foundation</a> was to host code development, and it has since expanded to include co-developed pre-standards specifications and other educational and non-technical <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/education/home">materials</a> as well. Take a spin through our github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/">repositories</a> if you’d like to see an overview of historical and ongoing projects.</p><p>In this quick overview, we have only scratched the surface, though, and we encourage anyone working in the open software space to educate themselves further. The Open Source Initiative <a href="https://opensource.org/trademark-guidelines#Usage_That_Does_Not_Require_Permission">holds the trademark </a>on the phrase “open source” and maintains a very helpful list of licenses that it has decided are fully conformant with its principles. The <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/category">list of approved licenses</a> that they maintain is a great place to start if you are researching the licensing landscape, and they also hold <a href="https://opensource.org/events">events</a> and offer a substantial offering of <a href="https://opensource.org/osi-open-source-education">educational materials</a>.</p><p>In our next installment, we’ll turn to Open Standards and the work of the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76">Drilling down: Open Source</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Bringing emerging privacy-preserving technology to a public health&nbsp;crisis</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaliya/">Kaliya Young</a>, Identity Woman, Co-Founder of the Internet Identity Workshop; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucyyang1122/">Lucy Yang</a>, Co-Chair of the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</p>Photo from&nbsp;Unsplash<p>We submitted this position statement to the “<a href="https://fpf.org/event/privacy-pandemics-responsible-uses-of-technology-and-health-data-during-times-of-crisis-an-international-tech-and-data-conference/">Privacy &amp; Pandemics Workshop: Responsible Uses of Technology and Health Data During Times of Crisis — An International Tech and Data Conference</a>” by the Future of Privacy Forum. The aim is to, from two participants’ point of view, share an abbreviated case study of CCI and to highlight key challenges that arose in our efforts to responsibly use new privacy-preserving technologies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We wanted to share our submission with the CCI community and the public in the hope to invite some further discussions.</p><p>So what is this emerging technology that is just coming to market with very early adopters and innovators leading the way (including the US government, the government of British Columbia, etc.)? It is called Verifiable Credentials (VC or VCs), <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">a data format standard developed </a>and published <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">by the W3C</a> last year. It is a universal data format for one entity (person, organization or thing) to assert something about another entity. The issuer packages up the credential and cryptographically signs it to seal the data it contains. It passes this to the subject, or holder, so that the subject can share it with the receiver of the credential, the verifier. At that point, the receiver is able to use cryptography to check the seal and the validity of the issuer. VCs are privacy-preserving because the issuer (identity provider) and verifier (relying party) do not form a technical/federated link with each other. The information does not pass directly.</p><p>This technology gives people the ability to collect and manage digital credentials — similar to the cards we find in our physical wallets — in digital wallets. These digital credentials act like paper credentials because individuals do not need to have the verifier directly connect to the issuer. Why is this new? Until now, to have provable information exchanged online, the issuer and verifier would need to directly “federate” to exchange information about the data&nbsp;subject.</p><p>Immunology is a complex science, but simplified basics about how it works with some viruses are known. It was based on these simple understandings that possibilities for how VCs might be used by people and institutions to better manage risk began to be explored. One obvious use case was the ability to issue VCs that reflect some type of COVID-19 status, a proof that&nbsp;one:</p>  Tests positive for antibodies and therefore not infected/or vulnerable to being infected.  Has recently tested negative and therefore the risk of being infected is low and that one could go to work, travel or visit a facility with vulnerable populations.  Has received a vaccine for COVID-19 and therefore safe to travel or access a large in-person event.  <p>Some of these use cases as articulated are not new (e.g. the Yellow Card); it’s just new to digitize them. It makes sense to consider how this simple paper-based technology can be updated to digital. However, the mild hysteria raised about doing things today done on paper via digital means that concerns were triggered without fully understanding or exploring how to use the technology. Some individuals were so concerned that they <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/resignation-at-identity-initiative-raises-doubts-about-immunity-passes">resigned</a> from organizations whose leadership <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/safracenterforethicswhitepaper8_01.pdf">floated these&nbsp;ideas</a>.</p><p>COVID-19 status is currently shared in two forms: 1) with the patient via a phone call or text message from the doctor or testing site or 2) in a patient medical record. Neither of these solutions provides a clear way for the subject to prove results to an entity that wants to know this information (e.g. an airline). VCs offer a new innovative format that provides people with information about their COVID-19 status that is under their control and verifiable by a relying&nbsp;party.</p><p>The VC approach is in strong contrast to the <a href="https://commonpass.splashthat.com/">CommonPass</a> effort, led by a Rockefeller-Foundation-backed nonprofit, that co-arose in the same time frame. The leadership at CommonPass is connected to the conventional medical records world and proposed the creation of a global system where patient medical records in some yet-to-be-determined way would be shared with a centralized decision engine that CommonPass would run globally. They held several global meetings with hundreds of people, including government leaders attending to build momentum for their proposed solution. There are also scores of siloed proprietary solutions popping up to solve these data-sharing challenges. For example, <a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-health-screening-digital-id-48f5ee5b-05c4-4b5e-8fda-4d2f59b946b0.html">CLEAR is offering</a> a biometric data sharing solution. In a public health crisis, these non-interoperable solutions are only good when only one of them is widely adopted, which doesn’t seem to be the&nbsp;case.</p><p>The community that formed around CCI was mostly made up of small, early-stage startups who were already implementing VCs for other use cases and decided to collaborate on exploring COVID-19 use cases. This makeup of the community means that it is not connected to global elites, governments, health departments or healthcare institutions. One exception to this is a startup that had political connections and worked with a California State Legislator to have the bill <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2004">AB2004</a> proposed, which opened up a committee to study the use of VCs for COVID-19 medical test results. The bill just passed the Senate and is now waiting to be signed by the governor to become a law. However, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has repeatedly voiced its opposition <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/no-california-bill-verified-credentials-covid-19-test-results">[1]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/california-tell-your-senators-ill-conceived-immunity-passports-wont-help-us">[2]</a>.</p><p>CCI has struggled to “raise voice” and be “heard” by the powers that make decisions. The experience of this group raises questions:</p>  How can emerging technology be “seen” by actors (governments, public health officials, airlines, workplaces) in the marketplace looking for solutions? Which technologists are listened to by policymakers? How are these actors making decisions about the claims these technologists are&nbsp;making?  How can networks of potential issuers of COVID-19 status credentials be spun up in such a way that the credentials issued are seen as valid by verifiers (airlines, etc.)? This set of challenges around the technology are not technical as much as they are about process and accountability systems.  How can existing norms of information sharing about people that are paper-based today be translated into a digital form in ways that make themselves and those concerned about human rights implications comfortable with the technical deployment?  How can a new privacy-preserving technology based on open standards be used for public health crises or any other time-sensitive occasions when its deployment and adoption require a lot of coordination, collaboration and communication? How can these things be facilitated by funders seeking to make a difference?  <p>We hope to hear your thoughts on the raised questions.</p>

 Zeenab Aneez &amp; Neha&nbsp;Mujumdar  Session <p>It was media theorist Marshall McLuhan who popularised the phrase ‘the medium is the message’; to him, different kinds of media engage the senses in different ways, affecting how we process it and engage with its contents. Before situating research in the digital space, it is important to ask ourselves: what is the nature of the medium are we dealing with here? How do people interact with it? What are the opportunities it provides and the risks it poses? How can we study new digital objects, such as online-first news outlets, podcasts, etc in a way that recognises the medium’s&nbsp;newness?</p><p>The proposed session is an exploration of a methodology that is informed and defined by specific characteristics of the medium, with a special focus on digital news and journalism in India. Through this, it seeks to tackle the first of the four key focus areas of the conference: How do we conceptualise, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India?</p><p>Keeping this key question in mind, we ask: how can digital methods research contribute to the study of news and journalism in the digital space? How can we use digital objects such as tags, Likes, and Comments to understand how user feedback works in the new information economy? What can the interface of a news creation platform tell us about the changing roles of Indian journalists in today’s media environment? How can we formulate a methodology for studying the metamorphosis of a news story by using Twitter and what skills are required to gather and process information for research of this&nbsp;nature?</p><p>In order to inform our responses to such questions, we borrow from Richard Rogers’ adage ‘Follow the medium’ (Rogers 2013), which argues that “natively digital”(Ibid. 19) objects like tags, links, Likes or Comments, which originate in digital networks, cannot be fully understood with methods, such as, say content analysis; an example of a non-digital method that does not recognise its digital nature. The proposed session will make use of the general philosophy embodied by Rogers’ approach and urge participants to acknowledge the specific properties of the Internet as a medium and look at news and journalism as part of the larger media ecology of the web. This calls for the use of new methods that are digital in nature; the discussion on contemporary news should expand from how the news industry is coping with the digital transition, to how we can better understand the specific elements of this transition and use this understanding to reflect upon the changing nature of journalism and news&nbsp;itself.</p><p>In order to channel the discussion, the session proposes using the framework from one particular field of digital research: platform studies. With the advent of Web 2.0 and the emergence of the ‘web as platform’ (O’Reilly 2007) and the strengthening relationship between the news industry and social media platforms(‘Reuters Institute Digital News Report’ 2015), traditional as well as digital-born news sites are increasingly adopting a platform model. Therefore, platform studies makes for a fitting framework within which to understand the workings of these platforms, their technological and formal structures, and the specific ways in which they allow users to interact with news&nbsp;content.</p> Plan <p>The session will begin with a brief introduction to digital methods (Rogers 2013) and the field of ‘platform studies’ (Bogost and Montfort 2009; Gillespie 2010; Dijck 2013), which will serve as a loose framework through which to study existing news platforms as well as perform analyses on social media platforms as sites for news and journalism. This will be supplemented by the works of Anne Helmond (2015) and Tarleton Gillespie (2010).</p><p>Following this, participants will be divided into groups of four-six, with each group anchored by a volunteer, with added support from the two co-leaders. They will then be given the task of formulating a research question that makes use of one or more of the digital methods presented and are also required to frame a methodology that makes allowances for the particularities of the Indian news environment. The session will conclude with a brief discussion based on their findings.</p><p>The goal of the workshop will be to explore how digital methods can be aligned with current concerns about news and journalism in India, and open up avenues for research that acknowledges that online news occupies a space that includes natively digital objects and information architectures and hence demands research methods specific to this environment. The workshop also aims at reflecting on potential collaborations between researchers in media studies, data scientists and technologists in developing a comprehensive methodology using which to study digital media in&nbsp;India.</p> Readings <p>Gillespie, Tarleton. “The Politics of ‘Platforms’.” New Media &amp; Society 12, no. 3 (2010):&nbsp;347–364.</p><p>Rogers, Richard. “The End of the Virtual: Digital Methods,” Digital Methods.

<p>A cross-community effort to standardize on common, DID-anchored capabilities</p><p>If you are reading this, you probably know already what Decentralized Identifiers (<a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DID</a>) are: they are “identifiers” or addresses which can be queried to return some information about the subject represented. The addresses take the form of a long, opaque “string” (a long block of letters and numbers, in this case of a fixed length), and the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-did-documents">DID “documents”</a> that get returned when they are queried contain some cryptographic key material and, depending on the particularities of the returning system, maybe a few other pieces of information or addresses.</p><p>Identity systems have traditionally been largely hierarchical, focusing on asymmetrical or vertical relationships. The most open system that allows horizontal communications between users in different systems is email, and even there, user-to-user communications are mediated by servers, which banlist each other based on a federated reputation system. DIDCommunications (DIDComm), on the other hand, is a set of tools to allow horizontal (or at least, power-neutral) and bidirectional channels of communication between two entities that know each other’s DIDs and nothing else. It resembles today’s end-to-end encryption systems like Signal, Telegram, and Whatsapp more than it resembles traditional email.</p> How DIDComm&nbsp;works <p>DIDComm is a cross-community standard that creates libraries and design patterns for two or more DID-controlling entities from diverse DID-based systems to communicate directly with one another. It creates a secure communication channel between software controlled by each of these entities, which can be people, organizations or things. This constitutes an “authenticated channel,” in that control of a given DID’s private keys is, barring a failure of design or operational security, proof of authenticity of the party represented by that&nbsp;DID.</p><p>This architecture is powerful because it provides a way to do mutual authentication between any two parties. Right now many systems of messaging and communication on the open web don’t provide for mutual authentication with cryptography; they ask individuals to authenticate to sites or businesses (nowadays mostly with single-sign on integrations, i.e. “log in with your XXX account” buttons), and these businesses vouch for and secure the end-user. In exchange, businesses get valuable insight into the communications or commercial activity they facilitate — insights they often sell to third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Furthermore, while the onus is on individuals to authenticate themselves to these enabling institutions and middlemen, the business themselves do little to authenticate themselves reciprocally. Over time, the “lock icon” next to URLs in modern browsers has come to be a useful norm (and users have been habituated to reacting suspiciously to any website which cannot provide on). However, phishing attacks, where intercepted or falsified communications lead users to malicious websites impersonating ones they trust, continue to be a major attack vector for fraud and identity theft. By supporting mutual authentication, a more uniform and democratic protocol is established for secure communications, which raises the bar for user expectations for security assurances from institutions and websites.</p> A Quick History of DIDComm and the Aries Protocols <p>DIDComm was first developed within an international and collaborative open source co-development project called <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a> (hosted at <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org">Hyperledger</a>) and under a IPR regime <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs#about">designed to cover</a> software but not specifications. Aries was spun out of the earlier Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a> project, to both iterate, expand, and make more blockchain-agnostic the codebase and tooling created earlier for the identity blockchain Indy. In the same process, Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Ursa</a> was also created to advance the underlying cryptographic elements independently of the blockchain and the identity systems relying on it. The Indy project continues evolving as well, from a single blockchain to a family of <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=36734079">interoperable</a> ones.</p><p>The name “DIDComm” and version 1 of its libraries and designs evolved in this context: it adapted the Indy-specific horizontal communications libraries to a more agnostic Aries context and iterated them to be more configurable for new contexts and implementations. At some point, however, it became clear that further interoperability would be best served not by writing specifications based on existing Aries implementations, but by a more “green-field”, specification-first design process with interlocutors from further afield. This work came to be co-sponsored by DIF and Hyperledger partly to engage these outside interlocutors, and partly because the IPR protections of DIF were more appropriate to a specification-first open-standards process. The charter of the DIDComm working group at DIF&nbsp;.</p>Source: CHAPI101/DIDComm101 <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/101_Session:_Verifiable_Credential_Handler_(CHAPI)_and_DIDComm">joint session</a> at&nbsp;#<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW30</a> The Future of&nbsp;DIDComm <p>Since the chartering process began in September of 2019 at the post-IIW DIF Face to Face, the work of designing a new core for DIDComm and thinking through new features and structure has proceeded at a steady clip. The implementations and details are still being hammered out in some places, but the feature set is stable. The benefits of the new protocol will&nbsp;include:</p>  Mutual authentication  Robust, email-like threading support for relying messaging systems (including error-handling and other machine-readable messaging systems)  Support for new security and transport primitives like the <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwm-a-new-standard-for-secure-messaging-a21d3daa4403">JWM&nbsp;envelope</a>  Asynchronous by default, but with synchronous communication modes also supported  Offline support so that two agents who are not online can exchange information via bluetooth or QR&nbsp;Code  Easy to support with a web server (among many other topographies)  Many of the positive qualities of the earlier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/soap12/">SOAP</a> protocol, include message format standards, routing, transport agnostic support, and subprotocols.  <p>This effort has the direct support and participation of many core members of the Aries community. It is within the plans of the Aries community to migrate to DIDComm V2 as it becomes ready for use and tested. In both existing DIDComms (many of which are already in production), protocols relying on a DIDComm-encrypted channel for authentication or communications functions will be moved over. The relationship between DIDComm and these relying “subprotocols” is quite similar to the relationship between HTTP and the APIs created on top of HTTP — an upgrade to the underlying security or feature set will not affect the relying applications that just need a secure&nbsp;channel.</p><p>There is <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/111">some consternation</a> about the use of the term “DIDComm Protocols” to describe the various different types of exchange or transactions that could be built on a DIDComm foundation. Regardless of whether one chooses to call them “protocols” or something else, a cross-community standard will be crucial to co-developing broadly interoperable capabilities and common libraries on the basis of secure, authenticated DIDComm channels. Some examples of what these would&nbsp;include:</p>  Secure user messaging or even chat-like instant messaging  Issuing a credential  Presenting a credential or an identity&nbsp;proof  Interactions with IOT systems or even directly with specific, authenticated devices  Payment coordination   Getting involved <p>A good place to jump in would be this video recorded by DIDComm WG Chair Sam Curren at the June DIF Face-to-face meeting:</p><p>With this background, a read through the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_DIDcomm_WG_Charter_v1.pdf">charter</a>, the mailing list <a href="https://dif.groups.io/g/didcomm-wg/topics">archives</a>, the github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/DIDComm-js">repository</a>, or the Slack channel of the DIDComm <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">working group</a> at DIF will make a lot more sense; as will DIDComm sessions at the new IIW and F2F meetings.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/understanding-didcomm-14da547ca36b">Understanding DIDComm</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Whether, why, and how to attend the biannual conference along with&nbsp;DIF</p><p>The <a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com">Internet Identity Workshop</a> is an interactive “un-conference” that has convened various kinds of researchers, identity technology companies, and thinkers since 2005. It brings together a wide swath of people working towards great control of the digital representations of themselves, incorporating theoretical, market-building, research, and policy-oriented projects. This coming month, the 31st edition will be held entirely only on the Qiqochat platform, like the 30th edition before&nbsp;it.</p> The Storied History of&nbsp;IIW <p>Kaliya Young, Doc Searls and Phil Windley founded the conference in 2005. At the time, all three were active in a group known as “the Identity Gang”. They had been discussing identity technology concepts in detail on a mailing list since meeting each other at Digital Identity World in the fall of 2004; after a year of passionate discussions, there came a point where an in-person meeting felt necessary. The first meeting was in Berkeley, California, and ever since it has been hosted at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. It has moved online-only since the Covid-19 pandemic began in early&nbsp;2020.</p><p>In 2005, many in the community were blogging and writing about identity and related themes. Some had made broad and widely acclaimed pronouncements like Kim Cameron, most known in this regard for his essay, <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">The Seven Laws of Identity.</a> One early collaboration within the community was a <a href="http://wiki.idcommons.net/Lexicon">Lexicon</a> that has aged well. Many were also writing code and founding projects to realize their various visions. At the first IIW, eight different projects gave structured presentations on the first day, while the second day was devoted to a more open-ended and collaborative synthesis, facilitated by Kaliya Young using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Space Technology</a>.</p><p>At that first event, several of the projects focused on using URLs as identifiers for individuals, who could authenticate against these as they moved around the early Web 2.0, commenting on different sites. Conversations at the event were formative on the OpenID protocols and the OpenID Foundation. Since then, many different protocols have been conceived and/or nested at the conference, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, <a href="http://www.simplecloud.info/">SCIM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_card">Information Cards</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Resource_Identifier">XRI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDI">XDI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebFinger">Web Finger</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_(protocol)">Salmon</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSub">PubSubHubbub</a>, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>The event attracts people from all over the world and continues to be the “biggest tent” for collaboration and ideation across the various user-centric identity spheres and communities, particularly for what is now called “decentralized identity” or “self-sovereign identity”. You can see the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">book of proceedings</a> from most of the IIWs for the last 15 years, refined and edited in the month after each organic and <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/engagement-guidelines/">self-organizing</a> event.</p> The Decentralized Identity Foundation at&nbsp;IIW <p>IIW has always been a neutral venue where diverse groups across the community focused on the decentralized identity, that often work in parallel between IIWs, come together to report out and understand each other’s projects. Furthermore, many attendees come from established sectors of the software industry, such as Enterprise Identity and Access Management (EIAM), Cybersecurity, or Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). This creates a healthy mix of specialists, professionals, activists, and novices, balancing the “bikeshedding” of technology specifics with societal conversations and industry-wide trends and roadmaps. The open culture of DIF and its commitment to integrations with today’s identity technologies thrive in this environment, and many key DIF collaborations have begun or successfully recruited new participants at&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>Anyone who attends from any of the myriad organizations in the space can put agenda/discussion topics forward, which also makes it a very generative place for researchers, innovators, and market-watchers. Many of the DIF working groups present their latest work at the event for technical or business review, and it is a key venue for soliciting insightful feedback from related organizations and industry stakeholders. Sometimes projects in early stages of development, specification, or scoping even do requirements gathering or technical sanity-checks at the&nbsp;event.</p><p>Historically, the DIF has hosted a one-day face-to-face meeting immediately before or after the IIW conference proper to take advantage of the geographic co-location of so many key players. This time around, however, DIF is experimenting with a more spaced-out approach to allow for a period of processing of the IIW sessions to allow for a more complementary role 5 or 6 weeks after the fact. Stay tuned for more details about design or development sprints to take place bookended by the two&nbsp;events.</p> Hot Topics across #IIW30 and&nbsp;#IIW31 <p>At the last IIW, DIF working groups put forward these sessions:</p>  The internal governance group shared its new <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Code_of_Conduct_-_at_DIF">Code of Conduct </a>and the <a href="https://identity.foundation/open-groups/glossary.html">Glossary Group</a> also gave a presentation on its <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/finding-the-bell-curve-of-meaning-61a1d22b7bdd">methodology</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Glossary_Results_-_Credentials,_Wallets,_Agents_Defined._%2B_Next_Steps">results</a>  There were four different sessions presenting and gathering feedback on four different aspects <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/%22KERI_(A)_Key_Event_Receipt_Infrastructure._A_ledger_agnostic_framework_for_decentralized_identity._KERI_unifies_many_DID_methods_types.">of</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_-Part_B_Key_Event_Reciept_Infrastructure.A_ledger_agnostic_framework_for_decentralized_identity._KERI_unifies_many_DID_methods_types.">the</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_(C)_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">KERI&nbsp;</a><a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_Implementation:_Whats_Next_DID:UNI_Method._Ref_Imp._DIF_Project.">project</a>.  Similarly, there were multiple presentations on the BBS+ signature suite at the heart of both the Aries <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/BBS%2B_JSON-LD_ZKPs_and_Aries_%26_Indy._Your_Thoughts%3F">AnonCreds2</a> system for verifiable presentations and a novel <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD_using_BBS%2B_-_Round_2">JSON-LD-based system</a>, development of which continues to be lead by Mattr&nbsp;Global.  The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm</a> WG gave a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/DIDComm_WG_Progress_Update">progress report</a>, which was particularly important to many stakeholders in the Aries community not involved in the autonomous research &amp; development project. A separate session was held on the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/JSON_Web_Messaging_(JWM):_What_are_they_and_why_are_they_useful_for_secure_messaging_sytems%3F">JSON Web Messaging (JWM)</a> proposal that the DIDComm WG submitted to the&nbsp;IETF.  Similarly, there was a well-attended joint progress report on the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Sidetree_Protocol_/_Element_DID_and_Friends">SideTree Protocol / Element DID and Friends</a>&nbsp;, as well as an update from the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/TxAuth_and_XYZ_(and_Maybe_someday_OAuth_3)">XYZ project</a> to iterate the OAuth protocol.  A breakthrough <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/101_Session:_Verifiable_Credential_Handler_(CHAPI)_and_DIDComm">panel</a> (which was recorded — see previous link) explored the potential interaction or combination of the complementary browser-based CHAPI communications/transport protocol and the more browser-independent work of the DIDComm&nbsp;WG  Frameworks and ecosystem maps were presented by the new Trust-over-IP foundation, the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Understanding_MyData_Operators_-_white_paper_published_today">Operators</a> <a href="https://mydata.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/Understanding-Mydata-Operators-pages.pdf">project</a> of MyData Global; certification programs were announced and outlined by the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Intro_to_the_Me2B_Alliance_Testing_Specification">Me2B Alliance</a> and the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ID2020_Certification:_feedback_and_next_steps">ID2020</a>&nbsp;project.  For a more detailed overview of highlights, see Juan Caballero’s <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/lessons-from-the-internet-identity-workshop-2020-89a4915c4658">detailed recap</a> for the <a href="https://medium.com/spherity">company blog</a> of DIF member organization, Spherity&nbsp;GmbH  For the complete, edited notes from all sessions, see the <a href="https://github.com/windley/IIW_homepage/raw/gh-pages/assets/proceedings/IIW_30_Book_of_Proceedings.pdf">Proceedings Book</a> (sponsored by DIF member organization, Jolocom&nbsp;GmbH)   Heading into the 31st IIW, we can expect significant interest and attendance at sessions on these&nbsp;topics:   A progress report on the alignment of the browser-native Presentation Exchange DIF specification and the relevant Aries RFCs and libraries  Moving KERI from prototype to actual implementations (and integrations!), as well as Drummond Reed’s less-technical introduction entitled “KERI for Mere&nbsp;Mortals”  Cross-method interoperability and portability, within and beyond Indy networks (which are proliferating quickly in&nbsp;Europe!)  Test Suites and a process to incentivize (or even fund?) revisions of major specifications to include more explicit test&nbsp;vectors  Lessons from the mid-2020 DID-Core sprint and PING W3C Security&nbsp;Review  Updates on OIDC-DID bridging work, OAuth &amp; GNAP, and fast-moving regulatory changes in Europe and North&nbsp;America   Making your IIW&nbsp;plan <p>DIF has had great success presenting work at IIW — and increasingly, it is becoming an important aspect of our educational and outreach efforts to post recordings of these presentations on our youtube <a href="https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCicZIzvOXOyij0A6jlA7nxQ?c=UCicZIzvOXOyij0A6jlA7nxQ">channel</a>. We’re hoping this tradition will build more momentum at the upcoming&nbsp;IIW!</p><p>The event is a great opportunity for those who are already very active in the community working on standards and code related to decentralized identity. It is also a great opportunity for those who are very new to get up to speed quickly via what language professors call “deep immersion.” It is very welcoming and friendly, and since each session includes experts from different fields, there are few assumptions and much level-setting. DIF leadership attends the event and encourages its membership to actively participate.</p><p>For those already planning to attend, please note that a skeletal structure is already <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/schedule/">posted</a>. The most important sessions to attend are each day’s “agenda creation” sessions; the “demo hour” sessions for live demos of new products and prototypes, and the “closing circle” readouts from each day’s events are close seconds. Cordoning off those timeslots in your calendar weeks in advance is highly recommended, as a way of keeping those timeslots free of conflicts in your home time&nbsp;zone!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-at-iiw31-f8aafe64c985">DIF at #IIW31</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>OwnYourData &amp; Human Colossus Foundation have been selected to take part in the Data Portability &amp; Services Incubator (DAPSI), a 3-year EU-funded project that empowers internet innovators to develop new solutions in the data portability field.</p><p>What is DAPSI ?</p><p>The Data Portability and Services Incubator (DAPSI) is an EU-funded project, under the European Commission’s Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, to empower top internet innovators to develop human-centric solutions, addressing the challenge of personal data portability on the internet. As foreseen under the GDPR, this will make it significantly easier for citizens to transmit data from one service provider to another.</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>DAPSI will support top-notch projects through a 9-month incubation programme where experts in diverse fields will provide a successful working methodology, access to top infrastructure, training in business and data related topics, coaching, mentoring, and a vibrant ecosystem. On top of that, each DAPSI project can receive up to €150k equity-free funding.</p><p><a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/hall-of-fame/dip/">Digital Immunization Passport</a> (DIP) is taking part in DAPSI to create a state-of-the-art digital certificate of vaccination. Currently, vaccination and immunisation information are spread over different organisations like labs and hospitals as well as pharmaceutical companies together with government agencies. A patient usually only has a paper certificate that provides vaccination treatments with often difficult-to-read handwritten additional information. In the proposed solution, OwnYourData and Human Colossus Foundation will develop an end-to-end data flow that:</p>  <p>connects to various immunisation information providers;</p>  <p>aggregates, harmonises, and semantically annotates the data;</p>  <p>makes this data set available in an open format accessible for Personal Data Stores (PDS), compliant to the MyData Operator guidelines;</p>    <p>provide a human-centric data management platform for health information;</p>  <p>allows to prove immunisation status through Verifiable Credentials*; and</p>  <p>packages selected health data for processing by 3rd parties together with a well-defined usage policy and a provenance trail.</p>  <p>The main focus of this project is on Data Interoperability &amp; Compatibility through establishing interfaces between the health industry and individuals, as well as pushing forward on standardised interfaces for PDSs. Additionally, we address Data Transparency (Usage Policies and Data Provenance in Semantic Containers) and Security &amp; Privacy (by applying blockchain technology and digital watermarking on data sharing).</p><p>* Note:&nbsp;The characteristic of verifiability refers to the signatures on the&nbsp;credential which are verifiable. It does not refer to the&nbsp;authenticability of the claims within the credential itself. A Verifiable Credential can therefore be thought of as an&nbsp;authenticable credential that can be verified.</p><p></p><p>How does it work?&nbsp;</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>In the two-phase supporting programme, the projects will develop advanced solutions in the Data Portability field. From September 2020 to February 2021 (Kick-Start phase), they will develop a solution related to a specific use case. The best projects will progress to the second phase (Booster) where the use cases will be fostered to evolve into solid projects to gain enough traction for deployment and market readiness.</p><p>Follow our journey through DAPSI!&nbsp;</p><p>Take a look at the DAPSI <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/hall-of-fame/">project portfolio</a> to see more information about the selected innovators.</p><p>To read more about DAPSI, please visit the website: <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/">dapsi.ngi.eu</a></p><p>Press contact and social media</p><p>Email: <a href="mailto:dapsi@ngi.eu">dapsi@ngi.eu</a></p><p>Website: <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/">https://dapsi.ngi.eu/</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/NGI_DAPSI">https://twitter.com/NGI_DAPSI</a></p><p>LinkedIn&nbsp;: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/ngi-dapsi">https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/ngi-dapsi</a></p><p>Facebook&nbsp;: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NGI.DAPSI">https://www.facebook.com/NGI.DAPSI</a></p><p><a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/ujalo98s00b93gh7gqkuqd3lfj52xq">Permalink</a></p><p></p>

				 <p>Winning the Future: Private Sector is Critical for the SDGs</p> 
			      
				
				
				 <p>There are important moments, when values are afloat and when change may happen. Moments where the zeitgeist is changing. Those moments often grow out of crisis.</p>
<p>Initiated by the pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis and fueled by the energy of the protests against racial injustice and the emergence of a new generation demanding change, we may find ourselves in such a moment as we face the disruptive forces of the Covid-pandemic.</p>
<p>2020 gave us the most serious health crisis in 100 years. The Covid-pandemic has stolen lives, rattled societies and led us straight into the most serious economic crisis in peacetime.</p>
<p>This crisis has ruthlessly exposed societal weaknesses and has shredded away decades of economic growth and job gains, leaving us vulnerable to the many other serious crises we face.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking across the globe, the crisis has also reminded us of the importance of government -of collaboration between government and the private sector – and the fact, that concerted planned action works, and can advance development.</p>
<p>The pandemic has offered important learnings.</p>
 
 On rapid, constrained innovation as we searched for remedies, or lateral innovation such as when car manufacturers learned to produce ventilators or winemakers produce hand sanitizers. 
 We have learned new ways of working and made digital leaps toward the online transition and on accelerating other useful digitalization by years. Inclusive Digitization is important as we find our way out of the crisis. An example is <a href="https://caspar.ai/">Casper.AI</a> where academics have come together to start a company that brings the power of distributed AI to help the elderly life a safe and comfortable live in their homes.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Perhaps most important though is the realization of the level of interconnectedness of our lives and how important it is to stand and work together.&nbsp; How directly our actions impact the lives of others and how we can mobilize and be innovative in collaboration for a more responsible and sustainable approach; how everyone comes out ahead, when we do that.&nbsp; The facemask, and the active choice in caring for others by wearing it, is a strong symbol of this. 
 
<p>As we find our way out of the current crisis, we should reflect on these learnings.&nbsp; This is important for our continued efforts to fight global warming and the many other challenges we face. As we focus on the current crisis, small steps continue to be made in the area of more sustainable development and solving some of the other important issues at hand.</p>
<p>Embracing the Sustainable Development Goals Framework – Doing Business As Unusual</p>
<p>It’s important that we realize the seriousness of the challenges ahead of us, and that we understand the huge opportunity for change. This calls for active involvement of industry and for a new type of responsible leadership and collaboration via the UN sustainable development goals framework.</p>
<p>World leaders agreed to the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">17 Sustainable Development Goals</a> in New York in 2015 in acknowledgement of the existential crisis we find ourselves in – combating climate change, tackling massive inequality and more. See <a href="https://sdgintegration.undp.org/?fbclid=IwAR1Tnsja2jh3ozETfS9x1Tm0fJ7NLGNIG0Pbo8P866ulGKIjcuobAZhMp8w">UNDP video on&nbsp; integrated&nbsp; solutions</a>. These goals weave together social, economic and environmental challenges and solutions – they recognize the interconnectedness of the challenges and have the deep spirit of leaving no one behind. Governments, philanthropy and civil society organizations around the world have embraced this global call to action and are collaborating on advancing the SDGs.</p>
<p>As we celebrate the 5th anniversary of the SDG’s, there is agreement across sectors that we need deeper private sector engagement and a new type of business leadership to achieve the SDGs in the remaining 10 years. Doing Business as Usual will not suffice – business leaders need to focus on generating value to society and minimize harmful externalities – not just on profits for a few individuals.</p>
<p>The celebration of the 5th anniversary of the SDG’s should serve as a call for active and joined effort by governments, civil society and business for a better world. The United Nation Sustainable Goals provide a substantial framework and metrics for a new responsible leadership.</p>
<p>The Business Case for Corporate Responsible Digital Leadership</p>
<p>This is not just a moral imperative for the private sector; consumers, markets, customers, employees also drive this shift. Industries leading the way will achieve a competitive advantage in this new era.</p>
<p>Some businesses are showing leadership. Examples include Maersk and Unilever, benefiting from demonstrating responsible leadership. Patagonia is a trailblazer on transforming by developing their core brand around a sustainable and inclusive approach to business. These companies reap the financial benefits of responsible business as consumers vote with their dollars, develop strong brand loyalty and have employees experiencing a deeper connection with their employer. Salesforce is has set an example for the Tech Sector by explicitly stating that the Business of Business is to Improve the State of the World and this may be a factor in it’s growth &amp; success.</p>
<p>We also live in a moment when tech is transforming everything at an unprecedented pace and impact we have never seen before – for good and bad. Tech provides the infrastructure of the future and policy-makers will not be able to keep up by themselves. However, in collaboration with Business leaders they can better anticipate and design policy to mitigate the harmful effects of tech to society and on the organization. An example is recent significant challenges faced by Tech sector giants of Silicon Valley who have been summoned by US congress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the norms, societal expectations and requirements for business were to assume their full responsibility to society including on the digital front – measured on the value they bring to society and not just the profits they generate for&nbsp; their shareholders, we would be much further along on the SDGs and businesses would prosper financially. The growing impact investing trend shows that investors are eager to fund businesses with a double bottom line. We need investors, customers and other stakeholders to focus similarly on rewarding businesses focused on Responsible Digital leadership.</p>
<p>The Power of Collective Action: Public Private Partnerships and Unorthodox Collaborations&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one expects an individual company to tackle the SDGs,&nbsp; but how a business sees its role in individual and collectively contributing to solutions and taking responsibility for not doing harm will be a game-changer in solving the many challenges we face. This is especially true in the digital realm increasingly becoming foundational infrastructure to businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collaboration across sectors with businesses partnering with governments, UN, foundations can achieve the seemingly unsurmountable challenges and co-create solutions to tackle digital challenges and scale digital opportunities to advance the SDGs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kenya SDG Platform is one example of cross-sectoral collaboration with partners across the world. The UN and Kenya have launched this platform inviting private sector actors, foundations, academics and innovators from across the world to help advance 4 prioritized SDGs. The Kenya SDG Accelerator Lab will bring together practitioners and academics from within country and beyond to explore cutting edge tech innovations from Kenya, Stanford, Berkeley and Silicon Valley to advance 4 SDGs. See Reuter’s article on the&nbsp; <a href="http://news.trust.org/item/20180209112650-s1njv/">Africa’s quest to achieve health care for all needs an unorthodox approach</a> on how such partnerships are being catalyzed to advance primary health care for all (SDG 3) in Kenya.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A similar example of innovative partnerships for change is the adoption of 13 Climate Partnerships by the Danish Government.&nbsp; The collaborative initiative invites industry and industry competences to develop solutions to achieve ambitious climate goals in 13 different areas such as finance, production, life science, aviation and agriculture through active and ambitious co-creational partnerships with the Danish Government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus we are pleased to be able to collaborate with Matthias De Bièvre, the aNewGovernance initiative (<a href="http://anewgovernance.org/">anewgovernance.org</a>) and the Skills Alliance (<a href="http://skills-alliance.org/">skills-alliance.org</a>) which unites public, private and academic organizations to form a Public Private Partnership to create human-centric data ecosystems, at the service of major societal issues such as employment, education and responsible mobility while at the same time bringing great value to businesses and organizations.&nbsp; Broader, shared and ethical access to data enables us to address many of the issues facing us collectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On this subject, Laurent Vidal, professor and research director at the University Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne and vice-president of the Institute for Digital Fundamental Rights (<a href="http://idfrights.org/">idfrights.org</a>) states: «&nbsp;Today the evolution of law and human rights on subjects as complex as digital and artificial intelligence must be done hand in hand with the organizations and companies creating and using these technologies to ensure that regulation and legislation correspond to the realities on the ground”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is Responsible Digital Leadership?</p>
<p>We need innovative solutions – efficient energy solutions, better and cleaner propulsion and more efficient solutions in a very high number of areas.&nbsp;Tech, data and innovation play an important role in fighting climate change and tackling the challenges we face. Artificial intelligence, autonomous technological solutions and better analysis through big data offers hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Covid crisis has underscored the need to process large amounts of data for good, in order to rapidly develop effective and innovative solutions. To effectively stop global warming and advance the human development on hunger, health care and education we will have to develop transformative digital solutions.</p>
<p>But to do that we need to remember to be mindful and responsible. We need trust.</p>
<p>The past years a very high number of guidelines have been presented to curb the adversarial effects of technology. These will have to be integrated into the way we conduct business. We need a new approach to responsible digital leadership. The World Benchmarking Alliance’s <a href="https://www.worldbenchmarkingalliance.org/digital-inclusion/">Digital Inclusion Benchmark</a> is going to be ranking ICT companies.</p>
<p>Business will need to focus on issues such as including stakeholders in decisions, systems thinking, responsible innovation and impact. This means a strong focus on basic values such as fairness, transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>Industry will have to revisit their values and redefine their visions and core missions to ensure relevant focus not just on profit, but also on long term impact.</p>
<p>For most, this means developing new internal roles and organizational bodies such as ethics committees, platforms for stakeholder engagement, revitalized board dialogues and mechanisms to ensure diversity and strong internal discourse of feedback and pushback to ensure a culture of responsible thinking.&nbsp; The carrot for the weary to take this jump is, that this is also necessary to promote the culture of responsible innovation we need to drive business in the 21st century.</p>
<p>The fact that culture is crucial has been coined in many ways and has never been truer. Whereas governance and guidelines are necessary and useful, a culture driven by transparent and bold responsible leadership is key to this development. The means to this end is continuous learning and an ongoing dialogue about values and impact until it seeps into the DNA of the organization.</p>
<p>In addition to addressing these kinds of digital challenges and opportunities in their core business practice/offerings, it is critical that businesses look at technology impact and the SDGs with a global citizen lens looking outwards into the ecosystem. In it’s <a href="http://report.hdr.undp.org/?utm_source=web&amp;utm_medium=homepage&amp;utm_campaign=hdr19">2019 Human Development Report</a> UN Development Program (UNDP) says that Climate change and technology rather than wealth and income are the modern-day wedges increasingly dividing the haves from the have-nots. «&nbsp;The climate crisis is already&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/poor-nations-pay-price-millions-flee-climate-chaos-oxfam-191202005945945.html">hitting the poorest hardest</a>, while technological advances such as machine learning and artificial intelligence can leave behind entire groups of people, even countries. «&nbsp;Allowing these new inequalities to grow could be «&nbsp;extremely dangerous and highly volatile,&nbsp;» said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.</p>
<p>We believe that bringing multiple actors from the corporate sector to collaborate on a framework for Responsible Digital Leadership is important.&nbsp; In this spirit we convened a handful of forward-thinking leaders from the financial sector in Europe at Stanford University in late 2019. Along with leading academics from Stanford University and U.C. Berkeley we brainstormed on co-creating a framework for Responsible Digital leadership. <a href="http://www.responsibletech.io">www.responsibletech.io</a> and launched an initiative on Responsible Digital Leadership described in this <a href="https://humanrights.stanford.edu/news/fellows-launch-responsible-digital-leadership-project">recent Stanford Press Release</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transforming Challenges into Sustainable Solutions to achieve the SDGs</p>
<p>The private sector has a long history of developing innovative solutions to solve big problems. In this moment of existential crisis, who better than visionary private sector leaders to turn the challenges articulated in the SDG into business opportunities – by leveraging the power of innovative technology and new win-win business models – to bring sustainable transformation within the organizations and without, in their supply chains and in their communities, to create win-win solutions for business and society.&nbsp; We call on all business leaders across the world to embrace Responsible Digital leadership and the SDG framework.&nbsp; We call on them to bring the SDGs front and center in the core of their business, not just as a side CSR activity and design create win-win solutions that tackle the grand challenges of our times.</p>
<p>Corporate leaders who boldly institutionalize Responsible Digital Leadership to advance the SDGs can come out as winners.</p>

				 <p>&nbsp;Data has become the most fluid and in-demand commodity of the 21st century. Digitalized societies and the use of data and AI pose a high number of questions and challenges for the rights of individuals. Social media has been boundlessly integrated into our lives without regard. And further, data is now the basis for exercising a number of basic freedoms and human rights. How do we secure the right to privacy and basic human rights in the digital world? And how do we protect those rights? Which governance models do we need to create? How can we leverage recent innovations of Silicon Valley to propel this process? How can we empower people with their data?</p>
<p>&nbsp;This discourse on Governance Models will feed into<a href="http://anewgovernance.org">&nbsp;aNewGovernance </a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://idfrights.org/">The Digital Fundamental Rights Institute</a> which are collaborating to build standards (legal, technical, business, design) for a human centric data circulation infrastructure. The results are expected to be presented at a Conference on Digital Human Rights at Stanford University.</p>

				  Mobility 
 We all want a green,&nbsp;inclusive, and fair economic development,&nbsp;where people can move around freely, while&nbsp;more than half of the planet lives in overcrowded&nbsp;and polluted urban areas. In the Covid-19&nbsp;context, in order to be more&nbsp; resilient, we need&nbsp;to reinvent mobility more than ever. Mobility is by essence&nbsp;a domain where personal data is&nbsp;scattered&nbsp;across various types of actors. As information is the main trigger for people’s decisions, allowing them to be in control and circulate their data will greatly&nbsp;help to address all those challenges.

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Anei mātou te hāpori o Digital Identity NZ e mihi ana ki a koutou i tēnei wiki hirahira, ko te wiki o Te Reo Māori. Arohatia te reo, kia kaha te reo Māori! Warmest greetings to you all during te wiki o Te Reo Māori. Toku ingoa ko, my name is Janelle Riki-Waaka, Pouherenga Waka, Relationships Manager and Kaihuawaere, Consultant Core Education and Digital Identity member.<br><br>Ko te kai a te rangatira, he kōrero – the substance of chiefs is to engage in kōrero. We, here at DINZ, have been engaging in lots of kōrero recently about how we can give mana to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and be tiriti-honouring in our intent and actions. We’ve been on a learning journey together and we are in the process of formalising our thinking into a Te Tiriti o Waitangi Action Plan that will guide our DINZ mahi ensuring we are striving for equity in Aotearoa. Our statement of intent is: “Digital Identity New Zealand is committed to being tiriti honouring by giving mana to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and upholding our responsibilities as effective treaty partners with Māori (Tāngata Tiriti).”<br><br>In thinking about how the articles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi relate to digital identity, here are just a few examples of our recent whakaaro: Article 1 – Kāwanatanga (Honourable Governance): DINZ understands our position as tangata tiriti and we affirm Māori as tangata whenua. Article 2 – Rangatiratanga (Māori Self-determination): We will seek to work alongside tangata whenua to support their aspirations and ensure their needs are addressed in the digital identity space. Article 3 – Ōritetanga (Equity): DINZ will work alongside iwi/hapū to ensure their voices are represented in kōrero about digital identity and their aspirations are realised in terms of digital identity solutions and developments. Article 4 – The Spoke Promise: Te Reo Māori will be celebrated in the digital identity ecosystem in Aotearoa and participating organisations will demonstrate and act on an understanding of their role as Tangata Tiriti. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital Identity New Zealand is on a journey and we are firmly in the waka with hoe (paddle) in hand! We understand the need for us to ensure Māori perspectives relating to identity are leading our hearts, minds and actions. Identity is a taonga (precious possession) and as such must be protected. The connection our tamariki (children) have with their language, culture and identity will shape our future in Aotearoa.<br><br>He tina ki runga, he tāmore ki raro. ‘Contentment above, firmly rooted below.’&nbsp; A good connection to your identity, culture and heritage will find contentment in life.</p>



<p>Janelle Riki-Waaka<br>DINZ Executive Council</p>



 



<p>Kia ora, thank you, Janelle. It is wonderful to have such a skilled and passionate kaiārahi (guide) in our DINZ Executive Council whanau, especially during te wiki o Te Reo Maori.&nbsp;<br><br>We’re pleased to announce our first two DINZ Discussion Forum events: A legal analysis of AML Reliance (members only) 7 October – join us as we share a report commissioned by DINZ members on the challenges and opportunities in the sharing and re-use of identity information used for customer due diligence in AML&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/online-event-dinz-report-aml-reliance-and-re-use/">Register here</a>. Deep dive into our 2020 Trust and Identity research (members only) 30 September – we will share the full research report and explore its implications and the collaborative action we can take to address some of the issues highlighted&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/online-event-exploring-the-trust-and-identity-research/">Register here</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p>



<p>And based on the success of our member spotlight sessions during Techweek, we are launching a quarterly member showcase series.&nbsp;The first of these will be a Spring Showcase on Thursday, 5th November.&nbsp;You can register your interest in presenting <a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz?subject=Spring%20Showcase%20presenter">here</a>.<br><br>For more information on joining DINZ head to the <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/join/">Get Involved</a> section of our website.&nbsp;Next month we will be communicating with members on our <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council</a> elections, which take place early December.&nbsp;We have four positions open for election/re-election.<br><br>Lastly, Happy International Identity Day!&nbsp;September 16 is International Identity Day (otherwise called “<a href="https://www.id-day.org/">ID-Day</a>”).&nbsp;It is an initiative led by <a href="https://id4africa.com/">ID4Africa</a> to raise awareness about the important role identity plays in empowering individuals to exercise their rights and responsibilities fairly and equitably in a modern society.&nbsp;The&nbsp; date 16 September was chosen in commemoration of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16.9 which calls for legal identity for all including birth registration by 2030.</p>
