<p>Authentication plays an increasingly important role in how governments are providing services around the world.</p>



<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit on Sept. 23, 2021, users, experts and vendors from around the world detailed how strong authentication helps to enable government services and new efforts to secure online identities. Users including the U.K. National Health Service (NHS), as well as the U.S. Government’s <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provided insights into the present and future of online authentication and digital identities.</p>



  



<p>In the opening session of the event, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance, outlined the strategic imperative for FIDO in government services around the world.</p>



<p>“COVID-19 created an imperative to really accelerate digital transformation activities,” Shikiar said. “When the pandemic hit all of a sudden, everyone was at home and all activity brought requirements for modern authentication schemes that go far beyond passwords, even beyond traditional multi-factor authentication.”</p>



<p>Shikiar noted that the FIDO Alliance standards align very well with global regulations and policies and there is a growing trend of government guidance for authentication that cites the use of FIDO.</p>



<p>“It’s important to enable trust in the government ecosystem,” Shikiar said. “This comes through the engagement FIDO does with different regulators and government bodies and ultimately will be manifested through the secure implementation of digital identity services to citizens worldwide.”&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Technology Helping to Push FIDO Strong Authentication Forward</p>



<p>A key path for enabling FIDO specification is via vendors that support government efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patrick Sullivan, CTO of security strategy at Akamai, commented that password credential stuffing attacks are very common. He noted that Akamai’s platform sees as many as a billion password attacks per day. That’s where multi-factor authentication and more specifically strong authentication based on FIDO Alliance standards play a strong role. Sullivan noted that there is a clear need to provide multi-factor authentication in a low friction environment where it’s delivered in the form factor of an app on a smartphone.</p>



<p>“We’re not asking users to carry around a hardware token to accomplish FIDO2 as we move in that direction, and by introducing less friction, there’s less risk of our users doing something anomalous,” Sullivan said.</p>



<p>Jeff Frederick, manager of solutions engineering at Yubico, noted during his session that in government, many agencies in the U.S use Common Access Card (CAC)/Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials that go beyond basic passwords. Frederick noted that FIDO2 standards, which are supported on his company’s YubiKey device, provide a strong impersonation resistant authentication protocol that uses public private key cryptography.</p>



  



<p>“It’s very similar to PIV/CAC and FIDO2 is an open standard that’s managed by the FIDO Alliance, so that any vendor can support this and use it today,” Frederick said. “It’s built into all major operating systems and all major browsers so there’s no middleware that you need to install to make this work and it’s just an easy to implement solution that will modernize the federal authentication infrastructure across the board.”</p>



<p>Making Identity and Authentication Less Taxing at the IRS</p>



<p>The IRS proofs and authorizes tens of millions of taxpayers every year, across both digital and non digital channels, according to Courtney Rasey, assistant to the director, Identity Assurance, Privacy Governmental Liaison, &amp; Disclosure (PGLD) at the IRS.</p>



<p>“None of those tens of millions of taxpayers who are calling the IRS are doing so just because they want to, it’s not really a fun weeknight activity,” she said. “They need to resolve an issue to meet their tax obligation and we know that, so we’re always striving to provide better service to taxpayers, to help them get the service that they need in the most convenient and efficient way possible.”</p>



  



<p>One way the IRS is looking to be more convenient to taxpayers is with its Secure Access Digital Identity (SADI) platform that was launched in June of 2021. Rasey explained that SADI leverages a Credential Service {rovider (CSP) that identity proofs the taxpayer and then provides the IRS with a digital identity credential.</p>



<p>“Users are eventually going to be able to access all IRS online applications utilizing that single digital identity credential,” Rasey said. “The IRS is moving more and more applications behind SADI throughout fiscal year 2022 and as we do move more applications taxpayers are going to be able to do so many things with just one credential.”</p>



<p>Moving Toward Zero Trust with Strong Authentication</p>



<p>In May, President Biden signed Executive Order 1402, which directs U.S. government agencies to improve cybersecurity. One of the primary provisions of the executive order is to move the federal government toward a zero trust architecture.</p>



  



<p>“When we talk about zero trust, we’re talking about an architecture where people and their devices aren’t trusted just by virtue of being inside an organization’s enterprise network,” explained Eric Mill, senior advisor, Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>



<p>Mill noted that in a zero trust model, people and devices are validated at each step and&nbsp; authentication is context-aware. The OMB is strongly encouraging the adoption of phishing resistant multi-factor authentication, with FIDO WebAuthn as a good alternative option in environments where CAC/PIV isn’t feasible.</p>



<p>“We’re pushing very hard on multi-factor authentication and we really view reliable authentication as a critical foundation of zero trust architecture,” Mill said.</p>



<p>In a Policy Deep Dive session, Jeremy Grant, managing director, technology business strategy at Venable, noted that there are a number of reasons why authentication is important to governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grant said that FIDO specifications can help governments to protect access to their own assets and can help to enable more high-value citizen facing services to the public.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think what we’re seeing in 2021, is a really different environment across the globe, where FIDO authentication is emerging, not just as another permitted option, but in many cases as a preferred choice of governments across the world,” Grant said.</p>



  



<p>How the National Health Service (NHS) uses FIDO</p>



<p>Among the areas in the world where FIDO is finding a home is in the U.K.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly funded medical and healthcare system in the U.K. and it has embraced FIDO standards to help improve human health.&nbsp; With the NHS Login service, citizens get a centralized identity for health services while the NHS app provides a simplified application for accessing and managing an individual’s access to health services.</p>



<p>Priyanka Mittal, technical architect for the NHS Login and NHS app, said that over the past 18 months there has been a 10-fold increase in the user base for NHS login as demand has grown during the pandemic.</p>



  



<p>Sean Devlin, tech lead for the NHS App, explained that initially the services started out using an SMS based two-factor authentication approach, but wanted to find a more seamless approach. NHS decided to use FIDO UAF and built out its own implementation, using eBay’s open source FIDO implementation as a starting point.</p>



<p>Devlin said that before using FIDO, users had to navigate as many as five different screens to get through a multi-factor authentication flow. With FIDO, it’s a single screen.</p>



<p>The NHS has also saved a lot of money by moving to FIDO. With over 500,000 FIDO logins per day, Devlin estimates that the NHS is saving on the order of £8,000 per day on SMS messaging costs.</p>



<p>Bringing FIDO Strong Authentication to Login.gov</p>



<p>FIDO specifications also play a pivotal role at login.gov, which is a single sign-on platform for U.S. government services.</p>



  



<p>Jonathan Hooper, login.gov Engineering Lead at the General Services Administration (GSA), explained that the authentication portal fronts over 200 sites across the U.S. government,&nbsp; spread across 27 different agencies. Hooper explained that starting in 2018,<a href="http://login.gov"> login.gov</a> began expanding the use of multi-factor authentication, including the WebAuthn specification.</p>



<p>“We don’t want to be ‘big brother,’ we want to make sure that we can protect users’ privacy and the things built into the protocol that helped to do that were very attractive to us,” Hooper said. “WebAuthn is also very cheap, it is much cheaper to do a WebAuthn authentication event than it is to do SMS by several orders of magnitude.”</p>



<p>Improving Digital Identity with FIDO</p>



<p>A FIDO-based approach for digital identity could soon be finding its way to Canada as well according to Joni Brennan, president, Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC). An effort currently underway is the Pan Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) which is an information assurance framework.</p>



<p>“We think that there’s a great opportunity here to leverage an information assurance framework, coupled with FIDO Alliance driven specifications, to create and to verify that end to end experience that’s needed for&nbsp;digital ID adoption,” she said.</p>



  



<p>The need for secured digital identities was also highlighted by Amit Mital, special assistant to the President and senior director, National Security Council at the White House.</p>



<p>“Today, when we authenticate ourselves and identify ourselves, we might use one of dozens of popular systems,” Mital said. “</p>



<p>So the ecosystem itself is very decentralized, and it’s very unharmonized. It is also fundamentally unsecure.”</p>



<p>Mital said that there is a clear need for strong remote identity solutions that can provide easy, secure, affordable and reliable ways to identify consumers across digital systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s clear that there are a diverse and large number of scenarios that need digital identity and there is no single entity that can solve all these scenarios,” Mital said. “We need an ecosystem that brings together the best ideas and innovation from the private sector, both large companies and startups, as well as the government at both the federal and the state, the local, tribal and territorial lands.”</p>



<p>Wrapping up the day’s event, Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance, observed that there are a lot of conversations ongoing about&nbsp; different types of government services and their dependency on secure digital identity.</p>



<p>“Ultimately, identity and authentication are core to deploy new services at scale, in a way that meets the requirements for government agencies, and for citizens alike,” Shikiar said.</p>

<p>The growing interest in verifiable digital credentials, such as mobile driver’s licenses or digital health passes, means companies and governments need new tools for managing risk in this decentralized infrastructure. “Risk management in financial services, such as banking and credit card networks, is a mature field,” said Scott Perry, co-chair of the ToIP Foundation Governance Stack Working Group. “But as we move into decentralized identity management, where individuals manage credentials in their own digital wallets, we need new risk management tools designed for this paradigm.”</p>



<p>To begin to fill this gap, today the Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation announced the release of the&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ToIP-Risk-Assessment-Worksheet-Template-GSWG-Final-Draft.xlsx">ToIP Risk Assessment Worksheet (Excel format)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ToIP-Risk-Assessment-Companion-Guide-RACG-ToIP-Format.pdf">Companion Guide (PDF)</a>. These new tools are intended to equip architects of&nbsp;digital governance frameworks&nbsp;— ”rulebooks” for establishing trust online—with the knowledge they need to perform a risk assessment grounded in generally accepted global standards and techniques, including:</p>



  Proper consideration and identification of potential risks,  Critical analysis of risks in terms of likelihood and severity,  Calculating a systematic risk impact score,  Triaging risks for further treatment,  Risk mitigation requirements and strategies,  Performance of an annual review to reassess existing risks and consider new ones.  



<p>The Risk Assessment Worksheet and Companion Guide provides a step-by-step method of performing a systematic risk assessment that conforms with industry-standard guidance such as ISO/IEC 27005 and NIST 800-30. This process identifies and categorizes risks by likelihood and severity in order to create a risk score that can be color-coded, and stack ranked to highlight the need for countermeasures as shown below. The Worksheet and Companion Guide include enough background and educational content that even risk assessment novices should be able to drive the risk assessment process. “A key missing piece of building open digital trust ecosystems has been a deep understanding of the various risks they introduce.</p>







<p>This can scare off key stakeholders“, said Darrell O’Donnell, CEO of Continuum Loop and Chair of the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group">ToIP Governance Stack Working Group</a>. “The Risk Assessment Worksheet is a powerful tool that helps create clarity about where the real risks are in an ecosystem and what to do about them.”</p>



<p>The Risk Assessment Worksheet and Companion Guide are the first deliverables from the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group">ToIP Governance Stack Working Group</a>&nbsp;(GSWG), whose mission is to produce a complete suite of tools, models, templates, and guides for digital governance frameworks. GSWG member Vikas Malhotra, CEO of WOPLLI Technologies, explained why risk assessment was at the top of the list: “Willingness to take risks is key to forming trust. A risk assessment process helps to qualify and quanfy the risk in a situation, so that the potential trustor can use the information to understand if they should take the risk or not.”</p>



<p>These new tools for risk assessment are already being put to use by digital trust ecosystems being incubated within the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Ecosystem+Foundry+Working+Group">ToIP Ecosystem Foundry Working Group</a>. An example is the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Yoma+Ecosystem+Governance+Framework">YOMA governance framework</a>&nbsp;for youth education and life skills credentials in Africa. “Designing a digital trust ecosystem without first assessing the specific risks it is intended to address is like laying underground pipes without testing them to determine the possibility of leakages” said Frednand Furia, who is leading the Yoma Trust Assurance Task Force. “The ToIP Risk Assessment Worksheet and Companion Guide have already proved to be very effective in architecting the YOMA Rules governance and trust framework.”</p>

 Project EDGE is setting the standard for a customer-centric grid architecture that maximizes the value — and impact — of distributed resources <blockquote>“Customers don’t want kilowatt-hours; they want… hot showers and cold&nbsp;beer.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://rmi.org/insight/negawatt-revolution/">Amory Lovins’ famous quip</a> highlights a paradox of the global energy transition: although hardly anyone gives a second thought to the machinations of the grid, consumer behavior is perhaps the most significant force transforming the electric utility industry.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-03/hyperdrive-daily-ev-adoption-outpaced-off-the-mark-outlooks">Each year actual adoption of electric vehicles, flexible loads, rooftop solar arrays, battery storage systems, and other DERs exceeds even the most bullish of predictions</a>. Transitioning to a decarbonized, distributed electricity system seems less like a wicked problem and more like an irreversible trend.</p><p>Case in point: the Ford F-150 Lightning. When the best-selling vehicle (a pickup truck, no less) in the most car-crazy country on Earth turns into a 180 kWh power plant on wheels with the ability to provide full-home backup power for over a week, distributed energy has officially gone mainstream.</p><p>There is no doubt that an <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/energy-transport-sustainability-10-predictions-for-2021/">ever-growing fleet</a> of DERs represents a massive opportunity to improve resiliency, lower costs, and reduce carbon emissions in grids across the world. Yet even as DERs get cheaper, more powerful, and more plentiful, they remain chronically underutilized.</p><p>Regulations like <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/ferc-order-2222-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity-for-decentralized-technologies-to-accelerate-the-c35cf41527cb">FERC Order 2222</a> and frameworks like <a href="https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/Publications/Position%20papers%20and%20reports/TSO-DSO_ASM_2019_190416.pdf">Integrated TSO/DSO Coordination</a> have been developed specifically to address this challenge and tap into burgeoning DER resources in the US and Europe, respectively. Yet while FERC 2222 is ostensibly designed to remove barriers to DER participation in all energy markets, it has caused much hand wringing, delayed regulatory filings from every major ISO / RTO, and as yet, no tangible results. In Europe, progress on TSO/DSO coordination isn’t much further along. Despite plenty of <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/11/30/17868620/renewable-energy-power-grid-architecture">excellent work on conceptual frameworks</a>, hesitation remains amongst grid operators (and regulators) to lean into the transition.</p><p>Why? By and large, incumbents are focused on solving the wrong problem. Too often, the assumption is that the key to unlocking the full potential of DERs is some sort of optimization: How can we perfectly utilize lots of small-scale, flexible assets to balance the variable nature of large-scale renewables like wind and solar? That work is important, but it’s not the real barrier to redesigning our grids’ architecture and toolsets. Focusing on DER optimization is like debating the merits of Gmail vs. Apple Mail vs. Microsoft Outlook before you’ve solved a more fundamental issue: how to send and receive email through a common, narrow waist protocol.</p><p>Before we can optimize DERs, the grid needs its own equivalent of SMTP — an open protocol through which DERs of all shapes and sizes can seamlessly exchange data and integrate into markets. The solution may not be easy, but it is surprisingly simple: there needs to be a shared view of DER attributes, relationships, and behaviors across all participants so each can perform their respective function. Just as the physical grid evolved over a century ago, the best way to achieve this is through shared, public digital infrastructure, rather than leaving it up to individual companies to manage independently. We can all move better and faster when we move together.</p><p>To see the answer in action, look to Australia.</p><p>Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) is at the bleeding edge of the distributed energy world, and it’s only getting more advanced in the coming years. With the <a href="https://onestepoffthegrid.com.au/australia-leads-the-world-on-solar-per-capita-at-664-watts-per-person/">highest per capita penetration of solar PV in the world</a>, an incredibly <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/31/australias-energy-storage-installed-base-to-grow-more-than-five-times-by-2030/">mature storage market</a>, a<a href="https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/climate-change/net-zero-plan/electric-vehicle-strategy"> host of EV incentives</a>, and greatly expanded <a href="https://aemo.com.au/en/initiatives/trials-and-initiatives/wholesale-demand-response-mechanism">opportunities for demand-side market participation</a>, Australia is on pace to get <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/henbest-energy-2040-faster-shift-clean-dynamic-distributed/">nearly half of its electricity from DERs by&nbsp;2040</a>.</p><p>In a deregulated energy market like the NEM, there are lots of proverbial cooks in the kitchen. For any given customer who owns rooftop solar or storage, there’s a long list of stakeholders, including the DER manufacturer (or “OEM”), the DER installer, the local distribution utility (Distribution Network Service Provider, or “DNSP”), their energy retailer, perhaps an aggregator, and of course the Australian Energy Market Operator&nbsp;(AEMO).</p><p>Each of these parties, including the customer themselves, is interested in the DER for different reasons. The customer might primarily care about how the DER delivers comfort or economic benefit, the OEM cares about operational performance and warranties, the DNSP cares about the DER’s impact on network congestion, the retailer on tariffs and/or wholesale market exposure, the aggregator on its impact to deliver grid services or optimize its DER portfolio, and AEMO cares about its contribution (or lack thereof) to the aggregator’s portfolio delivery.</p><p>Today each of these stakeholders operates more or less in their own separate world with limited, if any, information about the others. Typically, the information each stakeholder has about the DER and its influence on their domain is protected; sharing is not encouraged and customers need to register separate accounts with each entity. This presents a number of problems.</p><p>The primary revenue opportunity for DER owners is providing one or more services in the NEM wholesale market via an aggregator. As more aggregators enroll more DERs into more services and markets, the collective impact on the distribution network can be detrimental if DER behavior is not informed by physical grid constraints. Even though they manage interconnection requests, the DNSPs don’t ordinarily enroll DERs to use for local services, so they don’t monitor or manage their behavior on an ongoing basis. Yet most customers would happily enroll in complementary local services programs for DNSPs to maximize their revenue potential.</p><p>So we currently have markets where participants often act in operational silos, and DERs are not utilized to their fullest potential. Data exchanges, where they exist, are accomplished through bespoke point-to-point integrations between each participant’s system. Maintaining alignment across all their systems, managing access and permissions, and establishing relationships is extremely costly relative to the value of any given&nbsp;DER.</p> Project EDGE: Overcoming the Barriers of Legacy Data&nbsp;Exchange <p>In <a href="https://energyweb.org/aemo/">Project EDGE</a>, Energy Web (EW) is working with AEMO, AusNet (a key DNSP), and Mondo (a large aggregator), to build a shared infrastructure for establishing identity, roles, and permissions for all market participants. Instead of the bilateral point-to-point integrations, we’re building a hub and spoke architecture in which each participant’s IT system integrates with a common, shared data exchange solution. In other words, the hub isn’t unilaterally controlled by any single party; rather, it’s built using EW’s Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS), which allows every single market player to participate by hosting nodes (i.e., servers) that facilitate data exchange between all parties’ internal IT and OT systems. It provides a shared, trusted view of identity, relationships, and permissions for different actors and components within the system. EW-DOS also streamlines message exchange, and allows AusNet (the distribution utility), and AEMO (the wholesale market operator) to coordinate on the utilisation of DERs simultaneously across local and wholesale services.</p><p>In EDGE, all participating organizations and DER assets are given a unique digital identity via <a href="https://did-explainer.energyweb.org/#/default-dashboard">decentralized identifiers, or DIDs</a>. DIDs not only contain information about the physical location and attributes of DERs, but also define relationships (e.g. mapping a given DER to a specific aggregator’s portfolio) as well as roles within the EDGE marketplace (e.g. permissions to send/receive, or read/write certain types of&nbsp;data).</p><p>On the aggregator side, DIDs act as a common anchor point for enrolling and operating DERs in multiple markets based on their technical capabilities and where they are connected in the distribution grid. On the grid operator side, DIDs help the DNSP pair enrollment information with actual, physical grid constraints — such as congestion or capacity limits on certain distribution feeder circuits — so AEMO can factor those constraints into wholesale market operations. In short, DIDs become the common currency — the narrow waist protocol — by which all parties develop a shared understanding of the system state and move forward from&nbsp;there.</p><p>DERs are interconnected physically to the grid. With EDGE, they are now also interconnected digitally to each other and to grid operators’ systems, unlocking a next wave of the energy transition. By leveraging a shared infrastructure, EDGE removes the traditional friction for identity verification and data reconciliation among aggregators, DNSPs, and AEMO. Being fully open source, there are no licence fees, which helps significantly reduce market operating costs, as well as competitive barriers for existing and new entrants. Having designed it to be protocol agnostic, the EDGE architecture is highly flexible, ensuring participants don’t need to reengineer their own systems to engage with&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the ongoing energy transition, decarbonization via renewable energy is an unstoppable runaway train. Meanwhile, decentralization — via connecting and leveraging low-carbon DERs at scale — is gaining major momentum due to growing investment by customers, and in part regulatory tailwinds from FERC Order 2222 and similar regulations. But despite their rapid growth, DERs too often remain islands unto themselves — myriad isolated outposts connected to the edges of the electricity grid, collecting data in siloed, private databases.</p><p>Before we can make use of that data to optimize DERs for local or system benefits, the grid needs a narrow waist protocol through which DERs can seamlessly and securely establish identity and share data amongst all stakeholders.</p><p>Grid operators from the U.S. and EU can and should look at what’s happening in the Southern Hemisphere with Project EDGE: DIDs anchored to public digital infrastructure provide the necessary on-ramp for DERs to be the integral grid-connected assets evangelists have been saying they are. What we’re building may be driven by the requirements of the NEM, but the open-source EW-DOS stack is directly relevant to any market looking for ways to better tap into DERs.

 Both specs are ready to start implementing and being improved based on implementation feedback. 
 In OIDC4VP, progress has been made on using Presentation Exchange in the request-response syntax, for example, agreeing to include presentation_submission inside the signed ID token even when VP is being sent back separately as a VP Token. 
 In SIOP v2, some relevant discussions worth highlighting are how to use DIDs as Relying Party's (RP) client_id to resolve it and obtain RP's registration metadata; using universal links and trust frameworks to invoke SIOP instead of using custom URL schema.

<p>Submitted by SecureKeys' <a href="https://medium.com/@baha.abushaaban">Baha Shaaban</a><br></p><p>In short, ECDH-1PU is a key derivation process that allows for sender authenticity and enables a “<a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/11/what-is-perfect-forward-secrecy/#:~:text=Perfect%20forward%20secrecy%20means%20that,of%20the%20user's%20sensitive%20data.">Perfect Forward Secrecy</a>” mechanism, in addition to significant performance gains over JWS message nested in a JWE envelope, as used by existign ECDH-ES aproaches. This article walks through how ECDH-ES works step by step, showing how it achieves sender identity authentication using nested messages (JWS in JWE), and finally showing how ECDH-1PU is a better choice for authenticating the sender. This helps maintain the use of a single JWE message (without JWS) to meet the need for constrained agents (such as IOT devices) by reducing their communication footprint.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mathyaskurmann?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Mathyas Kurmann</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/post?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman">Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman</a> (ECDH) is a protocol that allows two parties to establish a secure and private channel over an insecure and observed network, and forms the basis for the secure encryption on many popular messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Signal and Skype… as well as DIDComm V1, which is being superseded by a more broadly interoperable V2. So-called “Diffie-Hellman” key exchanges ensure that messages sent over the channel they create can only be correctly interpreted by the sender and intended recipient, regardless of eavesdropping or security breaches on the communications channel.</p><p>As described in the<a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#message-encryption"> Message Encryption</a> section of the DIDComm v2 specification, the DIDComm protocol for transmitting Decentralized IDentifiers (DIDs) requires protecting a message using either Anonymous Encryption (aka `Anoncrypt`) or Sender Authenticated Encryption (aka `Authcrypt`). Either of these methods take different inputs and create a secure channel between two or more parties.</p><p>In the “AnonCrypt” handshake, there is no pre-existing “sender key” involved and it is intended for only the recipients of the message. This mechanism requires encryption with a Content Encryption Key (a “cek”) being wrapped with a key agreement mechanism using `ECDH-ES` for each recipient. DIDComm uses this “key-wrapping mode” with<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4.6"> ECDH-ES</a> to ensure only the intended recipients can decrypt the final message. The benefit of using `ECDH-ES` is that it's widely used and available in many crypto libraries for most modern languages. Building JWE envelopes using this type of encryption should be relatively easy using existing JOSE libraries in your preferred language.</p><p>“AuthCrypt'', however, requires a pre-existing (and published/discoverable) sender key to encrypt the message for the sender, and against which the sender can be authenticated. This encryption mechanism uses the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04"> ECDH-1PU</a> specification from IETF, the main topic of this article. As a growing number of independent implementations get announced, 1PU advances on the Standards Track at IETF and achieves maturity as a specification; for this reason, we are offering this educational resource so that understanding of its mechanisms can grow as well.</p> The all-important “Z” in ECDH-ES, first step in understanding ECDH-1PU <p>To understand how ECDH-1PU is significant, knowledge about the internals of ECDH-ES is required. ECDH-ES key agreement requires the sender to execute the following steps for each recipient to derive the key used to wrap the `cek`:</p><p>1. Generate an<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4.6.1.1"> ephemeral key</a> (aka `epk`).</p><p>2. Build `apu`, the producer (sender) identity. For Anoncrypt, this will represent the X value of `epk`, base64URL-encoded.</p><p>3. Build `apv`, the receiver (recipient) identity. It can optionally contain the recipient `kid`, base64URL-encoded.</p><p>4. Compute `Z`: the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4.6.2"> key derivation</a> process output of ECDH for each recipient using the above values with the **private** `epk` key and the recipient’s **public** key on the sender side. An example is found in<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#appendix-C"> appendix C</a> of the IETF RFC7518. On their end, the recipient will get the **public** `epk` and therefore does the same computation with their own **private** key.</p><p>5. Finally, the computed derived key is used to wrap the `cek`, the symmetric key used to encrypt/decrypt the payload content (the `ciphertext` section) of the JWE envelope .</p><p>So, to be clear, ECDH-ES takes as mandatory inputs an ephemeral key generated by the sender and the recipient's public key (a static long-lived key) to compute the key derivation `Z`; for this reason, the ES notation means Ephemeral-Static in ECDH-ES. This derivation fits neatly the requirement to protect messages for recipients without revealing the sender's identity (ie: no static sender key is used in the key derivation process when the recipient derives `Z`).</p> Key derivation beyond ECDH-ES to enable AuthCrypt <p>In the previous section, key derivation using an ephemeral key does not reveal who sent the message. This is useful for messages requiring anonymity of the author, e.g. a router agent receiving a message does not need to authenticate the sender in any way; its only purpose is to route the message to an end recipient. For this router agent, passing along Anoncrypt messages is acceptable.</p><p>In most cases, an end recipient requires authenticating the original sender. This means recipients will need to hold the sender's public key prior to receiving their messages in order to authenticate them. Since ECDH-ES does not involve the sender key, the only way to authenticate a sender is to nest a JWS in a JWE message which is “heavier” &nbsp;than a plain JWE-only message, i.e., more complex (i.e. expensive) to process and route.</p><p>Another, newer, option would be to use a new key derivation process that involves the sender's key.<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04"> ECDH-1PU</a> was introduced for this specific purpose; it uses the sender's static key in the key derivation process. The following section is dedicated to this process.</p> The Advantages of using ECDH-1PU (adapted from the DIDComm v2<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04#section-1"> Introduction</a>) <p></p><p>The advantages of public key authenticated encryption with ECDH-1PU<br>compared to using nested, signed-then-encrypted documents include:</p><p>Size and Efficiency</p><p>The resulting message size is more compact, as an additional layer of headers and base64url-encoding is avoided. &nbsp;A 500-byte payload when encrypted and authenticated with ECDH-1PU (with P-256 keys and "A256GCM" Content Encryption Method) results in a 1087-byte JWE in Compact Encoding. &nbsp;An equivalent, nested-then-signed-then-encrypted JOSE message using the same keys and encryption method is 1489 bytes (37% larger).</p><p>In both cases, though, the same cryptographics primitives achieve the same levels of confidentiality and authenticity, so these savings in code size, so crucial for constrained environments, come at no cost to privacy and security outcomes.</p><p>Increased Security</p><p>The generic composition of signatures and public key encryption involves a number of subtle details that are essential to security (namely, to the traits of Public Key Authenticated Encryption or<a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/12/14/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-iii/"> PKAE</a>). Providing a dedicated algorithm for public key authenticated encryption reduces complexity for users of JOSE libraries, which lowers the incidence of human error and design flaws with cybersecurity implications.</p><p>Flexibility</p><p>ECDH-1PU provides only authenticity and not the stronger security properties of non-repudiation or third-party verifiability. This can be an advantage in applications where privacy, anonymity, or plausible deniability are goals.</p> ECDH-1PU for sender authentication <p>Similar to ECDH-ES, the 1PU process executes key derivation to compute a Z but has 2 computations rather than 1, with the final result being formed by concatenating both as described here (Adapted from the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04#section-2.3"> Key Derivation</a> section of RFC7518):</p><p>1. The first is called `Ze`, which is the exact same key derivation as ECDH-ES using a private encryption provider key (`epk`) and the public recipient key on the sender side. (The recipient side will involve the public `epk` and the private recipient key).</p><p>2. The second is called `Zs`; in this second computation, we use the sender's static (long-lived) key instead of `epk`. So on the sender side we derive `Zs` by using the sender's private key and the recipient's public key. (The recipient side will use the sender's public key and the recipient's private key on their end).</p><p>The final `Z` is the concatenation of `Ze` and `Zs` which is then used in the key-wrapping, analogously to ECDH-ES.</p><p>There are special considerations in the process to protect against sender impersonation as described in Section<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04#section-2.1"> 2.1</a> of the draft:</p>  In Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode, the JWE Authentication Tag is included in the input to the Key Derivation Function as described in section Section 2.3. &nbsp;This ensures that the content of the JWE was produced by the original sender and not by another recipient, as described in the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4"> Key Management Algorithms Section</a> of the RFC.  Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode MUST only be used with content encryption algorithms that are compactly committing AEADs as described in the Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2-05"> specification</a>.  The AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 algorithms described in<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-5.2"> section 5.2</a> of RFC7518 are compactly committing and can be used with ECDH-1PU in Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode. Other content encryption algorithms MUST be rejected.  In Direct Key Agreement mode, any JWE content encryption algorithm MAY be used. This mode is NOT supported in DIDComm V2.  <p>The requirement to include the JWE Authentication Tag in the input to the Key Derivation Function implies an adjustment to the order of operations performed during JWE Message Encryption described in section 5.1 of [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516">RFC7516</a>]. &nbsp;Steps 3-8 are deferred until after step15, using the randomly generated CEK from step 2 for encryption of the message content.</p><p>To sum up, these considerations require:</p><p>1. The use of the `AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA` family of content encryption algorithms to encrypt the payload. Currently, JWE supports the following three algorithms in this family:</p><p>1. A128CBC-HS256</p><p>2. A192CBC-HS384</p><p>3. A256CBC-HS512</p><p>Note, however, that the DIDComm v2 specification<a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#curves-and-content-encryption-algorithms"> constrains payload encryption options</a> to minimize interoperability issues across implementations, so only the third-listed encryption algorithm, A256CBC-HS512, should be used for DIDComm v2 purposes.</p><p>2. Encrypt the payload prior to wrapping `cek` with the derived `Z`. The output is labelled `ciphertext` and `tag`</p><p>3. Use the resulting `tag` from the previous step as the value `len(tag)`+`tag` set in `cctag` in the key derivations of `Ze` and `Zs`.</p><p>Additionally, the `skid` protected header is also introduced as a `kid` (key ID) to reference the sender key. This will help recipients resolve the key behind `skid` and execute the ECDH-1PU process explained in the previous section.</p><p>For the sake of consistency, `apu` and `apv` must be set to the values mentioned in<a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#ecdh-1pu-key-wrapping-and-common-protected-headers"> section 5.8</a> of the DIDComm Messaging protocol to further restrain and protect the message.</p> Conclusion <p><br>ECDH-1PU is a public-key derivation process that allows for sender authentication and offers not only increased security, but also performance gains as mentioned above, especially when compared to a JWS message nested in a JWE envelope. This article walked through the implementation of ECDH-ES, showing how it achieves sender identity authentication using nested messages (JWS in JWE), and finally showing how ECDH-1PU is a better choice for authenticating the sender. This helps maintain the use of a single JWE message (without JWS) to meet the need for constrained agents (such as IOT devices) by reducing their communication footprint, as well as making it suitable where anonymity and privacy are of particular concern.<br></p><p>To find out more about joining the DIDComm Working Group at DIF, visit their page<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html"> here</a>, or follow their work on GitHub<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging"> here</a>.<br><br><br><br></p>

<p>The Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada and Prompt announce a partnership to support Quebec companies’ cyber-resiliency</p>



<p>September 21, 2021 – The <a href="https://diacc.ca/">Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada</a> (DIACC) and <a href="https://promptinnov.com/">Prompt</a> are pleased to announce a collaborative partnership that will improve the cyber-resiliency of Quebec companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The partnership will promote to Quebec based entities the importance of cybersecurity and digital identity as well as supporting the cost inherent to the development of their cybersecurity solution and / or the cost inherent to obtain relevant cybersecurity certification, trustmarks and standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through this partnership a process will be set to enable Quebec based entities to apply for reimbursement of 50% percent of the trustmark assessment costs associated with <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework </a>(PCTF) verification through <a href="https://diacc.ca/voila-verified/">DIACC’s Voilà Verified PCTF Trustmark verification program</a> through stream 2 of <a href="https://promptinnov.com/cybersecurite/">Prompt’s Quebec Cybersecurity Innovation Program</a> (QCIP). DIACC will be the entry point for those applications and will recommend to QCIP the most qualified projects for funding. Prompt and DIACC will also work together to raise awareness and drive the identification of new R&amp;D projects that have the opportunity to apply for funding through stream 1 of Prompt’s QCIP.</p>



<p>The Voilà Verified program sets auditable process based criteria at the intersection of technology and information assurance. Entities that earn the Voilà Verified PCTF Trustmark will be better prepared for global digital economy interoperability with frameworks and standards including and not limited to the NIST 800-63 series and the European Union’s eIDAS regulation.</p>



<p>“Leveraging our respective organizational strengths, the DIACC and Prompt will enable Quebec based entities to meet the digital identity, cyber resilience, and digital workforce related demands of the digital economy.” said Maxime Clerk, Senior Director of QCIP, Prompt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital identity verification of businesses and individuals plays an important role in cyber resiliency for the emergence of smart cities, smart health, and ai. We are thrilled to work together to amplify opportunities for Quebec based entities to fully benefit from the global digital economy” said Joni Brennan, President, DIACC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About the Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) (<a href="https://diacc.ca/">www.diacc.ca</a>)<br>The DIACC is a non-profit coalition of more than 100 public and private sector members that are committed to developing a Canadian digital identification and authentication framework to enable Canada’s full and secure participation in the global digital economy. The DIACC was created as a result of the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review and members include representatives from both the federal and provincial levels of government as well as private sector leaders.</p>



<p>About Prompt (<a href="https://promptinnov.com/">www.promptinnov.com</a>)<br>Prompt’s mission and objectives are to stimulate university-industry Research and Development (R&amp;D) partnerships that increase the competitiveness between Quebec companies of the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) industry. Prompt is active throughout the ICT sector, from hardware to software, as well as in components, networks and applications. This makes it possible for Prompt to build critical masses of projects within specific vertical markets (i.e.: health, security, transport, etc.) upon which industrial value chains increasingly rely.</p>

<p>Streamlining Global Trade</p> 


<p>How can standards help the world address the challenges of climate change, conflict minerals, and abuses of labor forces? OASIS members are answering that question with OriginBX.</p>



 The Problem 



<p>Free trade and the efficient flow of goods across international borders is something that a lot of us take for granted.&nbsp; Our collective society is built on the assumption that we can effectively buy finished goods or raw materials from a variety of countries, as well as trade or sell our own goods.</p>



<p>However, the seemingly simple act of buying or selling these goods across borders isn’t as straightforward as you might think.&nbsp; There are an increasingly complex set of requirements put in place by both governments and other organizations designed to protect consumers, producers and labor forces from abuse.&nbsp; At the heart of these requirements is a need to accurately identify the country or countries of origin for both finished goods and also raw materials used to produce those goods.</p>



<p>Despite the technological age we live in today, a vast majority of products and materials still have their countries of origin determined by manual processes involving emailing large bills of materials and PDF files between producers and regulatory bodies worldwide.&nbsp; An enterprising group of technologists and companies has gotten together to do something about that.</p>



 Finding Creative Solutions 



<p>On a recent episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YCorJCMhJ0">Open Matters</a>, I was joined by Todd Smith of KYG.trade, who is also the chairperson for a new Open Project here at OASIS called <a href="https://originbx-oasis.org/">OriginBX</a>, which is designed to help build common standards to allow for greater automation in identifying countries of origin for manufactured goods and their components.&nbsp; Todd has spent more than 20 years working on this problem at places like Ernst &amp; Young and KPMG, and our conversation was a fascinating one in that it covered not only the technical needs for a project like this, but also the larger role that country of origin plays in helping fight societal issues like climate change, conflict minerals, and abuses of labor forces.</p>



<p>Todd also speaks at length as to why he chose to come to OASIS to start this project and what our governance and community support model has done in helping him launch this effort.</p>



<p>Projects like OriginBX are one of the reasons I was excited to come to OASIS Open, where we strive to enable collaborative projects that make a difference not only in the technology space, but also in the lives of us all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I encourage you to watch and/or listen to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YCorJCMhJ0">episode</a>, and feel free to reach out to me directly or follow us on social media (@OASISOpen) to continue the conversation.</p>

 California grid operator launches new demand flexibility platform enhancements to Flex Alert system, leveraging Energy Web technology <p>As climate change causes more extreme weather events, electric grid operators face greater challenges to maintaining system reliability. The U.S. has seen examples this year from a variety of immediate causes: February’s <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/14/texas-power-grid-conserve-ercot/">grid failure in Texas</a> from extreme cold, this summer’s grid challenges in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/new-york-heat-wave-nears-its-sweaty-peak-as-northwest-highs-ease?sref=vuYGislZ">New York City from extreme heat</a>, and reduced transmission capacity and power supply due to wildfires in the&nbsp;West.</p><p>These challenges show no signs of abating, and therefore grid operators need to pursue a variety of strategies to ensure the grid operates reliably in times of extreme stress. One of the tools that grid operators use is load flexibility: rather than treating electricity demand as fixed at any given time and adjusting supply to meet it, grid operators increasingly try to adjust demand as well. Demand flexibility takes various forms, ranging from <a href="https://rmi.org/the-california-blackout-that-wasnt/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=spark&amp;utm_content=spark&amp;utm_campaign=2021_07_01">utility demand response programs</a> to <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/california-governor-makes-emergency-bid-to-prevent-blackouts/">calls for the public to voluntarily conserve</a> in times of, especially, high&nbsp;demand.</p> Limitations of legacy demand flexibility systems <p>Among the programs in the latter category is one managed by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), which is responsible for managing the transmission grid across much of California and a small part of Nevada. That program, called <a href="https://flexalert.org/">Flex Alerts</a>, historically has worked as&nbsp;follows.</p>  If CAISO foresees that, because of the weather forecast, supply and transmission conditions, and expected demand, demand will be critically high relative to supply in the coming days, it calls a Flex&nbsp;Alert.  Calling a Flex Alert simply means that CAISO communicates a call to conserve electricity during specific critical hours. That communication takes several forms, including an email to Flex Alert subscribers and posts to social&nbsp;media.  The message is a request for consumers to voluntarily conserve during the specific hours. Consumers then conserve if, and as much as, they wish: CAISO has no ability to adjust consumers’ thermostat settings or take any other steps to force anyone to conserve.  <p>One limitation of this system has been that CAISO has had no visibility into how many consumers might try to conserve electricity. That is to say, when CAISO calls a Flex Alert, is the public paying attention? Will people try to save energy? The only way to measure the effect of the program has been afterward to compare the demand that CAISO would have expected if not for the Flex Alert to the demand that the system actually&nbsp;saw.</p> Advantages of California’s new Flex Alert&nbsp;system <p>CAISO now has deployed an improved Flex Alert platform based on Energy Web’s open-source technology stack. The new system has several advantages:</p>  Consumers can subscribe to receive either emails or SMS messages whenever CAISO calls a Flex Alert. Open and response rates are much higher for SMS messages than for emails, and therefore people who choose to subscribe to receive SMS messages on their phones are more likely to see a Flex Alert in time to conserve. Enrollment in either or both subscription options is simple for consumers.  Non-subscribers (e.g., people who see a Flex Alert message on social media) and subscribers can respond to the Flex Alert message, so CAISO has some insight into how much demand flexibility it might expect. This insight can become more accurate over time, as past response numbers can be correlated with observed demand reduction.  Subscribers have the option to provide the postal (ZIP) code where they live and see how response rates for their area compare to those for other areas. It also gives CAISO some insight into, in the aggregate, where conservation efforts are greatest.  Because the platform is designed with Energy Web’s approach to self-sovereign identity, CAISO cannot link personal data — email address or mobile number, or postal code — to response history. CAISO can view aggregated data about, for example, how many subscribers in a particular county responded to the most recent Flex Alert. However, CAISO has no ability to connect individual responses with personal information. This means that consumers can be more confident that when they participate (i.e., subscribe or respond to a Flex Alert) they are not creating a data trail for malign actors to&nbsp;mine.   Opportunities to expand demand flexibility anywhere <p>Our identity approach and the data protection it provides also are extensible to potential future&nbsp;uses.</p><p>First, digital identities can be assigned to IoT devices (assets) and integrated into the platform, if it were desirable to integrate other types of demand flexibility programs. This could allow, for example, secure communication directly with smart thermostats, which could then pre-cool automatically (or after the owner’s approval) and then conserve during critical hours. Likewise, electric vehicle charging could be shifted to non-critical hours, so long as charge levels are reached before the vehicle is&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Second, because the platform can be operated without anyone organization owning the data or excluding others from it, it enables other power sector stakeholders (regulators, local utilities, or others) to participate as well. For example, if a local utility wished to collaborate with CAISO and use the platform to know which customers and devices were participating in a demand response program, it could do that while keeping access to sensitive customer data limited to the appropriate parties.</p><p>Furthermore, this platform could facilitate compensation of consumers for the flexibility provided. This would depend on the relevant stakeholders (transmission grid operator, local utility, regulator) all being supportive, but the point is that the technology enables greater levels of reliable, measurable flexibility — all while ensuring appropriate privacy and data ownership — and is independent of whatever market or program design is applied by those stakeholders.</p><p>Finally, because the technology is open-source, it could be implemented by other grid operators, with or without Energy Web’s engagement. We see other places in the U.S. alone where the power sector might wish to enhance existing practices, like <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/new-york-heat-wave-nears-its-sweaty-peak-as-northwest-highs-ease?sref=vuYGislZ">New York</a> or <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/14/texas-power-grid-conserve-ercot/">Texas</a>. But of course, the technology is not limited to the U.S. and could be useful anywhere that the ability to increase demand flexibility while maintaining privacy is desirable.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/california-grid-operator-launches-new-demand-flexibility-platform-enhancements-to-flex-alert-system-e01ae8030da0">California grid operator launches new demand flexibility platform enhancements to Flex Alert…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Global Assured Identity Network White Paper was the centerpiece of the OpenID Foundation’s &nbsp;Chairman Nat Sakimura’s keynote at the European Identity Conference just a few days ago. His presentation can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://nat.sakimura.org/2021/09/14/announcing-gain/">https://nat.sakimura.org/2021/09/14/announcing-gain/</a>.&nbsp;Nat describes GAIN as an overlay network on top of the Internet with all its participants&nbsp;identity proofed. One key benefit of the approach proposed in the white paper is that the standards required to enable this network already exist: OpenID Connect and eKYC/IDA.</p>
<p>The White Paper was&nbsp;a “no&nbsp;logo, pro bono, open source” collaboration of over 150 co-authors including many members of the OpenID Foundation. It’s well on its way to achieving its goal of generating&nbsp;a&nbsp;community wide discussion on the business, technical and legal requirements for pragmatic international interoperability.</p>
<p>One of our newest&nbsp;members and&nbsp;GAIN co author, Donna Beatty will&nbsp;co-lead&nbsp;the OpenID Foundation’s GAIN Technical Proof of Concept with Dr. Torsten Lodderstedt. Until recently Donna, was Executive Director, Digital Identity&nbsp;and Authentication, JPMorgan Chase and is a widely recognized technical, regulatory and business domain expert. Donna and Torsten are now organizing participation and processes to test the technical approach described in the White Paper. &nbsp;Interested parties should contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:donna@oidf.org">donna@oidf.org</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>

<p>Var group has organized, as part of the Convention Var Group in Riccione, from 19 to 21 a hackaton on the theme Blockchain <a href="http://www.vargroup.it/hackathon">www.vargroup.it/hackathon</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2018, Var Group entered the capital of commercio.network, one of the most innovative European blockchains. In fact, commercio.network is focused not on cryptocurrencies but rather on three crucial topics of digital transformation for companies:</p>
 
 E-identity. Identity management respecting privacy 
 E-signature The management of advanced electronic signatures 
 E-delivery Certified delivery of documents and proof of their existence 
 
<p>Var group, through its BlockIT company, became one of 100 independent validator nodes on July 4, 2020. The commercio.network blockchain &nbsp;instead of using electricity to validate its network, &nbsp;uses a new consensus algorithm called POS. This consensus mechanism consumes in a year what Bitcoin consumes in a minute, making it the most sustainable blockchain in the world and consequently the cheapest in the world as each transaction costs only a euro cent plus VAT</p>
<p>From July 4, 2021 Commerc.io srl offers the opportunity to all independent developers to use its commerce.app platform to create applications. commerce.app allows to solve the problem of wallet security through a fully-hosted platform based on HSM devices and programmable via API.</p>
<p>For developers participating in Var Group’s hackathon, commercio.io has provided two free online seminars consisting of 10 one-minute videos that explain respectively:</p>
<p>How to do business with blockchain :(in italian only) &nbsp;in which it is finally explained the substantial difference between blockchain and Internet and 36 use cases of applications to be developed related to 36 big problems that can be solved only through the blockchain of Commerce network. The video is available at the link <a href="https://commerc.io/farebusiness">https://commerc.io/farebusiness &nbsp; </a>Using the invitation code: VarGroup</p>

Now, however, autumn has arrived, and we’ve run our September Co-op&nbsp;day.</p><p>After checking in, saying hello and discussing the phrase “brand new second hand desk chair”, we got to work and focused on two main areas of the co-op: Operations and Marketing.</p> Operations <p>Digital stuff, workflows and processes are not static components of business. Technical decisions need to be reviewed on a regular basis no matter what shape or size your organisation is.</p><p>We spoke about our digital infrastructure and making improvements to our server setup.

In our co-op day, Anne shared some of the things she’s been working on that loosely connect to our “marketing strategy”. She also showed us thinking she’s been doing regarding <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop">Learnwith.weareopen.coop</a>, our library of free resources for working openly and collaboratively. In response, John got excited about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardley_map">Wardley Mapping</a>, and all of us started geeking out on the methodology. John and Anne are going to do some Wardley Mapping for WAO in the coming&nbsp;days.</p><p>We also spoke about running an end of year campaign.

In our co-op day we ran proposals to allot budget towards two budding ideas. We decided to support someone going to the <a href="https://www.coops.tech/">CoTech</a> meet-up in London later in the&nbsp;month.</p><p>We also passed a proposal to do a Strategic Starfish exercise in our co-op days as an experiment. Once that proposal was passed, we did the exercise. Our Strategic Starfish was great fodder for all the little to-dos and ideas people have about co-op work.

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Regula?</p>



<p>A leader in innovation and with over 29 years of experience in the industry, Regula develops and imporves solutions for the identity verification market. We strive to provide our customers with the best possible level of security and ensure that they benefit from superior protection features.</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>The existing and emerging markets are growing fast. New banks, new currencies, new technologies are all rapidly reshaping the customer’s expectations. A trustworthy digital identity that ensures the best possible level of security is crucial to retaining customers and growing businesses in this fast-paced industry.</p>
 



 
<a href="https://mobile.regulaforensics.com/"></a>



<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Millions of people trust the Governmental Security Organizations every day for their safety and well-being. It’s essential that these authorities have the highest level of security and service possible. Regula can empower the digital identity transformations and help the Canadian and global economy in a mission to protect and serve citizens.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>The heart of digital identity and trust services is community. Being a leader, it’s vital for Canada to give the community the confidence to flourish and grow.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>Having the best ID verification technology on the market and being compliant with data processing regulations is something that we take as a must and therefore, Regula joined DIACC to assist in delivering secure, remote, frictionless ID verification services for users across industries.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Regula Face SDK delivers secure (fully on-premises), frictionless online biometric verification regardless of the device used. Face matching allows you to compare a face biometric scan (selfie) with the photo on the ID or even a photo from the RFID (if combined with Document Reader SDK). Moreover, a liveness check becomes another security check available for the user. Such an easy step for a legitimate customer helps assure that the person holding the ID is the one on it as well as help confirm genuine presence.</p>



<p>Integration happens like plug and play. Together with that you get the solution that is compliant with the regulations, runs on all devices and platforms as well as reduces operational costs. Face SDK can be used in a variety of industries for different use cases including automated check-in in air travel, or onboarding in fintech. Regardless of the industry or use case software runs on the end-user device delivering the highest level of security.</p>

<p>This summer, we’ve been iterating through an article intended to talk
about the success that Blockchain Commons has had working with the Wyoming
legislature to help to define a first-in-the-country legal definition
of digital identity.</p>

<p>The Digital Identity Working Group for the Wyoming Select Committee on
Blockchain meets again next week, on September 21-22, 2021. I will be
providing testimony there at 2pm MST. As a result, we’ve decided to
release the current draft of this article on digital identity and how
Wyoming has defined it using Principal Authority, with the goal of
helping to shape the agenda for digital identity for the next year,
both in Wyoming and elsewhere.</p>

<p>—Christopher Allen</p>

 

<p>In 2016, I wrote <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">“The Path to Self-Sovereign
Identity”</a>
to talk about the historic evolution from centralized identity to
user-centric identity and to define the next step: a self-sovereign
digital identity that was controlled by the user, not some third party.
In it I also offered <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md">10 Self-Sovereign Identity
Principles</a>
which have been widely accepted by the decentralized identity community.</p>

<p>Self-sovereign identity has matured and grown considerably since, as I
chronicled in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-five-years-on">“Self-Sovereign Identity: Five Years
On”</a>.
There are now specifications, products, and entire companies supporting
the concept. However, recent legal efforts to define self-sovereign
identity may be just as important for catapulting it into the mass
market.</p>

 Defining Identity 

<p>Defining identity is by no means easy. That core topic could encompass a
paper much longer than this. The following are some various definitions
of identity drawn from the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot10-buenosaires/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/glossary-primer.md">RWOT
Glossary</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Identifier: A label that refers to an entity and can be used to establish or maintain an identity. For example, a name or UID.</p>

  <p>Identity: A conceptual construct that enables the differentiation between distinct entities that are individually considered to be unique, but which may possess class or group characteristics. An identity gives these entities the ability to interact as peers in collaborative or competitive ways. It is not the entity that it represents.</p>

  <p>Identity, Digital: A digital representation of an entity, managed by digital tools, over which that entity has personal or delegated control.</p>

  <p>Identity, Functional: How we recognize, remember and respond to specific people and things.</p>

  <p>SSI: Self-sovereign identity. A decentralized digital identity that does not depend on any centralized authority and whose information is portable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Digital identity is just one aspect of a complex, interconnected web of
different digital models. It’s not the same thing as identification
(where you prove you are a distinct entity with unique characteristics),
authentication (where you prove you were the same entity as before), or
personal data (which is information related to an identified or
identifiable entity).</p>

<p>Those other elements all need to be considered, but it’s digital
identity, and now self-sovereign identity, that gives us the linchpin to
do so.</p>

 Turning Digital Identity into Law 

<p>For self-sovereign identity to truly achieve international success, I
feel that it needs to not just be embraced by the technological sector,
but also to have a basis in law. In recent years, I’ve been progressing
toward that goal through work with various state and national
legislatures.</p>

<p>Collaborating with the Wyoming legislature has borne the first fruit.
This year they passed
<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">SF0039</a> on digital
identity, which the Governor signed into law and which went into effect
on July 1, 2021. It defines digital identity as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(xviii) “Personal digital identity” means the intangible digital
representation of, by and for a natural person, over which he has
principal authority and through which he intentionally communicates or
acts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So where’s the self-sovereign identity in that?</p>

<p>As with much legislation, it’s all about the careful selection of words.</p>

 Defining Principal Authority 

<p>To understand how Principal Authority relates to self-sovereign identity
requires insight into what Principal Authority is. The concept comes out
of English Common law. It appears in most Commonwealth countries but has
also found its way into the laws of other countries, including the
United States. It’s primarily used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency">Laws of
Agency</a>, an area of
commercial law where an agent is empowered to take on certain tasks.</p>

<p>As the name would suggest, Principal Authority first requires a
Principal: a person or entity. It then requires that entity have
Authority: some power. Principal Authority is thus the power derived
from a person or entity, which they can use or which they can delegate
out to others. When applied to digital identity, Principal Authority
says that a Principal has Authority over his identity — which is a clear
restatement of self-sovereign principles.</p>

<p>In fact, the recognition of a Principal is itself a statement of the
first of the principles of self-sovereign identity: existence. It
asserts that digital identity is always a representation of an actual
entity, who predates any digital representation, and who is also the
first and foremost beneficiary of that representation.</p>

<p>However, in drawing on the Laws of Agency, the concepts of Principal and
Principal Authority go beyond that. Because the person at the heart of
an identity has the ultimate power to control the self-sovereign digital
representation that they’ve created (and/or that they use), this means
that any others who exert Principal Authority over that identity data
are doing so only as agents of the Principal.</p>

<p>By focusing on Agency, the concept of Principal Authority also ensures
that the Principal always has the ability to revoke their delegation to
the agents whom they have temporarily offered Authority regarding their
identity. This is a requirement for other self-sovereign principles such
as portability, and it’s a real necessity in the digital world, where
we might need to delete personal data or to cancel Terms &amp; Conditions
that we signed without real, informed consent.</p>

<p>Altogether, this new definition of Principal Authority adds a lot of
nuance to self-sovereign identity, and much of that comes thanks to the
implicit incorporation of Agency.</p>

 Defining Control 

<p>In saying that a Principal has the ultimate authority to control their
digital identity, care also needs to be taken to define what that
control means. It means that a Principal has (or can delegate) the
Principal Authority to identify as that identity; to authenticate as
that identity; and to know the contents of the data held by that
identity.</p>

<p>However, any digital identity also exists as part of a larger ecosystem,
and the Principal does not have control over the larger ecosystem. They
cannot control how other entities rate, rank, or note the reputation
of their identity; and they cannot control comments, flags, or other
notes that other entities might attach to their identity.</p>

<p>Further, a Principal cannot necessarily prevent other entities from
creating new digital identities related to them, which may or may not
link to an existing identity. (Though states are increasingly
recognizing the limits of voluntary disclosure of information, digital
identity laws will ultimately never prevent a police station from
creating their own identity record related to a criminal, or a civic
authority from creating government-related identity records.)</p>

<p>In other words, self-sovereign identity, and the establishment of
Principal Authority over it, lays down boundaries for what the Principal
controls — boundaries that are much wider than those established for
digital identities controlled by third parties. However, those
boundaries still exist.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, control of a digital identity means that the Principal
can expect to maintain the continuity of that identity for as long as
they see fit, but in doing so must accept the battle scars inflicted by
interactions in a larger ecosystem that are implicit to the identity
itself.</p>

 Agents &amp; Their Duty 

<p>The ability to delegate Principal Authority, as revealed by the Laws of
Agency, may be as crucial to self-sovereign identity as the concept of a
Principal itself. It allows the empowerment of agents by a Principal —
who might be physical agents or, in the increasingly digital world,
virtual agents. But, it also institutes the core requirement that those
agents be working for the good of the Principal when they are exerting
Principal Authority over the identity holder’s identity data.</p>

<p>This concept of “duty” is crucial to the Laws of Agency. Duty requires
that an Agent only use their delegated Principal Authority as the
Principal requests, in a way that benefits the Principal, and with care
and due diligence, while frequently reporting back what they’ve done.</p>

<p>This is a notable change from the way that digital identities have been
treated traditionally. Compare that to banks, who represent you in
financial transactions, and then sell your spending data; compare that
to Facebook, who collects as much personally identifiable data and other
information as you’re willing to give them, then sells that to
advertisers; or compare it to Google, who infers personally identifiable
and demographic data based on the information you input into their tools
and the choices you make. In large part, you don’t even know what these
identity representatives and data holders are doing. In the world before
<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">Europe’s GDPR</a> or <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California’s
CCPA</a>, you had little input into their
actions. Even now, with those early and rough attempts to protect
digital self-sovereignty, you’re typically opting-out, not opting-in —
which is barely agency at all —&nbsp;and you’re still not protected against
people who are self-serving nor those who are inferring information from
scattered pieces of data.</p>

<p>That’s because any duties currently required of the entities to whom you
grant agency over your data are quite minimal. Maybe there’s a duty of
privacy, maybe there’s a duty of safety, but in general they don’t need
to work in your best interest. That’s why we need to ensure that new
definitions of digital identity, particularly self-sovereign identity,
follow the Laws of Agency in ways that our current systems do not.</p>

<p>This sort of agent agreement needs to be part of delegation. To date,
this has been true to a limited extent with federation protocols such as
SAML and Oauth, but that needs to be extended to every person. Wyoming’s
digital-identity law is the first example of legislation that focuses on
Agency in this way, and that’s much of its power.</p>

<p>However, this isn’t a simple issue. Even with Agency-focused
legislation, we need to determine a source for duties. This article will
try to outline some of them, using not just the traditional duties of
agents, but also the self-sovereign principles themselves. However, it’s
a mere starting point, with a stronger legal foundation required.</p>

 Principal Authority &amp; The State 

<p>Before defining duties, it’s important to note one other interesting
element of Principal Authority and its foundation in Agency: it focuses
not just on a single person’s authority, but also on their ability to
delegate to and require duties from other entities. In other words, it’s
a peer-to-peer relationship; this relationship works within the context
of a state who recognizes the concept of Principal Authority, respects
its ability to enable Agency, and enforces its established duties.</p>

<p>However, though the state is involved, this peer-to-peer relationship
still lies in stark contrast to traditional property law, where property
is always in some way beholden to the state: the state might be the
original source for property, they might be able to reclaim it by
eminent domain, and they might be able to seize it through asset
forfeiture. Those ideas all run counter to the idea of self-sovereignty
— which is yet another reason that we choose to focus on the Agency of
Principal Authority, not property law, as the core legal metaphor for
self-sovereign identity.</p>

 Restating the Self-Sovereign Principles 

<p>The use of Principal Authority to empower self-sovereign identity
provides a legal foothold for many of my original 10 principles.</p>

<p>What follows is a restatement of the self-sovereign principles that
reorganizes the original ten as rights and duties that are suggested by
customs, expectations, and best practices, but which need to be better
codified to become true duties. It also proposes five additional duties
that could come from customs implicit in the Laws of Agency.</p>

<p>Together, these ideas may allow us to both better understand how to turn
the self-sovereign principles into concrete usage and also to more
easily translate them into duties bound by legislation.</p>

 The Rights of Self-Sovereign Authority 

<p>Some principles of self-sovereign identity are implicit in the idea of
a Principal.</p>

 
   Existence. The definition of Principal requires that there be a real entity at an identity’s heart. 
   Control. The definition of Principal Authority says that the Principal always retains control of an identity, within specifically defined boundaries, no matter who is holding it at a particular time. 
   Persistence. Because of their uncontested Principal Authority, a Principal may decide to have an identity last for as long as they see fit. 
   Consent. Anything that happens within the defined boundaries of the digital identity is implicitly with the consent of the Principal, who may delegate or revoke Principal Authority at any time. 
 

<p>Self-sovereign rights recognize that an identity exists to benefit its
Principal. These core principles likely derive explicitly from a
definition of digital identity such as that created by the Wyoming
legislature.</p>

 The Duties of Self-Sovereign Identity 

<p>The remaining principles of self-sovereign identity can be stated as
duties owed to a Principal by an agent who has been granted Principal
Authority over an identity for certain purposes.</p>

 
   Access. An agent must provide the Principal with access to data related to their digital identity. 
   Transparency. An agent must be open about how they will administer a digital identity. 
   Portability. An agent must make a digital identity portable upon the request of the Principal. 
   Interoperability. An agent must use standard, interoperable protocols when making an identity portable, and should also use those interoperable protocols when interacting with other identity systems. 
   Minimization. An agent must minimize the data collected, stored, transmitted, and shared regarding an identity so that it only includes data that is strictly necessary in the context of a request made by the Principal. 
   Protection. An agent must place the protection of the identity above their own needs or desires. 
 

<p>Identity duties says that agents will tell you how they’re using your
identity, use it in the most minimalist way possible, and make it easy
for you to reclaim the identity. However, legislation may be required to
turn these best practices into duties bound by law.</p>

 The Duties of Self-Sovereign Agents 

<p>The idea of Principal Authority itself suggests additional duties that
were not included on the original list of principles of self-sovereign
identity, but which are generally defined in the Laws of Agency to be
due from agents to Principals.</p>

 
   Specificity. An Agent will use Principal Authority to serve specific tasks as instructed by the Principal, or as required by Custom, and do nothing more with an identity. 
   Responsibility. An agent will serve those tasks with reasonable care and skill, with due diligence, and without further delegation. 
   Representation. An agent will act in the best interests of the Principal, without secret profit, and will not take on other responsibilities that might conflict with that. 
   Fidelity. An agent will serve those tasks in good faith. 
   Disclosure. An agent will maintain accounts and report their actions back to the Principal. 
 

<p>Agent duties say that agents will be trustworthy in their use of your
identity. These duties are more likely to implicitly be a part of any
legislation that was built atop the Laws of Agency.</p>

 Taking the Next Steps 

<p>Wyoming’s definition of personal digital identity helps us to lay more
foundation for self-sovereign identity, but it’s still just a starting
point.</p>

<p>There’s more to do.</p>

 Laws of Custom 

<p>To start with, the Laws of Agency are largely built on Laws of Custom,
which are as likely to be common law as any formally codified
legislation. When creating new laws related to self-sovereign identity,
we’ll be creating new Laws of Customs for the digital frontier, an area
that’s so fresh that the tradition of customs has been limited.</p>

<p>This creates real challenges, as we must decide what customs we want to
create and then we must develop them from common law to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_law">legal
customs</a> to (eventually)
codified duties. We can integrate these with the Laws of Agency, and we
can figure out how that interrelates with old common laws such as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_(law)">Use Laws</a>. We may even need
special courts to set these common laws and achieve remedies, such as
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Chancery">Court of
Chancery</a>.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, there’s a lot of work to be done here; recognizing the
existence of a Principal and the use of delegatable Principal Authority
bound by the Laws of Agency is just a starting place. New customs, even
though understood as best practices, will not automatically become legal
duties.</p>

 Open Questions 

<p>Beyond that, I’m not a lawyer. There may be other legal elements that
can support our definition of digital identity. Are there additional
duties that we could bring in? Are there fiduciary or agency laws that
we could leverage? Are there other legal models of interest we can draw
from, such as the UNCITRAL Model Law of Electronic Commerce approach,
which says that “The actions, promises, rights and obligations of a
person shall not be denied legal validity on the sole ground they are
effectuated through their digital identity”? These possibilities need to
be studied, preferably with the help of legal experts.</p>

<p>Even once we’ve fully defined digital identity, we still must consider
how digital identity may need to be more carefully protected. Are there
ways we can give specific protection to private keys used for signatures
and to express authority? Can we protect against the theft of private
keys that might allow impersonation or false witness? Can we prevent the
misuse of digital biometric or genetic information? Can we protect
against other “crimes of authority”?</p>

<p>There’s also a flipside: digital identity should give us some new
advantages not found in traditional identity. For example, there have
always been problems with individuals with low market power being at a
disadvantage when negotiating with larger parties. Can new digital
identity laws help start to resolve that imbalance?</p>

 Final Notes 

<p>One of the most important steps going forward will be to continue
working with the Digital Identity subcommittee in the Wyoming
legislature. However, I’d also welcome discussions with other states and
nations, to ensure that we have great definitions of digital identity
that support self-sovereign identity everywhere.</p>

<p>If this is important to you too, consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">supporting Blockchain
Commons</a> to make this a
reality.</p>

 

 Offering Some Thanks 

<p>This article was written by Christopher Allen with Shannon Appelcline.
Thanks to commentators who made time to talk to us about it, including
Joe Andrieu, Dazza Greenwood, and Clare Sullivan. (Our conclusions are
ours; they may or may not agree with them.)</p>

<p>Many thanks to Wyoming State Senator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Rothfuss">Chris
Rothfuss</a> who invited me
to join the Wyoming Digital Identity subcommittee and to the others
members of the Digital Identity subcommittee in the Wyoming legislature,
including Brittany Kaiser, Carla Reyes, Diedrich Henning, Scott David,
and once more Clare Sullivan and Dazza Greenwood. Thanks to their hard
work, Wyoming now offers the first definitions of personal digital
identity in the United States, laying the foundation for these
additional ideas.</p>

<p>Canadian leaders must prioritize and champion digital ID to unlock capabilities for social inclusion and economic recovery</p>



<p>TORONTO, Sept. 14, 2021 — More than 100 financial institutions, telcos, technology companies, consulting companies, SMEs, academic partners, international organizations, and nonprofits have declared they are digital ID champions in a campaign by the Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC), launched today. The DIACC calls on all political parties and private sector leaders to prioritize digital ID to unlock the digital economy as a critical path forward to pandemic recovery.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically accelerated the pace at which Canada is shifting online. Many things we used to do ‘in person’ — from grocery shopping to medical appointments — we now do without ever leaving our home. At the same time, a global army of hackers are working to exploit online security vulnerabilities to access sensitive personal information.</p>



<p>“Canadians need digital ID credentials that&nbsp; empower them to use digital capabilities, while knowing their personal information is respected and secured,” says DIACC president Joni Brennan. “Technology alone can’t solve today’s challenges. Digital ID that works for everyone must&nbsp; be a public policy priority. Canadians want their governments to work with stakeholders to unlock digital ID multi-use credentials that protect their personal privacy while accelerating economic recovery.”</p>



<p>Now more than ever Canada needs Digital ID Champions. Digital ID Champions:</p>



  Promote digital ID to accelerate economic recovery and secure equitable social inclusion.  Work with DIACC and others to establish privacy-protecting digital ID that empowers individuals, businesses, the public sector and civil society.  



<p>Digital ID has foundational importance for every Canadian and every political party.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Liberal Party platform’s proposed “digital policy task force” ” would strongly benefit from secure, privacy-respecting, and citizen empowering digital identity if it wants “to position Canada as a leader in the digital economy and shape global governance of emerging technologies, including with respect to data and privacy rights, taxation, online violent extremism, the ethical use of new technologies, and the future of work.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Conservative platform acknowledges the need for Canadians to understand how their data is being used. Digital ID provides a tool for making this possible. As the platform notes, “Digital data privacy is a fundamental right that urgently requires strengthened protection through legislation and enforcement. Canadians must have the right to understand and control the collection, use, monitoring, retention, and disclosure of their personal data.”</p>



<p>The NDP’s promise to include a digital bill of privacy rights in its platform will gain much needed utility from a citizen empowering digital ID ecosystem .&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Bloc’s platform commitment “to improve support for the digital transition of businesses to enable a local, inclusive, and secure economy,” is also important in both a local and global digital economy. Digital ID can help Quebec and other communities to enable business transformation while enabling capabilities to verify the authenticity of Quebec existing and emerging cultural IP.</p>



<p>For these commitments to be implemented effectively, a strong and secure digital ID ecosystem must urgently be established. Creating a digital identity ecosystem now, supported by a pan-Canadian Trust Framework, will enable an effective transition to secure Canada’s full and beneficial participation in the digital economy, whether it’s introducing digital vaccine proofs, receiving government benefits, updating an immigration status, entering the workforce and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital ID is the key to effective economic recovery that will grow social inclusion and equity,” says Brennan. “We urge all Canadian leaders to be champions for digital ID by working with the DIACC and others to ensure social inclusion and accelerate economic recovery through secure and privacy protecting digital ID that empowers individuals, businesses, the public sector and civil society.”</p>

<p>About DIACC</p>



<p>The DIACC (Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada) is a non-profit coalition of more than 110 leading public and private sector organizations that are&nbsp; committed to developing a Canadian framework for digital identification and authentication. Our member organizations range from small 1-5 person shops to large multinational corporations with over 15,000 employees. We advocate for an inclusive, equitable, and privacy-enhancing digital ID strategy that works for all Canadians.</p>

  How the HOPR network is using Ceramic to provide off-chain logging information to node runners, while keeping the data private.

<p>The HOPR protocol is a layer-0 privacy foundation for the new generation of decentralized applications. The incentivized HOPR mixnet lets any application send data without leaking data or metadata. HOPR nodes will rely on Ceramic to track node payments without sacrificing user privacy. <br><br>Interested in learning more about the privacy protocol? Visit <a href="https://hoprnet.org/">HOPRnet.org</a> to run a node yourself.</p> Encryption is not enough for privacy  <p>Standard end-to-end encryption does not provide sufficient privacy, because it still leaks important metadata, such as who is exchanging data, when, and how often. Given enough metadata, global adversaries and private companies can identify your behavior across multiple applications, even when the content of the traffic you exchange remains encrypted. Services like VPNs can hide your information from your internet service provider (ISP) but can’t protect you from the general fingerprinting of your browser, mobile devices and websites visits on a daily basis. Over time, this online behavior creates a profile that can be traced.</p><p>HOPR addresses this challenge by ensuring all the data and metadata you produce and consume online stays private. To do this, HOPR feeds content through a state-of-the-art mixnet - the HOPR network. </p> The HOPR protocol <p>HOPR incentivizes node runners who relay packets using its own currency, the HOPR token. Messages routed through the network are embedded with HOPR tokens in the form of “tickets” to pay each node along the route. HOPR’s proof of relay mechanism ensures a node can’t claim a ticket until the data packet is relayed to the next downstream node. This creates positive incentives for nodes to be good actors in the network. Tickets are cashed out via an Ethereum compatible blockchain (EVM) but are not always valid. This probabilistic payment system ensures a node’s online behavior can not be analyzed using timing attacks.</p><p>To ensure privacy at any level of network usage, the HOPR network is constantly fed with cover traffic: arbitrary data which provides cover for real users. This is particularly important in the early years of the network, when usage will understandably be lower.</p><p>The HOPR Association has allocated 250M HOPR tokens to cover traffic, to be released over four years. These will be issued anonymously by nodes sponsored by the HOPR Association and routed through nodes based on multiple parameters including HOPR tokens staked, amount of channels open, and general connectivity.</p> Verify off-chain activity without compromising privacy <p>This incentivized cover traffic system, combined with proof of relay, is what sets HOPR apart from other privacy networks, which either lack the proper incentives to scale or end up compromising on privacy or decentralization. Privacy networks are very challenging to develop and then test - how can you monitor and verify node activity without sacrificing privacy? <br><br>This is particularly important for the development of cover traffic and the long-term economic balancing of the network. Since running HOPR nodes incurs electricity and internet bandwidth costs, it’s important to be able to distinguish between the kickstarter cover traffic (artificially high for the first four years) and real traffic (initially minimal, but growing as the network scales). <br><br>Tickets issued by cover traffic can be tagged as such and shared off-chain. This would allow analysis but prevent inspection by other nodes. The HOPR team needed a reliable way to implement this approach, since simply logging this information in a decentralized IPFS node, which anyone can add data, would allow &nbsp;information about cover traffic metrics to be skewed or manipulated by any party in the network.</p> Using Ceramic to create a decentralized monitoring tool for HOPR nodes <p>Using Ceramic, HOPR can propagate user-specific data and allow node runners to inspect and share their node's information as needed. To do this, nodes create a log entry in a Ceramic Stream, a DAG-based data structure for storing continuous, mutable streams of content on IPFS, every time they receive a particular message (for example, one with the cover traffic tag). Since this information is published with the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1">secp256k1</a> private key used by the HOPR nodes, this information can be connected to a HOPR node and verified as such. This prevents outside manipulation of data.</p><p>HOPR node runners can use the HOPR dashboard to see their node data, and by checking the Ceramic Streams pinned by their nodes, obtain meaningful information about the cover traffic sent to their nodes. In this way, Ceramic not only helps HOPR developers, but also allows users themselves to verify the state of the network without involuntarily compromising their privacy.</p><p>Previous iterations of HOPR testnets issued unverifiable cover traffic via a bot, which was cumbersome and of limited utility. Thanks to Ceramic, HOPR nodes can now easily compare notes and assess their own ability to connect to other nodes.</p><p>The HOPR Network is the first of its kind using Ceramic to log decentralized data for an open-source protocol, and we believe this approach can be used by any project which relies on peer-to-peer off-chain data, which would otherwise be unverifiable.</p> Using IDX to connect HOPR nodes to external accounts <p>Since HOPR nodes have their own private keys, which need to quickly sign and submit transactions on-chain, each node has a unique private identity. This is extremely important for privacy, but it also makes engaging with a community of node runners challenging. As a result, it wasn't trivial for the HOPR team to link HOPR node runners to another digital identity, enrich node runner data, or perform promotional actions linked to their <a href="https://stake.hoprnet.org/">staking program</a>, which would be trivial in a centralized (but not private) setting. This is where Ceramic provides a lot more flexibility.</p><p>The identities of HOPR node runners are private, but they don’t have to be anonymous. It’s possible to connect node runners with another digital identity, as long as that connection is verifiable.<br><br>The HOPR team has already started using Ceramic’s identity protocol, IDX, for this use case in a recent testnet on the Polygon network. HOPR nodes leverage IDX to connect to external Ethereum accounts outside of the HOPR network. With IDX, HOPR nodes now have the ability to sign an Ethereum account, enabling users to connect their nodes with an existing pseudonymous digital identity - real or not.</p> What's next for HOPR? <p>In the coming weeks, the HOPR team will start to test our cover traffic nodes, which will become the cornerstone for the HOPR network. The HOPR Association will continue to run testnets with the community to finetune the HOPR protocol. From there, node adoption and development of the protocol will continue alongside the community. The HOPR team will continue to use Ceramic to strike the right balance between data gathering and privacy.</p><p>We’re excited about what’s next to come for the HOPR team and the impact they'll have on data privacy.

 Protocol Labs and Energy Web complete first showcase of an open-source solution to decarbonize Filecoin <p>In support of the <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Crypto Climate Accord (CCA)</a>, <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web</a> today announced a successful showcase of an open-source solution for decentralized renewable energy purchasing by crypto miners. In this solution showcase, six Filecoin storage providers (i.e., miners) purchased verified renewable energy from <a href="https://3degreesinc.com/">3Degrees</a> using <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero</a>, a public renewable energy search engine. (PL and 3D are both CCA Supporters.) The solution will eventually be applicable across any blockchain to make it easy for any crypto miner to deliver proof of green&nbsp;mining.</p><p>The CCA is a private sector led initiative to decarbonize the crypto sector with open-source decentralized solutions and promote best industry practices. Energy Web is a co-convener of the CCA and both Protocol Labs and 3Degrees are CCA Supporters.</p><p>In the showcase announced today, renewable energy purchases are <a href="https://filrep.io/?columns=energy&amp;order=desc&amp;sortBy=energy">recorded in Filrep</a>, a reputation system used by clients aiming to store data on the decentralized Filecoin network. Integrating renewable energy data from Energy Web Zero into the reputation system allows clients to factor renewables into their decision when choosing a storage provider. Each record on Filrep points to a <a href="https://zero.energyweb.org/partners/filecoin/purchases/c8ffa1c8-c763-44c1-bb4d-b370c15694b3">verification page</a> in Energy Web Zero, showing where the energy was produced, documenting the renewable source, and providing an attestation certificate proving ownership of the corresponding renewable energy&nbsp;credits.</p><p>Over the next year, Protocol Labs and Energy Web will create a package of open-source solutions that make it easy for all Filecoin storage providers to search for and purchase renewable energy on Energy Web Zero. Both Filecoin storage providers and clients will be able to verify procurement to substantiate their environmental claims because transactions will be anchored on the public Energy Web Chain, and in turn be traceable to existing renewable energy registries as well as individual solar, wind and hydroelectric power projects.</p><blockquote>“We are excited to develop open-source decentralized technologies to support investments in renewable energy and track energy use throughout the supply chain,” said Alan Ransil, the technical lead for Filecoin Green at Protocol Labs. “By serving as an early adopter of these technologies, the decentralized network of Filecoin storage providers will set an example for both crypto miners and other industries to&nbsp;follow.”</blockquote><p>Filecoin is an open-source cloud storage marketplace, protocol, and cryptocurrency that serves as a decentralized alternative to traditional cloud storage. Traditional cloud storage providers like Apple, Amazon, Google, and others have been moving aggressively with renewables. Now, decentralized storage and blockchain, too.</p><p>Many members of the Filecoin Storage Provider community voiced support for the new&nbsp;project:</p>  “The dream of a decentralized storage network powered by renewable energy has been a motivating force behind the company since our first prototype,” said Kevin Huynh, the CEO of PiKNiK, a San Diego, California-based storage provider. “We believe it is imperative for the future of Web3 to grow our industry in a way that protects nature, while setting a sky-high standard for transparency as to our environmental footprint and renewable energy sourcing.”  “I was deeply impressed by The Paris Agreement and Kyoto Protocol, which established the need to act quickly to support the environment,” said Alex Ma, a Filecoin storage provider based in Asia. “In my view, linking Filecoin to Energy Web Zero brings the community closer to a sustainable data storage solution.”  “I’m happy to do my part in making Filecoin more environmentally clean and sustainable,” said Nelson Chen, “this approach allowed me to support renewable energy and prove my contribution easily, without having to change my power provider or install new equipment.”  Stuart Berman, who serves as CTO, also at PiKNiK, said that “We started participating in Filecoin because we believe in the long-term vision. This proof of concept connecting Filecoin to renewable energy markets is a major first step towards solving the challenge of environmental sustainability within Filecoin and Crypto more broadly.”  Alex Altman, the COO of Seal Storage Technology Inc. said: “As we enter a new age of corporate environmental responsibility, Seal Storage Technology is delivering on its commitment of carbon neutrality with the ambitious goal of achieving carbon negativity in 2022. Filecoin already empowers Seal to offer decentralized cloud storage using significantly less energy than other blockchain-based networks, and the integration with Energy Web will allow our renewable energy use to be tracked and verified”  <p>The full cross-chain solution to be deployed in mid-2022 will create a unique decentralized identifier (DID) on the Energy Web Chain for each Filecoin storage provider who chooses to participate and link storage providers’ renewable energy purchases to their respective DIDs. This linking of a given Filecoin storage provider’s DID with verified green Filecoin mining will enable that storage provider to reflect their zero carbon status in the Filecoin Reputation System, and allow energy attributes to be traced from client to storage provider to individual renewable energy projects.</p><p>This cross-chain solution being developed can be extended to miners in other ecosystems because the underlying technical architecture will leverage the verifiable, interoperable hash links that are the basis of Web3 technologies such as <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> and all blockchains. The project will therefore support the development of verifiably renewable crypto mining projects such as <a href="https://cryptoclimacc.medium.com/open-source-green-hashrate-software-solution-will-track-and-verify-green-bitcoin-mining-6b4e9cabe8b">Green Hashrate</a>.</p><p>Protocol Labs and Energy Web will share progress updates over the months ahead in advance of releasing commercial ready open-source solutions.</p><p>— — —</p><p>About Protocol&nbsp;Labs</p><p>Protocol Labs is an open-source research, development, and deployment laboratory.

<p>A New Way For Open Source and Open Standards To Collaborate</p> 


<p>I recently pointed out in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/a-revival-at-the-intersection-of-open-source-and-open-standards/">TechCrunch contribution</a> that the open source and open standards communities need to find ways to team up if they are to continue driving innovation and&nbsp; development of transformative technologies to push our society forward.</p>



<p>The challenge I posed to organizations like ours, OASIS Open, and others in the open source and standards ecosystems was to find ways to collaborate and encourage our stakeholders to do the same. My opportunity to “walk the talk” arrived immediately.</p>



<p>A Case in Point</p>



<p>The <a href="https://entethalliance.org/">Enterprise Ethereum Alliance</a> (EEA), with whom OASIS Open has had a long and productive relationship, came to us and described a need. EEA has years of experience as a forum for building standards for enterprise-ready, interoperable blockchain implementations.&nbsp; However, to promote broader community participation in the Ethereum ecosystem, EEA also wanted to offer the wider Ethereum community the ability to start open source projects and to do so in a proven setting that provides solid support for governance, standards, reference implementations and a path to cooperation with international high-level standardization as well. </p>



<p>And that’s the expertise of OASIS Open. So we joined forces and <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2021/06/29/eea-and-oasis-join-forces-to-provide-nexus-for-open-source-development-of-ethereum-standards/">announced EEA Community Projects</a>. The work is led by EEA, managed under the OASIS Open Projects process, and driven by the community at large. We’re describing this partnership as a “<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/managed-open-projects/">Managed Open Project</a>,” and we think this approach may be useful for other modern, agile development projects hosted with consortiums as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional OASIS Open Projects provide the pathway for open source projects to attract broad buy-in and become recognized international open standards as well. Of course, any developer can always build their own Git repo and open it to pull requests. But a stable, trustable project often requires more than that. Stakeholders want to know that their contributions or feature requests will be noted. Contributors want to know that their joint work will be run fairly. Commercial, open source, and government users (and international standards bodies) want to know that a project is properly licensed, vendor-neutral, and will remain available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The critical components needed for those goals are a tested process, expert facilitators with a light touch, and well-documented provenance. These elements are required by global treaties and many national practices to assure standards quality; they also happen to create the best, fairest open technologies. That’s precisely what OASIS Open offers with its well-known, verified, and accredited development governance process. And that’s why works produced here are widely accepted as open and reliable by so many industries and governments. </p>



<p>Our technical committees have co-developed their standards with open source reference implementations and proofs of concept for over 20 years. By creating our Open Projects program we encouraged future projects to operate on a “FOSS-first” basis, adding open source license defaults to our other routine process protections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open Projects have also been the preferred approach elected for most of our newest projects.&nbsp; But until recently, those were solely OASIS operations.&nbsp; So, what’s the difference between those and a ‘Managed Open Project?’</p>



<p>The Value-Add of Managed Open Projects</p>



<p>The primary difference is in branding, but it’s also more than that. OASIS has long enjoyed the reputation as our industry’s leader in sharing our work. We’ve been co-approving outputs with international standards bodies like ISO, ITU, IEC, and others since 2004; our strategy has always been radical transparency, the opposite of “not invented here.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let’s say, you participate in or support a software technology ecosystem. You might have member-focused and proprietary work, or community-based and open source efforts, or both. Either way, you rely on your active collaborators. If those contributors recognize the value of being well governed and having the opportunity for broader approval and certification, they will look for some of the qualities described above: support for open source code implementations, stability of releases and versions, open public process, eligibility for certifications, and assurances that support broad global acceptance. It takes a lot to build that, and most projects don’t readily have access to the skill sets in-house to shepherd a project to that kind of success.&nbsp; So you are faced with a build versus buy decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some huge foundations, or one-off smaller projects, may opt to build their own capabilities and seek certifications—or just decide to do without them. But for everyone else in the non-profit sector, outsourcing the process and development platforms may make a lot of sense. EEA essentially decided, after due diligence and some negotiated ground rules, to outsource their need for an open source and open standards development platform to us. They absolutely could have built their own native capacity for Ethereum enterprise-facing open source work. But the immediate up-front costs of time and personnel, and the longer-lead-time issues of seeking independent accreditation, made it worth it for EEA to combine forces with OASIS Open.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The deliverables created in that joint program will still be EEA works, branded from the EEA community and whoever else may choose to contribute to their open source projects, but administered by our team and supported by our processes and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through OASIS Open’s <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/managed-open-projects/">Managed Open Projects</a> program, other existing and new development organizations or consortiums can also add these self-branded capabilities to their existing hosted activities. They also will be eligible, at their option, to submit for international standards approval, without having to build from scratch all those resources, relationships and critical processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Managed Open Project approach is readily adaptable to any open source code, API, transaction or data structure in all industries. This includes blockchain, such as with EEA, but also can comprise a larger, open-source-powered tent for collaboration in real estate, petroleum, healthcare or any other industry with shared data and open standards needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Dream Come True</p>



<p>The reason that I came to OASIS Open is because I saw in this organization an ability and a desire to share and collaborate with other organizations, and the OASIS Open team is passionate about doing what’s best for the community. Now, after almost two years here, I’m more convinced than ever that we’ve got the expertise and contributor base of experts to make it happen; we’re nimble enough to be effective change catalysts; and, most importantly, we are doing the work. I couldn’t be more excited about this new Managed Open Project approach and how it is fulfilling the vision of harmonizing open source and open standards communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Managed Open Projects program specifically, and most cooperation and sharing of work across organizational boundaries generally, allow development projects to leverage broad community input while embracing contributions, feature requests, and bug fixes from a much larger potential group of stakeholders. Doing so in a transparent and open fashion and, increasingly, with widely-understood open source tools has been a great benefit to our own projects. </p>



<p>OASIS Open encourages all projects—of any size and housed anywhere—to look for cooperation and sharing opportunities across industries, consortia and open source foundations. It is a strategy that has served us very well since our own launch at the dawn of the internet in 1993.</p>



<p>If you share this vision and have a project or consortium that wants a reliable path to open source development, broader cooperation, or de jure standards, I hope you will <a href="mailto:join@oasis-open.org">reach out to us.</a> Together we can make it happen.</p>

<p>The specification for representing legal norms and rules is now an OASIS Standard. </p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the publication of its newest OASIS Standard, approved by the members on 30 August 2021:</p>



<p>LegalRuleML Core Specification Version 1.0<br>OASIS Standard<br>30 August 2021</p>



<p>Legal texts, e.g. legislation, regulations, contracts, and case law, are the source of norms, guidelines, and rules that govern societies. As text, it is difficult to label, exchange, and process content except by hand. In our current web-enabled world, where innovative e-government and e-commerce are increasingly the norm, providing machine-processable forms of legal content is crucial.</p>



<p>The objective of the LegalRuleML Core Specification Version 1.0 is to define a standard (expressed with XML-schema and Relax NG and on the basis of Consumer RuleML 1.02) that is able to represent the particularities of the legal normative rules with a rich, articulated, and meaningful mark-up language.</p>



<p>LegalRuleML models:</p>



  defeasibility of rules and defeasible logic;  deontic operators (e.g., obligations, permissions, prohibitions, rights);  semantic management of negation;  temporal management of rules and temporality in rules;  classification of norms (i.e., constitutive, prescriptive);  jurisdiction of norms;  isomorphism between rules and natural language normative provisions;  identification of parts of the norms (e.g. bearer, conditions);  authorial tracking of rules.  



<p>The project received 4 Statements of Use from Livio Robaldo, Swansea University, CSIRO Data61, and CirSFID-AlmaAI.</p>

Read the first post in this series, “An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and Economy”&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">here</a>.</p><p>By Audrey Stienon, Associate, Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>Labor Day represents an important moment to commemorate the essential contributions of working people to our&nbsp;country.</p><p>The holiday was created at the height of the Gilded Age, a time when the American economy was booming, the likes of John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and J.P. Morgan were making their fortune, and most people toiled in exhausting, unsafe jobs for paltry wages. Working people, including children as young as five, labored in 12-hour shifts, seven days a week — and still were not paid enough to escape poverty. Individuals had little power to change the status quo, but when they banded together in labor unions, they were able to effectively demand better pay, hours, and working conditions from their employers.</p><p>This shift in power didn’t happen quietly or easily. The wealthy few who profited by exploiting labor wielded their money and political connections to mobilize private security forces, police, and the judicial system against working people. In turn, the labor movement used all the tools at its disposal — from strikes and boycotts to protests and marches — to fight for change, even in the face of violence. In 1894, after twelve working people were killed during the Pullman railroad strike, President Cleveland tried to repair the government’s frayed ties with working Americans by declaring the first Monday in September “Labor Day,” a holiday commemorating the essential contributions of working people to our&nbsp;country.</p><p>A new holiday, of course, did not suddenly balance power between working people and their employers. Today, working people — along with the labor unions, grassroots movements, small business associations, and community organizations that represent them — continue to engage in many of the same battles for equal power that they fought more than a century&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Equal power means freedom of choice for working people. That freedom is what makes possible the American Dream, with its promise that everyone should have the equal right to build the life they desire by participating in the economy in whichever way they choose — through hard work, risk-taking, innovation, or entrepreneurship.</p><p>Like democracies, capitalist markets — especially those intended to support democratic societies — work best when participants enjoy a high degree of equality in decision-making power. Ideal markets, after all, depend on individuals’ ability to buy what they choose as well as to walk away from any exchange that does not satisfy them — something true for people entering a store just as much as it is for people assessing how they want to spend their time and&nbsp;labor.</p><p>But whereas democratic power is shared through the vote, markets’ power often comes from money. Any capitalist system intended to support a democratic society depends on checks and balances that prevent any one group from writing rules that benefit themselves at the expense of everyone else. A society in which this power of choice is not balanced — in which the rules of the economy leave working people with no choice but to accept jobs that leave them in poverty, and with no way to achieve meaningful change — cannot be truly democratic.</p><p>We know American capitalism has routinely failed to live up to this ideal. The two-pronged restriction on voting access and market participation by race, gender, disability, and class ensured that whole swaths of our society were (and in many cases, continue to be) robbed of both the political power to write economic rules that protect their interests and the economic power to gain enough resources to live with dignity. And yet, by learning from the combined struggles of the labor movement, civil rights movement, and alliances between them, we know that it is possible to build an economy truer to our democratic values.</p><p>We are currently experiencing two crises simultaneously: both American democracy and capitalism are in critical condition owing to the increasingly unequal concentration of political and economic power throughout our&nbsp;society.</p><p>Of the <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-grounding-our-economy-in-a-new-ideas-and-values-99596c8dabe8">many failed ideas US policymakers have implemented in recent decades</a>, one of the most dangerous has been to systematically erode the checks and balances within both government and markets. Lax regulations have made markets less competitive, allowing corporate behemoths to block the entry of new competitors, robbing consumers of the freedom to buy alternatives to products they do not like — including digital products that require them to give up personal data — and depriving working people of the ability to find better jobs. Right to work laws and anti-union employers have produced a steady decline in the wages paid by industries that used to be pillars of the middle class. Our political system has been corrupted by private money that fuels election campaigns and lobbying efforts, giving the wealthiest in our society an unparalleled ability to influence the policymaking process and ensure that the rules continue to work to their advantage.</p><p>All of this means that, even as most of us recognize the socio-economic status quo is harming many Americans, we lack the power to enact the change necessary to bring it more in&nbsp;balance.</p><p>We at Omidyar Network believe that if we want our democracy to survive, we need a new form of capitalism that promotes and protects balanced power. As in our democracy, we need checks on those with the most power to make sure they cannot rig the rules to their benefit, and we need to build <a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/testimony-by-heather-boushey-before-the-joint-economic-committee-on-the-coronavirus-recession/">counterweights to concentrated power</a> so that the people who suffer under unfair rules are certain to have their voices&nbsp;heard.</p><p>One of our priorities is to help build the power of working people so they can advocate for the wages, working conditions, and policies needed to thrive. That’s why we <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-network-endorses-pro-act-to-expand-worker-power/">endorsed the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of 2021</a>, which would expand people’s right to organize and engage in collective bargaining, ensuring their interests are well-represented when employers respond to economic shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future trends, such as automation.</p><p>In addition to the PRO Act at the federal level, many of the fights for worker power are taking place closer to the ground. As the pandemic increased people’s recognition of the importance of caregivers, hospital employees, and service workers — whose jobs typically pay low wages and provide little protection — we have supported the <a href="http://alwaysessentialworkers.com/partners/">National Essential Workers Campaign</a>, an initiative intended to coordinate state and local efforts fighting to give essential workers more voice and power, especially over health and safety. We have also supported the <a href="https://www.californiaworkerpower.org/">California Coalition for Worker Power</a>, a new coalition anchored by a number of partners dedicated to ensuring that every worker in the state has the power to come together and improve their work conditions and communities.</p><p>We also recognize that a rapidly changing economy requires new strategies and tools to help workers organize. We support <a href="https://uwunited.org/">Unemployed Workers United (UWU)</a> and their experimentation in the use of digital organizing tactics to engage people who have lost their jobs — especially in communities of color — in local grassroots campaigns. We also support an <a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/business-and-society-program/worker-voice-lab/">idea lab</a> at The Aspen Institute’s <a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/business-and-society-program/">Business in Society Program</a> to allow a number of stakeholders — including corporate governance experts, business leaders, and worker organizers — to explore solutions for increasing worker voice in corporate governance structures.</p><p>Working people, however, are not the only group that needs a greater say in the future of our economy. Alongside the Ford Foundation and W.K. Kellogg Foundation, we launched the <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-network-ford-foundation-w-k-kellogg-foundation-launch-carry-on-the-fight-fund/">Carry on the Fight Fund</a> to support grassroots organizations so they have support beyond Election Day to hold elected officials accountable to their campaign promises and build long-term power. We have also partnered with organizations such as <a href="https://mainstreetalliance.org/">Main Street Alliance</a>, which advocates for policies that support small business and helps small business leaders become their own advocates for policy change. We’re working with <a href="https://www.changethechamber.org/">Change the Chamber</a>, a student movement taking on the Chamber of Commerce through <a href="https://twitter.com/lobbyforclimatehttps:/twitter.com/lobbyforclimate">social media campaigns</a> and direct conversations with companies and policymakers in response to the Chamber’s continued lobbying efforts on behalf of fossil fuel interests to hinder essential climate change regulation.</p><p>We are also focused on ensuring economic policies do not concentrate wealth — and the power that comes with it — in the hands of a few individuals and corporations. To do so, we support groups such as <a href="https://bettermarkets.com/">Better Markets</a>, a watchdog organization that advocates on behalf of the public interest for a fairer financial sector and serves as a check on Wall Street’s immense lobbying power on financial regulatory matters. We are also working with several organizations pushing to reform the outsized impact large corporations currently have on the American political processes. Notably, the <a href="https://www.politicalaccountability.net/">Center for Political Accountability (CPA)</a> is working to increase accountability and transparency for companies’ political spending. They developed the <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CPA-Wharton-Zicklin-model-code-of-conduct-for-corporate-political-spending-10-13-20-.pdf">CPA-Wharton Zicklin Model Code of Conduct for Political Spending</a>, which is intended to guide companies on how to ethically engage in political activities and helped mobilize shareholders to win an unprecedented number of fights, resulting in requirements that companies disclose their political spending.</p><p>We recognize that many of these efforts have been guided by organizations that provide the research and ideas for how different stakeholders of the economy can work together toward a more equal distribution of economic power. The <a href="https://earn.us/">Economic Analysis and Research Network (EARN)</a>, for example, is a network of research, policy, and public engagement organizations that provide resources and technical assistance to local groups. Through their <a href="https://earn.us/issue/worker-power/">Worker Power Project,</a> they aim to bolster the ability of working people to achieve racial, gender, and economic justice through organizing, collective bargaining, and advocating for state and local policies that promote worker power. Meanwhile, the merger of the Center for Responsive Politics and the National Institute on Money in Politics created <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/">OpenSecrets</a>, which will build on the extensive datasets of its two parent organizations to track the money being invested in political campaigns and lobbying at both the federal and state level. This information is crucial for efforts to hold policymakers accountable to the&nbsp;public.</p><p>We celebrate this Labor Day amid a pandemic that has acted as a shock to the system and has given may people the power — often for the first time — to make a conscious choice about how they want to participate in the economy, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/07/jobs-report-labor-shortage-analysis/">triggering a “Great Reassessment of work in America.”</a> Many are choosing not to return to jobs that paid low wages and had erratic schedules or poor working conditions. These decisions are proof that the economy people want is very different than the one we have. Even a pandemic has not been enough to disrupt the systemic power imbalance that exists in both our economy and democracy. We must continue the legacy of the working people and labor leaders who have stood up to hoarders of power; we must continue to fight for a future in which each of us has the power and voice to determine how we live our&nbsp;lives.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-building-counterweights-to-power-83e7234aa958">Reimagining Capitalism Series: Building Counterweights to Power</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Credivera?</p>



<p>Mission: To bridge the way the world manages personal and professional credentials. We make people’s lives easier, safer, and more productive by seamlessly connecting trustworthy information to where it needs to go.</p>



<p>Vision: Transform the way we provide proof of people, products, and processes.</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>A global economy requires a shared, trusted framework for understanding that the information we are receiving is true, untampered, and current.</p>



<p>As we look at traditional industries, we see an urgent need to securely share information about an individual that respects both their personal data and the information required for operating a compliant organization.</p>



<p>As these markets interconnect, the skills of a workforce may be hybrid, remote or highly accessible but fundamentally still require a capacity to analyze, assess, and deploy talent associated with an identity based upon their current status.</p>



<p>Digital ID transitions the way we validate skills from subjective to objective, placing an emphasis on the work and removing stereotypes and bias limiting the advancements of new markets.</p>
 



 
<a href="https://home.credivera.com/"></a>



<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digital identity will create a common language and roadmap for securely sharing important personal information that honours the individual being in control of their identity. As their identity expands to involve personal and career credentials, the nature of work and repositioning of talent globally becomes a reality. </p>



<p>Canada will be able to attract the talent our industries require, share expertise in emerging geographies, and remove blockages in the way current economic systems operate that require verified identification in a manual way.</p>



<p>Credivera is developing an open, standards-based identity platform that provides proof of certifications and work experience using verified digital credentials. As we build a digital ecosystem of businesses, issuers, and individuals, we are supporting industries to adopt new ways to capacity plan, manage compliance, and identify opportunities for new career and skill development.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada can be agile and advocate for creating and mandating a shared standard of digital identity among world leaders. Through fundamental systems that enable both public and private trust services people, markets, and personal data can flow faster and more securely.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>As a participant in emerging advancements in digital identity for the government, Credivera learned of the Pan Canadian Trust framework and aligned with DIACC’s initiatives. As a member, we are excited to share knowledge and assist in creating the future of digital identity together.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Credivera is currently working with the Government of Canada on User Centric Verifiable Credentials, supporting the interoperability of foundational identity documents and will be found on the Microsoft Marketplace in the coming months for their digital Wallet.</p>

 AEMO announces open-source operating system for world-leading distributed energy marketplace design&nbsp;trial  World-first global partnership includes Energy Web (to provide the open-source data exchange system), Microsoft (to provide cloud services), and PXiSE (to provide market logic software), with local aggregators (Mondo) and network operators(AusNet) <p>Zug, Switzerland — 2 September 2021 — <br>Australian power system and market operator, Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has announced the architecture and technology partners for<a href="https://energyweb.org/aemo/"> Project EDGE</a> — a flagship initiative enabling distributed energy resources (DER) to provide for both wholesale and local network services at enterprise scale within an off-market trial environment. The DER Marketplace solution will be developed in partnership with local market participants AusNet Services, Mondo and global technology vendors, including Energy Web, PXiSE, and Microsoft.</p><p>Australia leads the world in adoption and deployment of distributed energy resources (DER), with nearly one in four homes featuring rooftop solar, and 40% in some states (South Australia and Queensland).</p><p>Combined with the rapid growth of energy storage, demand-side management, and utility-scale renewable generation, the Australian grid is transforming to a decentralised system in which consumer owned DER play a pivotal role. This has created challenges for AEMO and distribution network operators in balancing and protecting the grid, but also creates new opportunities for consumers and other market participants to create value via supporting the energy transition with their&nbsp;DER.</p><p>In response, AEMO has established a DER program to enable the transition from one-way energy supply to a world-leading system that maximises the value of DER for all consumers through digitisation and integration of DER into Australia’s power systems and&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Under project EDGE, AEMO is collaborating with Mondo and AusNet Services, with input from the broader energy industry, to demonstrate via a proof-of-concept trial, how aggregated fleets of DER can deliver multiple energy services at scale both wholesale power system and local network&nbsp;levels.</p><p>This project will provide AEMO and its partners with technical and operational experience to inform evidence-based changes to regulatory and operational processes to effectively manage Australian electricity grids and markets with increasing levels of DER participation. Additionally, EDGE will focus specifically on understanding consumers’ perspectives and preferences in selling their DER capacity to Aggregators for use in energy&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Project EDGE is focused on streamlining data exchange among market participants to maximise utilisation and coordination of DER for providing multiple grid services, informing capability for scalability. Project EDGE is testing this capability with up to 10MW of DER capacity, made up of approximately 1,000 customers.</p><p>The DER Marketplace will be underpinned by Energy Web’s open-source operating system, which will be used to establish digital identities for all assets and market participants in the program. This identity-based architecture facilitates secure, efficient exchange and validation of DER data amongst market participants using digital infrastructure shared amongst Australian market participants.</p><p>The market intelligence and logic layer will be provided by PXiSE, and the solution will leverage Microsoft Azure cloud computing resources. EDGE’s DER Marketplace will deliver three core function&nbsp;sets:</p><p>1:Efficient and scalable DER data exchange between actors through use of self-sovereign identities anchored to a digital infrastructure that in future, could be shared between market participants;</p><p>2:Wholesale integration: DER Fleets will be dispatched as if they are participating in existing wholesale markets, while considering Distribution Network Limits in the dispatch process;&nbsp;and</p><p>3:Local Services Exchange — the Marketplace will facilitate visible, scalable and competitive trade of Local DER Services that enables Distribution Network Service Providers (DNSPs) to manage local power security and reliability and enables DER Aggregators to stack local and wholesale value streams efficiently.</p><p>As DER deployment accelerates across Australia, coordinating DER across market participant operating systems and participating prosumers has become a significant challenge. Project EDGE will provide evidence to support decisions relating to investment in digital operating system and the underlying design of data exchange&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Australia’s EDGE project will begin testing services in April 2022, with project completion in March&nbsp;2023.</p><blockquote>AEMO Chief Markets Officer, Member Services, Violette Mouchaileh, said “Project EDGE aims to build understanding of and inform the most efficient and sustainable way to integrate DER into the electricity system and markets, allowing all consumers to benefit from a future with high levels of DER. There is no existing product that meets all high-level requirements for the DER Marketplace, so Project EDGE is at the leading edge of product development in this&nbsp;space.”</blockquote><p>The EDGE Project is being supported by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), with AEMO receiving almost $13 million in funding for the project. ARENA CEO Darren Miller said at the time that this landmark trial would provide the blueprint for integrating DER into the&nbsp;grid.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/aemo-announces-open-source-operating-system-for-world-leading-distributed-energy-marketplace-design-a211a6f6c415">AEMO announces open-source operating system for world-leading distributed energy marketplace design…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

	 Data Flow &amp; the Invisible Parallel Dataverse 
<p>Version 1.0 |&nbsp;September 1, 2021</p>
<p>Author: Me2B Alliance</p>
<p>#InvisibleParallelDataverse #RespectfulTech #DystopianMetaverse</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
The reality of online data flows is nothing like what we expect. Our personal data flows do not start light and increase with time and trust. Instead, a firehose of personal information is released – and shared with a host of unseen third parties – as soon as we open an app or website. Me2BA’s Respectful Tech Specification V.1 is largely focused on testing for these invisible parallel dataverse data flows.</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>So far in this series of Me2B 101 Flash Guides, we’ve focused on the digital world as we interact with and experience it. We now turn our attention to the flow of data during the Me2B Relationship lifecycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 10.1 illustrates typical user expectations about data sharing over the course of the Me2B Lifecycle. It reflects our expectations – based on the relationship norms in the physical world – that the flow of personal information would start off very slowly, only to build up over time as our trust builds.&nbsp; </p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the [somewhat] idealized view of how our digital Me2B Relationships should be – reflecting the increasing trust between the Me and the B over time, and a proportional increase in information sharing over time. It would be more ideal if the flow of information ceased more cleanly at the end of a Me2B Marriage, but that doesn’t appear to be the case for most services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, this idealized lifecycle is not at all the current reality of digital Me2B Relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, as soon as we so much open a website or an app, there is a firehose of information about us being shared with countless undisclosed entities—Data Processors (or Hidden B2B Affiliates, as introduced in Flash Guide #6).I&nbsp; The reality looks more like Figure 10.2 than 10.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 10.2 Invisible Parallel Dataverse&nbsp;</p>
<p>How Does This Happen?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;A major culprit in the tsunami of unwitting information sharing is the digital advertising infrastructure, (described in Flash Guide # 5) which systematically, and at massive scale shares personal data with multiple third parties (aka Data Processors). So long as this infrastructure exists, the personal data floodgates are open.ii&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital advertising is just one of the ways that websites and apps invisibly share data with third party Data Processors. Until all these avenues are exposed, and businesses and other Data Controllers are made responsible for respectful data processing, people are at risk. Version 1.0 of the Me2B Respectful Tech Spec is largely dedicated to testing for [outbound] invisible parallel dataverse data flows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	 
 

	 
 
 	 

 

	
	 
 See <a>Flash Guide 6</a> for how GDPR terms such as “Data Processor” and “Data Controller” map onto Me2B Alliance terminology.

<p>Author: Me2B Alliance</p>
<p>#Me2BRelationship #Me2BDeals #RespectfulTech</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
The Me2B Respectful Tech Specification measures technology behavior against 10 attributes that respectful Me2B Commitments should possess. These attributes represent how technology should treat us and our data at every step along the Me2B Relationship Lifecycle.</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p><a>Flash Guide #8</a> described the types of Me2B Commitments that may occur throughout the digital Me2B Lifecycle. The Me2B Alliance has identified 10 high level attributes that respectful Me2B Commitments should possess. Our Respectful Tech Specification measures technology behavior against these 10 attributes, while taking into consideration the specific context and stage for each commitment.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

	 
 

	 

 

	

	 
 
 
 
 The 10 Attributes of Respectful Me2B Commitments 
 
 Clear Data Processing Noticei 
 Viable Permission 
 Identification Minimization 
 Data Collection Minimization 
 Private by Default 
 Reasonable Data Use &amp; Sharing / Me2B Deal in Action 
 Data Processing Behavior Complies with Data Subject’s Permissions and Preferences 
 Data Processing Behavior Complies with Policies 
 Reasonableness of Commitment Duration 
 Commitment Termination or Change Behavior 
 
 
 
 
 


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>Each of the 10 attributes is described in more detail below:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Clear Data Processing Notice:&nbsp; Measures if the app or website provides adequate notice on how data is collected, used, shared, monetized, etc. by the Data Controller(s) and all Data Processors.<br>
&nbsp; 
 Viable Permission:&nbsp; The Me2BA uses legal scholar <a href="https://www.ali.org/members/member/344957/">Nancy Kim</a>’sii three requirements for legally viable permission to enter into a commitmentiii, and checks for the following:&nbsp;
 
 Understandability: Can the Data Subject understand the Me2B Deal?&nbsp; 
 Freely Given: Is the Data Subject coerced or manipulated in any way into providing permission for this commitment?&nbsp; 
 Intentional Action: Does the Data Subject perform a distinct act to provide permission, and is it recorded?<br>
 
 
<p>“Viable Permission” also evaluates the commitment’s permission flow to all Co-Data Controllers and Data Processors (which we refer to as “Transitive Permissions”).</p> 
 Identification Minimization: Measures if the identification constructed by the service are appropriate for the particular Me2B Commitment. Note that “appropriate” means that the identification level reflects the social norms described in Flash Guide #8.<br>
&nbsp; 
 Data Collection Minimization: Tests whether the data collected is proportional to, and appropriate, for the particular Me2B Commitment. We measure across three types of data:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 Volunteered Data – entered by the Data Subject 
 Observed Data – automatically collected by the website or app without the individual’s&nbsp;awareness, and&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Derived Data – data that is derived by the Data Controller(s) or Data Processors. <br>
&nbsp; 
 
 
 Private by Default: Measures whether the Data Subject must modify any website or app settings in order to have a private experience.<br>
&nbsp; 
 Reasonableness of Data Use &amp; Sharing Behavior: Measures if the observed data use and sharing behavior is appropriate for the particular Me2B Commitment.<br>
&nbsp; 
 Data Processing Behavior Complies with Data Subject’s Permissions and Preferences:&nbsp; Measures if the observed data processing behavior matches the Data Subject’s permissions and preferences.<br>
&nbsp; 
 Data Processing Behavior Complies with Policies: Measures if the observed data processing behavior matches the promised behavior as stated in the privacy policy and terms of service or terms of use.<br>
&nbsp; 
 Reasonableness of Commitment Duration: Measures if the duration of the commitment is appropriate for the particular Me2B Commitment, and the industry sector.<br>
&nbsp; 
 Commitment Termination Behavior: Tests three commitment termination behaviors:&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 Usability:&nbsp; If it’s easy for the Data Subject to change or end the commitment.&nbsp; 
 Record:&nbsp; If the commitment termination is recorded and provided to the Data Subject.&nbsp; 
 Data Removal: If the Data Subject’s data is forgotten/deleted by all Data Controllers and Data Processors.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>Like in the case of “Viable Permission” (attribute 2), this attribute assesses whether changes to “Commitment Termination”-related permissions or settings cascade down to all Co-Data Controllers and Data Processors.&nbsp;</p>

	 
 

	 
 
 	 

 

	
	 
 Note that the Me2B Alliance and our Respectful Tech Specification use GDPR terminology. In particular, note that “data processing” under GDPR Article 4, item (2) includes collection and all other behaviors relating to data: “‘processing’ means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction” <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/">Art. 4 GDPR – Definitions | General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (gdpr-info.eu)</a> 
 <a href="https://www.ali.org/members/member/344957/">https://www.ali.org/members/member/344957/</a> 
 “Consent has a variety of meanings in the law, but it is typically a conclusion based upon the presence or absence of three conditions: an intentional manifestation of consent, knowledge, and volition/voluntariness.” Kim, Nancy S. “Consentability: Consent and its Limits” (p. 9).

<p>IEEE DataPort provides a unified data and collaboration platform which researchers can leverage to efficiently store, share, access, and manage research data, accelerating institutional research efforts. Researchers at subscribing institutions will gain access to the more than 2,500 research datasets available on the platform and the ability to collaborate with more than 1.25 million IEEE DataPort users worldwide. The platform also enables institutions to meet funding agency requirements for the use of and sharing of data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As research in nearly all domains becomes more data intensive, providing institutions with the ability to store, share, access, and manage high quality data is critical.&nbsp; This agreement facilitates that opportunity. Edge and its peer Regional Research and Education organizations have a substantial overlap in technical domains of interest with IEEE, and will leverage their very wide and deep relationships with research organizations across North America to promote IEEE DataPort,” said Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs at Edge.</p>
<p>The partnership advances the mission of EdgeDiscovery, a research and discovery framework providing access to leading-edge technology to support collaborative research and educational opportunities.</p>
<p>“IEEE is pleased to have the opportunity to work with Edge in bringing IEEE DataPort to researchers and institutions. IEEE and Edge both understand the critical need of the research community for replication and extension of data intensive studies, to meet funding agency requirements, and for a secure platform on which to store, manage and provide accessibility to research data. IEEE DataPort is a full-service data platform that can serve all researchers and all institutions and help them meet the requirements for managing research data,” according to Dr. David Belanger, Chair, IEEE DataPort Project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	 Digital Me2B Commitments &amp; Deals 
<p>Version 1.0 |&nbsp;September 1, 2021</p>
<p>Author: Me2B Alliance</p>
<p>#Me2BRelationship #Me2BLifecycle #Me2BCommitments #Me2BDeals</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
Over the course of the digital Me2B Lifecycle, individual “Me-s” (Data Subjects) will have the choice of deepening the relationship through a series of Me2B Commitments with the online vendor, “B” (Data Controller). This guide provides examples of common Commitments and Deals, and shows how they map to the stages of a Me2B Lifecycle. It also reflects social norms for being anonymous, recognized, or known at each stage.</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p><a>Flash Guide #7</a> introduced the Me2B Lifecycle, both online and offline. This Flash Guide takes a deeper dive into the digital Me2B Lifecycle, with a focus on the types of Me2B Deals and Commitments that define each state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As in any relationship, ongoing two-way transactions ultimately shape the arc of the relationship lifecyle over time. Over the course of the digital Me2B Lifecycle, the individual (“Me”) will be asked or will seek to enter into specific bargains with the vendor (“B”). These opportunities to move along the relationship arc are called Me2B Commitments. </p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	 What’s the difference between a Me2B Deal and Me2B Commitment? 
 
<p>A Me2B Commitment is typically presented to the individual “Me” through the user interface, and it is an opportunity to transact with the B to agree to enter a new state, taking a step along the relationship arc into a specific commitment state, changing the intensity of the relationship.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>The Me2B Deal describes the terms of the commitment, i.e. what our “typical Me”, Mia, gives to the B and what she receives in exchange. (see <a>Flash Guide #5 Me2B Deal Currencies</a>).</p>
 


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>Examples of Me2B Commitments &amp; Deals, as experienced by Mia, our representative “Me”,&nbsp; are provided in Table 8.1, below.</p>



Me2B&nbsp;Commitment
Description
Me2B Deal


Cookie Commitment
Mia accepts cookies.
Mia allows the vendor (the “B”) to write cookies (and other data) to local storage in exchange for a better user experience.


Location Commitment
Mia approves location sharing.
Mia shares her location information for a better, location-aware experience.


One-off Transaction
Mia performs a one-off transaction, like buying something from a retailer without creating a log-in.
Mia provides cash equivalent in exchange for a tangible good or service.


Promotional Commitment
Mia enrolls for promotional communications from the vendor.
Mia shares email address and potentially other information in exchange for timely promotional communications from the B.


Loyalty Commitment
Mia enrolls in Loyalty Program.
Mia shares personal information and ongoing transactional information in exchange for valuable discounts from the B.


Me2B Marriage
Mia creates an account on the site/app.
Mia shares personal information, ongoing transactional and behavioral information in exchange for valuable, personalized service.



<p>Table 8.1 – Me2B Commitments and Me2B Deals&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the stars in Figure 8.1, below, depicts the point where a Me2B Commitment begins. Note that each of these commitments could also have a corresponding end point overlaid on the lifecycle. For simplicity we have not shown those end points – except for the cessation of the “Me2B Marriage” which is shown as “Close Account”.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 8.1 Me2B Commitments over a Digital Me2B Relationship Lifecycle&nbsp;</p>
<p>As described in Flash Guide #7, Me2B Deals (and the associated Me2B Commitments) should follow the identification norms — Anonymity, Recognition, and being Known —&nbsp; that match the stage of the relationship where they occur. Figure 8.2 illustrates how the behavioral norms for identification for each stage map onto the Me2B Commitments during the course of the Me2B Relationship Lifecycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 8.2 Digital Me2B Lifecycle with Behavioral Norms&nbsp;</p>
<p>These identification norms&nbsp; provide a crucial social context that is presently missing from technology standards and privacy regulation. This missing context can be understood as the state of the Me2B relationship, and ignoring it accounts for substantial harm to Me-s, such as rampant profiling and manipulation.i&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This contextual overlay on the Me2B Lifecycle gives us the language and framework—whether as Me-s, technology makers, policy makers, or standards makers – to better describe how technology should treat us and, importantly, when it departs from expected social norms, as nearly all technology does today. In particular, it serves as a foundation from which the Me2B Alliance works to develop rigorous standards for respectful and safe technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	<p>When we started drafting the Respectful Tech Specification a couple of years ago, it was immediately obvious that we didn’t have an adequate vocabulary to describe personal experiences in the digital world—never mind measure them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to even the formation of the Me2B Alliance, one of the first things I did was examine all of the interpersonal relationship categories we have in our lives to see if there was a generic term to describe the customer/purveyor relationship, because this relationship is at the heart of many of our digital interactions. After much exploration, I came up dry on a simple, pre-existing term to describe this kind of relationship. And it baffled me, since in our very capitalistic culture in the US, we have literally scores of these kinds of relationships in our everyday lives. How is it that we don’t have a category or class name for it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>My early presentations describing this relationship had over 100 slides. I remember spinning through an early version at the IIW (Internet Identity Workshop), posing this question:&nbsp; what do we call these customer/purveyor relationships? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls">Doc Searls</a> serenely offered, “why not Me2B Relationships?” And thus, a term was born.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Words matter. If we don’t have words to describe it, we can’t possibly understand it. And we certainly can’t measure it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me2B refers to a class of relationships between customers (Me-s) and purveyors (B-s) of virtually any sort, in both the physical and the digital world. This concept was the starting point for a new set of terms that enabled us to be more specific about human interactions in the digital world. These included:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Me2B Deals,&nbsp; 
 Me2B Relationship Life Cycle&nbsp; 
 Me2B Marriage,&nbsp; 
 Me2B Commitments,&nbsp; 
 Me2P Relationships, (where P = product)&nbsp; 
 Me2T Relationships, (where T = technology enabler)&nbsp; 
 B2B Hidden Affiliates.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Once we recognize that we are in fact in a two-way relationship with purveyors of things and services — not unlike other inter-personal relationships we have in our lives — we can better see the full tapestry of analogs. We can, for instance, see clearly that data is not the new oil, and that it’s harmful to think of it like that. Data isn’t fungible, it is not a commodity, nor labor, nor [strictly speaking] is it property. Data is about us – it is, simply, our very lives. Our data is us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is more appropriate to think of data like blood, or better yet, DNA—it is that sensitive and uniquely identifying. We shed data like microscopic flecks of skin as we go about living our lives. We don’t expect someone to be gathering our hair and skin debris as we wander about, and similarly, we don’t want people gathering our digital “DNA” detritus on the internet. It’s just not ok.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Me2B Alliance has recently published a number of short tutorials (<a>Flash Guides</a>) in a “Me2B101 Series” that describes the concepts underpinning of our mission and approach, and tells the story of our journey from ethical principles to metrics and measurement. We hope that you find these illuminating and helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	 The Me2B Lifecycle: Overlaying Social Norms on the Digital World 
<p>Version 1.0 |&nbsp;September 1, 2021</p>
<p>Author: Me2B Alliance</p>
<p>#Me2BRelationship</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
Key to creating a standard to measure the behavior of technology is the ability to take several contexts into consideration, including the current status of the Me2B relationship. The Me2B Lifecycle model provides a framework and vocabulary to articulate and account for the dynamic “relationship context” over time when evaluating the behavior of technology. This real life social context is currently missing in both existing privacy regulation and in industry standards models for ethical technology, but it is crucial to the Me2B Respectful Tech Specification. Our model helps course-correct connected technology by pinpointing how the digital Me2B experience deviates from important social behavioral norms.</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>The Me2B Alliance has developed a model for the lifecycle of Me2B Relationships that is rooted in interpersonal psychology. Specifically, we built on psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Levinger">George Levinger’s</a>i ABCDE relationship model, which asserts that every relationship eventually traverses through five stages:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Acquaintance&nbsp; 
 Build-up&nbsp; 
 Commitment&nbsp; 
 Deterioration&nbsp; 
 Ending&nbsp; 
 
<p>The Me2B Relationship Lifecycle follows a similar arc. It starts with acquaintance, and moves through a buildup of repeated interactions. Over time, if these interactions deepen in intimacy and trust, they may culminate in a deliberate deep commitment, which we call the “Me2B Marriage”, which is the point of creating an online account. Eventually, the relationship may deteriorate to the point of termination. (See Figure 7.1)&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 7.1 – The Me2B Relationship Lifecycle&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each stage in the Me2B Relationship Lifecycle represents a unique context that reflects the trust level and intensity of the relationship from the individual’s point of view. Figure 7.2 provides examples of how each stage of the lifecycle may look in the physical world and in the digital world.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 7.2 – Me2B Relationship Lifecycle in the Physical &amp; Digital Worlds&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the physical world, there are specific behavioral social norms and expectations for each of these stages of the Me2B Lifecycle. One doesn’t expect to be greeted by name, for instance, before any introductions have been made. Similarly, we don’t expect store employees to know our home address unless we’ve given it to them for a specific reason (such as delivery). </p>
<p>This real life social context is currently missing in both existing privacy regulation and in industry standards models for ethical technology, but it is crucial to the Me2B Respectful Tech Specification. Our work translates appropriate and respectful behavioral norms from the physical world onto our experiences online. Figure 7.3, below, illustrates how social norms for identification –for being anonymous, recognized, and “known” or remembered– operate in the physical world, and how they should operate in the digital world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 7.3 Identification Behavioral Norms of Me2B Relationships&nbsp;</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	 What is the Me2B Marriage? 
<p>The Me2B Marriage reflects the most intimate, trusted phase of the Me2B relationship, a stage where the individual chooses to be recognized, “known” or remembered, and personally responded to.&nbsp; In the physical world, this implies a level of being known by the business (such as loyalty program enrollment) and the agents of the business (such as cashiers or salespeople). In the digital world, the Me2B Marriage is the legal ceremony of agreeing to the vendor’s terms of service or terms of use, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/deloitte-study-91-percent-agree-terms-of-service-without-reading-2017-11#:~:text=A%20new%20Deloitte%20survey%20found,and%20conditions%20without%20reading%20them.">which most people never read</a>ii. This is, in fact, the act of entering a legal contract between the “Me” and the “B”. Ideally, the individual is not coerced or manipulated into signing up for an account, such that the individual freely signals to the B that they wish to be remembered, recognized, and personally responded to.</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>Currently, respectful behavioral norms from Me2B Relationships in the physical world are neither reflected nor supported in digital Me2B Relationships. The Me2B Lifecycle model serves as a tool that can help course-correct connected technology to reflect appropriate social norms and behaviors for each stage in the Me2B Relationship Lifecycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Me2B Respectful Tech Specification is specifically designed to address the disconnect between offline and online behavior. The tests in the specification evaluate connected technologies for how well they are translating respectful behavioral norms from the physical world into the digital world.&nbsp;</p>

	 Online Me2B Relationships 
<p>Version 1.0 |&nbsp;September 1, 2021</p>
<p>Author: Me2B Alliance</p>
<p>#Me2BRelationship</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
Me2B Relationships in the digital world have even more layers than those in the physical world. In addition, our relationship with connected technology includes a set of “hidden affiliates” (third party integrations) that most of us are not aware of. This guide describes how these relationships – conscious or not – emerge as we interact with digital technologies. </p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>In <a href="https://me2ba.org/flash-guide-4-introduction-to-me2b-relationships-and-me2b-deals/">Flash Guide #4</a>, we introduced Me2B Relationships and examined how they may be experienced in the physical world. In this Flash Guide, we’ll explore Me2B Relationships in the digital world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Me2B Relationships have a number of different facets. We introduced this layering in the Flash Guide #4, explaining the difference between the relationship our typical “Me,” Mia, has with a retailer or brand, and the “Me2P” relationship Mia has with a particular product. This same kind of layering exists—with even more layers—in the digital world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s walk through a fictional account of Mia unboxing a brand new iPhone:</p>
<p>Figure 6.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stage 1: The first thing that happens is that Mia powers up her phone and is immediately required to agree to the Apple Terms of Service—i.e. to enter into a Me2B Legal Relationship with the company (or “B”), Apple. As Mia uses the phone, she develops a disposition (love/hate, e.g.) towards the phone; she has an experiential relationship with the phone, not dissimilar to the experiential relationship she has with the OXO brand containers described in FG #4. This relationship with her phone is a Me2P or “Me-to-Product” relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a critical difference, however, between connected technology like Mia’s iPhone and static products like her OXO containers. Connected technology relies on a number of integrated third-party technologies, depicted as “B2B Hidden Affiliates” in Figure 6.1. These entities may have access to significant pieces of information about Mia and her usage of the phone. So in essence, Mia is having a relationship with those hidden affiliates—she just doesn’t know it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stage 2: As Mia starts configuring her phone, she decides to install the Chrome browser app: <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 6.2&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to Stage 1, as soon as Mia opens the browser, she is required to establish a Me2B Legal Relationship with Google, LLC. And over time, as she uses the browser, she builds a Me2P relationship with the browser itself. She is aware that she is using the browser—essentially having an ongoing dialogue with the app. Note that, even though she’s using the phone, it’s not at the forefront of her consciousness, and it has become an Enabling Technology Relationship (or Me2T relationship). We reserve the term “Me2P” for the app or website with which the individual is directly interacting. Finally, in this stage, notice that the list of B2B Hidden Affiliates continues to grow—this time, with all the third parties included in the browser app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stage 3: Mia opens the Instagram website from the Chrome browser:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 6.3&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to the previous stages, Mia is required to enter into a legal relationship with the company responsible for Instagram (Facebook). Her interaction with Instagram occupies her attention and she is in a two-way dialogue with the website. The list of B2B Hidden Affiliates continues to grow, and the browser is demoted to an Enabling Technology, like the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With just a few steps, Mia has developed a network of entities with whom she is in some kind of relationship—wittingly or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A word about B2B Hidden Affiliates: while these are depicted in this explanation, we do not consider these to be Me2B Relationships since Mia has no direct relationship with those entities. We will go deeper into the network of hidden affiliates in a subsequent Flash Guide.&nbsp;</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	 Mapping Me2B Relationships to GDPR Terminology 
<p>The Me2B Respectful Tech Specification leverages GDPR terminology and concepts, for consistency and clarity.i We acknowledge that the GDPR’s term for people, “Data Subject”, is not particularly empowering from a semantic perspective, but it has the benefit of being clear and legally explicit.There is no doubt that people are more than “data subjects”. The terminology we’ve introduced above maps to GDPR terms as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



Me2B TERM
GDPR TERM


Mia
Data Subject


Business or “B” in a Me2B Legal Relationship
Data Controller


Product or “P” in a M2P Relationship
Data Controller


Technology or “T” in a Me2T Relationship
Data Controller


B2B Hidden Affiliate
Data Processor

	 Online Me2B Deals: Currencies in the Digital World and the Price of “Free” 
<p>Version 1.0 |&nbsp;September 1, 2021</p>
<p>Author: Me2B Alliance</p>
<p>#Me2BDeal #TANSTAAFL</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
The Me2B Deals or transactions that occur online typically involve three types of “currency”: money, attention or data. The individual consumer (Me) exchanges one of these currencies for goods or services online. Data monetization has emerged as the primary method of income generation to subsidize so-called “free” digital services, with little to no regulation or oversight. What sets online data monetization apart from the other two currencies is that often, customers have no idea what they are paying with – or that they are paying at all.</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>As introduced in Flash Guide #4, Me2B Deals are the value exchanges that occur in the course of a Me2B Relationship. Me2B Deals represent bi-directional transactions between the individual customer (“Me”) and the business or purveyor (“B).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the physical world, we typically experience these deals as cash or credit transactions. The customer (“Me”) gives the business (“B”) some amount of money in order to receive some good or service. In addition, since the advent of advertising-supported media such as magazines, radio and television, attention has also evolved to be a type of currency used in Me2B Deals for media goods and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we traverse the digital world, online Me2B Deals also involve exchanges of money and attention for goods or services. In addition, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_monetization">data monetization</a>”i – the ability to make money off of data – has evolved into a powerful new type of currency in online digital transactions, resulting in three primary currencies for online Me2B Deals:</p>
 
 Money. Credit card transactions (and increasingly cryptocurrencies) are a typical occurrence in the digital world. In the 2020 pandemic, many of us turned increasingly to online retailers, grocers and delivery services, for which we pay using cash equivalents.   
 Attention. When radio and television came of age, another kind of currency matured:  namely, attention–i.e. people literally “paying” attention for some duration of time to watch or listen to advertisements. In exchange, we received broadcast radio and TV for “free”. When early online companies were grappling to find a viable business model, advertising was the obvious choice and digital advertising was born. Banner ads and pop-up ads were the earliest examples. Soon there was a “race for eyeballs” fueled by the “CPM” (cost per 1000 views of an ad), the desire for “sticky apps”ii, and a burgeoning advertising technology infrastructure of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_bidding">Real Time Bidding</a> systemsiii. &nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Data. The early evolution of the internet in the 2000’s heavily relied on the attention fueled ad-supported business model described above, and soon took it a step further with the monetization of data, which in turn reinforced the newly popular “free” and “freemium”iv business models. It wasn’t long before app and website publishers realized that they could observe and record every single movement a person makes online. (Shoshana Zuboff calls this information “behavioral surplus” in her&nbsp;master work, “Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power”v). The sharing of this information in exchange for money or another value is one example of “data monetization”. The irresistible allure of converting free, observable data into revenue has become the de facto business model for online services. It existed before the internet with credit companies, direct marketing and the segmenting and selling of contact lists. But the current digital version is far more pervasive, hidden, and unchecked. What sets online data monetization apart from the other two currencies is that often, customers have no idea what they are paying with – or that they are paying at all.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Let’s pause here to take a step back for a thought experiment to imagine how Data Monetization and a similar “free” business model might look in the physical world.&nbsp;</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	 
 
 
 
<p>“Free” in the Grocery Store</p>
 
 Mia goes to her friendly neighborhood grocery store and sees a sign that says, “Free Cantaloupes! (up&nbsp;to two per customer)”. No other information about what Mia is trading for the free cantaloupe is&nbsp;shown, so she adds a couple cantaloupes to her cart. 
 What Mia doesn’t know is that there is a network of video cameras following her around the grocery&nbsp;store. As soon as Mia places the cantaloupes in her cart, the video network begins recording. It observes and notes her behavior throughout the store. It notices, for instance, that she puts only cantaloupes and oranges in her cart and notes to itself, “Subject X023985FRL prefers cantaloupes and oranges. Subject X023985FRL spent 2.3 minutes selecting oranges. Subject X023985FRL only picked up blemish free cantaloupes. Subject X023985FRL walked past cantaloupes that were on sale.” 
 Unbeknownst to Mia, this recording system shares all that information with a variety of other businesses—including ones that had nothing to do with the grocery supply chain. 
 And the video cameras may continue to follow Mia after she leaves the store. 
 The cost of the “free” cantaloupes was actually a total loss of privacy while shopping, but Mia had no&nbsp;way of knowing that. Free comes at a price. 
 
 
 
 
 


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>One may ask:  Who has a right to know the details of my behavior?  How much of my behavior should be tracked?  These are the kinds of questions we’re tackling in the Me2B Alliance. In general, we think that no one has a right to track your behavior in the digital world in the current rampant, ungoverned, disrespectful and ultimately harmful&nbsp; way.   &nbsp;</p>
<p>It used to be that companies built products that competed on the value that they provided to customers. Today, the digital world is all about data monetization and a more exploitive relationship with customers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While online services today are free, we are anything but. &nbsp;</p>

	 
 

	 
 
 	 

 

	
	 
 “Data monetization…may refer to the act of generating measurable economic benefits from available data sources (analytics).”&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_monetization">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_monetization</a> 
 Defined by how long people spent engaged with and returning to apps. 
 “Real-time bidding (RTB) is a means by which advertising inventory is bought and sold on a per-impression basis, via instantaneous programmatic auction, similar to financial markets.” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_bidding">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_bidding</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Denver-based Bonifii, the financial industry’s first verifiable exchange network for financial cooperatives, today announced it has joined the Indicio Network as a Node Operator to support the continued expansion of decentralized identity across the globe.</p>
<p>The Indicio Network is the world’s only globally available, professionally-managed, enterprise-grade network for decentralized identity. With nodes on five continents, Bonifii joins a consortium of diverse, forward-thinking companies driving the use of decentralized identity to improve privacy and security in fintech, healthcare, travel, and the Internet of Things (IOT).</p>
<p>Bonifii’s president/CEO John Ainsworth said the company decided to support the Indicio Network after seeing it used to support a growing number of successful solutions over the past year.</p>
<p>“We are excited to join the Indicio Network and participate in the development of next-generation identity technology alongside some of the world’s fastest-growing innovators in the identity space,” said Ainsworth. “This has the potential to open up entirely new ways of conducting business for credit unions and enable compelling new experiences for their members.”</p>
<p>“As the leading provider of decentralized identity for credit unions, Bonifii is laying the foundations for the future of financial infrastructure,” said Heather Dahl, CEO, and co-founder of Indicio.tech. “We’re thrilled to see such an innovative company support the Indicio Network, and we look forward to seeing what they will build to make decentralized identity a reality for millions of consumers.”</p>
<p>Bonifii’s digital strategy focuses on credit unions and providing them with a digital network for peer-to-peer financial exchange. The company’s flagship product is MemberPass®, which allows credit union members convenient access to their financial accounts while allowing control and privacy of their personal information.</p>
<p>“The market for application-based consumer identity is wide open with Indicio’s superfast, secure, and low-cost distributed network,” Ainsworth said. “It’s in our interest to be part of the Indicio Network’s Node Operator collaborative. These companies are incubating new identity technologies and commercializing them in a global context. Being a Node Operator means having access to the combined technical insight of all the other members to improve our speed to market.”</p>
<p>Bonifii joins a growing network of diverse global entities, including IdRamp, Liquid Avatar Technologies, GlobaliD, Sapper Future Technologies, Verses Labs, and others who are driving the deployment of decentralized identity.</p>
<p>Indicio Node Operators are responsible for running the nodes of the Indicio Network, as well as guiding both strategy and ecosystem development. This contributes to robust network stability and is conducive to maintaining diversity and decentralization of the network. Node Operators also support Indicio’s comprehensive and easy-to-use governance model that provides safeguards for the entire ecosystem using the Indico Network and preserves the integrity of the Indicio network.</p>

 The growing demand for digital public infrastructure requires coordinated global investment and an ethical&nbsp;lens Global leaders weigh in on the ethical facets of digital public infrastructure at a virtual conference held Monday, Aug. 30,&nbsp;2021. The 10 must-reads to keep pace with the digital public infrastructure movement <p>By Govind Shivkumar, Director of Responsible Technology, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>You don’t need me to tell you that 2020 was an arduous year, or that the year that followed has been just as fraught. We all had a collective experience of the pandemic as a destabilizing force. It exacerbated and highlighted societal inefficiencies and inequities as no other single event in recent memory has, and it did so on a global&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Underlying many of the achievements and disappointments in pandemic response was digital public infrastructure (or lack thereof). Where some nations were equipped to deliver cash transfers to citizens, collect and utilize comprehensive public health data, and distribute vaccines in an orderly fashion, others struggled. What made the difference was often preexisting digital public infrastructure (or&nbsp;DPI).</p><p>Our friends at The Rockefeller Foundation explain this well in a new <a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/report/co-develop-digital-public-infrastructure-for-an-equitable-recovery/">report,</a> showing that as more of our society becomes digital (especially the economy), it becomes increasingly imperative that we treat digital infrastructure like we do roads and bridges. They outline six key areas of cooperation. The bottom line? We need coordinated global investment in digital public infrastructure so that it’s in place before we need it. And we need an ethical lens to ensure that any digital systems reinforce safeguards such as inclusion, trust, competition, security, and&nbsp;privacy.</p> A shared vision and call to&nbsp;action <p>The need for more and better digital public infrastructure has not gone unnoticed by government and philanthropy. This week, a group of nearly 20 global leaders laid out a shared vision for co-developing broad-based, flexible digital systems to support an equitable recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic while strengthening inclusion and human&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Hosted by the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a>, Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norad), and The Rockefeller Foundation, the virtual event elicited meaningful ideas and commitments from The United Nations, European Commission, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, Africa Digital Rights Hub, USAID, India, Sri Lanka, Togo, Sierra Leone, Estonia, Norway, Germany, and many other champions.</p><p>Omidyar Network’s Senior Vice President of Programs, Michele Jawando, moderated the conversation, drawing out pledges of funding and other support to <a href="https://mosip.io/">MOSIP</a> and <a href="https://mojaloop.io/">Mojaloop</a> (two of Omidyar Network’s grantees), the health data exchange <a href="https://dhis2.org/">DHIS2</a>, <a href="https://digitalsquare.org/blog/2021/8/27/digital-square-recommits-to-advancing-health-equity-through-digital-transformation">Digital Square</a>, Digital Public Goods Alliance, technical assistance to implementing nations, research, and proposals for new funding structures such as The Giving Pledge or creating a GAVI-like alliance that pools demand and resources from the public and private&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>“More than 400 people tuned in to learn more about digital public Infrastructure (DPI) — the basic systems like digital identity, payments and data exchanges that can connect us at a societal scale,” Jawando reflected. “Some heard for the first time how innovators built on DPI to slow disease spread and deliver help. They heard calls for caution and the need for safeguards for inclusion and protection. And they saw that we have a shared and coordinated agenda for equitable global co-development, based on digital public&nbsp;goods.”</p><p>As the speakers reminded us, this is just the beginning. We have a chance to bake ethics and inclusion into society’s next great socio-technological transformation; the first that is truly global AND digital. Let’s use that opportunity wisely.</p> An ethical framework <p>If history has shown us anything, it’s that creating systems that have society-wide implications without prioritizing ethical considerations is a fool’s errand at best; at worst it’s catastrophic. As the demand for digital public infrastructure becomes more widespread, it’s important to prioritize the ethical considerations when designing such&nbsp;systems.</p><p>That’s the objective of a new <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/digital-public-goods">white paper</a> funded by Omidyar Network and developed by Harvard University’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. To provide governments with a roadmap for the ethical deployment of digital public infrastructure, the Center’s Justice, Health and Democracy Impact Initiative produced a set of best practices for organizations that covers the design and deployment considerations for technologists, national governments, and philanthropic funders.</p><p>“After taking a hard look at existing work on this subject, we realized much of the debate is happening at the wrong level,” said co-author Josh Simons, who holds a joint fellowship at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy and the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. “There is too much uncertainty, change, and dynamism for hard and fast rules. What we need are concrete structures of decision-making and participation that hold actors to account for how they build digital infrastructure.”</p><p>Specifically, the paper advises technology developers to design digital public infrastructure that can adapt to emerging needs, concerns, and technological developments. Developers should consult directly with advocates of end users at all stages of development to ensure systems do not undermine their rights. Developers should also ensure their systems are able to be accessed by a variety of users, regardless of background or experience with technology, and regularly revise and maintain the systems once they’re&nbsp;built.</p><p>On the policy side, it is critical that policymakers integrate deliberation in the design and deployment of digital public infrastructure. These deliberation processes should also seek out input and feedback from groups have historically been marginalized. Additionally, policymakers should continuously conduct evaluations of how digital systems are affecting the communities they serve and establish clear ways to reform the systems, protect user rights, and establish transparency and accountability for politicians and technology developers.</p><p>Finally, philanthropists who are hoping to support the development of digital public infrastructure should identify and support developers and policymakers who have clear commitments to responsible digital public infrastructure development. They should moreover establish accountability measures for themselves such as adopting multidisciplinary ethics committees to help with oversight and navigating uncertain situations.</p><p>And the paper stresses regular discussions among all stakeholders involved to assess the merits, feasibility, and limitations of digital public infrastructure.</p><p>“Our guiding principles for stakeholders involved in developing and deploying digital public infrastructure are revisability of technology design, deliberative governance to create feedback loops, and accountability of funders and policy-makers,” said Jeff Behrends, Director of Ethics and Technology Initiatives at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics and co-author on the project. “We advocate an approach to the ethics of digital public infrastructure that we believe is robust, resilient, and applicable to countries across the&nbsp;world.”</p> A growing&nbsp;movement <p>If you feel like this has only scratched the surface, you’d be right! As with so many things with social, political, economic, and technological consequences, digital public infrastructure is a complex topic. Below are links to further reading that highlights the need for digital public infrastructure and how to make it a reality everywhere, for everyone. We’re confident that once others in government, international organizations, civil society, business, and philanthropy learn more, they will want to help overcome some of the remaining hurdles.</p><p>We welcome them into a rapidly growing international community of organizations working to change how countries are supported in their digital transformation journeys. There are no quick fixes. Only through better coordination, vastly more resources, and a clear vision of what “good DPI” is and why it matters can we accelerate deployments, strengthen national digital sovereignty and local value creation.</p><p><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/08/4-reasons-you-should-care-about-digital-public-infrastructure">How to bring digital inclusion to the people who need it most</a> (World Economic Forum, Aug.&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-digital-public-infrastructure-is-no-longer-just-a-development-agenda-6c3915d20598">Reimagining digital public infrastructure is no longer just a development agenda</a> (Omidyar Network, June&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://ecfr.eu/article/a-digital-agenda-for-the-eastern-partnership/">A digital agenda for the Eastern Partnership</a> (European Council on Foreign Relations, June&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.xyz/">Exploring digital public goods</a> (An eight-part series written by Richard Pope and supported by Omidyar Network, May-July&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-the-time-is-now-for-digital-public-goods-99833">Opinion: The time is now for digital public goods</a> (Devex, May&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/financing-the-digital-public-goods-ecosystem/">Financing the digital public goods ecosystem</a> (Digital Public Goods Alliance, March&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2020/12/07/covid-19-spurs-national-plans-to-give-citizens-digital-identities">Covid-19 spurs national plans to give citizens digital identities</a> (The Economist, Dec. 2020 — subscriber access required)</p><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/746a8643-1ff5-4e28-8f78-389f549c2b0e">‘Fire hose’ of health innovation risks going down the drain</a> (Financial Times, Nov.&nbsp;2020)</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/the-growing-demand-for-digital-public-infrastructure-requires-coordinated-global-investment-and-an-8ce1a22e4d6c">The growing demand for digital public infrastructure requires coordinated global investment and an…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Reflecting on WAO’s digital support of charities during the Catalyst Continuation programme Image: <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/uL99eb3GCa0">Clay&nbsp;LeConey</a><blockquote>“Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.” (Winston Churchill)</blockquote><p>A couple of months ago, we <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/all-good-things-come-to-an-end-e3d21a93da49">announced</a> that we’d been asked to help eight charities with some digital support through Catalyst’s ‘Continuation ‘programme. This has now come to an end, so we thought we’d wrap up what happened and what we learned from the&nbsp;process.</p><p>First of all, we tracked everything we did. This was vital not only to account for our time but also to co-ordinate with one another and fairly distribute our support amongst our eight charities. Doug and Laura collaborated to provide advice and support over the course of the programme.</p><p>The work being done by charities was diverse and different, and we didn’t have a lot of time to plan what kind of support we were going to offer. As our eight charities were in different places, we needed a plan that would be quite flexible. Consequently, we decided to run weekly office hours in which charities could randomly show up, meet whomever else happened to have shown up and ask questions or just chat. In addition, we offered weekly 1:1 sessions for each&nbsp;charity.</p><p>Our digital support was optional, which meant that some charities used their full allocation of time, whereas others touched in occasionally or used us as accountability partners.</p><p>From <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> training to <a href="https://typeform.com">Typeform</a> remixing, advice on SSL certs and hosting packages to analytics, GDPR, CRMs or discovering if a particular tool had its own API, over the ten weeks, we helped charities with a wide range of technical issues.</p><blockquote>I don’t believe we would have been as effective or achieved as much in this phase without the help, support and direction of the you as our Digital Mentors. (Christine Brown, Ideal For&nbsp;All)</blockquote><p>We also gave advice on community engagement, peer to peer learning, architectures of participation, user testing, UX and many other socio-technological phenomena. All of this kind of consultancy can only happen by understanding the wider context a charity is working in, so we are pleased that our participation in previous Catalyst programmes had given us that insight and understanding.</p><blockquote>Really appreciate everything you’ve taught us and that goes for the rest of the team too. (Lindsay Woodward, CFF)</blockquote><p>We’re so proud to have had the opportunity to work with such a wonderful group of charities and human beings. As we wrapped up our participation in the Catalyst Continuation programme, we made sure to let our charities know that they are always welcome to reach out and share with us what they’ve been working on. After all, the relationships don’t end just because the beginning does!</p><blockquote>We Are Open were as clever as they were time efficient, a valuable resource throughout. (Kat Lewis, The Margate&nbsp;Bookie)</blockquote> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-end-of-the-beginning-fad2447f378f">The End of the Beginning</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>We do not have to look back further than the global economic collapse of 2008 to fully understand the worst-case scenario of unverified legal entities engaging in financial transactions. The LEI was created at the request of the G20 and Financial Stability Board (FSB) in response to this global catastrophe. Its objective is to provide a means to uniquely identify any legally distinct entity that engages in a transaction and subsequently reduce fraud and mitigate risk within the ecosystem. </p>
<p>With the LEI’s origin and objective in mind, it follows naturally that it offers potentially immeasurable value too when it comes to delivering transparency and trust in payment transactions. This value is widely recognized among many payment industry insiders, and in recent years, there has been burgeoning appetite and advocacy for LEI usage in a broad range of payments use cases. There has been significant industry-wide progress with two concrete mandates for LEI usage recently emanating from the Reserve Bank of India and the Bank of England in specific payment applications. Additionally, many regions and regulators are consulting on transformation within the ecosystem, and considering what role the LEI could play as a result. Since early 2020, GLEIF has shared information with regulatory authorities and organizations in the payments space on the LEI and its credentials in identity management via nine public consultations. Many more are anticipated in the years ahead.   </p>
<p>Below is a summary of key recent developments within the payments’ arena, which demonstrate widening acceptance of the LEI as a tool capable of delivering an enhanced global payments ecosystem.    </p>
<p>Mandate: LEI for Large Value Transactions </p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has introduced a new mandate for the use of the LEI for all payment transactions of the value ₹50 crore (approximately €5.5 million) and above for entities using the Reserve Bank-run Centralized Payment Systems viz. Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT). By 1 April 2021, banks had to ensure that all remitter and beneficiary information in RTGS and NEFT payment messages were populated with the LEI. Data showed that in Q1 2021, India was ranked fifth in terms of the jurisdictions with the highest rate of LEI growth. This offers an indication of the mandate’s impact on LEI issuance.   </p>
<p>A strong proponent for the LEI, the RBI had earlier introduced it as a requirement in over the counter (OTC) derivative and non-derivative markets and large corporate borrowers.</p>
<p>The RBI’s use of the LEI to verify the identity of participants in large value transactions is the first use case of its kind. Yet the potential risk management advantages it offers make it a compelling tactic that other central banks may wish to consider adopting.   </p>
<p>Mandate: LEI in CHAPS Payments Message Standard (ISO 20022)  </p>
<p>In December 2020, The Bank of England (BoE) published its ‘Policy Statement: Implementing ISO 20022 Enhanced data in CHAPS’. Within the document, the BoE reaffirms its proactive position “to support the wider uptake of the LEI - beyond the financial sector - to corporates. […] the Bank believes wider uptake of the LEI could unlock a number of key benefits and is working with Government and national and international stakeholders to promote LEI use cases. These include their potential role in enhancing cross-border payments as part of the Financial Stability Board’s roadmap, as well as the role the LEI can play to help tackle financial crime.”</p>
<p>The paper confirms the BoE’s long-held intention to “introduce the LEI into the CHAPS payment message standard when migrating to ISO 20022, in line with industry views and international consensus, including HVPSplus and CBPRplus guidance.”</p>
<p>It then sets out the following initial phasing timeline:  </p>
 
 February 2023: LEIs will be introduced into ISO 20022 standard CHAPS payment messages on an ‘optional to send’ basis. While the BoE encourages all CHAPS Direct Participants to start using LEIs as early as possible, it will not become mandatory until spring 2024.  
 Spring 2024: The BoE will begin mandating LEIs to be used in by certain circumstances, with a vision to widen out the requirement to all participants over time. The BoE will mandate the use of the LEI where the payment involves a transfer of funds between Financial Institutions.  
 
<p>Within the report the BoE notes that the earlier firms adopt the LEI, the sooner they will derive its benefits. It also states an intention for the BoE to monitor the use of LEI for all transactions, with a view to assessing whether the mandatory requirement to include LEI data should be extended to all CHAPS payments. Industry will be provided with at least 18 months’ advance notice if the BoE extends any mandatory LEI requirements. </p>
<p>Consultation: Cross Border Payments </p>
<p>In February this year, GLEIF published a blog exploring the FSB’s support for the LEI in its Stage 3 roadmap on Enhancing Cross-Border Payments. In that publication, the FSB lists several focus areas that require global coordination and action to overcome the challenges and frictions in cross-border payments. Of particular note is the identification of ‘Establish Unique Identifiers with proxy registries’ as a key building block in the FSB’s roadmap to enhanced cross-border payments. </p>
<p>An action-oriented framework is laid out in the roadmap, which commits the FSB and GLEIF to collaborate in consultation with other prominent stakeholders to: “explore the scope for, and obstacles to develop, a global Unique Identifier (UI) for cross border payments and potentially other financial transactions, that takes into account existing identifiers including the LEI for legal entities….” This collaborative work effort is scheduled to run from October 2020 until December 2021 and GLEIF welcomes the opportunity to engage with it.</p>
<p>Additionally, as a further action mapped to the same ‘Establishing Unique Identifiers…’ building block, GLEIF will work in close coordination with the FSB, the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) and national authorities to explore options for improving LEI adoption. This work effort will run from June 2021 to June 2022.</p>
<p>Reassuringly, the FSB roadmap makes the association between an enhanced payments ecosystem and legal entity identification. For cross-border payments, the ability for identity verification to happen across borders is critical and this is why the LEI is perfectly poised to provide a solution. Its universality makes it the perfect candidate for bestowing transparency in relation to entity identification across the global payments landscape.  </p>
<p>Consultation: Instant Payments </p>
<p>In March 2021, the European Commission (EC) published its Consultation Strategy on Instant Payments in the EU. The purpose of the consultation is to identify obstacles to the creation of efficient pan-European instant payment solutions, to assess the effectiveness of potential solutions and to measure the potential benefits and costs of those solutions. The first part of this consultation involves surveying payment service providers (PSPs) and providers of supporting technical services. Of relevance to the LEI are the questions regarding sanctions screening. The survey asks whether there is a need for alleviated screening of transactions by PSPs involving clients vetted or whitelisted beforehand, or if a common EU-wide list of false hits and/or the use of the LEI for firms and digital IDs for individuals could solve any sanctions screening-related issue that instant payments may create. </p>
<p>GLEIF welcomes the EC’s consideration of the LEI as a potential solution to support the screening of instant payment transactions against sanction and watch lists and has a keen interest in the outcome of the survey. </p>
<p>The ‘LEI Lightbulb Blog Series’ from GLEIF aims to shine a light on the breadth of acceptance and advocacy for the LEI across the public and private sectors, geographies and use cases by highlighting which industry leaders, authorities and organizations are supportive of the LEI and for what purpose. By demonstrating how success derived from strong regulatory roots is giving rise to a ground swell of champions for further LEI regulation and voluntary LEI adoption across new and emerging applications, GLEIF hopes to educate on both the current and future potential value that ‘one global identity’ can deliver for businesses, regardless of sector, world-wide. </p>

<p>By Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director &amp; CMO, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Leaders from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and IBM met with President Joe Biden at the White House last week to discuss strategies the government and private sector can use together to improve the nation’s cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the meeting, Amazon announced that it will provide eligible AWS customers with access to free FIDO Security Keys. Not only will this protect the burgeoning number of businesses that run on AWS, but it will help instill better authentication practices as these keys can be used across many other business (e.g., G Suite, Github, Dropbox, Stripe) and consumer (Facebook, Twitter, Coinbase, Bank of America) services.</p>



<p>Amazon has been a leading stakeholder in FIDO Alliance for several years now – it is wonderful to see their leadership extended to the market at large. As more businesses move to the cloud, it is absolutely critical that cloud service providers follow suit to protect this critical infrastructure. Threats and attackers are growing in sophistication, and the impacts are non-trivial. Hundreds of millions of personal records are being stolen and resold on the dark web on an alarmingly regular basis. This is a clear and present threat to our economy, our national security and our society.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to name a breach from the past five years that wasn’t tied to stolen credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest prominent attack, which was carried out on Colonial Pipeline, used <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/colonial-pipeline-ceo-tells-senate-cyber-defenses-were-compromised-ahead-hack-2021-06-08/">a single stolen password</a> to essentially cripple the U.S eastern seaboard.</p>



<p>It is important that all businesses take steps to educate and protect their employees and customers from such threats. “Traditional” means of multi-factor authentication (such as OTPs) simply aren’t fit-for-purpose to protect against these attacks, which can financially cripple a company or organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, credential-based breaches (like Colonial Pipeline’s) wouldn’t be possible if accounts were protected with FIDO Authentication, which requires local possession of a device with no knowledge-based authentication credentials passed over the network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance has come a long way since our inception. What started as a whiteboard concept has evolved into technology that is becoming part of the web’s DNA. Virtually every platform and device can now support FIDO Authentication, and there are public SDKs and tools, plus a rich ecosystem of FIDO Certified vendor products and services that can help companies implement FIDO for their sites and apps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amazon’s move to provide free FIDO Security Keys sets a strong – and important – example. We encourage all other cloud service providers to urgently consider following suit by at a minimum enabling FIDO authenticators for admin access to networks.</p>

<p>What has your career journey looked like?</p>



<p>It has not been what I would call a straight line. I started out in accounting and financial services before I transitioned to what I call my second career, marketing. I will say that every discipline and role I have had has allowed me to gain a wide selection of experiences and expertises. These have ultimately made me a more well-rounded marketer that views my role and responsibilities from a wider business perspective.</p>



<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?</p>



<p>I wanted to be a backup dancer for Janet Jackson. I was a competitive dancer and I wanted to make dance my career, however dance is unforgiving on the body and ultimately only a very small few make it to that level :)</p>



<p><br></p>
 
 
 


<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>Imposter Syndrome. For me, I have had to fight through the “I don’t belong at this table” feeling, both from self doubt but also from men in the room who have made the environment one where I have not felt like I belong. On average, I have learnt to overcome this and to let my skills and experience speak for themselves.</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>This has been a challenge for most of my career, however over the past few years I have learned to find balance. I have carved out time to do the things I enjoy such as travelling, road riding, golf, and photography. It is not always easy or practical (depending on your role) to be able to turn things off, from a work perspective, at 5 or 6 pm but I do believe that you have to create a division between work and state. When I am hanging out with my family and friends I try to be present and in the moment and when I am working I am fully committed and engaged in my work and my team.</p>



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?</p>



<p>I think introducing girls into STEM at an early age is a great way to get them comfortable and inspired with the disciplines. Early exposure and education to the tech space is key so that girls can see that these disciplines are not just for boys and that anyone can do it.</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>A couple of things (1) You should have a deliberate plan with regards to how you intend to advance in your career. For some this may come easily without much forethought, but for many of us being purposeful helps to provide a roadmap to our goals. (2) Don’t be afraid to highlight your achievements. For women especially, this tends to go against the way we are hardwired. However, if you don’t take control of your career, you can not expect others to and finally (3) Find an advocate, not a mentor, but someone that you can confide in, get advice from and who knows your abilities and will campaign for you as you move through your career.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?</p>



<p>As far as we think we have progressed, with regards to women breaking the glass ceiling, in many respects it still is one step forward two steps back. You will know they have overcome the biggest challenge when they are described as tech professionals and not prefaced as women in tech.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Be curious, never stop learning, and be bold.</p>

<p>Early this month we were hosted by our good friends at <a href="https://www.marsh.com/nz/home.html?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">Marsh New Zealand</a> to run a joint Connect event with <a href="https://fintechnz.org.nz/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">FinTechNZ</a> on Digital and Cyber Risk.&nbsp; Overall, we see cyber security as one of three key elements, alongside identity and privacy which in combination make up Digital Trust – providing the confidence needed for people, technology and processes to create a truly safe and effective digital world. &nbsp;</p>



  
<p>The world has seen an unprecedented rise in cyber security incidents since the beginning of 2020 – a trend which is shaking up everything we thought we knew about prevention and management of this insidious risk.</p>
  



<p>We had four insightful presentations, given by Jono Soo (<a href="https://www.marsh.com/nz/services/cyber-risk.html?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">Marsh NZ</a>), Jonathon Berry (<a href="https://www.inphysecsecurity.com/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">InPhySec</a>), Andy Prow (<a href="https://www.redshield.co/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">Red Shield</a>) and Paul Platen (<a href="https://www.sss.co.nz/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">SSS</a>) which provided a deep-dive into what has been going on in the world of cyber security and insurance over the past 12 months, how this has impacted on businesses in all sectors both globally as well as in New Zealand, and what we might expect looking forward.</p>



<p>Their presentations can be found <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2021/08/Digital-and-Cyber-Risk-Beyond-2020.pdf?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">here.</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>The key take homes for me were:</p>



<p>More human interactivity now happens at the digital layer rather than the human layer (according to the CIA!) The frequency and severity of ransomware attacks continues to climb, therefore cyber security insurance premiums are going up quickly too and are going to be tougher to acquire. <a href="https://www.cert.govt.nz/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">CERT NZ</a> is a great place to get a whole host of cyber security info.&nbsp; However, when NZ CERT was set up it was given a budget of only $22m for 4 years. The NZ Defense Force spends around 4bn per annum i.e. the comparison between what is spent to protect ourselves physically vs what is spent to protect us digitally is stark. We need to take the protection of the digital realm much, much more seriously and orders of magnitude and more resources need to be focused here. &nbsp; </p>

<p>JADN v1.0 is ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that Specification for JSON Abstract Data Notation Version 1.0 from the OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) is an information modeling language. It has several purposes including defining data structures, validating data instances, informing user interfaces working with structured data, and facilitating protocol internationalization. JADN specifications consist of two parts: abstract type definitions that are independent of data format, and serialization rules that define how to represent type instances using specific data formats. A JADN schema is itself a structured information object that can be serialized and transferred between applications, documented in multiple formats such as text-based interface definition languages, property tables or diagrams, and translated into concrete schemas used to validate specific data formats.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>

 New OpenID Foundation draft enables secure and privacy protected webhooks to power an “API-First” world 
 Author: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tulshi/">Atul Tulshibagwale</a> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>APIs are an increasingly important aspect of software today, and “API-First” is the mantra being followed in a lot of new software development. A critical aspect of efficient APIs is their ability to notify callers of changes relating to something the caller is interested in. Such mechanisms are often referred to as “Webhooks”, sometimes as “Callbacks”. Webhooks in most APIs are proprietary implementations, although API standards such as <a href="https://aip.dev/">aip.dev</a> and <a href="https://swagger.io/specification/">Open API</a> have specified mechanisms such as “<a href="https://github.com/googleapis/api-common-protos/blob/master/google/longrunning/operations.proto">Long Running Operations</a>” and “<a href="https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#callback-object">Callbacks</a>” respectively. In both these standards, the Webhook mechanism is specific to resources recently operated upon by the API client, and so is limited in its scope.</p>
 The Shared Signals and Events Framework 
<p>The OpenID Foundation formed the “<a href="https://openid.net/wg/sse/">Shared Signals and Events</a>” (SSE) Working Group as a combination of the previous OpenID RISC working group and an informal industry group that was focused on standardizing <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/re-thinking-federated-identity-with-the-continuous-access-evaluation-protocol">Google’s CAEP proposal</a>. These represented two distinct applications of the same underlying mechanism of managing asynchronous streams of events. Therefore the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0-01.html">SSE Framework</a> is now proposed to be a standard for managing such streams of events for any application, not just CAEP and RISC. In effect, it is a standard for generalized Webhooks.</p>
<p>The SSE Framework defines stream-based communication mechanisms between Transmitters that generate events and Receivers that consume them. It defines an Event Stream Management API for obtaining the Transmitter configuration: Which events it supports, how they can be verified, and where it sends them to the receiver. Note that since this call to get the Transmitter configuration can also be authorized using OAuth, a Transmitter may decide based on which Receiver is requesting the configuration, which events it would support for that Receiver. The Receiver can specify the URL at which it wishes to receive the events, and the types of events it is interested in receiving. It also provides mechanisms for adding or removing subjects about which events should be included in the stream, and for pausing, starting and stopping the stream. The actual events are delivered using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8417">Security Event Tokens</a> (SETs), which are potentially signed JSON objects. The delivery mechanisms are defined using IETF draft specifications for <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-secevent-http-push-10">SET Push</a> or <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-secevent-http-poll">Poll</a>.</p>
<p>In combination with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749">OAuth</a>, which can be used to authorize calls between the Receiver and the Transmitter, this SSE Framework provides a comprehensive mechanism for implementing secure, privacy protected webhooks.</p>
 How It Works 
<p>Many internet services today have a “multi-tenanted” architecture, which means that each service hosts a number of independent customers within their infrastructure. Using SSE, streams may be managed using host-level authorization or tenant level authorization. Using host-level authorization requires the Transmitter to trust the Receiver highly, such that intentional or unintentional action from the Receiver does not leak data about a tenant to the Receiver. For example, if a Receiver uses host-level authorization to enable the stream for a customer that hasn’t authorized it, the Receiver will start receiving events for the customer without their knowledge.</p>
<p>It is therefore safer to use tenant level authorization, where the tenant administrator can authorize such management actions. This method is described below:</p>
 Setting up a Stream 
<p>The following example describes how an administrator authorization may be used to start a stream:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Adding a Subject 
<p>A Subject Principal in SSE can be a user, device, application or even a session. A subject can also be an aggregate subject like an OU, group or tenant. A Receiver can explicitly add or remove subjects in a stream. A stream will contain events only about subjects that are explicitly or implicitly included in the stream. In some cases, it makes sense to implicitly include all applicable subjects to a stream (for example, if events being exchanged are about the security of the subject). In other cases, a subject may explicitly authorize the use of their information in a stream, providing privacy protection (for example, if a user’s location needs to be shared). In the explicit case, the following steps can be taken to authorize the inclusion of events regarding a user subject in the stream:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Removing a Subject 
<p>The SSE Event Stream Management API also supports removing subjects, whether or not they were explicitly added. The flow to remove a subject is the same as the “add subject” flow described above.</p>
 Other Features 
<p>The SSE Framework also defines ways for both Receivers and Transmitters to enable, disable and pause streams. It also defines a mechanism for Receivers to verify the stream is active, which could be used as a “heartbeat” mechanism.</p>
 Current Status and Call to Action 
<p>The SSE Framework draft has been adopted as an Implementer’s Draft by the OpenID Foundation. This is a great time to begin implementations based on this specification. In your APIs, consider adding the webhook capability using the SSE Framework instead of a proprietary way of providing such functionality.</p>

<p>Hi. My name is Anne Hilliger and I am the new intern at <a href="http://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a>. Not only am I new but also the first ever intern at WAO which means I’m also their guinea pig for a possible future intern&nbsp;program.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@solomac?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Adam Solomon</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/hello?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>As a little taste of what makes me me here are some randomly collected facts about me: I am crazy for bike riding (nice gravel rides with coffee breaks and a good amount of icecream are just the best), the first half of this year I spend living and studying in Lapland in the same town where also Santa lives (Rovaniemi and yes I met him, twice), I live in a flat with 5 other adults and two incredibly cute kids (not mine though), I am definitely a cat person and if somebody would give me a basket full of kitties I would happily say&nbsp;yes.</p><p>I am studying cultural and media education at a small university in central/eastern Germany called <a href="https://www.hs-merseburg.de/">Hochschule Merseburg</a>. In the current semester it is time to do your mandatory internship and like my last name might tell, I know Laura Hilliger and have always been very interested in what she tells me about her work. Therefore I thought this internship might be a perfect opportunity to learn more about what WAO is doing, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/about-us/">who her colleagues are</a> and what it is like to work on projects with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Another incentive that made me want to work with WAO is that my curriculum at the university is rather focused on teaching kids and teenagers, mostly in face to face, school or kindergarten settings. This is also fun and interesting but in my world media education is even more than that. To have the opportunity to work with people who are specialized in teaching and learning in mostly online environments, who developed interesting and innovative tools and who know how to work with companies, charities or other collaborators, is going to teach me so many cool things! I am really looking forward to&nbsp;that.</p>one project I worked at in 2016: creating a virtual dinosaur museum in minecraft (CC BY-NC-SA&nbsp;4.0)<p>After receiving a very warm welcome I am now in my fourth week already, the onboarding is in full speed and I am learning a lot about the projects, the processes and of course the philosophy of openness. I worked myself through the email courses they developed (<a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/">please go and check them out if you haven’t, they are great!</a>), and I got particularly caught up with the topic of working openly because this is something I never really did before and it is as exciting as it is challenging.</p><p>I am coming from an understanding of work that is very conservative and heteronormative due to the capitalistic structures I grew up in. Therefore I find it challenging to actually pursue the approach of openness. In theory I understand the principles, but what does it actually mean? You have to unlearn quite some patterns. I for example noticed that in order to ask questions not only to Laura (who is a confidant) but into the channel where everybody from the Co-op can read it, I have to jump over my own shadow a lot (a German expression that means to overcome yourself). I am still thinking in the pattern of “Am I allowed to do that?”, “Aren’t the others too important/busy to listen to what I have to say?”, “I am only the intern”. I am really looking forward to jumping over my own shadow for this more often and starting to integrate the philosophy of openness into my understanding of how work can also be&nbsp;like.</p>And this is me, very much frozen in Lapland (CC BY-NC-SA&nbsp;4.0) <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/hello-world-6b5c8caed8db">Hello world!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation announced recently a new mechanism for rewarding and funding work in the common interest of its membership, the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/introducing-dif-grants/">DIF Grants Program</a>. The Steering Committee ratified an addendum defining these collaborations between a specific DIF working group and a grant sponsor, and this shiny new tool sits ready to be debuted in the toolkit available to DIF community work. DIF’s work is leveling up with this new mechanism for transparently funding work that supports DIF’s mission and benefits the membership as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>The first such grant was initiated by Microsoft, which has a long history of collaborations in DIF. Of the various modalities described by the grant program, The Claims and Credentials Working Group will be overseeing a new work item open to all DIF members that creates and harden a JWS test suite, with this grant funding a lead editor to drive the work and keep it to a pre-determined timeline, paid upon stable and complete&nbsp;release.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@natasyachen">Natasya&nbsp;Chen</a> History <p>Pamela Dingle, co-chair of the Interoperability WG, identified a recurring theme in conversations about interoperability across the great “JSON”/”JSON-LD” divide: while considerable cross-vendor, cross-stack alignment had happened over the last years to address many other aspects of credential exchange and identifier resolution, “translation issues” and varying interpretations of the JSON sections of the VC data model specification lead to divergent ways of structuring, defining, signing, and parsing VCs in JWT form. The kinds of signature suite definitions that define Linked Data Proofs made strange bedfellows with the in-built mechanisms of JWT, which were hardened and commoditized earlier. This results in a slightly “balkanized” landscape of VC-JWTs that make different concessions to the expectations of JSON-LD-native parsers and&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Initially, the idea of iterating one or more foundational specifications seemed a natural solution: a few key sections of any specification could be made more explicit, more normative, or less ambiguous. But just as the plural of anecdote is not data, so too is the plural of specifications not disambiguation. Another tack was chosen: implementers of the existing specification would come together and compare their running code to identify every difference and incompatibility, defining a test suite that interpreted the current specification. They might still produce a list of changes they would like to see in a future specification, and that list might contain some contentious items that take a long time to align. But in the meantime, they would have a practical roadmap to alignment and a benchmark for conformance to drive interoperability amongst each other and clarity for external interoperability.</p> A signature suite that spans two&nbsp;worlds <p>The specification under test in this new work item is <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">Json Web Signature 2020 </a>(“JWS2020” for short), a CCG signature suite that defines how the signature mechanisms and data structures native to “detached signature” JWS tokens can be parsed as <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a>. The signature mechanisms of the <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/jwt-jws-and-jwe-for-not-so-dummies-b63310d201a3">JWT world</a> and the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Feb/att-0130/VerifiableTrustStandards.png">LDP world</a> are quite different– bridging them requires a deep understanding of both: differing security models, canonization and serialization complexities, explicit reliance on <a href="https://www.iana.org/protocols">IANA registries</a>, <a href="https://json-ld.github.io/rdf-dataset-canonicalization/spec/">URDNA dataset normalization</a>, and the like. Advanced topics, even for this&nbsp;blog!</p><p>Understanding such a specification on a deep intellectual level and understanding its design decisions requires a firm grasp on all these complexities spanning two very different engineering traditions. Implementing the specification, however, should not; to be blunt, our community cannot afford such understanding gating off successful implementation, particularly if industrial adoption of decentralized identity is a shared goal. Before the specification gets iterated, it needs to be testable, and even more implementable than it already&nbsp;is.</p><p>This is where a test suite offers pedagogical tool for first-time implementers, as well as a negotiation tool for seasoned veterans and large corporations managing vast roadmaps and production development pipelines. While many DIF members do not encode VCs in JWT form, this grant is clearly in the common interest because mainstream adoption will indisputably benefit from a clearer, more explicitly-defined, and definitively-testable “normative VC-JWT”.</p> Selection Process <p>From 26 July 2021 to 9 August 2021, the chairs fielded applications through a google <a href="https://forms.gle/hPCNWaAQZpLFZyXd7">form</a>, and submitted all valid application to <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/claims-credentials/tree/main/grants/grant_1/applications">github</a> for posterity. The selection criteria for the work item lead is as&nbsp;follows:</p>  familiarity with JWS mechanics and common JOSE libraries/best-practices  experience with automated testing, vector design, and test scripts/suites  familiarity with LD Proofs and signature suites generally  familiarity with JSON/JSON-LD interop problems, at the semantic, signature-verification, and representation/parsing levels   Grantee Announcement <p>On 12 August 2021, The Claims &amp; Credential (C&amp;C) Working Group at DIF gladly announced Transmute Industries as the recipient of the first DIF Grant to provide a JWS Test Suite for Verifiable Credentials. One of the chairs, Martin Riedel, summarized the chairs’ decision thusly:Transmute has been a thought leader in the SSI space for years and uniquely fits the requirement profile laid out in the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/dif-grant-1-jws-test-suite/">Grant announcement</a>.</p>  Orie Steele, the CTO of Transmute, is the initiating author of, lead editor of, and main contributor to <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">the (LD-) JSON Web Signature 2020</a>.  Transmute has a strong background in TDD and is a strong proponent of delivering test vectors with specifications in order to achieve greater implementation-level interoperability. Examples include Test Vectors in <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/sidetree.js/tree/main/packages/test-vectors">Sidetree.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/did-key.js/tree/main/packages/did-key-test-vectors">did-key.js</a>.  The company already provides integrated libraries to support (LDS)-VC and JWT-VC side-by-side, demonstrating their familiarity with both representations. See&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/verifiable-data/blob/c61c2eeff859a902cfbaf375424b3b5cfa519ea6/packages/vc.js/README.md">vc.js</a>.  Lastly, Transmute has a strong track record of making specifications and libraries accessible to the general public in a variety of deployed web-projects (<a href="https://did.key.transmute.industries/">https://did.key.transmute.industries/</a>, <a href="https://wallet.interop.transmute.world/">https://wallet.interop.transmute.world/</a> and&nbsp;others…)  <p>Therefore we regard Transmute Industries as the ideal candidate to provide a comprehensive JWS test suite for LDS-VC and JWT-VC and support the community interactions around this project within DIF’s C&amp;C&nbsp;Group.</p> Next Steps <p>The new work item will be announced and regular meetings initiated at the 23 August meeting of C&amp;C– if you are interested in participating, please attend and/or drop a note in the C&amp;C slack&nbsp;channel.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-grant-1-jws-test-suite-a26cc4a95540">DIF Grant #1: JWS Test Suite</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>NFTs let anyone proveably own a unique digital property. This technology is revolutionizing <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/dapper-labs-nba-top-shot-has-crossed-the-million-user-mark">collectibles</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million">digital art</a>, <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/to-infinity-and-beyond-the-growth-of-axie-infinity/">gaming</a>, <a href="https://ff.mirror.xyz/3FKwvkwAPltEdhe4pWnL8RX7TNruwNNZcFAqNn92tUs">media</a>, and even <a href="https://twitter.com/paulkhls/status/1427724533713326082">science</a>. However, to date, the type of property that could be managed through NFTs has been limited to constant, static, hardcoded properties. This is great for art, collectibles, and other use cases where immutability is a feature. </p><p>Most types of property benefit from evolution, mutability, or gamification. Together, Ceramic and Chainlink give creators the tools to create more dynamic NFT experiences. Ceramic allows for hosting more flexible forms of content, while Chainlink can supply external inputs that change and gamify NFTs, creating what’s called dynamic NFTs. </p><p>With these new tools, NFT-based experiences can expand to include:</p>  Evolving art and collectibles, changed by the original creator, current owner, or new data like the weather  Collectible packs of NFTs with special edition traits randomly chosen upon opening  Property that gains value from each owner depending on how they use it, like an in-game item that keeps its own history of how it’s used in gameplay  Ownership rights that let the current NFT holder change the content associated to the NFT, for example for land parcels in AR, VR, or games  <p>“When you buy a physical piece of land, the house doesn’t disappear. There’s a foundation there,” says Geo Web founder Graven Prest. “We need to replicate that for NFTs in the digital world.”</p><p>CERAMIC is a sovereign data network for creating, storing and sharing data under the direct control of any identity. Because data in Ceramic is mutable, and only by the controller of that data object, it provides not only a fully decentralized option to store NFT content and metadata but the first way to attach dynamic content to an NFT, with strict permissions and access control rights. Because Ceramic has a cross-chain identity system built-in, this can be deployed easily for any blockchain. </p><p>There are two ways to use this in NFT experiences. First, Ceramic streams can be updated only by the original creator. This would let artists sell NFTs and then update and enhance their work over time. The history is preserved, so this mutability is purely a gain. Athletes could sell NFTs that evolve as their stats do. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork/status/1428371493407371265">NFT:DID</a>, a recently released feature in Ceramic, allows the current owner of an NFT exclusive rights to update content. For example, Geo Web is using Ceramic to store content displayed in their AR metaverse. The owner of each parcel of land, represented by an NFT, can change the content being displayed. This could be used for owner-only logbooks, storing critical metadata or permissions, profile pics with changeable attire, collective playlist creation, or more. &nbsp;</p><p>CHAINLINK provides more dynamic ownership models for NFT experiences based on reliable external data feeds and trust-minimized off-chain computations. Most notably, Chainlink <a href="https://chain.link/solutions/chainlink-vrf">Verifiable Random Function (VRF)</a> generates a tamper-proof and auditable source of randomness, which users can reference to offer fair drops of limited edition NFTs, evolve NFTs over time via pure entropy, and retain rarity odds in NFT distribution models.</p><p>Given the historical security and reliability of Chainlink VRF, we recommend that any developer launching NFTs on Ceramic and needing randomness to use Chainlink VRF. Ultimately, this will help them create a more exciting, transparent, and fraud-proof user experience, as well as help gamify NFTs by enabling them to change over time.</p> <p>About Chainlink</p><p>Chainlink is the industry standard oracle network for powering hybrid smart contracts. Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Networks provide developers with the largest collection of high-quality data sources and secure off-chain computations to expand the capabilities of smart contracts on any blockchain. Managed by a global, decentralized community, Chainlink currently secures billions of dollars in value for smart contracts across decentralized finance (DeFi), insurance, gaming, and other major industries.<br></p><p>Chainlink is trusted by hundreds of organizations, from global enterprises to projects at the forefront of the blockchain economy, to deliver definitive truth via secure, reliable oracle networks.

 Equity, innovation, and community gardens Image by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/dUsmF-F-bJg">dylan&nbsp;nolte</a><p>Imagine a community garden with abundant fruit and vegetables for anyone to come and pick and consume. Now imagine a factory creating standardised parts to be used by manufacturers. The two metaphors feel quite different, don’t&nbsp;they?</p><p>The first, the garden metaphor, feels welcoming. You can envisage suggestions being made about which fruit and vegetables to grow to meet the needs of the community. And it feels natural that people would be able to opt-in to come and work in the garden for the benefit of&nbsp;all.</p><p>The second, the factory metaphor, feels less welcoming. In fact, unless you’re an employee of the factory, or have been sanctioned for entry, then you don’t get to see how the standardised parts are made. And if you’re not a manufacturer, then why would you get a say in how they’re&nbsp;made?</p><p>Metaphors are imperfect tools for thought but do help us grasp at deeply-held assumptions about how groups of people should interact with one another. In WAO’s work with various organisations, we’ve found the garden metaphor comes up time and time again as one to strive towards. Too often, though, organisations treat people as ‘consumers’ within a ‘market’ — rather than community members within an ecosystem.</p><p>Standards are extremely important to our everyday modern lifestyles. They’re the reason that devices don’t explode when you plug them into electrical outlets; they’re the reason that you can go to shops and buy clothes and shoes that fit; they’re the reason you can visit any website using any web&nbsp;browser.</p><p>It’s important that experts help develop standards. For example, we want people who know a lot about electrical engineering designing standards for electrical outlets. But it’s no good having standards that no-one uses, or that they use begrudgingly. That’s why it’s crucial to have end-user input into standards development.</p><p>Different types of standards, of course, require different levels of input. If we’re talking about electrical wall sockets, there’s a level of mandating that applies: in this country, if you want to plug things in, it works like this. But when it comes to things that are international and have to work in a variety of contexts, then it’s important that standards aren’t limited to only what a small group of people are familiar&nbsp;with.</p><p>For people who have never really worked openly, who have always interacted within the confines of closed working groups (with people who look and talk a lot like them, come from similar backgrounds, and want similar things in life) end-user requests might come as a bit of a shock. Insiders might describe these requests as ‘unhelpful’ or dismiss the people themselves as ‘not understanding the bigger picture’.</p><p>The reason that the <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2021/08/02/open-badges-3-0/">recent IMS debacle</a> has rankled the Open Badges community so much is because of the stark contrast between the way that the standard was developed by Mozilla, compared to the way it is being stewarded by IMS. The only reason that the community have any insight into the development process, which is closed off to paying members, is because of a requirement from Mozilla that IMS retain an open repository.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/IMSGlobal/openbadges-specification/pull/303#issuecomment-890346719">At that repository</a>, Kerri Lemoie has submitted a proposal to align Open Badges with the W3C standard for Verifiable Credentials. Unlike IMS working groups, anyone can turn up for W3C calls — as a number of Open Badges community members have done. The opposition to Kerri’s proposal by a faction of IMS members has not been explained clearly and much of the discussion is happening behind closed&nbsp;doors.</p><p>This is not how open standards should be developed. It might take time to develop standards in the open. You may have to deal with people different to you and that you don’t particularly understand or like. It’s also possible that you have to consider use cases outside your own experience. But in the end, bringing a wealth of diversity and experience to the table is the exact thing that brought Open Badges its initial&nbsp;success.</p><p>Western capitalist society conditions us to understand openness as a danger. However, as the Open Badges community (and indeed other Open Source communities) have shown time and time again, openness leads to innovation. We’re all here to help make standards better — for everyone, everywhere.</p><p>Returning to the factory metaphor, consumers don’t usually have a direct say in what is produced by manufacturers. That is in contrast to the community garden, where even those people who are unable to work the land can have a say in what is grown. Openness leads to&nbsp;equity.</p><p>Open standards should be developed openly because not enough people work to ensure that equity is central to innovation and development. We believe that openness is an attitude, and one which bears fruit over time from which everyone can&nbsp;benefit.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-standards-should-be-developed-openly-1f0cf552308d">Open standards should be developed openly</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of the CREA?</p>



<p>Our mission is to support REALTORS® in service to their clients through the provision of services and standards that enrich the REALTOR® profession and reputation and to advocate for public policy that ensures Canadians can fulfill their home and property rights and aspirations. Our vision is that REALTORS® are the chosen, trusted and respected professionals for consumer real estate needs.</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>As technology continues to develop and touch all aspects of life, it’s more important than ever to create secure proof of identity and authentication in the digital space that enables individuals, organizations and governments to have confidence in their digital interactions. Ultimately, digital identity is critical to ensure people can trust the services they receive online and help reduce occurrences of cyber fraud that can erode this trust.</p>
 



 
<a href="https://www.crea.ca/"></a>



<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digital identity is quickly becoming a key feature in the 21st century economy as innovation and economic growth is, for the most part, happening online. Developing a strong digital identity framework in Canada will help build global trust and could lead to increased capacity for international collaboration in many different sectors.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada’s forward thinking and focus on the protection of personal information provides it with the unique opportunity to become a leader in the development and adoption of digital identity and authentication technologies. As technology companies continue to choose Canada as the destination to develop their products and services, Canada is well-positioned to be a strong international voice in this space.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>As the real estate industry continues to shift online and adopt digital tools, the need for trusted digital identity for both REALTORS® and their clients has become essential. CREA joined the DIACC to become a part of the ongoing discussions and valuable work happening on this subject, with the goal of being part of the solution to this important issue.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) is one of Canada’s largest single-industry Associations. Our membership includes more than 135,000 real estate brokers, agents and salespeople, working through 78 real estate Boards and Associations across Canada.</p>

<p>Thanks to Billy Leudtke of <a href="https://www.layer0.ventures/">Layer 0 Ventures</a> for drafting this article. </p><p>The Convo Space is giving Web3 developers an easy way to add comments, content and conversations to their decentralized applications. Now live on Ceramic mainnet, The Convo Space enables content from across applications to be linked to an user’s unique decentralized identity to create a shared, decentralized layer for Web3 conversations. The easy-to-use API abstracts away the complexity of Web3, paving the way for the defragmentation &amp; democratization of the ‘conversation’ layer of the internet.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://theconvo.space/">https://theconvo.space/</a> and get started today!</p> Fragmented social context <p>Today, our conversations are fragmented across applications and platforms. Threads of conversation we have with our friends, family, coworkers and peers flow unconnected across a plethora of mediums such as text message, WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Facebook, Instagram and others, and each context of interaction is tied to a different one of our many application-specific digital identities.</p><p>These silos destroy our continuity online, forcing us to:</p>  Rediscover and reconnect with contacts on each new platform  Carry conversations across platforms, eliminating context  Choose applications based on access to our social graph, rather than purely for the product itself  Relinquish control of our data, including the value it generates  Trust platforms to protect our privacy   <p>Platforms don’t talk, people do. Web3 promises an alternative model, with data, identity and reputation separated from individual applications and easily shared across platforms. This information is always controlled by the users, so they can bring reputation and data along when moving to different applications and interfaces, instead of starting from scratch.</p> The Convo Space: de-platformed conversations <p>The Convo Space is a decentralized conversation protocol with data separated from the application/interface, allowing a unified conversation layer that can work across applications and solve the fragmentation issue. Through this separation, conversations can continue to be generated organically on the incumbent platforms, while The Convo Space unifies that content from across platforms to create a cohesive conversation for the user. &nbsp;</p><p>The team’s first product is a commenting solution similar to a decentralized Disqus. The developer product offers three ways to integrate:</p>  A 1-line integration that embeds an i-frame for an out-of-the-box comments section that can be added to any website  React components to let developers customize their own decentralized comments product  APIs to build a fully custom social experience, without having to worry about all the complexities of Web3  <p>Developers can easily leverage any of the above methods to begin building on the decentralized conversation layer of the internet. And because all the data on The Convo Space is associated with users rather than applications, any application can build on the same conversation graph and content.</p> Built on decentralized content, organized around decentralized identities &nbsp; <p>The Convo Space is intended to be fully decentralized, making sure this key social infrastructure is not confined to, or controlled by, any single app or platform. The solution pulls together the latest decentralized technologies to achieve this, including Ceramic, IPFS, Textile, Pinata, and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). </p><p>Comments are stored in ThreadsDB databases, built by Textile. This content is made available through Pinata’s IPFS-pinning service and backed up to Filecoin to ensure fully decentralized availability and redundancy. </p><p>To complete the solution, the product needed to associate the comment threads with users and give them control of their content. For this, they turned to Ceramic. IDX, the decentralized identity protocol built with Ceramic, gives The Convo Space an easy way to link multiple addresses and disparate digital identities into a single user identity. </p><p>This open, unified data network lays the foundation for rich identities that can be used across platforms. IDX also provides an easy way to associate specific comment threads with a user directly. Says Anudit Nagar, founder of The Convo Space: </p><blockquote>Ceramic truly allows your data to flow and aggregate across multiple different chains - it's truly a one-stop solution for all your storage and access needs, in a truly decentralized manner. That is really future proof.</blockquote><p>The platform lets users aggregate all their social conversations into a single place, under a single identity. This lets developers focus on building new and amazing user experiences and worry less about data management. For users, this means conversational data will never be lost or trapped, locking you into a platform because your contacts and ongoing conversations are there. This bridge between Web2 to Web3 enables users to leverage their existing social communities to create more seamless and flexible experiences. </p> What’s Next for The Convo Space? <p>Today’s solution is just the first step towards an unbundled conversation layer for Web3. &nbsp;The team is actively working on rolling out new features to further improve user engagement and experience. Decentralized governance of the protocol is also in the works, which will allow the community to eventually manage itself and set up standards for content moderation, among other things. The team is also working on a <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> Snap which will allow conversations to live natively in a Metamask wallet.</p><p>The Convo Space is currently onboarding NFT marketplaces, DAO aggregation platforms and others to begin opening the commenting layer of the Web.

 Information about LegalRuleML Core Specification V1.0 



<p>Legal texts, e.g. legislation, regulations, contracts, and case law, are the source of norms, guidelines, and rules that govern societies. As text, it is difficult to label, exchange, and process content except by hand. In our current web-enabled world, where innovative e-government and e-commerce are increasingly the norm, providing machine-processable forms of legal content is crucial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objective of the LegalRuleML Core Specification Version 1.0 is to define a standard (expressed with XML-schema and Relax NG and on the basis of Consumer RuleML 1.02) that is able to represent the particularities of the legal normative rules with a rich, articulated, and meaningful mark-up language. &nbsp;</p>



<p>LegalRuleML models:&nbsp;</p>



<p>– defeasibility of rules and defeasible logic;&nbsp;</p>



<p>– deontic operators (e.g., obligations, permissions, prohibitions, rights);&nbsp;</p>



<p>– semantic management of negation;&nbsp;</p>



<p>– temporal management of rules and temporality in rules;&nbsp;</p>



<p>– classification of norms (i.e., constitutive, prescriptive);&nbsp;</p>



<p>– jurisdiction of norms;&nbsp;</p>



<p>– isomorphism between rules and natural language normative provisions;&nbsp;</p>



<p>– identification of parts of the norms (e.g. bearer, conditions);&nbsp;</p>



<p>– authorial tracking of rules.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The TC received 4 Statements of Use from Livio Robaldo, Swansea University, CSIRO Data61, and CirSFID-AlmaAI.[3].</p>

<p>First public review of this draft specification ends September 12th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) TC are pleased to announce that Common Security Advisory Framework Version 2.0 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) Version 2.0 is the definitive reference for the CSAF language which supports creation, update, and interoperable exchange of security advisories as structured information on products, vulnerabilities and the status of impact and remediation among interested parties.</p>



<p>The OASIS CSAF Technical Committee is chartered to make a major revision to the widely-adopted Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF) specification, originally developed by the Industry Consortium for Advancement of Security on the Internet (ICASI). ICASI has contributed CVRF to the TC. The revision is being developed under the name Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF). TC deliverables are designed to standardize existing practice in structured machine-readable vulnerability-related advisories and further refine those standards over time.</p>



<p>The documents and related files are available here:</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation</a>&nbsp;together with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a>&nbsp;(GHPC) today announced the release of the&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GHP_Interoperability_Blueprint.pdf">Good Health Pass (GHP) Interoperability Blueprint V1.0.0 (PDF)</a>. Produced by over 125 participating companies and organizations spanning global travel, health, cybersecurity, privacy, and government, the Blueprint is an urgently needed solution that describes how to unify the widely disparate set of digital vaccination certificate solutions on the market.</p>



<p>“Over the past several months, different vaccination certificate formats have been announced by at least a dozen different governments, health authorities, and industry consortia around the world, including the European Union’s Digital COVID Certificate and the World Health Organisation’s Digital Document of COVID-19 Certificates,” said John Jordan, Executive Director of the ToIP Foundation. “Each of these is good and valuable in its own right, however because they are designed to be digital health documents, they share more information than is necessary simply to prove one’s COVID-19 status for purposes of travel or entry to a venue. The Good Health Pass Blueprint was designed from the ground up to provide an international trust framework that addresses the need for a simple, secure, standard, privacy-preserving health pass that works anywhere you need to prove your health status, just like a mobile boarding pass works with any airline.”</p>



<p>The Good Health Pass effort began with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a>&nbsp;(GHPC) organized by ID2020, a non-profit organization focused on ethical digital identity. In February 2021, GHPC published the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/resources/">Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint Outline</a>, which specified the key problems that needed to be solved and the core design principles that needed to be followed. GHPC then formed a partnership with the ToIP Foundation to launch the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=73790">Interoperability Working Group for Good Health Pass</a>. Working Group leadership and cross-industry expertise were also contributed by Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH), particularly its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.covidcreds.org/">COVID Credentials Initiative (CCI)</a>. This combined effort resulted in a fully open and transparent process that created the full Blueprint in under eight weeks.</p>



<p>After a public review period during June with stakeholders in air travel, government, healthcare, hospitality, and other affected sectors, the Blueprint was finalized in mid-July for final approval and publication. “Publication of the V1.0.0 Blueprint is just the first step in seeing interoperable privacy preserving digital health passes adopted in order to support people being able to gather together again with lower personal and public health risk,” said Kaliya Young, chair of the Working Group and Ecosystems Director at CCI. “Our next task is collaborating with real world implementers to fill in any remaining gaps to get to an interoperable system and working with LFPH and other partners to deliver open source code that can be deployed.”</p>



<p>Judith Fleenor, Director of Strategic Engagements at the ToIP Foundation, adds “The best news is that the Good Health Pass Blueprint does not compete with or replace any of the publicly announced COVID-19 health certificates. It is compatible with all of them—and others still to come. With the right software, all those health certificates can be ingested and verified in order to issue a Good Health Pass-compliant health pass. This focus on interoperability will make life much simpler and safer for both users and verifiers.”</p>



<p>The ToIP Foundation is especially proud of this effort because it demonstrates how applying the core principles of interoperable digital trust architecture solves global problems and builds confidence in solutions that have data integrity, portability, and confidentiality built-in. This is the fundamental motivation for creating the&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/resources/intro-to-toip/">ToIP Stack</a>, the ToIP Foundation’s model for developing privacy-preserving, interoperable, and decentralized digital identity solutions that form and sustain digital trust relationships.</p>



<p>The high-speed collaboration enabled by the Interoperability Working Group for Good Health Pass also illustrates the value of the antitrust and royalty-free intellectual property rights protections that all our Working Groups enjoy as a Linux Foundation (LF) project. “Good Health Pass is a textbook example of the kind of project the LF was formed to support,” said Brian Behlendorf, LF General Manager of Healthcare, Blockchain, and Identity. “Being able to bring together this many global experts to work so intensively in such a short period is unprecedented—and shows the kind of confidence that the LF has built in an open public collaboration process.”</p>



<p>We encourage you to review the Blueprint, endorse it, and adopt it—and to join the&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/get-involved/good-health-pass-implementation/">Interoperability Working Group for Good Health Pass</a>&nbsp;if you would like to collaborate with other industry leaders in creating the world’s first privacy-preserving health credential interoperability framework.</p>

<p>By Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director</p>



<p>Editor’s Note: This is the second blog covering the FIDO Developer Challenge.&nbsp; To learn more about the background and process, please read the earlier blog post, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/announcing-the-fido-developer-challenge-for-developers-across-the-globe/">Announcing the FIDO Developer Challenge for Developers Across the Globe</a>.</p>



<p>We are happy to announce that 14 teams from eight different countries (the U.S., Japan, Canada, France, India, Malaysia, Vietnam, and South Korea) have been invited to participate in the implementation stage of the 2021 FIDO Developer Challenge.  Six of the teams are early-stage ventures and an equal number hail from academia; the other two are individual developers.</p>



  



<p>[Faces of participants, captured during online interviews in late July]</p>



<p>All of the teams share a commitment to using FIDO authentication to provide a smoother and more secure user experience across a variety of application areas.  As was the case in our earlier Hackathons, we are seeing yet again that the mix of entrepreneurial vision coupled with the capabilities of FIDO Authentication can be realized in a wide array of use cases and industries.  We will share more details on each of the submissions as the review process carries forward.</p>



<p>The teams are now engaged in designated virtual lounges for possible Q&amp;As and support from the Developer Challenge sponsors and broader FIDO development community.&nbsp; To that end, we would like to recognize and give special thanks to the W3C WebAuthn Adoption Community Group for managing the private Discord Channel to provide technical support for participating teams.</p>



<p>Implementations will be done by the end of August and the judges will evaluate the teams’ final presentations and demos by early September.&nbsp; Please stay tuned for our announcement of the Top 3 by the middle of September – with the winner being announced at the Authenticate conference in Seattle on October 20.</p>

<p>Developers building multi-chain applications have a powerful new combination to work with, as Ceramic supports Polygon applications. &nbsp;Polygon offers developers a massively scalable, EVM-compatible blockchain infrastructure. Ceramic adds support for advanced data management and cross-chain identity. </p><p>Together, this enables developers and users to depend on the same accounts and wallets to manage transactions, identities, and data across their applications. Get started <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network">building today</a>. </p> A full stack for cross-chain applications <p>Since Polygon uses the same keypairs and wallets as Ethereum, and Ceramic’s identity system can be managed by Ethereum wallets, signing and<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/blockchain/#currently-supported-blockchains"> </a>authentication for Ceramic's data streams is supported out of the box for Polygon applications. </p><p>Now that Polygon and Ceramic can easily be used together, developers can:</p>  Build data-rich user experiences and social features on fully decentralized tech  Give users cloud-like backup, sync and recovery without running a centralized server  Publish content on the open web without the need to anchor IPFS hashes on-chain  Leverage interoperable profiles, social graphs and reputations across the Web3 ecosystem  <p>Users can now perform transactions on Ceramic and Polygon with their existing wallets. For example, users of <a href="https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/ideation">Boardroom’s DAO governance platform</a> can participate in ideation forums and discussions with all content stored on Ceramic and managed by their decentralized identity.</p> Getting started with Ceramic and Polygon   To get started on Polygon visit their <a href="https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/getting-started">documentation site</a>  To add IDX to your project, follow this<a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>  To use Ceramic for streams without IDX, follow this<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>.

Built on top of open standards including IPFS, libp2p, and DIDs and compatible with any raw storage protocol like Filecoin or Arweave, all information stored on Ceramic exists within a permissionless cross-chain network that lets developers tap into an ever growing library of identities and data while using their preferred stack.</p><p><a href="http://idx.xyz/">IDX (identity index)</a> is a cross-chain identity protocol that inherits Ceramic's properties to provide developers with a user-centric replacement for server-siloed user tables.

 🚀 Foundation News 
 DIF "Frequently Asked Questions" Knowledgebase 
<p>DIF has launched a massive <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/">knowledgebase</a>, structured as a long series of frequently-asked questions and answers. This synthesizes a year of educational efforts in the interop WG, blog posts, newsletters, and many other DIF inputs in a format we hope will be useful as a reference and onboarding document throughout the decentralized identity space.  Please peruse it, particularly the sections about your personal research focus and/or your company's specialty and products, opening issues or PRs on github wherever you feel a correction or addition is needed.  This is intended as a community resource, so PRs are open to your input!</p>
 🍾 DIF Welcomes Chris Kelly at Comms 
<p>Hello and greetings to all! I am delighted to introduce myself as DIF's new communications director. I am originally from Dublin, Ireland, and home is now Berlin, Germany. I'm excited to get involved at DIF, support members in their documentation efforts and bring the decentralised identity conversation to a wider audience. I've spent time in the advertising and non-profit sectors, as a video producer, a sysadmin, and I cohost a comedy drag talkshow on YouTube. At DIF I'll be working on things like promoting our blog and managing our social media channels, and I have some exciting ideas in store.<br>
Visit my drop-in office hours Tuesdays at 8pm CET (11am PT, 2pm EST) for a chat, or reach out to me directly via Slack or <a href="mailto:chris@identity.foundation">email</a>.<br>
I am always happy to hear your feedback and ideas for articles and initiatives!</p>
   🛠️ Group Updates  
 <a href="http://identity.foundation/interop/interop.html">☂️ InterOp WG (cross-community)</a> 
 
 New Chairs of the Interop Group:
 
 David Waite (PingIdentity) 
 Snorre Lothar von Gohren Edwin (Diwala) 
 
 
 John Jordan - the ToIP vision and governance for decentralized identity 
 Conversation about SSI, "eIDAS 2.0" and possible cooperation with the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure.
 
 EBSI: is this about roots of trust or trust frameworks?
 
 EBSI: European Blockchain Services Infrastructure 
 
 
 eIDAS 1.0 was defining eIDs in a way that allows crossborder interop 
 the EU digital ID &amp; VC-holding wallets and EBSI should be seen as two distinct movements 
 EU member states still can chose to adopt, or fork, or ignore whatever EBSI does
 
 they want to avoid potential misalignement of independent implementations across the EU 
 
 
 
 
 here is the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EBSIDOC/EBSI+Documentation+Home">EBSI documentation homepage</a> that gets updated regularly
 
 Report from the OIDF Working Groups with David Waite and Kristina Yasuda.
 
 Discussion about identity history, SIOP, WebAuthN, NFC support.
 
 history of the past 12 years in identity world
 
 OAuth1, Oauth2, Keybase etc. 
 
 
 "Different kind of trust, can anchor with more sources of identity." 
 With SIOP, you do self-generated and pairwise keys - ephemeral, not rooted to anything. 
 one of reasons I think that "Sign in with Google" is so attractive is that I expect their Google account to outlast my account - so I don't have to do recovery. 
 OIDF is interested in using VP as recovery scheme (e.g. drivers license).
 
 If shared during registration, becomes source of registration for recovery. 
 repairing a damaged trust relationship is very time-, cost- and labor-intensive for a company. Using VP can help reestablish the trust relationship, spares asking secret questions, extra data eg. Mom's name, pets etc. 
 
 
 Discussion about OpenID Connect for Verifiable Presentation
 
 Previous term: portable identifiers. For existing hosted provider, is there a way to include/assert DID ownership in challenge with other parties? 
 
 
 Aggregated and Distributed Claims.
 
 upstream credentials without defined retrieval mechanism. Potential overlap with Credential Manifest 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 <a href="http://identity.foundation/interop/interop.html">💡 Identifiers &amp; Discovery</a> 
 
 New time for UR Calls: Wednesdays 2PM CET (8AM ET). 
 Discussion about EBSI Ledger and Trust - List of Trusted Registries, Registry Properties,  "Onboarding Service", LoA, key security, eIDAS, Current Status of EBSI 
 Discussion about Historical Key Resolution.
 
 A DID document could point to a hub, which contains a list of historical keys associated with the DID. This list is signed by a current DID controller key. 
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/identity-hub/spec/#did-relative-urls">Using DID URLs</a>, it should be possible to point to a specific historical key at a specific point in time, and it can be dereferenced publicly by anyone. 
 Discussion on implementing this in the Universal Resolver. 
 The ID WG could start a new work item which defines the data structure of historical keys, as well as the format of DID URls that point to them. 
 
 
 Universal Resolver returning a key in a given format (e.g., JWK(S))
 
 Discussions about <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-spec-extensions/blob/master/parameters/transform-keys.md">transform-key DID URL parameter</a>. 
 PoC has been implemented in Universal Resolver. 
 What are possible values? JWK, JWKS, base58, multibase, PEM, ...?
 
 <a href="https://did.key.transmute.industries/">Discussion on this approach vs. use media types</a>. 
 
 
 
 
 Discussion about Solid and DIDs. 
 
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">🛡️ Claims &amp; Credentials</a> 
 
 Workitem Status: WACI-PEX. 
 Workitem Status: PE (Maintenance) + Credential Manifest. 
 Workitem Status: VC Marketplace. 
 Discussion: COVID Vaccination Pass Story. 
 
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html">🔓 DID Auth</a> 
 
 Updates from the OIDF-DIF co-hosted work.
 
 OIDC4VP draft that specifies how VPs can be transported using any OpenID Connect flow is maturing - this is an alternative to "empty VPs" 
 Main piece left in OIDC4VP is how to use DIF PE as a query language. There are few outstanding issues in DIF PE GitHub that will be discussed on a call on 4th Aug - join us if interested 
 SIOP V2 (previously known as did-siop) is also making progress. Big discussion happening now is how to secure and perform origin verification in a cross-device flow where verifier and the user wallet are on the different devices. 
 Credential Provider draft is in the process of being integrated into the Claims Aggregation draft to define how VCs can be issues from the OpenID Identity Provider

<p>Having shown in our last piece how interoperability “profiles” are designed, we now tackle some key technical problem areas ripe for this kind of profile-first interoperability work across&nbsp;stacks.</p><p>In our <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/setting-interoperability-targets/">last essay</a>, we explored the means and ends of interoperability targets and roadmapping across stacks and markets. “Interoperability,” like “standardization,” can be a general-purpose tool or an umbrella of concepts, but rarely works from the top-down. Instead, specific use-cases, consortia, contexts, and industries have to take the lead and prototype something more humble and specific like an “interoperability profile” — over time, these propagate, get extended, get generalized, and congeal into a more universal and stable standard. Now, we’ll move on to some technical problem areas ripe for this kind of profile-first interoperability work across&nbsp;stacks.</p><p>&gt; What makes sense to start aligning now? What are some sensible scopes for interoperating today, or yesterday, to get our fledgling market to maturity and stability as soon as safely possible?</p>Ponte Vecchio, Fiorenze, by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/GHoX7zFRMMU">Ray Harrington</a> From testable goals to discrete&nbsp;scopes <p>The last few months have seen a shift in terminology and approach, as many groups turn their attention from broad “interoperability testing” to more focused “profiles” that test one subset of the optionalities and capabilities in a larger test suite or protocol definition. This decoupling of test suites from multiple profiles each suite can test helps any one profile from ossifying into a “universal” definition of decentralized identity’s core featureset.</p><p>As with any other emerging software field, every use case and context has its own interoperability priorities and constraints that narrow down the technological solution space into a manageable set of tradeoffs and decisions. For instance, end-user identification at various levels of assurance is often the most important implementation detail for, say, a retail bank, and DID-interoperability (which is not always the same thing!) might be a hardware manufacturer’s primary concern in being able to secure hardware supply&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Every industry has its unique set of minimum security guarantees, and VC-interoperability is obviously front-of-mind for credentialing use-cases. For example, in the medical data space, “Semantics” (data interpretation and metadata) might be a harder problem (or a more political one) than the mechanics of identity assurance, since high standards of end-user privacy and identity assurance have already made for a relatively interoperable starting points. Which exact subset of the many possible interoperability roadmaps is safest or most mission-critical for a given organization depends on many factors: the regulatory context, the culture of the relevant sectors, its incentive-structures, and its <a href="https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">business&nbsp;models</a>.</p><p>Cross-cutting industry verticals, however, are structural issues with how decentralized identity stacks and architecture vary, which can already been seen today. By applying “first principles,” (or in our case, the “<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md">functions</a>” of a decentralized identity system and its many moving parts) across use-cases and industrial contexts, certain shared problems arise. As is our default approach in DIF Interop WG, we applied DIF’s in-house <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/raw/master/assets/interop-mapping-version-by-Hakan-Yildiz(TUB).pdf">mental model</a> of the “5 layers” of decentralized identity systems, sometimes called “the 4+1 layers”. (See also the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity.github.io/raw/master/assets/crosscommunity-architecture-survey-oct-2020.pdf">more detailed version</a>).</p><p>We call these the “4+1” layers because our group agreed that a strict layering was not possible, and that all the architectures we compared for using verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers had to make major architectural decisions with consequences across all four of the more properly “layered” categories. This fifth category we named “transversal considerations,” since they traverse the layers and often come from architectural constraints imposed by regulation, industrial context, etc. Foremost among these are storage and authorization, the two most vexing and cross-cutting problems in software generally; these would justify an entirely separate&nbsp;article.</p><p>In a sense, none of the topics from this transversal category are good candidates for specification in the medium-term across verticals and communities — they are simply too big as problems, rarely specific to identity issues, and being addressed elsewhere. These include “storage” (subject of our newest <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">working group</a>), “authorization” (debatably the core problem of all computer science!), “cryptographic primitives”, and “compliance.” (These last two are each the subject of a new working group, <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/crypto.html">Applied Cryptography</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/wallet-security.html">Wallet Security</a>!). These interoperability scopes are quite difficult to tackle quickly, or without a strong standards background. Indeed, these kinds of foundational changes require <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">incremental advances</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093">broad cooperation</a> with large community organizations. This is slow, foundation work that needs to connect parallel work across data governance, authentication/authorization, and storage in software more generally.</p><p>Similarly, the fourth layer, where ecosystem-, platform-, and industry-specific considerations constrain application design and business models, is unlikely to crystallize into a problem space calling out for a single specification or prototype in the medium-term future. Here, markets are splintered and it is unclear what can be repurposed or recycled outside of its original context. Even if there were cases where specification at this later would be timely, DIF members might well choose to discuss those kinds of governance issues at our sister-organizations in the space that more centrally address data governance at industry-, ecosystem-, or national- scale: <a href="http://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP</a> was chartered to design large-scale governance processes, and older organizations like <a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData.org</a> and the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> also have working groups and publications on vertical-specific and jurisdiction-specific best practices for picking interoperable protocols and data&nbsp;formats.</p><p>That still leaves three “layers”, each of which has its own interoperability challenges that seem most urgent. It is our contention that each of these could be worked on in parallel and independently of the other two to help arrive at a more interoperable community — and we will be trying to book presentation and discussion guests in the coming months to advance all&nbsp;three.</p> Scope #1: Verifiable Credential Exchange <p>The most clear and consensus-building, even urgent way forward is to bring clarity to Verifiable Credential exchange across stacks. This has been the primary focus of our WG for the last year. Given that most of the early ecosystem-scale interest in SSI revolves around <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/#vc-infrastructure-layer-3">credentialing</a> (educational credentials, employment credentials, health records), it is highly strategic to get translation and unified protocols into place soon for the interoperable verification and cross-issuance of credentials.</p><p>In fact, there has actually been a lot of good progress made since Daniel Hardman wrote an <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/getting-to-practical-interop-with-verifiable-credentials/">essay</a> on the Evernym blog making a pragmatic case for sidestepping differences in architecture and approach to exchange VCs sooner. This aligned with much of our group’s work in recent months, which has included a <a href="https://hackmd.io/t1cotiReTXCnkpDG8k2tVA#THE-MAIN-EVENT">survey of VC formats</a> among organizations producing “wallets” for verifiable credentials (be they “edge” wallets or otherwise). Our group has also sought to <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8j6niRuFWTjVMIXqmw3zX-4KkLt-sli8">assist educational efforts</a> at the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>, in the Claims and Credentials <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">working group</a>, and elsewhere to make wallet-producing organizations aware of the relevant <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/vc-spec-map">specifications</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/dif/be6763341a014d248f655aea187d7890?v=c9ac48a07f3d411c9a1bea32b55f7e76">other references</a> needed to make their wallets multi-format sooner and less painfully. Much of this work was crystalized into an <a href="https://www.lfph.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Verifiable-Credentials-Flavors-Explained.pdf">article</a> by co-chair Kaliya Young and crowd-edited by the whole group; this work was a major guiding structure for the Good Health Pass work that sought to make a common health record format (exported from FHIR systems) equally holdable and presentable across all of today’s VC&nbsp;systems.</p><p>One outgrowth of this effort and other alignments that have taken place since Hardman’s and Young’s article is the work of prototyping a multi-community exchange protocol that allow a subset of each stack’s capabilities and modes to interoperate. This tentative, “minimum viable profile” is called <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-presentation-exchange">WACI-PEx</a> and is currently a work item of the Claims and Credentials working group. Work is ongoing on v0.1, and an ambitious, more fully-featured v1 is planned for after that. This profile acts as an “extension” of the broader Presentation Exchange protocol, giving a handy “cheat sheet” for cross-stack wallet-to-issuer/verifier handshakes so that developers not familiar with all the stacks and protocols being spanned have a starting point for VC exchanges. Crucially, the results of this collaborative prototype will be taken as inputs to future versions of the DIDComm protocols and the WACI specification for Presentation Exchange.</p><p>Note: There has been some discussion of a OIDC-Presentation Exchange profile at some point in the future, but given that the alignment of DIDComm and Presentation Exchange started over a year ago, the most likely outcome is that work on this would not start until after v1 has been released of the “WACI-PEx” profile for DIDComm has been released.</p> Scope #2: Anchoring layer <p>Of course, other forms of alignment are possible as well in the “bottom 3” layers of the traditional stack, while we wait on the ambitious transversal alignment specifications and the ongoing work to align and simplify cross-format support for VCs (and perhaps even multi-format VCs, as Hardman points out in the essay&nbsp;above).</p><p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery</a> WG at DIF has long housed many work items to align on the lowest level of stack, including general-purpose <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jsonld-common-java">common libraries</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secret-recovery-methods">recovery mechanisms</a>. It has also received many donations that contribute to method-level alignment, including a recent <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/trinsic-donates-did-key-rs-to-i-d-wg-8a278f37bcd0?source=friends_link&amp;sk=dbd175f5db9107ed1e9d953a386441a4">DID-Key implementation</a> and a linked-data <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jsonld-document-loader">document loader</a> donated by Transmute. The group has also served as a friendly gathering point for discussing calls for input from the DID-core working group at W3C and for proposing W3C-CCG work&nbsp;items.</p><p>One particularly noteworthy initiative of the group has been the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540?source=friends_link&amp;sk=306a37f289dcf61a89d19cd11f5be04e">Universal Resolver</a> project, which offers a kind of “trusted middleware” approach to DID resolution across methods. This prototype of a general-use server allows any SSI system (or non-SSI system) to submit a DID and get back a trustworthy DID Document, without needing any knowledge of or access to (much less current knowledge of or authenticated access to) the “black box” of the participating DID methods. While this project only extends “passive interoperability” to DIDs, i.e., only allowing DID document querying, a more ambitious sister project, the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar">Universal Registrar</a>, strives to bring a core set of CRUD capabilities to DID documents for DID methods willing to contribute drivers. Both projects have dedicated weekly calls on the DIF calendar, for people looking to submit drivers or get otherwise involved.</p> Scope #3: “Agent”/Infrastructure Layer <p>There is another layer, however, in between DIDs and VCs, about which we haven’t spoken yet: the crucial “agent layer” in the ToIP/Aries mental model, which encompasses trusted infrastructure whether in or outside of conventional clouds. The Aries Project has scaled up an impressively mature ecosystem of companies and experimenters, largely thanks to the robust infrastructure layer it built (and abstracting away from application-layer developers and experimenters).</p><p>Until now, differences of strategy with respect to conventional clouds and infrastructures have prevented large-scale cooperation and standardization at this layer outside of Aries and the DID-Comm project. Partly, this has been a natural outgrowth of the drastically different infrastructural needs and assumptions of non-human, enterprise, and consumer-facing/individual use cases, which differ more at this level than above or below. Partly, this is a function of the economics of our sector’s short history, largely influenced by the infrastructure strategies of cloud providers and telecommunication concerns.</p><p>This is starting to change, however, now that agent frameworks inspired by the precedent set by the Aries frameworks have come into maturity. Mattr’s <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/verifiable-credentials-with-auth0-and-mattr/">VIII Platform</a>, the Affinidi framework SDK (including open-source <a href="https://docs.affinidi.com/interop">components by</a> DIF members Bloom, Transmute, and Jolocom), ConsenSys’ own modular, highly <a href="https://veramo.io/docs/veramo_agent/plugins">extensible</a> and interoperable <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a> platform, and most recently Spruce ID’s very <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi">DID-method-agnostic</a> <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/">DIDKit</a>/<a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/credible/">Credible</a> SDK all offer open-source, extensible, and scalable infrastructure layers that are driving the space towards greater modularity and alignment at this&nbsp;layer.</p><p>As these platforms and “end-to-end stacks” evolve into frameworks extensible and capacious enough to house ecosystems, DIF expects alignment and harmonization to develop. This could mean standardization of specific components at this layer, for&nbsp;example:</p>  The DIDComm protocol could expand into new <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-looker-jwm-01.html">envelopes</a> and transports  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secret-recovery-methods">Control recovery</a> mechanisms could be specified across implementations or even standardized on a technical and/or UX&nbsp;level  Auditing or historical-query requirements could be specified to form a cross-framework protocol or primitive  Common usages of foreign function interfaces, remote procedure calls like gRPC and JSON-RPC, or other forms of “glue” allowing elements to be reused or mixed and matched across languages and architectures could be specified as a community  <p>We are very much in early days, but some see on the horizon a day when frameworks that don’t cooperate with one another can’t compete with the ones that join forces. After all, adoption brings growing pains, particularly for the labor market — aligning on architectures and frameworks makes onboarding developers and transferring experience that much easier to&nbsp;do!</p> Next Steps <p>I would encourage anyone who has read this far to pick at least one of the three scopes mentioned above and ask themselves how they are helping along this alignment process in their day-to-day work, and if they truly understand what major players at that level are doing. Often large for-profit companies pay the most attention to what their competitors are doing, but here it is important to think outside of competition and look instead at non-profit organizations, regulators, and coalitions of various kinds to really see where the puck is heading. Sometimes consensus on one level is blocking compromise somewhere else. It can be pretty hard to&nbsp;follow!</p><p>In recent articles, DIF has encouraged its members to think about an open-source strategy as comparably important to a business plan, a living document and guiding philosophy. I would like to suggest that the subset of DIF companies working with VCs and DIDs should also think of interoperability strategy and conformance testing as the most crucial pillar of that strategy — if you cannot demonstrate interoperability, you might be asking people to take that strategy on&nbsp;faith!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/setting-interoperability-targets-part-2-of-2-671f8faa8ecb">Setting Interoperability Targets Part 2 of 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/library/digital-nation/education/"></a>A keynote use case for the<a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-identity/topic/scottish-credential-ecosystem/"> Scottish Credential Ecosystem</a> that demonstrates the tremendous potential for this approach is Education, notably the awarding of academic credentials. 
<p>Innovations relevant to this use case include ‘<a href="https://www.learningmachine.com/badges-and-blockcerts/">Blockcerts</a>‘, an open source blockchain project for enabling a Universal Verifier that will verify any Blockcert issued by any institution, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Via their Medium article UniversaBlockchain explore the scenario of <a href="https://medium.com/universablockchain/blockchain-in-education-49ad413b9e12">Blockchain in Education</a>.</p>
<p>They highlight keynote problems like the high rates of medical school diploma falsification as pain points a technology like Blockchain is ideal for tackling in some form, among a wave of other transformative benefits for the sector as it ripples through all workflow areas related to HR, resume checking, et al.</p>
<p>Athena<a href="https://blog.athenagt.com/blockchain-in-education-and-5-use-cases-to-observe/"> builds on this</a> some, notably detailing the core signature process that underpins the integrity of the record, as a comparison to traditional paper-based approaches:</p>
 
 Blockchain-enabled digital certificates are immutable and cannot be forged. 
 The records are stored on a distributed ledger, hence certificates can be only evaluated by anyone who has access to the blockchain. 
 Since the records are stored in a shared distributed ledger, the certificate can still be validated even if the organization that had issued it no longer exists. 
 The digital certificates stored in the ledger can only be destroyed if all the copies in every system are destroyed. 
 
<p>Countries like<a href="https://www.finder.com.au/good-clean-use-case-bahamian-students-graduate-on-the-blockchain"> the Bahamas</a> are now issuing Blockchain-based academic certificates.</p>
<p>Digitary is one vendor specializing in this sector, offering a<a href="https://www.digitary.net/products/"> suite of features</a> for managing academic credentials and digital badges, and has <a href="https://www.digitary.net/digitary-evernym-webinar/">teamed up with Evernym</a> to integrate these with Self-Sovereign Identity.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.aruccnationalnetwork.ca/news">this news</a> highlights one of the first customers to harness this capability is the Association of the Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada (ARUCC),&nbsp; choosing Digitary as the solution provider for the Made for Canada National Network.</p>
<p>This initiative means the Canadian higher education community is creating the very first online platform and national credential wallet for post-secondary learners. Once fully operational, the Network will enable 3 million learners across the country to access and share their official digitized post-secondary transcripts and credentials online – anytime, anywhere.</p>
 Digital Badges – Foundation for Gamified Micro Learning 
<p>This capability would ideally go hand in hand with ‘Digital Badges’, which can also be authenticated via the Blockchain the same way. As <a href="https://www.hastac.org/initiatives/digital-badges">Hastac explains</a> :</p>
<p>“A digital badge is a validated indicator of accomplishment, skill, quality, or interest that can be earned in many learning environments. <a href="http://openbadges.org/">Open digital badging</a> makes it easy for anyone to issue, earn, and display badges across the web—through an infrastructure that uses shared and open technical technical standards.”</p>
<p><a href="http://openbadges.org">Open digital badging</a> makes it easy for anyone to issue, earn, and display badges across the web—through an infrastructure that uses shared and open technical technical standards. Organizations like <a href="https://credly.com/">Credly</a> facilitate their universality across industries.</p>
<p>A pertinent example of how this can be applied in the corporate world is this example of the <a href="https://www.badges.sssc.uk.com/getting-started/what-you-need-to-know-about-open-badges/">Scottish Social Services Council uses them</a> to underpin workforce learning. The BCS describes this as the <a href="https://www.bcs.org/content-hub/digital-badging-the-future-of-professional-development/">future of professional development</a>, with many organizations like <a href="https://new.siemens.com/uk/en/company/education/teachers/siemens-digital-badges.html">Siemens</a> using them this way.</p>

 Information about the candidate OASIS Standard and the OSLC Open Project 



<p>The OSLC initiative applies Linked Data principles, such as those defined in the W3C Linked Data Platform (LDP), to create a cohesive set of specifications that can enable products, services, and other distributed network resources to interoperate successfully.</p>



<p>OSLC Core defines the overall approach to Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration based specifications and capabilities that extend and complement the W3C Linked Data Platform. The OP received 3 Statements of Use from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SodiusWillert, and IBM [5].</p>



<p>OSLC Query provides a mechanism for a client to query or search for RDF resources that match a given criteria. The response to a successful query includes the RDF of a query result container that references the member resources found by the query, and optionally includes selected properties of each member resource. The OP has received 3 Statements of Use from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Koneksys, and IBM [6].</p>

<p>In the latest installment of the Lumen Researcher interview series, we spoke with Andrea Fuller, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal who specializes in data analysis. Prior to her work with the WSJ, Fuller was previously a data journalist for Gannett Digital, The Center for Public Integrity, and The Chronicle of Higher Education.</p><p>Fuller’s work combines data, spreadsheets, and code with investigative journalism and storytelling. Last May, Fuller wrote an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-dmca-copyright-claims-takedown-online-reputation-11589557001">article</a> for the Journal about her investigation into Google’s handling of DMCA takedowns. Using Lumen’s extensive database of copyright notices, Fuller exposed some of the shady copyright claims and abusive submitters that were flying under Google’s&nbsp;radar.</p><p>In this interview, Adam Holland, Project Manager at the Lumen Project, Anna Callahan and Gina Markov, Lumen’s 2021 summer interns, spoke with Fuller about her research and how the Lumen Database helped her develop her story about the bad actors in the world of DMCA takedowns.</p><p>Lumen: Could you give us a brief description of your&nbsp;bio?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: I’ve been at the Journal since 2014, so, seven years now. I’ve done tech stories, I’ve done a lot about nonprofit shenanigans, I’ve done a lot about education. So, I’m a little bit of a jack of all trades when it comes to subjects. But I mainly work on data projects at the Journal — I do spreadsheets, I do SQL, I do R, I write code, I call people and talk to them, and then I write stories. So, yeah, I do a little bit of everything.</p><p>Lumen: In 2020, you wrote an article for The Wall Street Journal about how Google approaches DMCA takedown requests. Could you give us some background about your process of researching and writing that&nbsp;piece?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: We started this article in late 2019 after it came out of some other Google reporting. We came across some of Lumen’s own blog posts and great work about the DMCA and we wanted to take this a step further. So we spent months and months downloading lots of DMCA requests from the Lumen database. We got the Lumen API key and started uploading the text of these requests and assembling our own database.</p><p>I set up a MongoDB database that we imported all these JSON files into, and we started collecting them incrementally. I actually wrote a bunch of code to turn it into a relational database so I could search them more easily. I was working in SQL. Google releases its own transparency report, which does not have all the detailed information of the text of these requests, but does say how many and which of the URLs were removed, so I was able to cross reference that.</p><p>I looked for any DMCA requests against major websites, whether they be major retail sites or news sites. It was interesting — there weren’t any successful DMCA requests from sites like The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times. What I started finding was more obscure, niche news sites — whether they be blogs or international news sites in foreign languages — [where] Google had complied with the take-down requests [it had received]. It became evident to me that Google was doing a really good job at filtering out bad takedown requests against major newspapers and major consumer sites, but not so much against more esoteric&nbsp;media.</p><p>Lumen: Do you have any speculation as to why that&nbsp;is?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: One of the things we say in our article is that the team at Google that’s in charge of DMCA is not very big. To actually manually review all of these requests is a near impossible task as the volume of DMCA requests has increased dramatically. And it’s really hard to make those judgment calls, because whether something is a real news site or not can be a really difficult determination. You get into broader philosophical discussions about the credibility of media in particular.</p><p>In one of the most compelling interviews that I had, I talked to this journalist in the Ukraine who was affiliated with an international reporting organization. He described these shady characters who will post fake copies of webpages on live journals and then file DMCA take-down requests to remove the original pages. It works, forcing them to file counterclaims, but there’s a gap before you can have it restored. So it’s a pretty effective strategy for getting content removed if you are an alleged Ukrainian gangster.</p><p>I also talked to one girl who was a blogger in Singapore, and she had a blog that was taken down through a DMCA request. She was writing letters to Google saying, “Why? I don’t understand. What did I do?” She didn’t do anything. She wrote about this Instagram influencer who was promoting a questionable sham cryptocurrency product. And that [product’s] organization created a blog post and filed a take-down request, claiming that it wrote the article first, which was laughable because it was clearly written in her voice, in her person. So, it’s really hard for people to fight these. They can definitely file counterclaims, but there is a delay in the process and then sometimes people don’t necessarily have the resources.</p><p>It’s a really tricky issue. It would take a lot of manpower to manually review all of these. Even though I was able to use queries to identify likely problematic ones, this took me a lot of time. Eventually, I sent Google about 100 things that I pretty much knew were wrong. And from that, because they have much more data than I do internally, they were able to restore something like 50,000 pages that they had taken down erroneously. And that’s just out of my one little slice of research.</p><p>Lumen: Did you see any trends in how fraudulent notices looked as you were going through&nbsp;them?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: You would see examples of things that claim to have happened earlier, but the date was something that couldn’t possibly match with the dates in the context of the piece. And it was clearly just made up. So, it was pretty self evident. I think there were a lot of really clever, yet nefarious, tactics. But once you look at some of these articles it was really blatantly obvious: We had these LiveJournals that had been hacked and were suddenly all in Russian or Ukrainian, and had all these articles about oligarchs.</p><p>In other cases, it was harder. Both of these sites in Ukrainian look kind of scammy, which is the real one and which isn’t? And it was really hard to assess that in some&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Lumen: What was the most shocking or unexpected thing that you found during your research?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: There were a couple things that I think surprised me, one being the hacking of LiveJournals. The idea that LiveJournals played such a big role was so bizarre to me. I actually, at one point, started searching for any take-down requests that were based on claiming that a LiveJournal had copyright, because that was a way I was identifying them. I think I was also pretty surprised by that story where the girl’s blog actually got taken down because it was a Google Blogger product, and that was pretty stunning to me. Not only was it not available in search, but it was just gone from the internet entirely and that was pretty troubling.</p><p>Lumen: What alternative approach do you think you would have been able to take had the notices not been available to you via Lumen? Do you think that approach would have been as effective?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: I think it would have been really difficult just going off the URLs — I don’t think this would have even been possible without the Lumen data. I don’t think we could have found such a large volume of stuff. Having the actual text of the complaint was what made this analysis possible and I can’t even really fathom how we could have done it simply based on the transparency report data. We could have probably found a few anecdotes, but I didn’t know what websites to search for because I don’t know the name of Ukrainian blogs, so I think it would have been really difficult without&nbsp;Lumen.</p><p>Lumen: Do you think there is any appetite for a follow-up piece about this&nbsp;stuff?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: Yes. My coworker, Rachel Levy, did a great story a couple months before mine about reputation management. This hedge fund manager had created fake websites to promote himself and manipulate Google search results. So, it’s certainly a really interesting area, and I think DMCA is a larger piece of that&nbsp;puzzle.</p><p>Lumen: As a data journalist who often covers issues pertaining tech and business, how important, in your opinion or experience, is transparency through notice&nbsp;sharing?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: As a journalist, we do our jobs based on this kind of transparency. If there had been no Google transparency report or Lumen database we wouldn’t have been able to do this. And so, you have to at least give Google credit for releasing that kind of data. And I think if there was more stuff like that out there in the tech world that would be really beneficial to researchers and journalists and people who can help with the accountability process. I think that the more transparent data we have, it makes stuff like that possible. And at the end of the day, it helps the public and consumers and it really helps the Ukrainian journalists. And that’s what we’re all here&nbsp;for.</p><p>[The quotes in this interview have been edited for clarity.]</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/lumen-researcher-interview-series-andrea-fuller-wall-street-journal-ec35d2800e3f">​Lumen Researcher Interview Series: Andrea Fuller, Wall Street Journal</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 DIACC’s Written Submission for the Pre-Budget Consultations in Advance of the 2022 Budget 



<p>Ahead of the 2022 federal budget, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Committees/en/FINA/StudyActivity?studyActivityId=10877390">asked</a>&nbsp;Canadians to share their input.&nbsp;<br>DIACC is pleased to have submitted a brief, calling on the Federal Government to implement the following recommendations:&nbsp;</p>



  That the government secure adoption of the <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PCTF-Overview-FINAL.pdf">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> by businesses and governments.  That the government act on the <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Committees/en/FINA/StudyActivity?studyActivityId=11021772">Finance Committee’s 2021 Pre-Budget Consultation</a> Recommendations 128, Implement a digital identity system that empowers Canadians to control their data that is held by the federal government, and 129, Create a national data strategy.  That the government work with provincial and territorial partners and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to ensure that all Canadians have access to an ISO-compliant government-issued digital ID credential with economy-wide utility by December 2022.  That the government make digital identity-enabled services available to all Canadians by December 2022.  That the government prioritizes funding and integration of digital ID as part of the <a href="https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/">Digital Technology Supercluster</a> Initiative.  



 The Key to Unlocking an Inclusive Digital Economy: Investing in Digital ID 



<p>To re-start the economy and deliver inclusive services to all Canadians, governments must invest in unlocking digital. Digital ID empowers Canadians with the choice to safely share their existing credentials (eg: passports, driver’s licenses, health cards) for digital transactions.</p>



<p>Investing in digital ID offers economic benefits to citizens, businesses, and governments and also establishes digital tools to support societal trust, security, privacy, and fraud mitigation. This is a win for all.</p>



<p>Few budget items have the potential to impact every government initiative – digital ID is one such investment with broad impacts and encompassing benefits. Digital ID offers service improvements across all government services and priority areas. This initiative has the potential to empower individuals, increase government efficiency, strengthen companies, and unite communities across the country with secure access to resources, economic development, trust, and support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Canadians understand the potential. The pandemic has been an intense and polarizing experience, leading many Canadians to lose faith in institutions. The Edelman Trust Barometer reports that 46% believe that government leaders purposely misled them. At the same time, Canadians are relying more on technology, with the digital sector growing 3.5 percent in 2020, while the economy as a whole shrunk by 5 percent. With digital transformation happening across the country, Canadians are aware that online privacy is crucial. A recent poll from The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada reports that 89 percent of Canadians are concerned about people using information about them online to steal their identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How can the government build trust, enhance privacy, and demonstrate that citizens’ rights are top priority? The answer is clear: 9 in 10 Canadians are supportive of digital ID. Citizen-centric, standards-aligned Digital ID offers an ecosystem that reopens doors closed by the pandemic and unlocks entirely new paths to economic resiliency, cohesion, and social trust.</p>



<blockquote><p>🔑 Recommendation 1: Implement adoption of the <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PCTF-Overview-FINAL.pdf">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> by businesses and governments to ensure Canadians are empowered post-pandemic and have clarity in building a secure, interoperable, and privacy-respecting digital ID.</p></blockquote>



<p>The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™ (PCTF) is a co-created framework that any jurisdiction — federal, provincial, or international — and industry sector can work with to ensure business, legal, and technical interoperability to realize the full benefits of a digital ecosystem. Rather than seeking a single solution, the PCTF promotes choice and offers a shared hub and language that distinct solutions can interoperate through. Developed by public and private sector experts over a decade, the PCTF provides organizations of all sizes, across sectors, industries, and locations with shared principles and guidelines for a digital ID ecosystem. Built based on recommendations from the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review in 2011, this work has been identified by the public and private sectors as key for Canada’s economic resilience but remains underfunded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While provinces, territories, and countries around the world set up COVID credentialing and proof of vaccination systems, the need for these systems is urgent. The credentials issued must be designed with common principles and security to enable acceptance across various jurisdictional and sector-specific solutions for their unique context. The PCTF makes this possible, working as a flexible foundation to connect systems without dictating a single technological architecture.&nbsp;<br>The PCTF includes adaptable recommendations that are currently being tested in-market, including standards for Notice and Consent, Authentication, Privacy, Verified Person, Verified Organization, Credentials (Relationship and Attributes), Infrastructure (Technology and Operations) and Assessment. A Model, Overview, and Glossary have been published for ease of use across industries and sectors. Developed with Canadians in mind, the PCTF is technology-agnostic, encouraging innovation while prioritizing privacy, safety and security, and supporting digital economic growth on a global scale.</p>



<blockquote><p>🔑&nbsp; Recommendation 2: Put citizens first and integrate cross-government priorities. Act on the <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Committees/en/FINA/StudyActivity?studyActivityId=11021772">Finance Committee’s 2021 Pre-Budget Consultation</a> Recommendations 128, Implement a digital identity system that empowers Canadians to control their data that is held by the federal government, and 129, Create a national data strategy.</p></blockquote>



<p>Empowering individuals to control their data, understand available services, and have more convenient and secure access to government services offers a direct path to rebuild trust. A recent Leger survey commissioned by Postmedia reports that the pandemic has eroded trust in the federal government, either a little or a lot, for 63% of Canadians. After a challenging year, it is critical that the budget puts citizens first. Digital ID is a proactive initiative that offers immediate and long-term benefits. It has the potential to restore confidence, act on Canadian values, and empower citizens.</p>



<p>Providing Canadians with the digital ID credentials necessary to access, manage, and share their own data ensures citizens have control over the important information they need to manage their health, business(es), and digital services. A national data strategy ensures all Canadians benefit from these advances. It also clarifies accountability for those who seek to use technology and personal information with malicious intent. A pan-Canadian strategy evens the playing field for businesses looking to operate digitally across provincial, territorial, and global borders. This approach also enhances Canadians’ ability to compete economically on a global scale, travel, and seek care with the virtual mobility afforded by a secure, verifiable digital ID.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>🔑 Recommendation 3: Ensure all Canadians benefit from digital connections, opportunity, and the right to be recognized with digital ID. Work with provincial and territorial partners and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to ensure that all Canadians have access to an ISO-compliant government-issued digital ID credential with economy-wide utility by December 31, 2022.</p></blockquote>



<p>Digital ID is the key, as the pandemic has built and opened new doors for Canadians navigating their safety, financial security, health and relationships. According to a study by Brookfield Institute, 9 percent of Canadian businesses made 60 percent or more of their total sales online, up from 6 percent in 2019 — but this digital success has been difficult for small to medium enterprises to adopt. As digital service adoption grows, citizen and employee expectations have also shifted to demand more reliable and secure digital alternatives. Digital ID can encourage sustainable, long-term adoption of digital platforms and help organizations of all sizes to benefit from these systems. It also presents a more flexible and streamlined strategy for pan-Canadian notification systems, service delivery, and community safety initiatives.</p>



<p>Provinces and territories are establishing their own digital ID initiatives. <a href="https://account.alberta.ca/">Alberta</a> and <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/government-id/bc-services-card/log-in-with-card/set-up-mobile-card/verify-by-video">British Columbia</a> have launched digital IDs, with BC including a mobile card and a <a href="https://youtu.be/nWC7H3LGlrE">Verify by Video</a> option. Significant investments have been made in <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/58872/ontario-making-government-services-more-convenient-reliable-and-accessible">Ontario</a> and <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/gouv/politiques-orientations/vitrine-numeriqc/se-transformer/">Québec</a>, where <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/progress-of-the-covid-19-vaccination/proof-covid-19-vaccination">proof of vaccination credentials</a> have been launched. <a href="https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/doing-business-with-government/saskatchewan-account-help/identity-validation-and-privacy">Saskatchewan</a>, Yukon, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick are launching pilots, proof of concepts and digital ID components.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This prioritization demonstrates demand for this enabling capability across the country — but unequal funding and approaches developed in departmental silos pose a risk. Without cohesive federal leadership, these systems will be disjointed and miss the opportunity to be truly interoperable, efficient, and useful for all Canadians. Unlocking these opportunities in a synchronized and equitable manner will ensure Canadians can all access economic opportunities, required public services, and the chance to manage their own personal information.</p>



<blockquote><p>🔑&nbsp; Recommendation 4: Collaborate for the highest and most equitable impact. Make digital identity-enabled services available to all Canadians by December 2022.</p></blockquote>



<p>As the provincial and territorial governments take action to simplify and secure digital identities, private companies are also taking note of this massive market opportunity. Notably, Apple is teaming up with the TSA to be a trusted source of ID for Americans and Stripe is pursuing digital ID services partnering with other apps, including Discord, for user verification. Many more companies are entering the digital ID space in hopes of earning users’ trust and capturing market share. As the issuer of identity in Canada, the public sector is uniquely positioned to empower Canadians and enable the private sector — but the government needs to act now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While offering numerous economic and social benefits locally and globally, a Canadian digital ID builds citizen trust and mitigates risk. As the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security noted, “the number of cyber threat actors is increasing, and… Cybercrime will almost certainly continue to be the cyber threat most likely to affect Canadians.” This vulnerability means that Canadians urgently require an encompassing, policy- and leadership-driven approach to implementing and enforcing Privacy by Design principles. A McKinsey report confirms this, suggesting that, for national governments to address the heightened risks presented by cyber threats, “organizations can move from a ‘trust but verify’ mindset to a ‘verify first’ approach.” Pressures and requirements for proof of vaccination, contact tracing, and social distancing are also made possible, digitally secure, and more user-friendly through universal data minimization standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital ID offers the key to unlocking secure digital services and pathways. With opportunities to boost job creation, economic growth, citizen wellbeing, COVID-19 planning, support, and mitigation, and reconciliation efforts, digital ID is a budget line that prioritizes and directly benefits all Canadians. Digital ID offers Canadians more personalized control over personal information and convenient access to services. It can increase mobility and connect intra-provincial and territorial systems. It offers an opportunity to strengthen innovation and establish a secure foundation for international collaboration.</p>



<blockquote><p>🔑&nbsp; Recommendation 5: Embed within existing ecosystems. Prioritize the funding and integration of digital ID as part of the <a href="https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/">Digital Technology Supercluster</a> Initiative. Digital ID supports and intersects its areas of focus including health, sustainable natural resource applications, and digital training.</p></blockquote>



<p>Strides are already being made by Canadians. Purpose-built solutions, like the COVID Alert App, demonstrate that Canada has the talent and innovation to adapt and develop market-leading solutions. Unfortunately, the $20 million price tag and reactive nature of these innovations could be improved. The app has also not been approved by data authorities in Alberta, British Columbia, Nunavut, and Yukon, making it an incomplete solution that doesn’t account for different provincial regulations. Due to the nature of the pandemic, a pan-Canadian solution isn’t a nice to have — it’s a must. Digital ID is a proactive investment that could provide similar benefits in contact tracing and offer lasting impacts on service delivery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital ID has the potential to add $4.5 billion of added value to SMEs and reinvestments in the economy. It also directly meets the needs and preferences of consumers, with Signicat reporting that 68 percent of consumers expect 100 percent digital onboarding in the wake of COVID-19 and 60 percent would value digital identities to access services internationally. Canada has an opportunity to lead, recover, and take a future-focused position by making an investment in digital ID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prioritizing digital ID is putting Canadians today and in the future first, and reflects responsible investment that offers benefits across departments. Its utility and impact apply during and beyond health or environmental crises. Digital ID delivers an adaptable foundation to deliver new services, security, citizen engagement opportunities, and economic growth.</p>

Two of the four EC proposals call for the LEI to be used in certain customer identification and verification scenarios where it is available: </p>
 
 New Regulation on AML/CFT: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing; 
 Revision of the 2015 Regulation on Transfer of Funds: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on information accompanying transfers of funds and certain crypto-assets (recast). 
 
<p>Inclusion of the LEI within such far-reaching, EU-wide proposals for a future-proof AML/CFT regulatory  framework represents a huge leap forwards, in terms of realizing a key component of the G20 and Financial Stability Board’s vision to create the LEI as a public good. Any role played by the LEI in helping to protect EU citizens from the impact of terrorism and organized crime can be deemed of significant societal benefit. </p>
<p>A brief analysis of why the EC is championing the LEI within the AML/CFT context highlights that there are many benefits. Use of the LEI consistently for entity identification at the Member State level and the EU level can diminish the margins-of-error related to language ambiguity, human interpretation, and manual intervention. The LEI’s broad interoperability enables it to be integrated seamlessly into both centralized and decentralized digital identity management systems, together with the eIDAS-compliant digital certificates that are already harmonizing the use of e-signature technologies across the EU.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the new EC proposals are intended to create a much more consistent framework to ease compliance for operators subject to AML/CFT rules, especially for those active cross-border. Here too, and given the cross-border nature of money laundering and terrorism financing, the LEI can be used as the ‘Rosetta Stone’ for legal entities involved in financial transactions. Overseen by the <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/about/index.htm">Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC)</a>, the Global LEI System is the only system that establishes a recognized, monitored and standardized global identity for legal entities, linked to the entity’s national ID system. Its universality across borders, combined with open and online access to annually verified business card information linked to each LEI, makes it uniquely placed to enable efficient information exchange between the ‘obliged parties’ defined in the AML/CFT proposal and all competent authorities.   </p>
<p>And while this is the first time the LEI has been officially endorsed by the EC in its AML/CFT framework, the LEI has a long track record as a powerful tool in assisting the efforts of financial institutions to combat money laundering and terrorist funding. The LEI enables financial institutions to conduct fully automated, straight-through processing; by replacing outdated manual checks, the LEI increases both the speed and the effectiveness of client onboarding and ongoing compliance checks. This includes improving screening against sanctions and watch lists thereby enabling new efficiencies for both institution and client, lowering costs significantly. </p>
<p>The latest recommendation from the EC that the LEI is used, where available, for customer identification and verification in AML/CTF legislative reforms, has the potential to drastically increase the transparency of legal entities participating in financial transactions. Recent AML scandals have shown that financial criminals mostly operate through a network across borders to conceal their illicit transactions. The LEI, a global standard for unique legal entity identification, can make these connections and transactions across borders visible and easy-to-interpret to the financial institutions and Financial Intelligence Units. It can therefore contribute to the stronger authentication of entity clients, promote transparency and reduce illicit transactions.</p>
<p>By including the LEI in its AML/CFT legislative package, the EC strengthens efforts across Europe to use and reinforce global standards in the promotion of transparency and financial stability. The European Central Bank (ECB) recently recognized the benefits of extending LEI use to cover all future public reporting and financial transactions. As a result, the European Systemic Risk Board has recommended the establishment of an EU legislative framework for systemic and comprehensive adoption of LEIs across the EU by any organization involved in a financial transaction and to identify entities reporting financial information.</p>
<p>In context of the AML/CFT proposals, for those ‘obliged entities’ that want to surpass transparency goals, becoming a Validation Agent offers a vast array of business benefits. The Validation Agent role was created by GLEIF within the Global LEI System to simplify LEI issuance for clients and to deliver a variety of cost, efficiency and customer experience benefits for the Validation Agents organizations themselves. More information on the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/validation-agents">Validation Agent role can be found on the GLEIF website</a>.   </p>
<p>How has the LEI Been Referenced Within the EC’s AML/CFT Legislative Package? </p>
<p>AML / CFT Regulation <br>
As defined in Article 1, this proposal lays down rules concerning: </p>
 
 Measures to be applied by obliged entities to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing;  
 Beneficial ownership transparency requirements for legal entities and arrangements;  
 Measures to limit the misues of bearer instruments.  
 
<p>Obliged entities are defined fully in Article 3 of the proposal, but include (with certain exceptions): credit institutions; financial institutions; and various natural and legal persons acting in a professional capacity, ranging from auditors, accountants and tax advisors to legal representatives involved in certain types of transactions, including property, precious metals and stones, gambling services, crypto-asset service providers and crowdfunding service providers. </p>
<p>Reference to the LEI is made in Article 18, which is titled ‘Identification and Verification of the Customer’s Identity’. The text makes clear that where available, an LEI should be obtained by obliged entities, in order to identify a legal entity customer. </p>
<p>Revision of the 2015 Regulation on Transfer of Funds<br>
In a press release announcing the legislative package, the EC makes it clear that primary drivers for enhancements to the existing EU AML/CFT framework are “new and emerging challenges linked to technical innovation.” It names virtual currencies, more integrated financial flows in the Single Market and the global nature of terrorist organisations among these challenges. </p>
<p>The key focus of this Revision of the 2015 Regulation on Transfer of Funds ensures that EU AML/ CFT rules are extended beyond their current remit, to fully apply to the crypto sector. This will ensure full traceability of crypto-asset transfers and allow the prevention and detection of their potential use for money laundering or terrorism financing. </p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the LEI has been referenced twice within the package of legislatory proposals. </p>
 
 In section (25), which outlines that transfers of funds or crypto-assets from the Union to outside the Union should carry complete information on the payer and payee, a new requirement has been introduced: “Complete information on the payer and the payee should include the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) when this information is provided by the payer to the payer’s service provider, since that would allow for better identification of the parties involved in a transfer of funds and could easily be included in existing payment message formats such as the one developed by the International Organisation for Standardisation for electronic data interchange between financial institutions.”  
 In a later section that outlines the obligations on the payment service provider of the payer, Article 4 of the Revision proposal sets out the requirements for information that must accompany transfers of funds. In the latest revision, a new requirement for the payer’s current LEI has been added, “subject to the existence of the necessary field in the relevant payments message format, and where provided by the payer to the payer’s payment service provider….”.

<p>1.What is the mission and vision of Trust Science?</p>



<p>Trust Science ® is a FinTech SaaS that delivers Credit Bureau 2.0 ® / Credit Bureau + ™. Its mission is to help deserving people get the loans they deserve.&nbsp;The service gives lenders highly accurate scores about underbanked and financially stressed borrowers in a fair, ethical and compliant way. This solution repairs the on-ramp to the modern credit economy, improving financial inclusivity while simultaneously boosting lender profitability.</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Even in multi-billion dollar credit bureaus, data often crosses individuals, leading to frequent mix-ups and inaccurate credit reporting (i.e. lost opportunities for deserving borrowers or fraud committed by un-deserving people). With a trustworthy digital identity and interoperable digital credentials, lenders can ensure that individual data is correct and correctly attributed. As well, given the trends in Consumer Protection and Privacy laws, trustworthy identity is the first step toward returning control and consent to the use of personal data back to its rightful owners. Furthermore, in the rapidly emerging market of alternative credit underwriting, where Trust Science is a leader, digital identity enables new application processes, giving new-age credit bureaus fast and secure access to more data points for more accurate scoring. Trust Science believes that digital identity solutions will form the backbone of financially inclusive credit scoring and will be instrumental in a variety of other contexts.   </p>

<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Interoperable digital credentials will transform all economies by significantly reducing cost and time for all forms of applications and sharing sensitive, verified information.&nbsp;Trust Science is designed to be a compliant service in all jurisdictions so that it can improve borrowing outcomes for global citizens and lenders. This is evidenced, in part, by a massive patent and trademark estate (comprising over 4 dozen patents, trademarks and pending patents across 18 different countries, and counting.) To support this transformation, Trust Science is pioneering the application of digital identity in the credit reporting industry. It is a Founding Steward of the Sovrin.org Identity network alongside industry heavyweights and it has now proudly joined DIACC. It will also provide services/consulting and its Smart Consent™ software to lenders and their borrowers to enable a transition to the use of digital credentials in loan applications, as digital wallets proliferate among consumers. As well, the company is working with regulatory bodies in both Canada (OSFI) and in the U.S. (RFI submission re: Explainable AI to 5 federal agencies in June 2021) to ensure that modern technology and its capabilities are fully understood and appreciated by all stakeholders, especially the topmost banking regulators.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada undisputedly has the technological capabilities and knowledge needed to be a global leader in digital identity and trust services. A strong supporter of digital identity standards, Trust Science is excited to be a part of that leadership, especially with the Canadian government’s “User-Centric Verifiable Digital Credentials” initiatives.</p>



<p>At a practical and real-world level, Canada shares the world’s longest border with the world’s biggest and most advanced economic and technological actor.&nbsp; It is incumbent on a partner in such a relationship to meet or beat best practices in all matters of identity and services (like money transfer) that rely on trust and KYC. Turning to the global space, Canada must continue to support domestically-driven innovations to maintain its position of leadership and continue to set the global pace&nbsp;of digital identity standards in the customary Canadian way: fair, ethical, and inclusive.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>Trust Science joined DIACC to facilitate partnerships with other members that will further the adoption of emerging digital credential standards. The company believes that these partnerships will form the foundation of a strong Canadian ecosystem of digital identity companies and that all the different players’ collective&nbsp;experiences working on the cutting-edge of the tightly regulated lending industry will provide mutually valuable insights among each other.&nbsp; Trust Science looks forward to networking and collaborating with other DIACC members in a way that helps Canada maintain its reputation for having a very strong banking/lending sector and healthy financial (including Insurance industry) institutions.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Trust Science provides automated loan underwriting solutions leveraging traditional credit bureaus’ data, alternate data, and user-permissioned data. Given the risk associated with centrally stored personal data accessed during the loan application process, Trust Science aims to enable migration to decentralized digital credentials that will increase security and privacy while also significantly simplifying the application process. Put simply, Trust Science offers lending leaders a fair and ethical way of scoring financially stressed or under-banked customers, right now.</p>

 With an initial pilot complete, we look ahead to what’s next for one of the world’s largest renewable energy&nbsp;markets <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/guy5aS3GvgA">ActionVance</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/guy5aS3GvgA">Unsplash</a><p>In the world of power grids, PJM Interconnection is a household name. It is a regional transmission operator (RTO) whose service territory spans a 13-state region in the Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes, and Northeast region of the United States. It’s not huge by land area: as measured in square miles, all of PJM’s service territory could fit within the borders of France. But it is a massive electricity and renewable energy&nbsp;market.</p><p>PJM was the world’s largest competitive wholesale electricity market until the development of the European Integrated Energy Market in the 2000s. And it remains one of the world’s largest grid operators as a founding member of the GO15. On the renewable energy front, in 2020 PJM generated more renewable energy certificates (RECs) than the whole of Australia.</p><p>And so when we, Energy Web, kicked off a collaboration with <a href="https://www.pjm-eis.com/">PJM Environmental Information Services, Inc. </a>(PJM-EIS) — a subsidiary of PJM Interconnection — in late 2018, we were excited. That’s because PJM-EIS administers the Generation Attribute Tracking System (GATS), a platform for tracking and trading RECs in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>The focus of the collaboration was to build a blockchain-based pilot alongside PJM’s existing GATS system. Together, PJM-EIS and Energy Web wanted to explore the potential for bringing new functionality and benefits to GATS and evaluate how blockchain technology could be integrated into existing IT systems seamlessly and create value for PJM stakeholders.</p><p>Evaluating opportunities to modernize an existing U.S. REC&nbsp;platform</p><p>We set out to leverage the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS), an open-source tech stack of decentralized software and standards for the energy sector. More specifically, the pilot used <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-origin/">Energy Web Origin</a>, an open-source software development toolkit (SDK) for REC (and similar) tracking and trading platforms running on the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">Energy Web Chain</a>, to create new functionality for the GATS Bulletin Board and assess the potential for decentralized technologies to support wider improvements to GATS beyond the Bulletin&nbsp;Board.</p><p>The Bulletin Board is a place on GATS where REC buyers and sellers can, respectively, post their bids and asks for specific REC volumes. Actually selling or buying those RECs remains the responsibility of the counterparties in bilateral agreements. We thought a blockchain-based solution could improve that experience and increase use of the Bulletin&nbsp;Board.</p><p>Historically, the Bulletin Board has been an underutilized feature available on GATS to facilitate trading of voluntary RECs. The central aim for this pilot was to test new functionality that could enhance the Bulletin Board as a means to grow the REC market in the PJM footprint while also improving security, increasing transparency, and reducing transaction costs for PJM stakeholders. In other words, this pilot assessed how improving the technical functionality and user experience of the Bulletin Board could remove market barriers and grow the local REC market — and possibly even attract greater REC imports from other U.S. REC&nbsp;markets.</p><p>The result: a pilot for the PJM-EIS version of GATS Bulletin Board with blockchain-based REC marketplace functionality that integrated with the existing&nbsp;GATS</p><p>This spring, five PJM subscribers tested the pilot GATS Bulletin Board. Seller participants posted asks on the Bulletin Board based on actual RECs in their respective GATS accounts and buyer participants posted their REC bids based on their procurement needs. Any matches made between bids and asks then triggered notifications for participants to confirm if they wanted to complete any REC transfers, where any completed trades would link back to the legacy GATS to update the buyer and seller’s respective accounts. For this pilot, the transactions were purely test transactions and so there was no financial settlement.</p><p>Here are some screenshots from the pilot GATS Bulletin Board to give a flavor of the updated user experience (shown from the perspective of a renewable energy&nbsp;buyer):</p>  Getting a view of the overall Bulletin Board market&nbsp;activity  <p>2. Starting the renewable energy procurement journey with various search filters to place&nbsp;bids</p><p>3. Identifying verified procurement options that match with&nbsp;bids</p><p>4. Viewing completed transactions and blockchain-based proof of each transaction</p><p>“We have learned a lot about what it would take to add new technical functionalities to GATS, how to integrate blockchain-based technologies ‘under the hood’ of GATS, and how PJM stakeholders support these improvements,” said Ken Schuyler, President of PJM-EIS. “We look forward to further understanding how we can use EW-DOS to support our overall digitization efforts.”</p><p>Energy Web Origin provided the back-end infrastructure for the marketplace functionality and use of a public blockchain — the Energy Web Chain — to digitize the RECs in GATS and anchor the proof of any REC transactions that occurred on the pilot Bulletin Board&nbsp;system.</p><p>Pilot feedback and next&nbsp;steps</p><p>In post-pilot interviews, pilot participants shared overall positive feedback about their experience, especially around the level of integration with GATS, and shared how they could successfully post bids and asks for RECs from their GATS accounts.</p><p>In the end, given how energy sector market participants typically adopt new technologies in phases (rather than in one fell swoop), this pilot illustrates that it is possible to integrate blockchain-based functionalities into existing IT systems to support wider digitization and tech modernization efforts.</p><p>Nevertheless, PJM-EIS and Energy Web experienced practical implementation challenges with the pilot. The core challenge revolved around how — while it’s possible to integrate new, blockchain-based tech with legacy IT systems — this integration process takes more time than designing and implementing an entirely new IT system from scratch. This is the main reason why the pilot took more time than initially expected to implement.</p><p>The pilot also raised bigger strategic questions that PJM-EIS will continue to evaluate as it explores next steps for technical upgrades to GATS in general and the Bulletin Board in particular. For example, this pilot showed that it is technically possible to integrate new technologies on a legacy system, but cannot answer the central question as to whether or not PJM-EIS wants to make the Bulletin Board an exchange where real REC purchases (and associated financial transactions) happen. In addition, the pilot did not assess the role of using new decentralized identifier technologies that make it possible to assign every energy device a unique digital identity anchored on a public blockchain so that a given device can plug into different PJM&nbsp;markets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/pjm-eis-update-modernizing-a-legacy-u-s-rec-tracking-system-with-blockchain-based-technology-db0ad5a4f924">PJM-EIS UPDATE: Modernizing a legacy U.S. REC tracking system with blockchain-based technology</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Digital Content Assistant de <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com">Cuatroochenta</a></p><p>Alastria ID es uno de los modelos referentes de identidad digital soberana en el que han colaborado empresas como Cuatroochenta a través de la firma 4TIC, a la que adquirió en 2020. El proyecto quiere que la ciudadanía y las empresas sean propietarias de sus datos personales y que tengan el control con todas las garantías de seguridad que aporta la tecnología blockchain.</p>Sistema de funcionamiento basado en la Identidad Digital Soberana. Foto: Cuatroochenta<p>Un negocio que quiera tener una cuenta corriente en una entidad bancaria ha de facilitar a la sucursal una copia del DNI del representante legal. Si la firma tiene cuentas en otras entidades, debe ofrecer esa copia a cada uno, redoblando trámites y riesgos de seguridad, ya que esa documentación se expone muchas más veces a un posible robo de información… Esto es lo que pasa hoy en día, pero imaginemos un escenario totalmente diferente. Un escenario en el que una empresa no tiene que ofrecer ningún documento físico ni electrónico, sino que simplemente permite al banco acceder a su número de DNI, a través de su cartera digital, es decir, su wallet. Este sistema serviría también, por ejemplo, para hacer los trámites para ser proveedor de un negocio o para licitaciones en administraciones públicas. Estamos hablando de la <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/blockchain-como-garantia-de-confianza-en-los-negocios/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">identidad digital soberana</a>, conocida por sus términos en inglés como self sovereign identity&nbsp;(SSI).</p><p>La Comisión Europea ha presentado recientemente la identidad digital europea, sustentada en la SSI y en la <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/blockchain-como-garantia-de-confianza-en-los-negocios/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">tecnología blockchain</a>, que permite distribuir en una red el control de la información y validarla sin intermediarios.</p><p>Con este sistema, la ciudadanía y los negocios pasan a ser los propietarios de la identidad digital y, por tanto, de las credenciales que la conforman. Y ¿qué se entiende por credencial? Cualquier dato que identifica a una persona o empresa. Puede ser, por ejemplo, el número de DNI o NIF, el carnet de conducir, un título universitario o una aptitud profesional. Imaginemos el supuesto de una persona que debe acreditar que es mayor de edad. Con este sistema no es necesario que aporte el DNI con todos los datos personales que recoge, sino una <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">credencial verificable (VC)</a> en que una administración confirma esa mayoría de edad preservando la privacidad de los&nbsp;datos.</p><p>Es un giro y un cambio de paradigma hacia un <a href="https://elpais.com/retina/2017/06/05/tendencias/1496646930_763686.html">modelo descentralizado</a>. La Unión Europea con su <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_es">proyecto de identidad digital</a> quiere evitar que las personas cedamos y regalemos sin darnos cuenta datos a las grandes tecnológicas. En los últimos años se han implementado en toda Europa diversas iniciativas con la vista puesta en los usos de la SSI. En España uno de estos proyectos es el que ha desarrollado el consorcio multidisciplinar <a href="https://alastria.io/">Alastria</a>, del que es socio Cuatroochenta de forma colaborativa entre más de 200 miembros <a href="https://alastria.io/id-alastria/">Alastria ID</a>, un modelo técnico de identidad digital basado en los estándares internacionales y que quiere aprovechar las <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/tendencias-tecnologicas-que-marcaran-2021/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">capacidades de blockchain</a> y de la&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>Si quieres conocer cómo se construye la identidad digital, los beneficios de la SSI y las características del modelo Alastria ID puedes leer el <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/los-cimientos-de-la-identidad-digital-sobre-blockchain/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">artículo completo</a>.</p>

 Some Overviews 

<p>Blockchain Commons is getting big, so we produced some overviews of our work!</p>

<p>Video Overview. Over the last few years, Blockchain Commons has produced a number of specifications, including our fundamental work on Uniform Resources (URs), our other innovations such as Lifehashes and Object Identity Blocks, and our updates of sharding technology with SSKR. If you’re trying to get a handle on the technologies we’re using and the specifications that we’re creating with our Airgapped community, we invite you to take a look at our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">technology overview video</a>, which runs through our core conceptual and specification work one element at a time.</p>



  
<p><br></p>

<p>The Gordian Principles. We’ve also begun publishing some descriptions of what the Gordian architecture means to us. It’s focused on four principals that we believe are crucial to digital-asset management: independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. They’re all about ensuring that you’re the controller of your digital assets. Besides writing a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles">short overview</a>, we’ve also begun adding descriptions to each of our reference apps, discussing how they embody those principles.</p>

<p>And, those reference apps were our biggest news for the quarter …</p>

 Reference App Work 

<p>Our reference apps show off how Blockchain Commons’ Gordian Principles work in real life. We made great progress on them this quarter.</p>

<p>Gordian Releases. Where we had three reference apps available for beta testing in Q1, in Q2 we advanced to having two available for release from Apple.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229"></a>
Gordian Seed Tool is the app previously known as Gordian Guardian.
It allows for the management of your cryptographic seeds in a way that’s secure and resilient. You store your seeds in Seed Tool, ensuring that the data is encrypted and that it’s redundantly backed up to iCloud, and then you derive and export keys as they’re needed. As with all of the Gordian reference apps, this one demonstrates the usage of a number of Blockchain Common’s specifications, including SSKRs, UR, and even our new <code>request/response</code> airgap methodology that we just <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-001-request.md">debuted</a> this February.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070"></a>
Gordian QR Tool is a simpler tool that similarly allows for the storage of QR codes in a secure and resilient way. Thus, if you had a largely unused seed or key, you could export it as a QR and store it here. QR Tool can also be used to store other private information such as 2FA seeds or the brand-new Smart Health Cards. QR Tool recognizes many categories of QR codes, including the UR types that Blockchain Commons has defined, allowing easy categorization and sorting of your cryptographic data. Our QR Tool was slightly held back by inadequacies we found in Apple’s QR creation functions, which can produce overly large QRs. We’ve already begun work <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/QRCodeGenerator">translating a better QR library into Swift</a> and expect to integrate that into v1.1 of QR Tool in the future.</p>

<p>QR Tool and Seed Tool also offer the first demonstration of the interactions possible in a Gordian architecture. One of the most powerful examples involves Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">SSKR specification</a>. Seed Tools allows a user to not only shard a seed using SSKR, but also to encode those shares as QR codes. The encoded shares can then be given to friends and family who have QR Tool, ensuring the safe storage of all the shares required to restore your seed!</p>

<p>We have more reference app releases planned for the future. Gordian Cosigner remains available as a Testflight beta release, and is our reference app for demonstrating how to conduct airgapped signing. We are also beginning work on the Gordian Recovery app, which we announced last quarter; it’ll demonstrate methodologies for recovering assets held by third-party wallets.</p>

<p>Sweeptool Debut. Recovering funds held in a third-party HD wallet can be tricky since you don’t always know which addresses were actually used. We’ve also been attacking that problem with a command-line tool called <code>sweeptool</code>, which sweeps funds anywhere in the hierarchy defined by a descriptor. Sweeptool is the work of one of our intern graduates, and is already available as an <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/sweeptool-cli">alpha release</a>.</p>

<p>Timelock Experiments. Our current architecture for #SmartCustody depends on multisigs to allow for the partitioning of keys and the creation of resilience. However, we’re already thinking about the next generation of #SmartCustody, which will allow the use of timelocks to recover funds in the case of the incapacitation of a principal. We did some deeper investigation into miniscript this quarter, which allows for easier integration of timelocks into Bitcoin addresses, and also mapped out some new architectures for progressively sweeping funds forward to keep ahead of timelocks. However, we discovered that at this point miniscript isn’t yet integrated with the descriptor-wallets that are another of the core elements of the Gordian architecture. This prevents integration with our Gordian apps.</p>

<p>We’ve published a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Timelocks.md">preliminary paper</a> on the usage of Timelocks, but it isn’t finalized yet because of these issues. Meanwhile, one of our interns has begun work on a Rust-based Timelock project called <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli">mori-cli</a>. This work is all meant to ensure we’re ready when miniscript is added to Bitcoin Core, or when timelocks are integrated into descriptors in some other manner.</p>

 Coding Processes 

<p>Releasing apps is just one step of a larger coding process, which requires careful consideration of what languages (and libraries) to use and careful reviewing of their security.</p>

<p>Rust Focus. Sweeptool is written in Rust, which is an increasing focus at Blockchain Commons. We’ve also been using it for our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/musign-cli">musign-cli work</a> and some of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap">torgap work</a> and have touched upon it in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/18_5_Accessing_Bitcoind_with_Rust.md">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line</a>. We think that Rust is an important language for the future of Bitcoin development in large part because of its safety guarantee, including <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/22/why-rust-for-safe-systems-programming/">memory safety properties, which can resolve 70% of security problems</a>. Our main barrier for wider use of Rust has been the fact that C and C++ are the main languages used by Bitcoin Core, iOS, and Android, but we’ve already seen the start of changes there, and hope to be able to integrate Rust even more fully in the future. The fact that the Rust-based <a href="https://bitcoindevkit.org/">Bitcoin Dev Kit</a> is actually in advance of Bitcoin Core in some features is very encouraging.</p>

<p>Security Review. Bitmark, one of our Sustaining Sponsors, has hired <a href="https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security</a> to conduct a security review of our SSKR libraries, <a href="https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-shamir">bc-shamir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">bc-sskr</a>. This is crucial element in making Blockchain Commons’ specification work widely available, since it would be improper for us to review our own security code. As our first partners planning to use one of our libraries in a shipping project, as opposed to just our specifications, Bitmark is stepping up to the plate to fund the review of our core SSKR libraries. We expect this pattern to repeat with future partners and libraries in the future. It shows the power of our open libraries: future companies will be able to depend on our SSKR libraries thanks to Bitmark’s contribution, and then they’ll be able to make contributions of their own that will be much less than if they’d had to security review an entire suite of themselves.</p>

 New Docs 

<p>The blockchain infrastructure is empowered by users and developers who know how to use it properly. Teaching them is the goal of our documentation projects.</p>

<p>UR &amp; SSKR Docs. The ultimate purpose of our reference applications is to demonstrate how our new specifications can be used in actual applications. Hand-in-hand with that, we’re also producing documentation that lays out in more detail how those specifications work. We’ve begun collecting many of those docs in the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/tree/master/Docs">documents area of our crypto-commons repo</a>. This quarter we added to our docs repo with several documents about our Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction system, including <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-users.md">SSKR for Users</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-developers.md">SSKR for Developers</a>. We also released a series of articles on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md">Uniform Resources (URs)</a> intended to show developers how they’re constructed and used.</p>

<p>We are also planning further support for our interoperable specifications such as UR and SSKR at a virtual interoperable wallet specification workshop. We’re currently working on locking down a date.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Translations. Our best-known tutorial at Blockchain Commons, is our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course</a>, which we pushed to v2.0 last year and which has 1,700 stars and 100 watchers on Github. We’re thrilled that translations are now ongoing into both <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/portuguese-translation/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/spanish-translation/es">Spanish</a> thanks to a half-dozen core volunteers. Some of Blockchain Commons’ own programmers and interns entered the blockchain industry thanks to this course, so we’re looking forward to these translations opening the doors even wider.</p>

 Other Priorities 

<p>Finally, we have a lot of more varied projects that all saw some progress.</p>

<p>Our Summer Interns Have Begun Work. Thanks to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/human-rights-foundation-grants-bitcoin-defi-education-activism">a grant from the Human Rights Foundation</a>, we have a class of a dozen interns this summer. We’re engaging them with weekly calls to introduce them to crucial use cases and to let them talk with Bitcoin and Lightning experts from the industry and human-rights experts, most recently including John Callas from the EFF and Alex Gladstein from HRF.</p>

<p>Some of our human-rights-focused intern projects include a self-sovereign donation app, scripts to automate the setup of privacy and/or bitcoin services, documents on managing pseudonymity, and tracking of blockchain-based legislation.</p>

<p>Some of our more general intern projects include deployment of a full Esplora node for Blockchain Commons, the creation of scripts to make it easier for others to do so, documentation on bitcoin fee-estimation use cases, improvements to our Spotbit server including expansion of the Spotbit API and client app, and the aformentioned work on Mori and on Learning Bitcoin translations.</p>

<p>Our first completed intern ‘21 work is a short <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/15_0_Using_i2p.md">i2p chapter</a> for Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line, talking about an alternative (or supplement) to traditional Tor privacy.</p>

<p>Wyoming Testimony. Christopher’s testimony has continued in Wyoming, talking about DAO and identity, to improve and extend both laws. The most recent testimony <a href="https://youtu.be/ayQ086BVDXE?t=4060">on May 28</a> continued to work through the ramifications of the definitions of principal authority for self-sovereign identity.</p>




<p><br></p>

<p>Self-Sovereign Identity. Speaking of which, it was the fifth anniversary of the concept of self-sovereign identity, which first suggested that we should control our identities on the internet, not be beholden to centralized agencies. Christopher <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-five-years-on">wrote an article</a> for Coindesk celebrating that anniversary, talking about how far we’ve come and reflecting on how things could be improved.</p>

<p>BTCR. Finally, we’ve also been talking about another of our blockchain projects that originated in <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>: BTCR, a self-sovereign decentralized identifier that uses the Bitcoin blockchain. Recently Christopher and the other creators of BTCR talked with <a href="https://the-rubric.castos.com/episodes/the-granddaddy-of-dids">The Rubric</a> about the past and future of the DID.</p>

<p>As you can see, we’ve got lots of ongoing work that continue to expand the ideas of responsible key management and self-determination on the internet. If you’d like to support our work at Blockchain Commons, so that we can continue to design new specifications, architectures, reference applications, and reference libraries to be used by the whole community, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a>.

 Five Years of Assembly: Interdisciplinary fellowship offers paths forward in public interest technology <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/zenzele-best">Zenzele&nbsp;Best</a></p>Assembly Program logo, Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp;&nbsp;Society<p>Between 2017 and 2021, the <a href="http://bkmla.org/">Assembly</a> Program at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> (BKC) at Harvard University brought together almost 150 professionals, experts, and students to better understand and develop solutions to some of the most intractable issues in technology policy. Led by Professor <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jzittrain">Jonathan Zittrain</a> and supported by faculty, staff, and experts from across the University and the Center, the program explored topics in digital security, artificial intelligence (AI), and disinformation; produced a variety of prototypes and projects; and fostered a community that spanned across sectors and disciplines.</p><p>“Being academic isn’t, at its core, about credentials or paper-writing for its own sake,” said Zittrain. “It’s about approaching problems with humility, energy, and an open mind, attacking those problems rigorously, and reviewing whether one is even asking the right questions. Assembly was begun on the theory that people outside academia, from across disciplines and sectors, would be eager to take on problems that way, and with the overall public interest in mind, rather than the interests of one player in a larger ecosystem. We found an extraordinary number of people willing to engage in that&nbsp;spirit.”</p><p>Over five years, Assembly grew from a pilot project that brought together professionals from across sectors to a multi-pronged, interdisciplinary fellowship program that developed innovative approaches and cross-sectoral collaborations focused on the public interest. In 2019, Assembly expanded to include two additional tracks, the <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/forum-about">Forum</a> and <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/studentfellowship-2021about">Student Fellowship</a>, which convened senior leaders and Harvard students, respectively, to discuss the spread of disinformation on online platforms. In 2021 — the program’s fifth and final year — the Assembly Fellowship invited ongoing alumni project teams to return (virtually) to BKC to support their work and celebrate their continued success.</p><p>“Our initial goal with Assembly was to combine the real-world expertise of people in industry with the socially-motivated nature of academia,” said <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jordi-weinstock">Jordi Weinstock</a>, one of the founders of the Assembly Program. “From day one of the pilot year, we had no idea whether any of the projects would develop beyond a nascent stage, or even if that was a necessity. Instead, we worked to create a lasting community within the cohort, one that would continue to bring positive change for the world long after their program ended. Through the years, both the thematic focus and the people involved would change, but consistent throughout has been the strength of the Assembly community. To me, it is both a bonus and a testament to our Assemblers and staff that many projects did, in fact, flourish.”</p> Over twenty prototypes explore solutions to complex tech policy questions <p>How can we build AI systems to serve the public interest and not perpetuate or exacerbate existing inequalities? How can we improve security vulnerabilities among “<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot">Internet of Things</a>” (IoT) devices? Who should be held accountable for the spread of disinformation on social media platforms? How do we govern cyberspace across international borders?</p><p>Five years of Assembly projects have sought to make progress on complex, whole-of-society questions like these. Created as a model to help solve some of society’s most pressing issues around technologies, the program brought together a community of professionals from around the world to leverage their expertise across disciplines and actively collaborate on provocations and prototypes in the public interest.</p><p>Incoming fellowship cohorts convened at Harvard to meet each other, identify problem spaces and form project teams, and participate in programming in-residence before working asynchronously on their projects for the remainder of the four-month development period. Each cohort was supported by an expert Advisory Board of faculty and practitioners with expertise across the range of topics fellows explored. Between 2017 and 2020, four Assembly Fellowship cohorts developed twenty-one projects that aim to offer paths forward on complex challenges in the digital public sphere. As <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/hilary-ross">Hilary Ross</a>, Assembly’s program manager, put it, “Assembly created a space for people from across disciplines to come together around complex technology and policy problems, problems that at times feel intractable and really require effort from across all sectors. Through programming and projects, fellows got to both better understand those problems from varied perspectives, and collectively find paths forward and demonstrate possibilities.”</p> 2017 <p>Assembly’s pilot year in 2017 focused on the challenge of digital security and sought to answer a central question: how do we move beyond a world where virtually every computing device and network is insecure? Over four months, the sixteen professionals that comprised the <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2017people">cohort</a> explored the complex interaction between Internet governance organizations and sovereign states, the tension between the ease of disseminating information online and the interest of copyright holders, privacy advocates, and other stakeholders, and the roles of intermediaries and platforms in shaping what people can and cannot do online. The first year of Assembly produced five <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2017projects">projects</a> aimed at addressing these challenges, including: <a href="https://cleaninsights.org/">Clean Insights</a>, a privacy-oriented analytics tool and <a href="https://berkmancenter.github.io/datatransparency/">Information Fiduciaries and Data Transparency</a>, a prototype of a visualization tool that would enable companies to better document their collection and use of consumer&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>“[Assembly] provided an opportunity for participants to pop out of their usual bubbles of collaborators, to connect with committed thinkers, scholars, experts, advocates and hackers from a diverse set of contexts and experiences. Whether participating on a project or reviewing the teams’ work as [an advisor], I benefited deeply from the exposure to smart people, working collectively, to find novel approaches to difficult challenges.” — <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/nfreitas">Nathan Freitas</a>, 2017 and 2021 Assembly Fellow, 2020 Assembly&nbsp;Advisor</blockquote> 2018–2019 <p>The <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2018about">2018</a> and <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2019about">2019</a> Assembly cohorts focused on the ethics and governance of artificial intelligence. AI technology has become increasingly sophisticated over the past decade, driving innovations in industries from <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/373927">healthcare</a> to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-next-car-may-anticipate-your-needsand-let-you-add-features-on-the-fly-11625684411">travel</a> to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2020/05/18/10-ways-ai-is-improving-manufacturing-in-2020/?sh=10729b5f1e85">manufacturing</a> and becoming a feature in many <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2019/12/16/the-10-best-examples-of-how-ai-is-already-used-in-our-everyday-life/?sh=35a9e66a1171">homes</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-smartphones-artificial-intelligence-features-phones-2018-1">smartphones</a>, and <a href="https://letstalkscience.ca/educational-resources/backgrounders/ai-and-personal-vehicles">vehicles</a>. However, as AI becomes even more ubiquitous, these advances have raised new questions: how do we prevent, detect, and mitigate bias in AI systems? What factors should municipal governments consider before deciding whether to implement AI technology in a city space? What are the risks of pursuing surveillance-related AI work, and how do we mitigate them? Between 2018 and 2019, the Assembly Fellowship developed ten frameworks, tools, and other projects aimed at addressing these challenges, including <a href="https://aiblindspot.media.mit.edu/">AI Blindspot</a>, a framework for identifying and mitigating bias in AI systems and the <a href="https://datanutrition.org/">Data Nutrition Project</a>, a tool that improves the accuracy and fairness of algorithms by helping practitioners better assess datasets.</p><blockquote>“The [Assembly Fellowship]…gave me an opportunity to experiment: I wore many hats, performed many roles, and ultimately learned more about myself and what I am good at and what I want to do. In a world that pushes us to excel rather than to explore, I really appreciated the space to try things I never thought I’d do — from writing a TV pilot to building interactive data visualizations to reading hundreds of military RFPs — and being given the support to try.” — <a href="https://bcavello.com/">B Cavello</a>, 2019 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</blockquote> 2020 <p>In 2019, BKC launched Assembly: Disinformation, which built on the success of both the previous three iterations of the Assembly Fellowship and other programs at the Center. The 2016 United States general election vaulted online disinformation — and its real world ramifications — into the national discourse. In the aftermath of the election, the program sought to make progress on important questions about the United States’ vulnerability for foreign influence operations, the importance of digital literacy, and the role of social media companies in disseminating and amplifying false information. The 2020 <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2020">cohort</a> developed <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2020projects">projects</a> that included <a href="https://medium.com/@Assembly_Program/semaphore-a-tool-to-flag-online-disinformation-3a71f522eae0">Semaphore</a>, a prototype of a tool to help users publicly flag false information on platforms, <a href="https://datavoids.2020.bkmla.org/#Part1">Into the Voids</a>, a framework for evaluating <a href="https://datasociety.net/library/data-voids/">data voids</a> and the harms they pose, and <a href="https://disinfodex.org/">Disinfodex</a>, a database that indexes publicly available information about disinformation campaigns.</p><blockquote>“Outside of academia, it is so rare to be able to explore a complicated societal challenge like disinformation in a completely unconstrained way, and even rarer to actually produce a final project addressing that issue. The long-lasting relationships formed with my teammates and cohort from working on these projects will be something I take away long after the conclusion of Assembly.” — <a href="http://jennyfan.com/about">Jenny Fan</a>, 2020 and 2021 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</blockquote> 2021 <p>In its capstone year in 2021, Assembly invited back five independently continuing alumni projects: <a href="https://aiblindspot.media.mit.edu/">AI Blindspot</a>, <a href="https://cleaninsights.org/">Clean Insights</a>, the <a href="https://datanutrition.org/">Data Nutrition Project</a>, <a href="https://disinfodex.org/">Disinfodex</a>, and <a href="http://cloakpixel.com/">Cloak &amp; Pixel</a> (an evolution of the <a href="https://equalais.media.mit.edu/">equalAIs</a> project, developed by Assembly fellows in 2018). The projects address the variety of challenges that the Fellowship explored since 2017: how can companies better balance user privacy and product development? How can we improve the accuracy and fairness of algorithms to help practitioners better assess the viability of datasets? How can we better track and understand influence operations on online platforms? Through this final year of the program, the cohort learned from each other, developed new iterations of their tools, and reached new audiences. Watch the cohort’s final showcase and learn more about the teams’ work&nbsp;<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/assembly-project-fellowship-showcase">here</a>.</p> Alumni community continues to integrate new approaches to responsible technology <blockquote>“Assembly was the most interesting collection of people I’ve ever met working on some of the hardest, most important problems on the internet. One unexpected gift I got from the program was a good look at the lots of different ways to change things: there are techniques and career paths I’d never have thought about [on my own]. Through the program, I met so many tremendous folks, and I now see so much more potential.” — John Hess, 2017 and 2020 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</blockquote><p>The Assembly Fellowship, one of three of the program’s core tracks, offered a model in which professionals from across sectors could learn from, challenge, and collaborate with each other. Its impact was twofold: while Assembly produced a number of public interest-focused prototypes, frameworks, and other projects, the Fellowship’s most lasting impact might be the people that comprise its community. The Assembly Fellowship helped to shape the way its alumni think about the intersection of technology and society: since their time in the program, alumni have pursued new career paths, continued to develop their Assembly projects, and used the tools and perspectives they gained as fellows to integrate new approaches to responsible technology.</p><p>Below are some stories from former Assembly Fellows about their experience in the program and its&nbsp;impact:</p><p>“As a practitioner working at the crux of democracy and technology for over a decade, Assembly was an opportunity to connect with the latest thinking about the challenges and solutions to how technology impacts people’s lives. The program offered a space to both reflect and learn, while at the same time contributing to developing practical tools and approaches that address some of the toughest challenges we face in data-driven societies… Being part of an interdisciplinary team expanded my interest in providing a useful bridge between advancing the intellectual frontiers of how data-centric technologies impact society and translating that knowledge into action by policymakers, technologists, and civil society. This has led to an exciting new path in my career as Managing Director at Data &amp; Society, working with our research and engagement teams to shift the focus onto the people most impacted by technological change.” — <a href="https://datasociety.net/people/calderon-ania/">Ania Calderon</a>, 2019 and 2021 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</p><p>“I was grateful that Assembly brought together people who might not have otherwise found each other…[my cohort was comprised of] a bunch of brilliant thinkers and doers who may have shared values, but certainly had different approaches and backgrounds that ultimately informed our work together. Working with activists and academics, corporate professionals and service members, and creatives and educators broadened my worldview and helped me realize that I have allies in more places than I would have thought. The fellowship also gave me an opportunity to experiment: I wore many hats, performed many roles, and ultimately learned more about myself and what I am good at and what I want to do. In a world that pushes us to excel rather than to explore, I really appreciated the space to try things I never thought I’d do — from writing a TV pilot to building interactive data visualizations to reading hundreds of military RFPs — and being given the support to try.” — <a href="https://bcavello.com/">B Cavello</a>, 2019 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</p><p>“As someone working in industry, it’s almost impossible to get dedicated time to think through really challenging issues. I applied to Assembly because the fellowship gave me exactly that: a chunk of time to dig into the complexities around the ethics and governance of AI. Through Assembly, I met a truly inspirational community of people who were interested in the same questions I was asking, but coming from all sorts of backgrounds. Together, we launched a research group that continues to this day — the <a href="https://datanutrition.org/">Data Nutrition Project</a> (DNP), which builds ‘nutritional labels’ for datasets meant to increase overall awareness and health of datasets being used to build algorithmic systems. DNP, and the amazing support from the Assembly program and community since, has really changed the trajectory of my own career. I am much more aware of and focused on addressing issues of inequality in algorithmic systems, and I now bring that to everything I do during my daily work — from building COVID analytics frameworks to assessing the quality of humanitarian datasets.” — <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/kasia-chmielinski">Kasia Chmielinski</a>, 2018 and 2021 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</p><p>“Assembly, for me, achieved the delicate balance between the often slow, deeply considered pace of academia and the less thoughtful ‘move fast and break things’ mentality common in the tech industry. It provided an opportunity for participants to pop out of their usual bubbles of collaborators, to connect with committed thinkers, scholars, experts, advocates and hackers from a diverse set of contexts and experiences. Whether participating on a project or reviewing the teams’ work as [an advisor], I benefited deeply from the exposure to smart people, working collectively, to find novel approaches to difficult challenges. In addition, the access to and feedback of accomplished mentors and advisors was a critical aspect of the program, one that helped [project teams] reconsider, rethink, or more fully commit to a particular direction…In my case, I was fortunate to have Assembly be a place where a seed of an idea was germinated into a fully blossoming independent, grant-funded endeavor. Through our project [<a href="https://cleaninsights.org/">Clean Insights</a>], the Assembly Fellowship will have a lasting impact on data privacy, security and sovereignty for real people around the world.” — <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/nfreitas">Nathan Freitas</a>, 2020 Assembly Advisor, 2017 and 2021 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</p><p>“As a fellow, a member of the advisory board, and a member of the staff team, Assembly has been the most meaningful, impactful, and inspiring program I have been involved with in my more than seven years at Harvard: the support, the community, the ideas and their impact in the world are all things I expect to benefit and learn from throughout the remainder of my career. Launching and continuing to work with the <a href="https://datanutrition.org/">Data Nutrition Project</a> has been a consistent source of inspiration for me. So impressed by (and grateful for!) the reach and breadth of this program.” — <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/snewman">Sarah Newman</a>, 2020 Assembly Advisor, 2018 and 2021 Assembly Fellow, and 2019–21 Assembly&nbsp;staff</p><p>Over five years, the Assembly Fellowship brought together nearly 80 journalists, engineers, policymakers, designers, and other practitioners all deeply committed to the public interest. As the program draws to a close, BKC will continue to carry forward Assembly’s models, lessons, and approaches through the Center’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/institute-rebooting-social-media">Rebooting Social Media Institute</a> and other programs and initiatives.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/five-years-of-assembly-e52809c41749">Five Years of Assembly</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

So what is special about children’s data, and why did we choose to focus on children in particular?</p><p>Children’s rights are afforded extra protections under international human rights laws such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and data processing impacts on virtually all areas of children’s rights to some degree. States, companies and guardians have a duty under existing international human rights laws to prevent children’s personal information and data from being used to exploit them or violate their freedoms. The main difference between general data governance and children’s data governance is the presumption that children cannot effectively advance and advocate on behalf of their own interests because of their age and capacity. That is why we believe that children’s data merit special protection and a distinct consideration in international, regional and national governance regimes.</p><p>Privacy and protection of children’s information and identities are particularly important as they grow and experiment by making different choices and exploring different preferences, and as they develop their personalities. Children need to be afforded the agency to define who they are for themselves, without having their future pathways predetermined or their learning styles unduly narrowed down by algorithms.</p><p>Governance of children’s data also presents some challenging questions in relation to consent and children’s agency over their own data. Children, depending on their age, may be less suited than adults to provide meaningful consent for their data collection and use. This is because children are often less able than adults to make mature decisions on data use that may impact their future in ways that are difficult even for adults to understand. This problem is compounded by a general lack of transparency in relation to how data is used by technology companies — it is rare to see terms and conditions of data collection explained in child-friendly language or translated into minority languages. Generally there is already a power imbalance between the public and governments, companies, or other institutions that process their data, and children are in an especially vulnerable position within these relationships.</p><p>On the flip side, we also wanted to focus on children’s data because we are excited about the potential for its use for good. We know that children’s data can support research, development and provisions of services, and poor data governance can lead to a loss of potential benefits for children. In an increasingly data-driven global economy good data governance for children is essential for children, for development, and for business.</p>Festusminja, via Wikimedia Commons What does good data governance for children look like, and how do we get&nbsp;there? <p>The working group members wrote a series of background papers that informed the manifesto, covering <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/state-surveillance-and-implications-children">state surveillance and the implications for children</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/data-governance-young-people-commercialized-digital-environment">young people in the commercialized digital environment</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/covid-19-spotlight-child-data-governance-gaps">data governance gaps in light of Covid-19</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/responsible-group-data-children">responsible group data for children</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/childrens-rights-design-new-standard-data-use-tech-companies">children’s rights by design</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/governance-student-data">governance of student data</a>, and exploration of <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/fiduciary-approach-child-data-governance">a fiduciary approach to child data governance</a>.</p><p>As part of tackling the question of what good data governance for children looks like, the working group took the manifesto through a series of regional workshops in the US, Europe, Asia, and Africa, which helped to flesh out ten key action&nbsp;points:</p><p>1. PROTECT children and their rights through child-centered data governance. Such data governance should adhere to internationally agreed standards that minimize the use of surveillance and algorithms for profiling children’s behavior.</p><p>2. PRIORITIZE children’s best interests in all decisions about children’s data. Governments and companies should give priority to children’s rights in their data collection and processing and storage practices.</p><p>3. CONSIDER children’s unique identities, evolving capacities and circumstances in data governance frameworks. Every child is different, and children mature as they get older, so data governance regulations must be flexible. Marginalized children must never be left&nbsp;behind.</p><p>4. SHIFT responsibility for data protection from children to companies and governments. Extend the protection measures to all children below the age of 18, regardless of the age of&nbsp;consent.</p><p>5. COLLABORATE with children and their communities in policy building and management of their data. Through distributed models of data governance, children and their communities should have more say in how data is processed, by whom it can be processed, and with whom it can be&nbsp;shared.</p><p>6. REPRESENT children’s interests within administrative and judicial processes, as well as redress mechanisms. It is imperative that children’s rights are integrated into existing mechanisms, such as the work of data protection authorities.</p><p>7. PROVIDE adequate resources to implement child-inclusive data governance frameworks. Data protection authorities and technology companies must employ staff who understand children’s rights, and governments should allocate funding for regulatory oversight.</p><p>8. USE policy innovation in data governance to solve complex problems and accelerate results for children. Policy innovation can help public authorities to make the most of data, while at the same time safeguarding children’s rights.</p><p>9. BRIDGE knowledge gaps in the realm of data governance for children. There are some urgent knowledge gaps that need further research to ensure that data governance regulations are evidence-based.</p><p>10. STRENGTHEN international collaboration for children’s data governance and promote knowledge and policy transfer among countries. This Manifesto calls for greater global coordination on law and policy. Uncoordinated national-level data governance laws can lead to competing assertions of jurisdiction and conflict.</p><p>At the time of writing, increased efforts are being made to regulate the technology sector in all regions. At the same time, promising local and national initiatives are exploring ways to manage data in the public interest. A key takeaway from this manifesto is that children’s rights need to be front and centre of all of these new data governance initiatives, rather than being side-lined. This is increasingly important in a world in which children’s data cannot always easily be distinguished from adult’s data, and children are often impacted by data processing even when they are not the primary intended users of a digital platform or&nbsp;service.</p><p>You can read the full manifesto <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/good-governance-childrens-data">here</a>, which contains rich information about many of the child rights issues impacted by data processing and elaborates on the ten action points listed&nbsp;above.</p><p>Watch Urs Gasser, former Executive Director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society — Harvard University; Jasmina Byrne, Chief of Policy, Office of Global Insight and Policy — UNICEF; and Emma Day, UNICEF Consultant, discussing the manifesto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g309A5Gd2_s">here</a> with a panel of&nbsp;experts:</p>  Julie Brill, Chief Privacy Officer, Corporate Vice President, and Deputy General Counsel of Global Privacy and Regulatory Affairs — Microsoft;  Dorothy Gordon, Chair of the Inter-Governmental Council of the UNESCO Information For All Programme; and  Riita Vanska, Specialist in the IHAN (Human-Driven Data Economy) Project — SITRA.  <p>For further information contact Jasmina Byrne: <a href="mailto:jbyrne@unicef.org">jbyrne@unicef.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/why-all-data-governance-needs-to-consider-childrens-rights-8b218a825a08">Why all data governance needs to consider children’s rights</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation announced recently a new mechanism for rewarding and funding work in the common interest of its membership, the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/introducing-dif-grants/">DIF Grants Program</a>. The Steering Committee ratified an addendum defining these collaborations between a specific DIF working group and a grant sponsor, and this shiny new tool sits ready to be debuted in the toolkit available to DIF community work. &nbsp;DIF's work is leveling up with this new mechanism for transparently funding work that supports DIF's mission and benefits the membership as a whole.</p><p>The first such grant was initiated by Microsoft, which has a long history of collaborations in DIF. Of the various modalities described by the grant program, The Claims and Credentials Working Group will be overseeing a new work item open to all DIF members that creates and harden a JWS test suite, with this grant funding a lead editor to drive the work and keep it to a pre-determined timeline, paid upon stable and complete release. </p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@natasyachen">Natasya Chen</a> History <p>Pamela Dingle, co-chair of the Interoperability WG, identified a recurring theme in conversations about interoperability across the great "JSON"/"JSON-LD" divide: while considerable cross-vendor, cross-stack alignment had happened over the last years to address many other aspects of credential exchange and identifier resolution, "translation issues" and varying interpretations of the JSON sections of the VC data model specification lead to divergent ways of structuring, defining, signing, and parsing VCs in JWT form. &nbsp;The kinds of signature suite definitions that define Linked Data Proofs made strange bedfellows with the in-built mechanisms of JWT, which were hardened and commoditized earlier. &nbsp;This results in a slightly "balkanized" landscape of VC-JWTs that make different concessions to the expectations of JSON-LD-native parsers and systems.</p><p>Initially, the idea of iterating one or more foundational specifications seemed a natural solution: a few key sections of any specification could be made more explicit, more normative, or less ambiguous. But just as the plural of anecdote is not data, so too is the plural of specifications not disambiguation. Another tack was chosen: implementers of the existing specification would come together and compare their running code to identify every difference and incompatibility, defining a test suite that interpreted the current specification. &nbsp;They might still produce a list of changes they would like to see in a future specification, and that list might contain some contentious items that take a long time to align. &nbsp;But in the meantime, they would have a practical roadmap to alignment and a benchmark for conformance to drive interoperability amongst each other and clarity for external interoperability.</p> A signature suite that spans two worlds <p>The specification under test in this new work item is <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">Json Web Signature 2020 </a>("JWS2020" for short), a CCG signature suite that defines how the signature mechanisms and data structures native to "detached signature" JWS tokens can be parsed as <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a>. The signature mechanisms of the <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/jwt-jws-and-jwe-for-not-so-dummies-b63310d201a3">JWT world</a> and the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Feb/att-0130/VerifiableTrustStandards.png">LDP world</a> are quite different– bridging them requires a deep understanding of both: differing security models, canonization and serialization complexities, explicit reliance on <a href="https://www.iana.org/protocols">IANA registries</a>, <a href="https://json-ld.github.io/rdf-dataset-canonicalization/spec/">URDNA dataset normalization</a>, and the like. &nbsp;Advanced topics, even for this blog!</p><p>Understanding such a specification on a deep intellectual level and understanding its design decisions requires a firm grasp on all these complexities spanning two very different engineering traditions. Implementing the specification, however, should not; to be blunt, our community cannot afford such understanding gating off successful implementation, particularly if industrial adoption of decentralized identity is a shared goal. &nbsp;Before the specification gets iterated, it needs to be testable, and even more implementable than it already is.</p><p>This is where a test suite offers pedagogical tool for first-time implementers, as well as a negotiation tool for seasoned veterans and large corporations managing vast roadmaps and production development pipelines. While many DIF members do not encode VCs in JWT form, this grant is clearly in the common interest because mainstream adoption will indisputably benefit from a clearer, more explicitly-defined, and definitively-testable "normative VC-JWT".</p> Selection Process <p>From 26 July 2021 to 9 August 2021, the chairs fielded applications through a google <a href="https://forms.gle/hPCNWaAQZpLFZyXd7">form</a>, and submitted all valid application to <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/claims-credentials/tree/main/grants/grant_1/applications">github</a> for posterity. &nbsp;The selection criteria for the work item lead is as follows:</p>  familiarity with JWS mechanics and common JOSE libraries/best-practices  experience with automated testing, vector design, and test scripts/suites  familiarity with LD Proofs and signature suites generally  familiarity with JSON/JSON-LD interop problems, at the semantic, signature-verification, and representation/parsing levels   Grantee Announcement <p>On 12 August 2021, The Claims &amp; Credential (C&amp;C) Working Group at DIF gladly announced Transmute Industries as the recipient of the first DIF Grant to provide a JWS Test Suite for Verifiable Credentials. One of the chairs, Martin Riedel, summarized the chairs' decision thusly:<br><br>Transmute has been a thought leader in the SSI space for years and uniquely fits the requirement profile laid out in the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/dif-grant-1-jws-test-suite/">Grant announcement</a>.</p>  Orie Steele, the CTO of Transmute, is the initiating author of, lead editor of, and main contributor to <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">the (LD-) JSON Web Signature 2020</a>.  Transmute has a strong background in TDD and is a strong proponent of delivering test vectors with specifications in order to achieve greater implementation-level interoperability. Examples include Test Vectors in <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/sidetree.js/tree/main/packages/test-vectors">Sidetree.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/did-key.js/tree/main/packages/did-key-test-vectors">did-key.js</a>.  The company already provides integrated libraries to support (LDS)-VC and JWT-VC side-by-side, demonstrating their familiarity with both representations. See <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/verifiable-data/blob/c61c2eeff859a902cfbaf375424b3b5cfa519ea6/packages/vc.js/README.md">vc.js</a>.  Lastly, Transmute has a strong track record of making specifications and libraries accessible to the general public in a variety of deployed web-projects (<a href="https://did.key.transmute.industries/">https://did.key.transmute.industries/</a>, <a href="https://wallet.interop.transmute.world/">https://wallet.interop.transmute.world/</a> and others…)  <p>Therefore we regard Transmute Industries as the ideal candidate to provide a comprehensive JWS test suite for LDS-VC and JWT-VC and support the community interactions around this project within DIF’s C&amp;C Group.</p> Next Steps <p>The new work item will be announced and regular meetings initiated at the 23 August meeting of C&amp;C– if you are interested in participating, please attend and/or drop a note in the C&amp;C slack channel.</p>

<p>As many people working in the digital identity, security and privacy spaces will know, the Privacy Paradox is the discrepancy between an individuals’ intentions to protect their privacy and how they actually behave in the online world.&nbsp; The relationship between an individuals’ intentions to disclose personal information and their actual personal information disclosure behaviours, can often be very different.<br><br>Many surveys have shown that privacy is a primary concern for people across the globe in our digital age.&nbsp; However, on the other hand large numbers of people freely divulge personal information in exchange for services and convenience, often for relatively small rewards such as interacting with others within a social network.<br><br>This inconsistency of privacy attitudes and privacy behaviour is often referred to as the Privacy Paradox – people expressing privacy concerns often fail to act in accordance with them.<br><br>There have been many explanations for the Privacy Paradox.&nbsp; Examples being that people:</p>



<p>find it difficult to associate a specific value to their privacy and therefore, the value of protecting it</p>



<p>do not consider their personal information to be their own and might not appreciate the need to secure it</p>



<p>lack awareness of their right to privacy or privacy issues&nbsp;</p>



<p>believe their desire for a fully personalised experience outweigh the potential risks from big tech companies using their data for profiling.</p>



<p>Others may have chosen to take it as a sign that, despite what people say, they really just don’t care about their privacy and have used it as an excuse to look at increasingly invasive methods for monetising personal data.<br><br>Well, hopefully as pointed out&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbird/">Richard Bird</a>, Ping Identity’s Chief Customer Officer at the&nbsp;<a href="https://identiverse.com/">Indentiverse conference</a>&nbsp;in Denver a few weeks back, this later explanation ran into a seemingly solid dead end earlier this year, when with great fanfare (and strong disagreement from the likes of Facebook) Apple released iOS 14.5 and began enforcing App Tracking Transparency.<br><br>All being well, most people should now be aware that the latest release of iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV apps are required to request a user’s permission to track their activity across multiple apps for data collection and ad targeting purposes.<br><br>The early data is not looking good for app developers and advertisers who rely on targeted mobile advertising for revenue.&nbsp; While the worldwide opt-in rate has been creeping up, as of 28 June (2 months into the release), it is still only at 17%.&nbsp; The US only figure is even lower, at 9%.<br><br>So ultimately if people are now showing they do care about privacy when they are given the choice, why has the Privacy Paradox been so persistent over the last ten years or so?<br><br></p>



<p>Is it simply that to date people have really not had a choice?&nbsp; Or perhaps more starkly, the only choice they have had was to not use a service at all?&nbsp; Is the greatest example of “an offer you can’t refuse” the ACCEPT button on the Terms of Use page?<br><br>Hopefully we are now heading into a time when the Privacy Paradox will be no more. A time when people are offered a genuine choice about sharing their personal information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>

<p>Boardroom, the governance middleware platform that powers some of Web3's biggest DAOs, has gone live on Ceramic mainnet. Among the many new features built on Ceramic, Boardroom is debuting an Ideation feature that lets protocol contributors suggest, discuss, and pressure test ideas in a collaborative, censorship-resistant, and fully decentralized way.</p><p>Want to try Boardroom’s new Ideation feature? Visit the <a href="https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/ideation">ShapeShift DAO</a>.</p> What is Boardroom? <p><a href="https://boardroom.info/">Boardroom</a> is addressing the fragmented governance landscape with a simple and transparent platform for stakeholder management over DAOs and protocols.</p><p>As DeFi and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) have exploded in popularity, so has experimentation in new governance methods and tooling. This has led to massive market fragmentation, with no unified experience that serves all aspects of governance together. Today, proposal information, discussion, voting, and execution are splintered across many platforms.</p><p>Boardroom intends to fix this. They are building a powerful governance platform that allows many different governance tools to plug into a single seamless framework that can serve an organization throughout all stages of its governance lifecycle.</p> Governance is more than voting <p>Voting is often considered a critical part of governance for DAOs, but voting is only the tip of the governance iceberg. Long before any votes are cast, ideas are generated, discussed, signaled, and revised - then they come to a vote and potentially move to on-chain execution. Today, this frequently happens across many platforms and is often done implicitly through back-channels rather than in a clear and explicit way. This process is full of friction and often results in lackluster participation and suboptimal decision-making.</p><p>Good governance requires context around all the moving parts, and that was Boardroom's founding motivation: to bring context to governance by unifying the disparate pieces and making sure the relevant information can be surfaced in an easy and clear way to participants.</p>The portal pulls in profiles, project information, discussion forums, Snapshot votes, ideation tools, and more.<p>The Boardroom SDK normalizes data and governance-related actions from across multiple governance frameworks and lets projects build their own, into a single standardized platform. Built on the Boardroom SDK, Boardroom's governance portal provides a consistent, low-friction interface for community members to interact and engage with distributed governance.</p><p>As they were building Boardroom, the team recognized that two critical aspects were missing from most governance tools:</p>  The social layer: Contextualized discussion and debate  The people layer: Rich, pseudonymous reputations   The social layer: Contextualized discussion and debate <p>While much emphasis is put on formal proposals and votes, the Boardroom team found that ideation and discussion, while softer, are more influential in governing the direction of projects. Kevin Nielsen, Boardroom co-founder:</p><blockquote>The vote is extremely important to actually anchor a specific decision, but the most important part of the actual process is coordinating the human and social layer.</blockquote><p>To elevate this part of the governance process and connect it to decision-making, Boardroom is building a set of ideation and forum tools.</p><p>On the Boardroom app, each governance proposal will include its own forum for discussion on the same page, presented in a unified experience - with participation restricted to token holders in the network.</p><p>Additionally, a new tool designed for ideation allows the community to suggest, show support for, and discuss new ideas before moving to a formal vote. Ideation is a way to get more people involved in the process in a clear, contextualized, and collaborative way. After debuting the Ideation feature last week with the Shapeshift DAO, their community has already <a href="https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/ideation/kjzl6cwe1jw145n4mqq47jgbzojg9q07zgvnx0u2xy95rexpwo9kul4xydei9qt">generated and discussed</a> several new ideas using Ideation. Here's a preview:</p> Ceramic Streams: Web3-native content for DAOs <p>In governance, forum posts and discussions must be trustless and censorship-resistant, or else protocol governance could be shaped by a single party with the power to warp this crucial part of the process - including Boardroom. Storing discussion threads on a server would leave this data susceptible to corruption and posts couldn't just be stored on vanilla IPFS without a management layer to link posts, reactions, and responses together into a consistent thread.</p><p><a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> provided a perfect solution for this user-generated content, with signed streams of content persisted on a decentralized network. Because Ceramic content is authenticated with the same decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that sit at the heart of <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/identity/idx/">IDX</a> and Boardroom's user profiles, users can begin posting to forums without the need to authenticate in a new way. Each piece of content is signed, stored, and controlled by users, then aggregated into the complete thread by the application.</p><p>This approach provides a lightweight way to manage rich user content and enables full portability and composability of data. Other governance applications could easily build on top of the same ideation threads outside of the Boardroom UI by referencing the same Ceramic streams or discovering them through a users' IDX. This paves the way for a consistent ideation and discussion layer that can be used everywhere across the governance ecosystem.</p> The people layer: Rich, pseudonymous reputations <p>To be maximally effective, governance delegates and participants must be able to build and leverage a reputation. The anonymity provided by obscure hex addresses might be sufficient for one-off financial transactions, however governance is a long-term game and requires continuity across repeated social interactions. For example others might want to know, "Who are the delegates that are consistently making good suggestions, proving their intent, and putting skin in the game?" Says Nielsen:</p><blockquote>What we want to highlight with voter profiles is not about real-world identity. It's about mapping stakeholders in the network to their on-chain activity, their previous decisions, and their role. It's contextualizing how they fit into that specific DAO, or ecosystem, or decision.</blockquote><p>The fact that many users maintain multiple on-chain accounts and wallets adds complexity to this goal. While this practice may be good for opsec and privacy, it makes it more difficult to construct a unified governance experience for users across all of their accounts. To solve for this, Boardroom needed a way to allow users to link many accounts (and their interactions) together into a unified identity without compromising a user's desire for privacy.</p> Ceramic IDX: Aggregated identities for users <p>This is why Boardroom is moving their identity system and user profiles to <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX</a> - the identity protocol built on top of Ceramic. In addition to storing profiles and other arbitrary information, IDX lets users link multiple on-chain accounts to the same identity, as well as prove ownership of various Web2 accounts such as Twitter, Github, and Discord.</p><p>As more projects like Rabbithole, Sourcecred, and Gitcoin begin to also use IDX for identity and user data storage, a user's history of on-chain and off-chain transactions can aggregate into a unified, cross-platform reputation which can be used everywhere across the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>All of this information stored in IDX results in a rich source of user context which doesn't just aid the voting process, but rather adds value to every stage of engagement and governance across the Web3 ecosystem — all while staying pseudonymous.</p> Connecting the governance ecosystem <p>With Ceramic and IDX, Boardroom is building a DAO governance platform that brings together the on-chain, social, and human layers in a way that is lightweight and ready to scale. Said YJ Kim, engineer and co-founder of Boardroom:</p><blockquote>We initially thought we'd need to use Discourse forums for ideation. But data is not easy to fetch from the Discourse API, we can’t make a PR to suit our needs since it’s closed source software, and each integration required the forum admins to manually whitelist our IP.</blockquote><p>IDX allows Boardroom to build a focused, web3 version such that future applications both within Boardroom and in the broader governance ecosystem don’t have to face those hurdles. Everything is just...there. That not only makes future iterations easier, but also if a user begins using some other application built on IDX, we’ll be able to easily plug that data right into our portal if we wanted to - and vice versa.</p> What's next for Boardroom? <p>Boardroom recently announced the addition of projects using Governor Alpha, Governor Bravo, and AAVE-based governance frameworks to their platform, adding to existing integrations such as Snapshot. Any projects using these frameworks can easily onboard to Boardroom's platform and use their governance portal interface to vote, delegate, ideate, track treasury distributions, and more.</p><p>For projects using modified versions of these frameworks, Boardroom will work with teams to build adapters as needed.

  <p>The Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF) is proud of its ongoing transparency initiatives. Namely its open approach to providing unrestricted access to the latest LEI data from around the world with the Quarterly LEI System Business Reports, which are made publicly available free of charge. Through this ‘LEI in Numbers’ blog series, GLEIF aims to highlight key data from the latest report, explaining trends and profiling successes from the global LEI rollout. </p>
<p>The latest report, covering Q2 2021, shows that 58,000 new LEIs were issued globally during that period. Issuance was slightly lower than the previous quarter (68,000 issued in Q1), however this trend is quite common during the second quarter of the year, as the world moves into the slower summer months. The overall picture is very encouraging; in Q2 2021, total LEI issuance grew by 3.3% and the total number of active LEIs now stands as 1.82 million. </p>
<p>For a further summary of the past quarter’s data, the below infographic contains the key statistics from Q2 2021. </p>
<a href="https://www.gleif.org/thumbs/newsroom/blog/q2-2021-in-review-the-lei-in-numbers/gleif_jul21-1-750x1937.jpg"></a>
<p>For the first time, Turkey emerges as the largest growth market in Q2, with an impressive growth rate of 22.9%. This is one of the highest growth rates seen this year. This was driven largely by a regional deadline to map LEIs to legacy international securities identification numbers, in line with the joint initiative from the Association of National Numbering Agencies and GLEIF. In addition, Iceland has doubled its quarterly growth rate when compared to the previous quarter (19% in Q2, up from 9.2% in Q1). </p>
<p>While remaining high overall, there was a nominal decline in renewal rates across both EU and non-EU jurisdictions throughout the past quarter (64.3% down from 66%). In line with fluctuations in issuance and growth, it is normal for renewal rates to vary from quarter to quarter. GLEIF advocates for LEI renewals to be made mandatory whenever LEI issuance is mandatory. The prevention of lapsed credentials by proactive renewal of LEIs on an annual basis ensures that the Global LEI Index continues to provide the most accurate and up-to-date data as possible. This benefits the entire ecosystem and all users of LEI data, who rely on its accuracy to make informed business decisions with confidence. </p>
<p>For the full report which includes further detail on the status of LEI issuance and growth potential, the level of competition between LEI issuing organizations in the Global LEI System and Level 1 and 2 reference data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Reports page.</p>
<p>If you are interested in reviewing the latest daily LEI data, our Global LEI System Statistics Dashboard contains daily statistics on the total and active number of LEIs issued. This feature now enables any user to review historical data by geography, increasing transparency on the overall progress of the LEI.</p>

 🚀 Foundation News 
 DIF "Frequently Asked Questions" Knowledgebase 
<p>DIF has launched a massive <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/">knowledgebase</a>, structured as a long series of frequently-asked questions and answers. This synthesizes a year of educational efforts in the interop WG, blog posts, newsletters, and many other DIF inputs in a format we hope will be useful as a reference and onboarding document throughout the decentralized identity space.  Please peruse it, particularly the sections about your personal research focus and/or your company's specialty and products, opening issues or PRs on github wherever you feel a correction or addition is needed.  This is intended as a community resource, so PRs are open to your input!</p>
 Interop WG election 
<p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/interop/">Interoperability WG</a> is seeking nominations for new chairs. The group is hoping to pivot to a greater focus on testing, so candidates with experience scripting tests or making specs testable (whether in decentralized identity contexts or otherwise) are particularly welcome. For details about the ballot, visit the mailing list or slack channel.</p>

 Funding is allocated to projects using short research cycles targeting the most promising ideas. Each of the selected projects pursues its own objectives, while the NGI RIAs provide the program logic and vision, technical support, coaching and mentoring, to ensure that projects contribute towards a significant advancement of research and innovation in the NGI initiative. 
 The focus is on advanced concepts and technologies that link to relevant use cases, and that can have an impact on the market and society overall. Applications and services that innovate without a research component are not covered by this model.

TLDR; WACI isn’t being donated as a snapshot or as a reference implementation of a finished protocol; it’s being donated as a starting point for an ongoing work item in C&amp;C WG that will round out the spec to be more robust and flexible, after the WACI-PEx profile has been finished and there is feedback to consider from implementers of it, and/or of other applications.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[DIF focuses on three distinct] “layers”, each of which has its own interoperability challenges that seem most urgent. It is [the Interop WG's] contention that each of these could be worked on in parallel and independently of the other two to help arrive at a more interoperable community-- and we will be trying to book presentation and discussion guests in the coming months to advance all three.</p>

				 <p>KP4 to join the Board of aNewGovernance AISBL:</p>
<p>Because human-centric data infrastructure has to be the new global model across all sectors, moving away from platform-centric and state-centric current situations, we are delighted to announce Toulouse-based OKP4 is joining our Brussels-based International Association</p>
<p>As the Data Strategy and the Data Spaces are being put in place in Europe, the other main priority of the EU27 is the Green Deal, probably with even more impact. We are therefore delighted to welcome OKP4 which is bridging both priorities:</p>
<p>“In today’s data-driven society, the success of any organization relies on knowledge extracted from relevant data. Paradoxically, 70% of data produced by companies is not exploited. Worse, data is almost never shared between stakeholders due to lack of standards, trust and/or common interests.</p>
<p>Because data is the only asset whose value increases when it is shared, OKP4 (Open Knowledge Platform for) proposes an infrastructure where stakeholders can share their data without exchanging it with the others. Our infrastructure indexes heterogeneous data and services (AI) to produce on-demand knowledge without disclosing the data. Another particularity of OKP4 is to fairly reward knowledge contributors: it aligns interests between parties, within a framework of security and mutual consent allowing trustworthy collaboration. We believe the current data economy helped by data marketplaces is just a transition towards a more efficient and fairer knowledge economy helped by actors such as OKP4.</p>
<p>OKP4 focuses primarily on the field of agriculture, but is a toolbox that could and will be applied to any data-based usecase. Today, we help organisations extract value from their data and help them build multiparty data-sharing ecosystems for maximum mutual benefits.”</p>
<p>In recognition to its valuable contribution, OKP4 will be represented in the aNewGovernance Board by its President, Emmanuel Aldeguer.</p>
<p>Brussels, Toulouse, 15 July 2021</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has released Gordian Seed Tool, a new iOS app that allows for the creation, storage, backup, and transformation of cryptographic seeds is now available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Apple appstore</a>. It is an independent, private, and resilient vault, which can protect the most important underlying secret used by most cryptocurrencies: the cryptographic seed.</p>

 Read More 



<p>Though most wallets focus on the private keys used to unlock their cryptocurrency transactions, Gordian Seed Tool takes a step back and allows you to manage the fundamentals upon which private keys are built: entropy and seeds. You can use coin flips, die rolls, card draws, or iOS randomness as the entropy to generate your seeds, or you can import them from other applications. Using those seeds, Gordian Seed Tool can then derive unique, non-correlatable public and private keys as you need them.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The focus of Gordian Seed Tool is to protect your seeds. It does so by supporting new approaches to security such as QR-based airgaps, where you store your secrets on a closely held device that isn’t fully networked, such as an offline device in airplane mode, or a strongly protected device like the secure enclave in Apple’s iPhone and more modern Macinotoshes. You then communicate with that device primarily through QR codes or text that can easily be transmitted across that gap of air. Your seeds are thus protected by modern mobile-device security such as data encryption, trusted hardware, and biometric access protection.</p>

<p>That data encryption comes about through Apple’s trusted encryption routines. Seed Tool then adds resilience through integration with iCloud. If your choose for your mobile iOS device to have a network connection, its seeds will be stored in iCloud using end-to-end encryption. If you lose your device, you can retrieve those seeds with a replacement device logged into the same Apple account. (If you prefer, you can also use a cellular networked device, such as an iPod Touch or wifi-only iPad, leveraging airplane mode, to entirely ensure that your seeds never leave your device.)</p>

<p>You’ll be able to easily identify your seeds using the Blockchain Commons <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-002-digest.md#object-identity-block">object identity block</a>, which includes a visual lifehash, a human-readable name, an icon, and an abbreviated digest. Put them together and you should be able to recognize each seed at a glance.</p>

<p>Besides generating seeds, storing them, and backing them up, Gordian Seed Tool can also transform your seeds. It can derive popular Bitcoin and Ethereum public and private keys from your seeds, answer requests for other derivations, encode seeds as bytewords, BIP39 words, or hex, or shard them into SSKR shares and save them to different locations or as social recovery with your family, friends and close colleagues. Your seed is the basis for a whole tree of secure data, and Gordian Seed Tool gives you access to all of it.</p>

<p>Gordian Seed Tool is just one of several Blockchain Commons apps that demonstrate the Gordian principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> offers a way to store confidential QRs such as 2FA seeds, SSKR shares, and (for that matter) cryptoseeds. Our forthcoming Gordian Cosigner will demonstrate how to easily manage Bitcoin transactions across an Airgap.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/3box-labs-a-future-on-ceramic-network/">3Box Labs is sunsetting 3Box products</a> in favor of the new and more powerful combination of <a href="http://developers.ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-11/CIP-11.md">Identity Index (IDX)</a> protocol. This post provides a short tutorial on how to update your application to load user profiles using the Self.ID SDK instead of the 3Box profiles API. Making this upgrade ensures your application will always be loading the most current profiles for your users.</p> Why use Self.ID instead of 3Box? <p>Migrating your application from using 3Box to Self.ID for fetching user profiles will ensure you are always querying up-to-date profiles for your users, whether a given user has migrated from 3Box to Ceramic/IDX or not.</p><p>As Ceramic mainnet goes live, existing 3Box users will have their profiles migrated over to IDX. Updating a user's IDX requires the user to be authenticated and sign the updates, so this will not happen all at once. Instead, the first time a user interacts with a Ceramic-enabled app that uses <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/authentication/3id-did/3id-connect/">3ID Connect</a> for authentication they will be prompted to migrate their account from 3Box to IDX and the data will be transferred in the background for them.</p><p>To make sure you are accurately pulling profiles for all users, we recommend upgrading to IDX ASAP. The 3Box API will keep working for the immediate future. However, if you do not upgrade you will only load outdated profiles from the 3Box API for users who have migrated. The Self.ID API solves this by returning an IDX profile for migrated users and falling back to 3Box profiles for users who have not yet migrated.</p>  How to query profiles with Self.ID <p>This tutorial will show you how to fetch profiles in order to display them in your application's UI. The code below allows your app to display an IDX profile if one exists, and if not, will fall back to displaying a legacy 3Box profile.</p><p>First, we need to install the following packages of the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/overview/">Self.ID SDK</a>:</p> <code>npm install @self.id/core @self.id/3box-legacy</code> <p>Now let's import our dependencies:</p> <code>import { Core } from '@self.id/core'
import { getLegacy3BoxProfileAsBasicProfile } from '@self.id/3box-legacy'</code> <p>Now let's load a profile for a user. Notice below that we first try to load the profile using the <code>core.get</code> method. This attempts to retrieve the user's <code>basicProfile</code> from IDX, however if one is not present because the user has not yet migrated to Ceramic/IDX, then we can fallback to use the <code>getLegacy3BoxProfileAsBasicProfile</code> function to get the user's profile from the 3Box API.</p> <code>const core = new Core({ ceramic: 'https://gateway.ceramic.network' })

const ethAddress = '0xabc123...'
let profile = await core.get('basicProfile', ethAddress + '@eip155:1')

if (!profile) {
  profile = await getLegacy3BoxProfileAsBasicProfile(ethAddress)
}
console.log(profile)
</code> <p>You may have noticed that the Ethereum address is concatenated with <code>@eip155:1</code>. This is because the <code>core.get</code> method can be used to lookup data for accounts on any blockchain. <code>eip155:1</code> is simply the blockchain namespace for Ethereum mainnet. See the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md">CAIP-10 spec</a> for more details.</p> Questions or support? <p>We're always available to answer any questions and assist you through this transition period.

 Internal benefits, external benefits, training, and communication <p>In <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/badges-for-digital-transformation-7e9e1a17e714">our last post</a>, we talked about some strategies for implementing badges. In this post, we’ll talk about specific benefits in using badges for digital transformation and related strategic work.</p><p>Open Recognition Pathways support strategic goals like staff development and retention, community outreach and engagement, as well as promotional or marketing initiatives.</p>The More You See by Bryan Mathers is licenced under&nbsp;CC-BY-ND What are open recognition pathways? <p>Open Recognition Pathways are constructed from Open Badges. These badges are verifiable, digital artifacts that show a skill or achievement, and are shareable across the web. They appear as a digital image, which once clicked, presents data about the badge, including the criteria for earning it. They can be awarded, issued and earned by anyone and can be connected to form pathways that signpost additional opportunities.</p><a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/IDB_Credentials_Workshop_Outputs#/media/File:Where_are_the_credential_sized_holes.png">Where are the credential sized holes</a> by Bryan Mathers is licenced under&nbsp;CC-BY-ND How could pathways benefit an organisation?  1. Internal&nbsp;benefits   Train up your staff. Badges can package learning criteria up and show a staff members motivation to learn. They can be used to help validate promotions and show a staff member’s commitment to professional development.  Retention. Since badges provide recognition of an individual’s skills, they can help employees feel valued and seen, which promotes retention.  Skills search and skills gaps identification. Badge portfolios provide an easily searchable directory of organisational skills, making it easy to identify staff with relevant skills for new projects or skills gaps that should be&nbsp;plugged   2. External&nbsp;benefits The Four Stages of Engagement by Bryan Mathers is licenced under&nbsp;CC-BY-ND  Open Engagement. Badges make it easy for the earner to demonstrate their skills and values. Contributor Badges earned from a particular organisation, for example, can help a contributor show the skills applied during their open contribution. They also highlight the social values and donation of time they have given to an organisation. These benefits can increase volunteerism and help motivate further engagement with the organisation  Outreach. Badges can be shared across the web and recipients are often proud to share their achievement. Badges issued can have branding and link back to the organisation. These activities can deliver meaningful marketing wins  Pipeline. Badges can form pathways towards additional badges and opportunities. Low level badges can be the start of routes towards more meaningful engagement, potentially providing a pipeline of interested and talented people who can contribute to, and further the work of an organisation  The Story of a Journey by Bryan Mathers is licenced under&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a> Let’s get more&nbsp;specific <p>Let’s explore in more detail how they impact three specific departments / initiatives:</p> 3. Badges for internal&nbsp;training   Provide recognition of learning — people who have taken a training can show that they have done so. They can also use a badge to share what they’ve learned and (humble) brag about their accomplishments amongst their colleagues.  Internal/External Marketing — People are generally proud to share their achievements. This can drum up support for your programme internally, and it can help position an organisation as a ‘learning organisation’ that invests in its&nbsp;staff   4. Amplifying communications   Ask for contributions — We know that <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/10-reasons-why-people-contribute-to-open-source-d13b86b1e9d3">people contribute as a way to learn new skills</a>, build reputation and to belong to a community with similar values. Contributors who are recognised are likely to share that recognition, and as an added bonus, they’ll link back to the organisation that recognised them.  Provide pathways to further engagement — Since badges can be connected to form pathways, you can send your audience on a journey that helps them get to know your community and become further engaged in the work that you&nbsp;do.   How do WAO approach this&nbsp;work? Disco (very) by Bryan Mathers is licenced under&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a><p>We generally see three phases of&nbsp;work:</p>  A discovery phase into how badges could support your strategic goals, leading to a badge strategy. We usually recommend having both internal badges to help staff development and retention, as well as more contributor focused badges to promote community outreach and engagement.  Next we explode that strategy into a project plan for badges. We figure out how to scaffold the development of the badges and the promotion of them with your organisation.  Implementation! Rolling out new badges is pretty easy once they exist. If learning opportunities already exist, we can add badges for those opportunities, and if they don’t, we’ll develop&nbsp;them.  <p>Interested? <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact">Get in&nbsp;touch</a>!</p><p>Special thanks to WAO members past and present who worked on this&nbsp;summary.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/4-benefits-of-open-recognition-pathways-a51c10a37633">4 benefits of Open Recognition Pathways</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What is Digital Transformation and why it is essential to have a blockchain&nbsp; like Commercio.network&nbsp; to implement it. 
 What is digital transformation? 
<p>In 2014, the EU issued the eIDAS directives by regulating Trust Services to create electronic identities, sign and send electronic documents with legal value. This has made it possible to dematerialize all business processes in digital form. According to an EU estimate, digital transformation is expected to increase gross domestic product by 2.2 trillion euros over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why is it essential to be a blockchain ? 
<p>The blockchain is the technology made famous by Bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s a network that allows you to exchange something that has value and must remain original to keep it. You can exchange copies of images on the internet, but you can’t transfer originals. If it were possible we could all send each other pictures of money via whatsapp and not exchange banknotes. The blockchain solves the problem of exchanging value by exchanging originals. That’s why the founders of Commerc.io thought of using it to exchange documents with legal value.</p>
<p>The Digital Transformation&nbsp; blockchain Commercio.network is an open-source PROJECT that gives companies the ability to sign and exchange documents using blockchain technology to guarantee:&nbsp;</p>
 
  Paternity: The document was created by the declared sender.&nbsp; 
  Non-repudiation: The sender cannot deny having&nbsp; signed the document&nbsp; 
  Integrity: The document has not been altered during transport.&nbsp; 
 
<p>There are two main groups of business documents:&nbsp;</p>
 
  Structured: Mostly XML (Invoices, orders, order confirmations, etc).&nbsp; 
  Unstructured: Mostly PDF (Contracts, forms, letters, etc).&nbsp; 
 
<p>The network is organized through an international network&nbsp; of 100 independent companies. Any company, especially yours, is welcome to join the consortium and take advantage of this next-generation technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commercio.network is called The Documents blockchain because it focuses on solving one core business problem: legally exchanging and signing business documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mission&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our mission is to spread blockchain technology to worldwide companies with a bold Go to market&nbsp; plan:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  100 Node validators companies to onboard. 
  1000&nbsp; distributors companies to onboard. 
  10.000 IT companies to onboard…&nbsp; 
  100.000 end customers companies on the blockchain.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to provide every IT Company in the world a simple, fast, profitable way to create value for them and their end customers with:</p>
 
  the vision&nbsp; 
  the skills&nbsp; 
  the core technology&nbsp; 
  the network of validators&nbsp; 
  the developer tools&nbsp; 
 
<p>We have removed the underlying complexity of implementing a blockchain project by defining a three layer approach.&nbsp;</p>
 
  APPLICATION LAYER: where IT companies build apps for solving users’ problems.&nbsp; 
  NETWORKING LAYER: where the companies run the blockchain network nodes.&nbsp; 
  PROTOCOL LAYER: where the basic 8 Core Functions are implemented on the node.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 8 Core Functions Our blockchain core Node software has a group of “Smart Contracts” focused on the world of the document:&nbsp;</p>
 
 CommercioWallet (Done) : Enable users account and access&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;CommercioID (Done): Enable users self sovereign identity&nbsp; 
 CommercioDocs (Done): Enable users to exchange business documents&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;CommercioSign (Done): Enable users to sign business documents&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;CommercioMint (Done): Enable users to create blockchain Tokens&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;CommercioKYC (Next) : Enable TSPs to issue verifiable credentials&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 CommercioDex (Next) : Enable users to exchange blockchain Tokens&nbsp; 
 CommercioPay (Next) : Enable users to get SEPA payments

 Trojan mice, paved cow paths, and constellation-creation <p>As anyone familiar with the work of WAO’s members will be aware, we’re big fans of <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a>. We’ve been involved with the movement from the beginning and, in this post, want to reflect on our experience of how they can be used for the digital transformation of organisations.</p>Image CC BY-ND Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>A quick note, as ever, on terminology. We’re going to use the shorthand ‘badges’ to refer to what people call variously Open Badges, digital credentials, digital badges, or microcredentials. The important thing is that there’s a standard behind what’s being issued so that the data hard-coded into the visual image can be recognised by different systems.</p> Credentials vs recognition <p>There are broadly two streams in the badges movement. The larger, and more obvious stream is focused on credentialing. In other words, issuing badges is about proving things like who you are, what you know, what you can do, or which group(s) you belong to. These badges tend to be issued by well-known, trusted authorities.</p><p>We’re all familiar with credentials. It could be a degree certificate, a driver’s license, or a gym membership card. To date, badges tend to have been used to demonstrate skill acquisition, but the recently-renamed <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/">W3C Verifiable Credentials working group</a> seeks to expand that in both human and machine-readable ways.</p><p>The other stream in the badges movement is around recognition. This is perhaps best explained by <a href="https://www.openrecognition.org/bord">The Bologna Open Recognition Declaration (BORD)</a> from the Open Recognition Alliance:</p><blockquote>Promoting the recognition of learning achievements to support identity construction, citizenship, career development, learning organisations and territories, trust and empowerment.</blockquote><p>As we explored in a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/on-common-ground-8fadc99692cd?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------">previous post</a>, these are the kind of badges that might include those that are self-issued and then endorsed by others, or that are issued by peers are part of a Community of Practice.</p><p>Both credentialing and recognition are important parts of any organisational badge strategy. Perhaps the easiest way of thinking about them is that the former is a ‘top-down’ approach, while the latter is ‘bottom-up’.</p> 3 badge strategies for digital transformation <p>We’ve seen time and again badges be introduced to organisations like&nbsp;this:</p>  Management creates a badge as a&nbsp;pilot  The pilot is successful because the badge is issued by management  Someone new to badges is tasked to create a&nbsp;system  They create Gold / Silver / Bronze badges for XYZ&nbsp;skills  The programme fails through lack of engagement or confusion  <p>It really doesn’t have to be like this! Instead of imposing badges, they should be grown as part of an ecosystem of organisational development and transformation.</p><p>Here are three of our favourite ways to embed badges in organisations. Your mileage may vary, but using elements of one or more of these approaches is likely to be more successful than trying to mandate badges from on&nbsp;high.</p> 1. Trojan&nbsp;mice Illustration by <a href="https://artplusstory.com/blog/2016/5/19/trojan-mouse">Elizabeth Beier</a><p>Many people will know the story of the Trojan horse, a wooden horse used by the Greeks during the Trojan War. They tricked their way into the city of Troy by presenting a ‘gift’ which was actually full of an elite members of the Greek army. The ‘Trojan horse’ has come to serve as a metaphor for something that looks like one thing (i.e. harmless, innocuous) but is actually another underneath (i.e. threatens the status&nbsp;quo).</p><p>These days, people are savvy enough to see Trojan horses coming a mile off, which is why WAO recommends setting off Trojan mice instead. Instead of talking about implementing a badging system, you could try badging participation in a workshop, or issuing a badge along with a paper certificate in an existing awards ceremony.</p><p>There are many advantages of this experimental approach, including:</p>  Avoiding blockers — by seeing what works and what doesn’t, you can focus on what gains traction.  Moving faster — finding something that gains traction and then iterating on that is quicker than trying to design everything upfront.  Improving responsiveness — Trojan mice-size projects are nimble and can adapt to a changing landcape.  <p>This metaphor is an easy way to introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile development practices</a> to organisations which may be new to this approach. <a href="https://whatsthepont.blog/2013/11/10/trojan-horses-are-not-trojan-mice-5-questions-to-spot-the-difference/">This helpful post</a> outlines five different types of Trojan mice that you might want to try in your organisation, from the obvious to the&nbsp;oblique.</p> 2. Paved cow&nbsp;paths Image via <a href="http://www.grisanik.com/blog/control-by-design--examples/">Gris&nbsp;Anik</a><p>Anyone who has been walking in hills and fields where there are cows will be familiar with cow paths. As cows are creatures of habit, when one cow begins to walk across a field, a second one follows, and then the whole herd. After a while, the cows have created a well-worn route from point A to point B. This is often the path of least resistance.</p><p>As you can see in the above photos, humans do the same. It’s unrealistic to expect humans to walk in one direction, turn 90 degrees, and then walk in another direction. They just cut the corner. Of course they do. We all&nbsp;do.</p>Image via <a href="http://www.grisanik.com/blog/control-by-design--examples/">Gris&nbsp;Anik</a><p>So one solution is not to create any paths at all, but instead see where people actually walk. Then create a path over the top. In other words, paving the cow&nbsp;paths.</p><p>If we now apply this to learning design, and in particular, badge design, we can see how this can be beneficial. Rather than planning everything out in advance in a way that looks good on paper or on a presentation slide deck, set a direction and some design constraints, and then co-design badges with early adopters!</p> 3. Constellation-creation Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/a-constellation-of-pathways/">Bryan&nbsp;Mathers</a><p>When we escape the light pollution of modern cities and look up at the night sky in places, we see countless stars in the sky. Some of these stars, however, are brighter than others, which led our ancestors to group them into the constellations that we know&nbsp;today.</p><p>All of those stars are entities in their own right. And, given the scale of the universe, how they’re grouped together is somewhat arbitrary. It depends on the observer. There’s nothing stopping you or I making up our own constellation tonight by connecting the dots in new and novel&nbsp;ways.</p>Skill tree from the game ‘Path of&nbsp;Exile’<p>In the world of gaming, there is an established notion of a ‘skill tree’. The above example is from a game called <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/game">Path of Exile</a>, and it looks very constellation-like. As you gain ‘skill points’ you can choose to level up your character in different ways. As you can see from the above screenshot, there are potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of different ways of doing&nbsp;this.</p>Skill tree from the game ‘Shadow of the Tomb&nbsp;Raider’<p>The above screenshot is from the game <a href="https://tombraider.square-enix-games.com/en-gb">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> and presents a visually-different way of doing something quite&nbsp;similar.</p> Next step… Negentropy! <p>Once you’ve got your badge system up and running, the key thing is to keep feeding it. What does this mean? Many people will know that the term ‘entropy’ means a system tending towards disorder. Your job is the opposite, the seldom used term ‘negentropy’ (yes that is a real word!) which means a system tending towards&nbsp;order.</p><p>If WAO can help you with any of these steps, please do get in touch so we can have a chat. We’re quite good at untangling people’s organisational spaghetti!</p><p>Drop us a note here: <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">https://weareopen.coop/contact</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/badges-for-digital-transformation-7e9e1a17e714">Badges for digital transformation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a>3Box Labs</a> is about to open up a lot of new roles. As we grow into our next phase, we spent a lot of time last month digging into a critical question: how do we improve the diversity of our team?</p><p>Our current team is far from representative of the global population we aim to build for. Our team of 12 is 9 men and 3 women. 9 of us are white. We are geographically spread out - but only in North America and Europe. And our pipeline of incoming applicants is more homogenous than this.</p><p>Last month we had a series of full-team conversations about our approach to building a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable team. We had plenty of differing opinions and useful debates, and did not end with 100% agreement on everything. We did end with a deeper shared appreciation for how much this matters, an approach that we believe in, and some steps we are putting into action.</p><p>We'd love your support, input, and feedback as we put this into action and so are sharing thinking as well as our plans.</p> Why diversity is critical to us <p>Our team first dug into why it is important to us. There are many reasons building a diverse team matters. Bringing focus to those that hold the most meaning to our team helped us make sure we arrived at a plan of action that would resonate. It also let us get extremely specific about how this goal relates to our overall mission and the other goals — and other constraints — that we have as a team. This helped us ensure our plan of action would be practical.</p><p>After several iterations, we arrived at this summary of why this topic is so important to us, which now lives on our <a href="https://www.notion.so/About-3Box-Labs-7100eadf86624b1ba00793da29a08711">About Us page</a>.</p>  🤝🏽 Commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion <p>Building a diverse team is a top priority because nothing will impact our success more deeply. Our ambitions for change are global and our team must represent perspectives from across the world we aim to improve.</p>  The challenges we face are incredibly complex. We must tackle these with ideas and ingenuities from a wide variety of backgrounds and contexts.  Our technology impacts how information and identities are controlled online, with deeply personal and widespread effects. We each have blind spots and need many viewpoints to anticipate the consequences of our work.  We want to face the many unforeseen changes and challenges we have ahead with a balanced and robust team, drawing on a diversity of strengths to adapt and improve through adversity.  <p>We have work to do here, as a team and industry. It's our responsibility to model that only a diverse team working together can we succeed in building a more sustainable, fair and equitable web.</p> <p>One thing absent from this is anything about our role in helping close the opportunity gap for underrepresented groups in crypto, tech, and knowledge economy jobs. We debated this internally at length, as we do feel a responsibility to advance equity more generally in the greater ecosystem in which we operate. However, we feared diluting the messaging that building a diverse and inclusive team is central to our core mission. Aiming to impact social justice in tech felt like a big undertaking and adjacent to our core goals. We have a deep conviction that building a diverse team is critical to our success as an organization, so we decided to keep our statement focused on reinforcing that rather than adding additional diversity goals related to social justice more broadly.</p><p>We talked with several DEI advisors and heard mixed reactions. One felt it absurd to make a 'business case' for an equitable team; it's simply the right and necessary thing to do. Others felt that grounding our commitment to diversity deeply in our team's mission would help us feel the priority more concretely and urgently. We ended, for now, keeping our commitment tied explicitly to our mission. We do hope that through that commitment we will be able to model equity in a space where lack of representation is too much the norm.</p> Our approach to building a diverse team <p>To live up to our commitment, we need a principled approach to hiring that values and emphasizes diversity while still holding to other values, including evaluating every candidate as an individual. We established two particularly important principles:</p>  Invest heavily in proactively building a representative pipeline for every role  Out of that pipeline, hire the candidate who adds the most to our team's mission  <p>At the end of our hiring process, we always want to hire the person that will add the most value to our team. This is not purely about their ability to excel in the role; it also includes character that reinforces our values, and capacity to add new dimensions to our team. This step cannot function in isolation, though. If we hire the best candidates from a pipeline of white male candidates, we will always be hiring white males.</p><p>We must build a broad and representative pipeline of quality candidates for every role. As noted earlier, this does not happen organically right now. We have to put significant proactive effort towards it, then pair it with a thoughtful evaluation and offer process. &nbsp;This is an investment, and will take more time and will mean slower hires on some roles.</p><p>At a startup with limited resources and an urgent need to hire, this is hard. The two priorities of hiring fast and hiring deliberately - including to add diversity - are directly at odds. By explicitly tying our commitment to diversity and success in our mission together, and adding more concrete tactics, we hope to turn diversity into a top-of-mind priority for every hire.</p> Concrete changes we're making  Make it very clear that all candidates are welcomed on our team <p>Adapt our job descriptions, incorporating the knowledge that different candidates react differently to certain language and elements (e.g., men are more likely to apply to jobs where they don't meet all listed requirements). Three changes we've made:</p>  Replace "Requirements" with a section called "You're likely to succeed if," which focuses on capabilities and outcomes and avoids past experiences that would narrow the candidate pool  Explicitly encourage candidates from underrepresented groups to apply in every job description  Ensure inclusive language, using a tool to detect wording that may appeal more to men than women  <p>Share our commitment publicly. We added a commitment to diversity to our <a href="https://www.notion.so/About-3Box-Labs-7100eadf86624b1ba00793da29a08711">About Us</a> page. We will also begin sharing more from inside our team about this topic and related ones, starting with this post.</p> Invest in proactive sourcing <p>We will spend time, money and creativity to bring more candidates from a diverse set of backgrounds into our pipeline. A few actions we are taking towards this:</p><p>Tech talks: our team will start doing these far and wide in the tech world to build bridges in new communities (if you'd like to set one up, reach out!)</p><p>Be wary of opportunistic hires: these tend to be from similar backgrounds, and deprives us of an opportunity to build a more intentional pipeline. This is so hard because when a great candidate from our network emerges, it's likely a very high signal on a very strong candidate. We haven't ruled this out for certain specialized roles, but we cannot let it become a habit.</p> Refine our interview process to value difference and remove bias <p>A few changes we are making on this front: </p><p>Early rounds will focus on skills relevant to the role. Later rounds, with more of the team involved, will evaluate value alignment and teamwork so there are more perspectives to balance out potential biases.</p><p>Removed sources of bias from our scorecard. For example, we used to score candidates on if they "would bring energy to our team." The goal was to find people who would energize us to work with, but it ended up creating a tilt towards high-energy extroverts which was not the intent.</p><p>Add "Would bring a new dimension to the team" to our scorecard, to make sure we consider this for every candidate.</p> Ensure we operate as an inclusive team  <p>Most of our current efforts are focused on hiring. But equally essential is maintaining an inclusive team culture that is welcoming, inspiring, and comfortable to all. This is critical to retaining candidates and to make sure our outreach to new candidates is authentic. It also lets us all be happier and more productive, and comfortable being ourselves.</p> Seek help from groups and people doing great work in this arena <p>We have a lot to learn and a long way to go. There are great teams and individuals that we can learn from, support, and work with. We have a list of those we've already been inspired or educated by. Over time, we'll aim to partner with organizations driving diverse hiring in Web3, amplify the voices of those helping make Web3 a beacon of equity in tech, and make long-term commitments to support the most aligned communities.</p><p>We also continue to do more of this work in public. We hope this will allow others to learn from our experience and open opportunities to work together to improve the practices and norms throughout the ecosystem. We also hope it creates an opportunity for the community to provide feedback and advice back to us. We have a long ways to go and value any support, critiques, and help.</p> <p><a href="https://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs Site</a> | <a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic Website</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://chat.ceramic.network">Discord Community</a> </p><p></p>

     <p>Denver, CO (JULY 7, 2021) – Open banking is proving to be a game changer for financial services. Open banking is the structured sharing of data using application programming interfaces (APIs) between financial institutions and third-party providers. It helps financial institutions more efficiently partner with fintechs and it helps consumers more easily and securely leverage their data across solutions</p>
<p>CUFX, or the Credit Union Financial Exchange, has been the credit union industry’s open integration standard allowing credit unions to efficiently share data between banking systems, reduce redundancy, reduce technical complexity, drive down costs and improve speed to market. Since its inception, the credit union industry has greatly benefited from CUFX by supporting credit unions’ own API gateways or through easy integrations with third-party providers.</p>
<p>CUFX is expanding its support of open banking and interoperability by joining the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) consortium. FDX is a non-profit organization operating in the U.S. and Canada that is dedicated to unifying the financial industry around a common, interoperable and royalty-free standard for the secure access of user permissioned financial data, aptly named the FDX API. By collaborating with FDX, CUFX will enable credit unions and interested organizations to bridge both standards to leverage a broader, more interoperable transaction set and market reach.</p>
<p>“With CUFX as a protocol for the exchange of data, this membership will give credit unions a seat at the table with a best-in-class standards organization and help CUFX further evolve in support of digital identities, open banking and API exchanges,” says John Ainsworth, president/CEO of Bonifii.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to welcome CUFX to the Financial Data Exchange family,” said Don Cardinal, Managing Director of FDX. CUFX’s participation in our consortium will help FDX continue to connect credit unions of all sizes so that they can offer their customers API-based data sharing with third-party fintechs via a common industry standard,” added Cardinal.</p>
<p>With the pandemic causing credit unions to accelerate their digital strategies, now is the right time for credit unions to start to begin leveraging open banking to help them grow and compete as they serve their members.</p>

 Creative workshop encourages hands-on experience to create questions about&nbsp;time Olivia Tai and Sarah Newman hosted the workshop.<p>by Grace&nbsp;McFadden</p><p>The philosophy of time can be introduced quite simply, according to Harvard Physicist Jacob Barandes: all it takes is a stack of pancakes.</p><p>Barandes was a guest speaker at “The Mysteries of Time in Physics and Philosophy,” the second in the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2021-05/2021-virtual-creative-spring-workshops">Creative Workshop series</a> that metaLAB is offering this summer designed and led by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/snewman">Sarah Newman</a>, Director of Art &amp; Education at <a href="https://metalabharvard.github.io/">metaLAB at Harvard</a>, and supported by Olivia Tai, a student at Harvard College and research assistant at metaLAB. The workshop brought together sixty attendees from seventeen different countries.</p><p>The event began with Barandes discussing presentism and eternalism, two different theories of how time works. This discussion formed the basis of a hands-on creative exercise led by Newman and Tai to explore the “mysteries of&nbsp;time.”</p><p>Barandes framed time as follows: “Think of each layer in the stack as a successive moment in time. Roughly speaking, if you’re standing still, you’re at the same place in each successive pancake. You’re at the same place in the bottom pancake, the next pancake, the next pancake.”</p><p>Presentism, explained Barandes, can be thought of as the idea that we all experience the same pancake at the same time. This universal present, which Barandes likened to a hot pancake, is the only one in which we exist. This also means that neither the future nor the past is&nbsp;real.</p><p>Barandes then explained how <a href="https://www.space.com/36273-theory-special-relativity.html">Einstein’s theory of special relativity</a> serves as a challenge to presentism, which he also referred to as the A Model of&nbsp;time.</p><p>“The special theory of relativity says we do not all experience pancakes the same way,” Barandes&nbsp;said.</p><p>As explained by Barandes, Einstein’s theory of special relativity says that because the speed of light is constant regardless of the observer, there are repercussions for how time happens to each person. He said that the familiar, everyday laws of physics dictate that if someone threw a baseball on an airplane, a person outside the airplane would perceive the baseball to be moving at the combined speed of the throw and the airplane.</p><p>“But if you shine a light with the flashlight on the airplane, what Einstein said was, you on the airplane will perceive light travelling at the speed of light. Someone on the ground looking up will also see light going at the same constant speed. Light doesn’t combine. This is a very weird thing, it means that somehow time and space have to change,” Barandes&nbsp;said.</p><p>Space and time being relative and interconnected serves as a challenge to the idea that the present is experienced universally.</p><p>“Maybe the most profound weirdness here is that if you’re moving relative to someone else, then your pancake slices are not horizontal. Your pancake slices are slightly diagonal. So you don’t slice the pancakes horizontally anymore. If you’re moving, you slice the pancakes a little bit diagonally,” Barandes said. “And if different observers in different states of motion slice the stack of pancakes differently, that’s a challenge to the notion that one pancake slice is the ‘hot’ one for everybody. So that’s a challenge to presentism.”</p><p>Eternalism, which, Barandes explained, is known as the B Model, holds that the past, present, and future are all equally&nbsp;real.</p><p>The talk by Barandes primed the audience to form questions about time. Newman then guided participants through exercises to explore their own questions about&nbsp;time.</p><p>Tai guided the audience through a short meditation. The object, explained Tai, was to experience time in a different way than we usually do in our busy&nbsp;lives.</p><p>“The experience of time can feel very different when you are turning your intention inwards rather than outwards,” Tai&nbsp;said.</p><p>As part of the pre-work to the event, participants were encouraged to spend 90 seconds creating a timeline of their lives, which they had the opportunity to share with others during the workshop. Newman then prompted the group to write down things they “knew”,“believed”, and “didn’t know”. Participants were then asked to do the same exercise, except focusing on their knowledge of&nbsp;time.</p><p>From there, participants used these thought experiments to generate two of their own questions about time, which formed the foundations of the final steps of the workshop: exploring these questions visually by drawing them, and then creating physical sculptures to represent their&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>In preparation for the event, participants had been asked to spend ten minutes gathering materials ranging from “something that changes in time” to “two things that rhyme with each other.” After choosing one of their questions about time, participants created a sculpture to represent their question using the objects they gathered prior to the&nbsp;event.</p>A sculpture created by participant <a href="https://twitter.com/dashiel_carrera/status/1403374002232610821">Dashiel&nbsp;Carrera</a>.<p>Sculptures created by participants sought to explore questions such as “Could we have a functioning society without a supposedly objective passage of time, measured by clocks?” and “What would it look like if we perceived space as time and vice versa?” The resulting prototypes from the event were made of materials including lichen, incense, dice, and a bedspring.</p><p>Newman’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/473445114">methodology</a> for her creative workshops emphasizes the importance of asking questions, the value of interdisciplinary perspectives on hard topics, and then using found materials to physically wrestle with these abstract ideas. This allows workshop attendees to free their thinking when it comes to concepts that can be difficult to conceptualize. The event received positive feedback from attendants, one of whom <a href="https://twitter.com/silviabauer/status/1403380086380892162">said</a> that “time passed at light-speed” during the workshop.</p><p>The final event in the Creative Workshop series, entitled “Telegrams to Telepathic Memos: The Future of Trust and Truth Online,” was held on June 25. The metaLAB team will be displaying the creations from this workshop series&nbsp;<a href="https://metaworkshops.cargo.site/">here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/meditation-and-metaphorical-pancakes-exploring-the-philosophy-and-physics-of-time-with-metalab-4e24d7713062">Meditation and Metaphorical Pancakes: Exploring the philosophy and physics of time with metaLAB</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Updates from our June Co-op&nbsp;Day <p>As is our custom, we held another monthly Co-op half day last week — a block of time scheduled and set aside to dive into some of the stickier issues and ideas of running a cooperative.</p><p>These are things that we can’t get to in our regular catch up meeting, and Co-op days are days when we sit down together, tackle the topics that are more long winded and build solutions for ourselves. It’s also a time for us to hang out, bond and generally team-build.</p> 🦋 We are open to evolving… some of the folks we’ve worked&nbsp;with<p>We Are Open is ticking along in the slow summer months with a general can-do attitude and some work from some lovely repeat clients. We are, however, not at capacity for the rest of the year, and so we talked about how to drum up more business. We’re lucky that we have folks knocking on our door quite a bit, but maybe we’ve gotten too comfortable with waiting for work to come&nbsp;in.</p><p>Of course we want to continue working with the good clients we have, but we also want new and exciting projects. We’re eager to learn about all the people doing good in the world, and we want to support them in their endeavours. We don’t want to be comfortable, we want to be inspired. So we set ourselves a goal of having 5 completely new clients each&nbsp;year.</p><p>To achieve this, we scheduled ourselves an “Hour of Power” each month — we’ll use this hour to actively look for interesting projects and people. We’re also going to, like, try this thing called “marketing”.</p> 🚀 Speaking of marketing… image from the PDF version of our&nbsp;website<p>We worked on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pdCdBJ_Eg5UW3OTn_aWhKoo8WBSUTBj0s-ZOTi3ug_s/edit?usp=sharing">PDF ‘information pack’ version</a> of our <a href="https://weareopen.coop">website</a> and a “<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aDkZ8zMv_VxsfcFn9gDXIvjzHspgSOUbH9T80MECSM4/edit#slide=id.ge22416d19e_0_54">WAO in 3 Slides</a>” deck. This might seem like a strange thing to do for digital activists like us, but there are a lot of people who are more likely to spend most of the day in their email inbox. We also put the finishing touches on our new Collaborator Contract to make it easy for us to contract talented people to fill holes in projects, or because we’re eager to work with&nbsp;others.</p><p>The latter proves tricky because, while we committed to all things open, we also have to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements (“NDAs”) with certain clients. So there’s a tension between the two which we have to spell out in the contract. On the one hand we want collaborators (a.k.a. sub-contractors) to be open, on the other we want them to abide by&nbsp;NDAs.</p><p>Excitingly, we’ve come to the end of our first season of the <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/podcast/">Tao of WAO podcast</a>. We’ll be back for another season at the end of the summer, so we gave a brief update of how that went in preparation for a full Season 1 Retrospective, which we worked on this&nbsp;week.</p> 🧦 Co-op&nbsp;IRL… it has been a while since we saw each others socks (not featured: Doug’s&nbsp;socks)<p>Our last order of business for our Co-op half day was to discuss the fact that we haven’t been in the same place in a year and a half. Covid halted travel for everyone, but we know how important in-person bonding time is. So we’re eager to find a time to meet up. WAO members don’t want to fly (see why in <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/spirit-of-wao">the Spirit of Us</a>), so we’ll likely head to The Netherlands and head there by train and ferry. It’s still hard to commit to travel, but we need to start talking about it. We’re thinking the first week in October, all things being&nbsp;equal.</p> 🌞 Summer&nbsp;days <p>We’re privileged that we can use the summer lull to plan for the fall, and we’re excited that we have some interesting work coming up. If you have projects that you’d like to talk to us about, now is a good time to schedule a 30 minute&nbsp;chat!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/where-does-work-come-from-d0cdb6952875">Where does “work” come from?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Conformance Testing for Measurable Goals</p><p>[Written in consultation with the<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability"> Interoperability Working Group</a>&nbsp;chairs]</p><p>A recurring topic in the Interoperability Working Group is that of defining short-, medium- and long-term goals or “targets” for interoperability. The topic comes up again every few months, and each time it does, the chairs try to tackle it head-on for a full meeting or two, some emails, and various off-line discussions, but doing so never seems to arrive at a satisfactory or definitive answer. Each time, what feels a Herculean outlay of effort only gets us a tentative resolution, as if we’d deflected a debt collector with a minimum payment. Dear reader, we would like to refinance, or at least restructure, this debt to our community!</p><p>In this two-part overview of our goals for 2021, we would like to survey the landscape of “provable,” testable interoperability targets and give some guidance on what we would like to see happen next in the testable interop world. Then, in a companion article, we will lay out clear proposal for parallel, distributed work on multiple fronts, such that progress can be distributed across various subcommunities and hubs of open cooperation, each reasonably confident that they are helping the big picture by “zooming in” on one set of problems.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christopherphigh">Christopher Paul&nbsp;High</a> A seemingly uncontroversial target&nbsp;state <p>Interoperation is a deceptively transparent etymology: any two things that perform a function are inter-operating if they can perform their operation together and mutually. Two fax machines interoperate if one sends a fax and the other receives it, which is a far more impressive feat if the two machines in question were designed and built by different companies on different continents, fifteen years apart. This is the kind of target state people usually have in mind when they imagine interoperability for an emerging technology.</p><p>This everyday example glosses over a lot of complexity and history, however. Standards bodies had already specified exact definitions of how the “handshake” is established between two unfamiliar fax machines before either model of fax machine was a twinkle in a design team’s eye. In addition to all the plodding, iterative standardization, there has also been a lot of economic trial and error and dead-ends we never heard about. Even acceptable margins of error and variance from the standards have been prototyped, refined, socialized, and normalized, such that generations of fax machines have taken them to heart, while entire factories have been set up to produce standard components like white-label fax chips and fax boards that can be used by many competing brands. On a software level, both design teams probably recycled some of the same libraries and low-level code, whether open-source or licensed.</p><p>Decomposing this example into its requirements at various levels shows how many interdependent and complex subsystems have to achieve internal maturity and sustainable relationships. A time-honored strategy is to treat each of these subsystems in a distinct, parallel maturation process and combine them gradually over time. The goal, after all, is not a working whole, but a working ecosystem. Architectural alternatives, for example, have to be debated carefully, particularly for disruptive and emerging technologies that redistribute power within business processes or ecosystems. Sharing (or better yet, responsibly open-sourcing and governing) common software libraries and low-level hardware specifications is often a “stitch in time” that saves nine later stitches, since it gives coordinators a stable baseline to work from,&nbsp;sooner.</p><p>Naturally, from even fifty or a hundred organizations committed to this target state, a thousand different (mostly sensible) strategies can arise. “How to proceed?” becomes a far-from-trivial question, even when all parties share many common goals and incentives. For instance, almost everyone:</p>  Wants to grow the pie of adoption and market&nbsp;interest  Holds privacy and decentralization as paramount commitments  Strives to avoid repeating the mistakes and assumptions of previous generations of internet technology  <p>And yet, all the same… both strategic and tactical differences arise, threatening to entrench themselves into camps or even schools of thought. How to achieve the same functional consensus on strategy as we have on principles? Our thesis here is that our short-term roadmaps need testable, provable alignment goals that we can all agree on for our little communities and networks of technological thinking to converge gradually. Simply put, we need a few checkpoints and short-term goals, towards which we can all work together.</p> Today’s test suites and interoperability profiles <p>Perhaps the biggest differences turn out not to be about target state or principles, but about what exactly “conformance” means relative to what has already been specified and standardized. Namely, the core specifications for DIDs and VCs are both data models written in the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), which put protocols out of scope. This stems partly from the decisions of the groups convened in the W3C, and partly from a classic division of labor in the internet standards world between W3C, which traditionally governs the data models of web browser and servers, and a distinct group, the Internet Engineering Task Force&nbsp;(IETF).</p><p>VCs were specified first, with a preference (but not a requirement) for DIDs, with exact parameters for DIDs and DID systems deferred to a separate data model. Then, to accommodate entrenched and seemingly irreconcilable ideas about how DIDs could best be expressed, the DID data model was made less representationally-explicit and turned into an abstract data model. This shift to a representation-agnostic definition of DIDs, combined with the still-tentative and somewhat representation-specific communication and signing protocols defined to date, makes truly agnostic and cross-community data model conformance somewhat difficult to test. This holds back interoperability (and objective claims to conformance)!</p> W3C: Testing the core specifications <p>The only test suite associated with the core W3C specifications is the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/tree/main/packages/vc-http-api-test-server">VC-HTTP-API test suite </a>for VC data model conformance and the fledgling <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/">DID-core test suite</a>, both worked on in the W3C-CCG. The former tests implementations of VC-handling systems against some pre-established sample data and test scripts through a deliberately generalized API interface that strives to be minimally opinionated with respect to context- and implementation-specific questions like API authentication. The latter is still taking shape, given that the DID spec has been very unstable in the home stretch of its editorial process arriving at CR this last&nbsp;week.</p><p>The VC-HTTP-API interface, specified collectively by the first <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">SVIP</a> funding cycle cohort for use in real-world VC systems, has been used in some contexts as a de facto general-purpose architecture profile, even if it is very open-ended on many architectural details traditionally specified in government or compliance profiles. Its authors and editors did not intend it to be the general-purpose profile for the VC data model generally, but in the absence of comparable alternatives, it is sometimes taken as one; it has perhaps taken on more of a definitive role than originally intended.</p><p>Following the second iteration of the SVIP program and the expansion of the cohort, the API and its test suite are poised to accrue features and coverage to make it more useful outside of its original context. Core participants have established a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/">weekly public call</a> at the CCG and a lively re-scoping/documentation process is currently underway to match the documentation and rationale documents to the diversity of contexts deploying the&nbsp;API.</p> Aries: End-to-end conformance testing <p>Other profiles, like the Aries interoperability profile, serve an important role, but it would be misleading to call it a VC data model test suite — it is more like an end-to-end test harness for showing successful implementation of the Aries protocols and architecture. Here “interoperability” means interoperability with other Aries systems, and conformance with the shared Aries interpretation of the standard VC data model and the protocols this community has defined on the basis of that interpretation.</p><p>Many matters specified by the W3C data model are abstracted out or addressed by shared libraries in Ursa, so its scope is not exactly coterminous with the W3C data model. Instead, the Aries interoperability profile has its own infrastructural focus, which focuses on scaling the privacy guarantees of blockchain-based ZKP systems. In many ways, this focus complements rather than supplants that of the W3C test&nbsp;suites.</p><p>Many of the trickiest questions on which SSI systems differ are rooted in what the Aries and Trust-over-IP communities conceptualize as “<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack">layer 2</a>,” the connective infrastructural building-blocks connecting end-users to VCs and DIDs. As more and more features get added to be testable across language implementations, and as feature-parity is achieved with other systems (such as <a href="https://youtu.be/LC0OXAir3Qw">support for LD VCs</a>), the case for productive complementarity and deep interoperability gets easier and easier to&nbsp;make.</p> The first wave of local profiles and guidelines <p>Other specifications for decentralized-identity APIs and wallets, modelled on that W3C CCG and/or extending the work of Aries-based infrastructures, are starting to crop up around the world. So far these have all arisen out of ambitious government-funded programs to build infrastructure, often with an eye to local governance or healthy competition. Canada and the European Commission are the most high-profile ones to date, building on earlier work in Spain, the UK, and elsewhere; Germany and other countries funding next-generation trust frameworks may soon follow&nbsp;suit.</p><p>It is important, however, to avoid framing these tentative, sometimes cautious attempts at bridging status quo and new models as universal standards. If anything, these frameworks tend to come with major caveats and maturity disclaimers, on top of having carefully narrowed scopes. After all, they are generally the work of experienced regulators, inheriting decades of work exploring identity and infrastructural technologies through a patchwork of requirements and local profiles that tend to align over time. If they are designed with enough circumspection and dialogue, conformance with one should never make conformance with another impossible. (The authors would here like to extend heartfelt sympathy to all DIF members currently trying to conform to multiple of these at&nbsp;once!)</p><p>These profiles test concrete and specific interpretations of a shared data model that provide a testing benchmark for regulatory “green lighting” of specific implementations and perhaps even whole frameworks. Particularly when they specify best practices or requirements for security and API design, they create testable standardization by making explicit their opinions and assumptions about:</p>  approved cryptography,  auditing capabilities,  privacy requirements, and  API access/authentication  <p>These will probably always differ and make a universal abstraction impossible; and that’s not a bad thing! These requirements are always going to be specific to each regulatory context, and without them, innovation (and large-scale investment) are endangered by regulatory uncertainty. Navigating these multiple profiles is going to be a challenge in the coming years, as more of them come online and their differences come into relief as a stumbling block for widely-interoperable protocols with potentially global&nbsp;reach.</p><p>The Interoperability working group will be tracking them and providing guidance and documentation where possible. Importantly, though, there is a new DIF Working Group coming soon, the Wallet Security WG, which will dive deeper into these profiles and requirements, benefiting from a narrow scope and IPR protection, allowing them to speak more bluntly about the above-mentioned details.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/setting-interoperability-targets-part-1-of-2-c6cbeaf82e98">Setting Interoperability Targets Part 1 of 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Medium-term interoperability challenges</p><p>[Written in consultation with the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability">Interoperability Working Group</a> chairs]</p><p>In our <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/setting-interoperability-targets/">last essay</a>, we explored the means and ends of interoperability targets and roadmapping across stacks and markets. “Interoperability,” like “standardization,” can be a general-purpose tool or an umbrella of concepts, but rarely works from the top-down. &nbsp;Instead, specific use-cases, consortia, contexts, and industries have to take the lead and prototype something more humble and specific like an “interoperability profile”-- over time, these propagate, get extended, get generalized, and congeal into a more universal and stable standard. Now, we’ll move on to some technical problem areas ripe for this kind of profile-first interoperability work across stacks.</p><blockquote>What makes sense to start aligning now? What are some sensible scopes for interoperating today, or yesterday, to get our fledgling market to maturity and stability as soon as safely possible?</blockquote>Ponte Vecchio, Fiorenze, by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/GHoX7zFRMMU">Ray Harrington</a> From testable goals to discrete scopes <p>The last few months have seen a shift in terminology and approach, as many groups turn their attention from broad “interoperability testing” to more focused “profiles” that test one subset of the optionalities and capabilities in a larger test suite or protocol definition. This decoupling of test suites from multiple profiles each suite can test helps any one profile from ossifying into a “universal” definition of decentralized identity’s core featureset. </p><p>As with any other emerging software field, every use case and context has its own interoperability priorities and constraints that narrow down the technological solution space into a manageable set of tradeoffs and decisions. &nbsp;For instance, end-user identification at various levels of assurance is often the most important implementation detail for, say, a retail bank, and DID-interoperability (which is not always the same thing!) might be a hardware manufacturer’s primary concern in being able to secure hardware supply chains. </p><p>Every industry has its unique set of minimum security guarantees, and VC-interoperability is obviously front-of-mind for credentialing use-cases. For example, in the medical data space, “Semantics” (data interpretation and metadata) might be a harder problem (or a more political one) than the mechanics of identity assurance, since high standards of end-user privacy and identity assurance have already made for a relatively interoperable starting points. &nbsp; Which exact subset of the many possible interoperability roadmaps is safest or most mission-critical for a given organization depends on many factors: the regulatory context, the culture of the relevant sectors, its incentive-structures, and its <a href="https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">business models</a>. </p><p>Cross-cutting industry verticals, however, are structural issues with how decentralized identity stacks and architecture vary, which can already been seen today. &nbsp;By applying “first principles,” (or in our case, the “<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md">functions</a>” of a decentralized identity system and its many moving parts) across use-cases and industrial contexts, certain shared problems arise. As is our default approach in DIF Interop WG, we applied DIF’s in-house <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/raw/master/assets/interop-mapping-version-by-Hakan-Yildiz(TUB).pdf">mental model</a> of the “5 layers” of decentralized identity systems, sometimes called “the 4+1 layers”. (See also the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity.github.io/raw/master/assets/crosscommunity-architecture-survey-oct-2020.pdf">more detailed version</a>).</p><p>We call these the “4+1” layers because our group agreed that a strict layering was not possible, and that all the architectures we compared for using verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers had to make major architectural decisions with consequences across all four of the more properly “layered” categories. This fifth category we named “transversal considerations,” since they traverse the layers and often come from architectural constraints imposed by regulation, industrial context, etc. Foremost among these are storage and authorization, the two most vexing and cross-cutting problems in software generally; these would justify an entirely separate article.</p><p>In a sense, none of the topics from this transversal category are good candidates for specification in the medium-term across verticals and communities-- they are simply too big as problems, rarely specific to identity issues, and being addressed elsewhere. These include “storage” (subject of our newest <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">working group</a>), “authorization” (debatably the core problem of all computer science!), “cryptographic primitives”, and “compliance.” (These last two are each the subject of a new working group, <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/crypto.html">Applied Cryptography</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/wallet-security.html">Wallet Security</a>!). These interoperability scopes are quite difficult to tackle quickly, or without a strong standards background. Indeed, these kinds of foundational changes require <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">incremental advances</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093">broad cooperation</a> with large community organizations. This is slow, foundation work that needs to connect parallel work across data governance, authentication/authorization, and storage in software more generally.</p><p>Similarly, the fourth layer, where ecosystem-, platform-, and industry-specific considerations constrain application design and business models, is unlikely to crystallize into a problem space calling out for a single specification or prototype in the medium-term future. Here, markets are splintered and it is unclear what can be repurposed or recycled outside of its original context. Even if there were cases where specification at this later would be timely, DIF members might well choose to discuss those kinds of governance issues at our sister-organizations in the space that more centrally address data governance at industry-, ecosystem-, or national- scale: <a href="http://trustoverip.org">Trust over IP</a> was chartered to design large-scale governance processes, and older organizations like <a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData.org</a> and the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> also have working groups and publications on vertical-specific and jurisdiction-specific best practices for picking interoperable protocols and data formats.</p><p>That still leaves three “layers”, each of which has its own interoperability challenges that seem most urgent. It is our contention that each of these could be worked on in parallel and independently of the other two to help arrive at a more interoperable community-- and we will be trying to book presentation and discussion guests in the coming months to advance all three.</p> Scope #1: Verifiable Credential Exchange <p>The most clear and consensus-building, even urgent way forward is to bring clarity to Verifiable Credential exchange across stacks. &nbsp;This has been the primary focus of our WG for the last year. Given that most of the early ecosystem-scale interest in SSI revolves around <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/#vc-infrastructure-layer-3">credentialing</a> (educational credentials, employment credentials, health records), it is highly strategic to get translation and unified protocols into place soon for the interoperable verification and cross-issuance of credentials. </p><p>In fact, there has actually been a lot of good progress made since Daniel Hardman wrote an <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/getting-to-practical-interop-with-verifiable-credentials/">essay</a> on the Evernym blog making a pragmatic case for sidestepping differences in architecture and approach to exchange VCs sooner. This aligned with much of our group’s work in recent months, which has included a <a href="https://hackmd.io/t1cotiReTXCnkpDG8k2tVA#THE-MAIN-EVENT">survey of VC formats</a> among organizations producing “wallets” for verifiable credentials (be they “edge” wallets or otherwise). Our group has also sought to <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8j6niRuFWTjVMIXqmw3zX-4KkLt-sli8">assist educational efforts</a> at the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>, in the Claims and Credentials <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">working group</a>, and elsewhere to make wallet-producing organizations aware of the relevant <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/vc-spec-map">specifications</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/dif/be6763341a014d248f655aea187d7890?v=c9ac48a07f3d411c9a1bea32b55f7e76">other references</a> needed to make their wallets multi-format sooner and less painfully. Much of this work was crystalized into an <a href="https://www.lfph.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Verifiable-Credentials-Flavors-Explained.pdf">article</a> by co-chair Kaliya Young and crowd-edited by the whole group; this work was a major guiding structure for the Good Health Pass work that sought to make a common health record format (exported from FHIR systems) equally holdable and presentable across all of today’s VC systems.</p><p>One outgrowth of this effort and other alignments that have taken place since Hardman’s and Young’s article is the work of prototyping a multi-community exchange protocol that allow a subset of each stack’s capabilities and modes to interoperate. This tentative, “minimum viable profile” is called <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-presentation-exchange">WACI-PEx</a> and is currently a work item of the Claims and Credentials working group. Work is ongoing on v0.1, and an ambitious, more fully-featured v1 is planned for after that. This profile acts as an “extension” of the broader Presentation Exchange protocol, giving a handy “cheat sheet” for cross-stack wallet-to-issuer/verifier handshakes so that developers not familiar with all the stacks and protocols being spanned have a starting point for VC exchanges. &nbsp;Crucially, the results of this collaborative prototype will be taken as inputs to future versions of the DIDComm protocols and the WACI specification for Presentation Exchange. </p><p>Note: There has been some discussion of a OIDC-Presentation Exchange profile at some point in the future, but given that the alignment of DIDComm and Presentation Exchange started over a year ago, the most likely outcome is that work on this would not start until after v1 has been released of the “WACI-PEx” profile for DIDComm has been released.</p> Scope #2: Anchoring layer <p>Of course, other forms of alignment are possible as well in the “bottom 3” layers of the traditional stack, while we wait on the ambitious transversal alignment specifications and the ongoing work to align and simplify cross-format support for VCs (and perhaps even multi-format VCs, as Hardman points out in the essay above). </p><p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery</a> WG at DIF has long housed many work items to align on the lowest level of stack, including general-purpose <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jsonld-common-java">common libraries</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secret-recovery-methods">recovery mechanisms</a>. It has also received many donations that contribute to method-level alignment, including a recent <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/trinsic-donates-did-key-rs-to-i-d-wg-8a278f37bcd0?source=friends_link&amp;sk=dbd175f5db9107ed1e9d953a386441a4">DID-Key implementation</a> and a linked-data <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jsonld-document-loader">document loader</a> donated by Transmute. The group has also served as a friendly gathering point for discussing calls for input from the DID-core working group at W3C and for proposing W3C-CCG work items.</p><p>One particularly noteworthy initiative of the group has been the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540?source=friends_link&amp;sk=306a37f289dcf61a89d19cd11f5be04e">Universal Resolver</a> project, which offers a kind of “trusted middleware” approach to DID resolution across methods. This prototype of a general-use server allows any SSI system (or non-SSI system) to submit a DID and get back a trustworthy DID Document, without needing any knowledge of or access to (much less current knowledge of or authenticated access to) the “black box” of the participating DID methods. While this project only extends “passive interoperability” to DIDs, i.e., only allowing DID document querying, a more ambitious sister project, the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar">Universal Registrar</a>, strives to bring a core set of CRUD capabilities to DID documents for DID methods willing to contribute drivers. Both projects have dedicated weekly calls on the DIF calendar, for people looking to submit drivers or get otherwise involved.</p> Scope #3: “Agent”/Infrastructure Layer <p>There is another layer, however, in between DIDs and VCs, about which we haven’t spoken yet: the crucial “agent layer” in the ToIP/Aries mental model, which encompasses trusted infrastructure whether in or outside of conventional clouds. The Aries Project has scaled up an impressively mature ecosystem of companies and experimenters, largely thanks to the robust infrastructure layer it built (and abstracting away from application-layer developers and experimenters).</p><p>Until now, differences of strategy with respect to conventional clouds and infrastructures have prevented large-scale cooperation and standardization at this layer outside of Aries and the DID-Comm project. Partly, this has been a natural outgrowth of the drastically different infrastructural needs and assumptions of non-human, enterprise, and consumer-facing/individual use cases, which differ more at this level than above or below. Partly, this is a function of the economics of our sector’s short history, largely influenced by the infrastructure strategies of cloud providers and telecommunication concerns.</p><p>This is starting to change, however, now that agent frameworks inspired by the precedent set by the Aries frameworks have come into maturity. Mattr’s <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/verifiable-credentials-with-auth0-and-mattr/">VIII Platform</a>, the Affinidi framework SDK (including open-source <a href="https://docs.affinidi.com/interop">components by</a> DIF members Bloom, Transmute, and Jolocom), ConsenSys’ own modular, highly <a href="https://veramo.io/docs/veramo_agent/plugins">extensible</a> and interoperable <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a> platform, and most recently Spruce ID’s very <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi">DID-method-agnostic</a> <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/">DIDKit</a>/<a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/credible/">Credible</a> SDK all offer open-source, extensible, and scalable infrastructure layers that are driving the space towards greater modularity and alignment at this layer. </p><p>As these platforms and “end-to-end stacks” evolve into frameworks extensible and capacious enough to house ecosystems, DIF expects alignment and harmonization to develop. This could mean standardization of specific components at this layer, for example:</p>  The DIDComm protocol could expand into new <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-looker-jwm-01.html">envelopes</a> and transports  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secret-recovery-methods">Control recovery</a> mechanisms could be specified across implementations or even standardized on a technical and/or UX level  Auditing or historical-query requirements could be specified to form a cross-framework protocol or primitive  Common usages of foreign function interfaces, remote procedure calls like gRPC and JSON-RPC, or other forms of “glue” allowing elements to be reused or mixed and matched across languages and architectures could be specified as a community<br>  <p>We are very much in early days, but some see on the horizon a day when frameworks that don’t cooperate with one another can’t compete with the ones that join forces. After all, adoption brings growing pains, particularly for the labor market-- aligning on architectures and frameworks makes onboarding developers and transferring experience that much easier to do!</p> Next Steps <p>I would encourage anyone who has read this far to pick at least one of the three scopes mentioned above and ask themselves how they are helping along this alignment process in their day-to-day work, and if they truly understand what major players at that level are doing. Often large for-profit companies pay the most attention to what their competitors are doing, but here it is important to think outside of competition and look instead at non-profit organizations, regulators, and coalitions of various kinds to really see where the puck is heading. Sometimes consensus on one level is blocking compromise somewhere else. &nbsp;It can be pretty hard to follow!</p><p>In recent articles, DIF has encouraged its members to think about an open-source strategy as comparably important to a business plan, a living document and guiding philosophy. I would like to suggest that the subset of DIF companies working with VCs and DIDs should also think of interoperability strategy and conformance testing as the most crucial pillar of that strategy-- if you cannot demonstrate interoperability, you might be asking people to take that strategy on faith!</p>

This update will improve EWC performance and security, and keep the EWC aligned with the latest developments in the Ethereum ecosystem.  If you are running an EWC node, you must <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/706478224/Updating+the+Client">update it to a Berlin-compatible client</a> and <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/2568257551/Chainspec+update+for+Berlin+Hardfork">update the chainspec</a> as soon as possible. EWC validators have already completed all the necessary updates.  If you are an EWC user or EWT holder, no action is required.  <p>In April 2021 the Ethereum mainnet implemented the Berlin upgrade, which introduced four improvement proposals (i.e., <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2565">EIP-2565</a>, <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718">EIP-2718</a>, <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929">EIP-2929</a>, and <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930">EIP-2930</a>) that modified gas prices and created new transaction types. Combined, these updates improve the overall performance and security of EVM blockchains (including the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain).</p><p>In May 2021, after observing the successful Ethereum upgrade, <a href="https://validators.energyweb.org/">the EWC validators</a> voted to adopt Berlin on the EWC as well. Since then the EWC validators have successfully implemented the upgrade on the <a href="https://volta-explorer.energyweb.org/">Volta test network</a> and are now preparing for the upgrade to occur on the main&nbsp;EWC.</p><p>The EWC Berlin upgrade will occur at <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org">block 12,649,625</a>, which will occur on or around Tuesday, 6 July (the precise time will depend on block time variation). All full node operators must <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/706478224/Updating+the+Client">update their node to a Berlin-compatible client</a> and <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/2568257551/Chainspec+update+for+Berlin+Hardfork">implement the Berlin chainspec</a> prior to the hard fork transition block. Due to subtle variations in the EWC block time, it is recommended to perform the update several days prior to the expected transition date.</p> FAQ <p>Who does this announcement impact?</p><blockquote>This announcement only impacts people or organizations that are operating a full node on the EWC. All EWC node operators should update the client and chainspec as soon as possible. As of the time of publication, all EWC validators have already completed the necessary updates to successfully implement the Berlin upgrades.</blockquote><p>If I’m an EWT holder but I’m not operating my own full node, is there anything I need to&nbsp;do?</p><blockquote>No, if you connect to the EWC via the public RPC and Metamask, an exchange (including Kucoin, Kraken, Liquid, Bitmart, or Hotbit), a web wallet (e.g., MyCrypto), or hardware wallet (e.g., Trezor, Ledger) then you do not need to take any&nbsp;action.</blockquote><p>Why is the Berlin upgrade happening on the&nbsp;EWC?</p><blockquote>The <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">EWC is a public, proof-of-authority EVM blockchain</a> and it benefits from adopting the latest upgrades and improvements from the wider Ethereum community. The EWC validators voted to adopt the upgrades contained in the Berlin fork in May&nbsp;2021.</blockquote><p>What will happen before, during, and after the&nbsp;upgrade?</p><p>As mentioned above, the decision to proceed with the upgrade is made by the EWC validators via the established governance process. After the decision is approved and before the upgrade occurs, all EWC validators and other node operators will update their node clients and chainspecs. During the upgrade (i.e., at the specified transition block), the new rules defined within the improvement proposals will take effect, creating a “new and improved” version of the EWC. There are no expected operational or performance impacts to the EWC during the upgrade. Following the upgrade, users and node operators can continue to interact with the EWC as&nbsp;normal.</p><p>If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please get in touch via our <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/psraNwqGqp">Discord</a> channels.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/announcing-the-berlin-upgrade-on-the-energy-web-chain-98c8da76054b">Announcing the Berlin Upgrade on the Energy Web Chain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Still frame from The Intersection<p>By Julia Solano, Eshanthi Ranasinghe, and Nicole Allred, Exploration &amp; Future Sensing, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p> The Intersection, a short film in collaboration with Superflux, creates a hopeful future that reimagines extractive, hyperconnected technology to serve community, support nature, and value human relationships. Watch&nbsp;<a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/569842501?badge=0&amp;amp;autopause=0&amp;amp;player_id=0&amp;amp;app_id=58479">here</a>. <p>My low balance of -$1.50 glows red above my wrist as I cross through the turnstile and enter the station. Options to top up via crypto or credit are greyed out on my digital wallet; those accounts are empty. Guess I’m watching the ads today, just like they’re watching&nbsp;me.</p><p>As I sit down on the train, images — shoes I’ve always wanted, modeled by my favorite influencers, with payment plans to shrug off my empty bank account — flash before my eyes. There’s no hiding from them — the algorithms track my eye-movement, my heartbeat, my temperature. They know what I want before I&nbsp;do…</p><p>Technology is causing our perception of reality — and of each other — to splinter. The same stories and facts can be twisted and contorted to fit a desired narrative depending on which slice of the web we are tuned into. Social media content is engineered for our reaction, “taking our hopes and fears, our pain and suffering and using it as content between ads” (The Intersection); pitting us against each other in a race to the bottom line. We live in fundamentally different worlds — each with its own set of facts — depending on the media we&nbsp;consume.</p><blockquote>The average person touches their phone 2,617 times every day, and cellphone addiction (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/nomophobia">nomophobia</a>: the fear of going without your phone) is rising. This begs the question: Are we driving technology, or is our technology driving&nbsp;us?</blockquote>Still frame from The Intersection What if this reality wasn’t limited to our&nbsp;screens? <p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/ingestibles-wearables-and-embeddables">Ingestibles, wearables, embeddables</a>; smart homes and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/02/ring-camera-fears/">peer-to-peer surveillance</a>; the Internet of Things (IoT) and <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/industrial-internet-of-things-iiot">Industrial IoT</a>; 5G; <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/smart-cities-digital-solutions-for-a-more-livable-future">smart cities</a>; facial recognition, temperature checking <a href="https://dronelife.com/2020/03/31/this-pandemic-drone-can-see-who-has-a-temperature-or-coughs/">pandemic drones</a>, and satellite imagery — a new layer of ambient (ever-present, always-on, hyper-connected) technology is seamlessly enveloping the world around us. Ambient data collection and algorithmic decision-making allow our physical environments, like our devices, to be infiltrated with information and metadata constantly gleaned from our search histories, our purchases, our locations, our sleep patterns, our menstrual cycles.</p><p>Our physical and digital worlds are developing to become almost indistinguishable. This web of ambient technology is shaping our new reality. Question is, is that what we&nbsp;want?</p><blockquote>With the encompassing and interconnected nature of ambient technology, we are barreling towards a society in which each interaction with the physical and digital world is fair game for extraction and exploitation.</blockquote><p>This world isn’t science fiction — its creation is in progress, atop a complex web of existing technologies and systems already leveraging the personal data of&nbsp;users.</p>Still frame from The Intersection<p>Omidyar Network’s Exploration and Future Sensing team has been tracking this evolving trend since 2018. Our initial investigations provoked many questions: What could this world look like with a new layer of ambient technology? What currently drives its development and the course it takes? What is the experience of those already commonly marginalized, excluded, and/or discriminated against in current tech and surveillance systems? What might be the experience of immigrants, minorities, elderly, special needs, rural, urban, etc in this world? How could our interaction with technology, government, companies, society, each other change? Will these technology developments only be extractive, or is there a world where they could be supportive, or even regenerative? Is it possible for this world to be designed from a place that acknowledges our interconnectedness and centers diverse perspectives?</p> Making of “The Intersection” <p>To provoke the possibilities of this hyper-connected world, we partnered with <a href="https://superflux.in/">Superflux</a>, a speculative design and foresight agency. We hoped to provoke imagination about futures that could evolve what we, collectively, would like our relationship with technology to be, as we build the infrastructure, protocols, norms, social structures, and policies, for a technology ecosystem that can be empowering for us&nbsp;all.</p><blockquote>“I don’t want the tech we build to consume the world, but to augment and support it. We’re starting to build something new. A new way of networking and connecting. The tech was built from the ground up. To support people, instead of mining them.” — The Intersection</blockquote><p>Together we produced “The Intersection”, a short film that explores the future of ambient technology through the lens of four protagonists whose lives have been shaped by the dissonance of extractive technology norms, misinformation, surveillance capitalism, and context collapse:</p>  Ericka, a young activist whose movement for justice is derailed by a never-ending feed of misinformation and conspiracies concocted to extract&nbsp;data.  Jake, a journalist whose work is diluted and corrupted by AI systems that helped him prioritize clicks over the truth, taking news out of context and pandering to readers’ “intensely monitored, precisely categorized fears.”  Amp, a hardware engineer who set out to change the world using technology, only to have her utopian dream shattered by the realization that the only problem she was solving was finding new ways for technology companies to make&nbsp;money.  Tammi, a climate migrant who became a refugee in her own country because her family refused to evacuate in the face of an impending storm, citing “fake news”&nbsp;reports.  Still frame from The Intersection<p>As the film begins, the future of ambient tech is all-encompassing and ever present in every aspect of life. Individually, then together, the protagonists find ways to re-evaluate their relationships with technology — to repurpose and redesign ambient tech to serve their communities, support nature, and value human relationships. They come together to reconcile their differences — illustrating how people can be united by a common purpose, regardless of how different their backgrounds and world views may be. The film ends at a new beginning, open to audiences to shape — where could we head from here? What would we do today, if we knew this is where we were&nbsp;heading?</p><blockquote>“We wanted to show in an experiential way, the interconnected nature of the issues present in our world. Whether environmental, social or technological, these domains don’t reside within neat categories, they overlap and intermingle, giving birth to new hybrid forms that are as tricky to define as they are to address”– Anab Jain &amp; Jon Ardern, Superflux.</blockquote><p>We hope this film makes the future of ambient technology more tangible, prompts us to investigate our relationship with technology, and encourages us to build towards a more just, pluralistic world that centers the experiences of those most marginalized among&nbsp;us.</p><p>Watch the Intersection <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/569842501?badge=0&amp;amp;autopause=0&amp;amp;player_id=0&amp;amp;app_id=58479">here</a>.

 AKA Tao of WAO (but not the&nbsp;podcast) <p>As the state of the world has…evolved/deteriorated…<a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open</a> members have dealt with these changes and challenges in various ways. The co-op has grown up a lot over the last five years and with growing comes random conversations in which someone says “Do we need a policy on…?” This is adulting&nbsp;pure.</p><p>In April, we had a existential chat about the climate emergency, racial justice, lost traditions and more, and we decided that we wanted to write a page that summarises the points we agree&nbsp;on.</p>CC-BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/hashtag/activism/">Bryan&nbsp;Mathers</a><p>We’ve published our <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/spirit-of-wao">new page</a> on our wiki and are republishing here:</p> Spirit of&nbsp;WAO <p>In our April 2021 co-op day, we spoke about climate, justice, etc and would like to have a page that shows our&nbsp;spirit.</p><p>WAO is a collective of individuals who broadly agree on many things. Like any group of people, there are nuanced differences in our positions on the issues of the day, so instead of corporate pronouncements, this page exists to share what we believe in. It’s the product of discussion and debate during our monthly co-op&nbsp;days.</p><p>We believe in:<br> • Placing ourselves and our work in historical and social contexts so that we can make thoughtful decisions about our behaviours and mindsets.<br> • Seeing ourselves as part of nature not the rulers of it and acknowledging that there is a climate emergency. We are conscious of the lost lessons and spirit of the indigenous and strive for climate justice.<br> • Sharing resources to help combat prejudice wherever we see it (including, but not limited to: racism, sexism, ageism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and hostility relating to education or socio-economic status).</p><p>Instead of policies, we believe in dialogue that leads to action. Our members think carefully about charitable giving, and we have decided to make this an individual matter of conscience rather than a collective decision. As a cooperative, we consciously review the amount of travel we do for work, especially air&nbsp;travel.</p><p>One tool we’ve found useful in thinking about this is the Venn diagram (shown below) shared by the How to Save a Planet podcast. At the centre of what we’re good at, what needs doing, and what brings us joy is the work that makes a difference.</p><p>So to summarise, while you absolutely will see WAO members out on the street doing in-person activism, that’s not everyone’s style. Some of us run websites dedicated to informing people about important issues. Others are members of hyperlocal groups helping make the world a better&nbsp;place.</p><p>However we do it, WAO members do it intentionally and not because we have a policy for&nbsp;it.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/spirit-of-wao">See our&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p> Instead of virtue signalling, get to&nbsp;work <p>Over the last year and a half, our members did courses (some of which the co-op paid for), went to demos, read a bunch of stuff and donated to various causes. They reflected on <a href="https://medium.com/@LauraHilliger/quietly-paying-attention-b4add24684df">their own</a> and together. We are not perfect, haven’t necessarily had an easy time of it, but at we keep doing the work we believe in, and we keep thinking about how our actions create&nbsp;impact.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/spirit-of-wao-e5cb23c8cdfb">Spirit of WAO</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 WAO’s participation in the Catalyst Network Engagement WG <p>WAO is in the midst of our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/all-good-things-come-to-an-end-e3d21a93da49?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------">latest Catalyst-funded project</a>, having spent the majority of the pandemic supporting charities through digital transformation.</p><p>Catalyst itself is undergoing a transformation, as explained by Ellie in <a href="https://www.thecatalyst.org.uk/news/were-changing">this blog post</a>. In a nutshell, Catalyst responded well during the emergency situation caused by the pandemic and is now looking for how it can be more decentralised, equitable, and partnership-driven.</p><p>To help with that, they created several “temporary, experimental working groups” — one of which WAO got involved with. This was the <a href="https://coda.io/@ellie-hale/catalyst-working-groups">Network Engagement Working Group</a>, which met four times, facilitated mostly by <a href="https://twitter.com/tessacooper5">Tess Cooper</a>, although Doug did facilitate the third session while Tess was&nbsp;away.</p> Outputs <p>Skipping straight to what the group achieved, we spent a lot of time in <a href="https://miro.com">Miro</a>, but also one week in <a href="https://etherpad.org/">Etherpad</a> (given WAO’s love for it, no prizes for guessing which week that&nbsp;was!)</p><a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lCSGiY0=/">Miro board</a><a href="https://pad.weareopen.coop/p/catalyst-wg/timeslider#3954">Etherpad</a><p>There was a mix of organisations represented, from small charities to larger network organisations, as well as digital agencies and individual freelancers. In the Slack channel there are 19 people, with about 12–15 of them being on any one&nbsp;call.</p> Next steps Zoomable version of this image available as <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lCSGiY0=/?moveToWidget=3074457360251697304&amp;cot=14">Frame 8 on the Miro&nbsp;board</a><p>We took the opportunity as a group to plot our ideas on two axes: useful and feasible. More useful ideas go towards the top of the green rectangle, while more feasible ones go further to the&nbsp;right.</p><p>Once we had gone around discussing and moving these based on everyone’s input, we colour-coded them based on our original brief. Are these to do with core Catalyst business, reach and engagement, or&nbsp;both?</p><p>The list, sorted by colour from the top right is&nbsp;below.</p> Core   Design-hops and other practice training approaches  Come up with an open standard of what good digital practice/ infrastructure looks like within the charity&nbsp;sector  An evolving open-standard that can fit on a slide (process &amp;&nbsp;product)  Define what Catalyst areas need focusing on most e.g. services, resources, how orgs are engaged, reaching diversity of orgs e.g. through their&nbsp;networks   Reach / engagement   Explore and articulate what people can get out of engaging beyond&nbsp;money  Connecting UK Tech for Good organisers network with the local (generic and specialist) infrastructure organisations in their&nbsp;areas  Test assumptions about when, how and why people would engage and contribute their time and energy to influencing Catalyst’s work, network activity and direction of growth and money&nbsp;required  Train the trainers programme for tooling up infrastructure organisations so that they can carry actively support their members in digital transformation   Both   No-code expert to build relationships with suppliers and share how charities can easily apply these tools within their organisations  Deepen understanding of the diversity requirement — is it diversity of voices / reaching and supporting contribution from organisations that service under-recognised communities / social sector organisations that face disadvantages themselves (e.g. regional barriers, small team, niche&nbsp;issue)  Identify patterns of need, and connect that with digital best practice — build on the rich research that’s been done over the last year, keep adding and deepening and SHARE it across the&nbsp;network  Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan&nbsp;Mathers</a> Stars and&nbsp;wishes <p>We closed the final session talking about ‘stars’ and ‘wishes’ — i.e. highlights of the process as well as what we’d like to improve in future. The following were noted down by Ellie and shared in the Slack&nbsp;channel.</p> Stars   openness and feel of this&nbsp;group  so many of us care about&nbsp;this!  hearing people’s&nbsp;thoughts  being part of this conversation as a smaller, local&nbsp;org  learning from others in the room and being prompted to think about things differently  interesting collage of different peoples’ day jobs and experiences  great facilitation from Tess and&nbsp;Doug  grateful to connect in to this group, gives great energy to see people wanting to collaborate and find solutions  watching people think through a gnarly&nbsp;problem  contributions and insights of this group have been&nbsp;amazing   Wishes   to take what we’ve created on Miro and put it into a form that others can understand/input into  have something more tangible/manageable to engage with for next&nbsp;steps  something more&nbsp;tangible  cross referencing things across each working group will help shape the next bits (maybe it’s because we’re in a bubble that it’s confusing for&nbsp;us)  we remain connected in some way and see what comes out of this and other&nbsp;groups  keep this going in some way, shape or&nbsp;form  that Ellie gets all the support she&nbsp;needs  meeting in-person! getting to know people better outside of this&nbsp;convo  apply digital best practice to the way we’ve approached this group — user research, prototype then&nbsp;learn  tangible actions from this to take&nbsp;forwards   Next steps <p>Catalyst is hiring a new team over the summer to reconfigure its working practices and take forward some of the ideas of each of the working groups, where appropriate.</p><p>We Are Open would love to continue to be part of this exciting network, doing the hard yards of helping charities in their digital transformation journey!&nbsp;🙌</p><p>If your charity, non-profit, or for-good organisation needs some help, why not get in touch? <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">https://weareopen.coop/contact</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/on-common-ground-8fadc99692cd">On Common Ground</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>What is MiCA?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MiCA is the Acronym of Markets in Crypto Assets</p>
<p>The EU will create a SINGLE regulation &nbsp; for ALL 28 members Countries regarding Crypto</p>
<p>A Regulation..&nbsp; Basically&nbsp; is a LAW IMPOSED upon all countries immediately that supersedes any national regulations.</p>
<p>MiCA Regulation therefore is a single set of rules , Immediately applicable, Throughout the Single Market.</p>
<p>Is MiCA good or bad?</p>
<p>To Answer this question let’s focus on why they are doing it. The EU is drafting new strategy on digital finance for the EU financial sector. The EU with MiCA aims to ensure that the EU embraces the Blockchain revolution and become leader with innovative European firms in the lead, On one side they want&nbsp; to be innovation-Friendly to make digital finance available to European consumers and businesses. On the other side wants to&nbsp; mitigate the risk to consumers (and banks).</p>
<p>MiCA Objectives</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 First objective give LEGAL CERTAINTY to&nbsp; crypto-asset markets. The EU thinks there is a need for a sound legal framework, clearly defining the regulatory treatment of all crypto-assets that are not covered by existing EU legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Second objective is to SUPPORT INNOVATION.&nbsp; The EU wants to&nbsp; Promote crypto-assets development and new user cases while putting in place a safe and proportionate framework to support innovation and fair competition. 
 Third objective is CONSUMER PROTECTION. The EU thinks crypto-assets present many of the same risks as traditional&nbsp; financial instruments.&nbsp; 
 Fourth objective is to ensure FINANCIAL STABILITY. The EU is literally&nbsp; terrified by ‘stablecoins’, because&nbsp; unlike cryptocurrencies have the potential to become widely accepted and potentially systemic disruptive for the status quo.&nbsp;

<p>By CV Madhukar, Responsible Technology, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>In a world where digitization ubiquitous, we now have an opportunity to shape digital ID programs and other components of the digital public infrastructure in a direction that serves the <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-network-unpacks-good-id-update-our-point-view-digital-identity/">public interest</a> and powers the digital economy, rather than only serving private corporate interests.</p><p>Back in 2015, the UN Sustainable Development goals called for “legal identity for all” by 2030. At the time, the World Bank released data which revealed that 1.5 billion people in the world lacked formal identification. Those working on financial inclusion challenges were among the first to articulate the societal cost of this gap; if a person is unable to identify themself, then they will be unable to engage in for the formal financial system and economic growth will&nbsp;stall.</p><p>Yet conversations about digital identity innovation were mostly treated as a developing country issue, with ardent advocates in the West unwilling to acknowledge that digital identity could add value to developed economies. Now, as the world <a href="https://omidyar.com/a-decade-of-digital-public-goods-holding-up-the-digital-economy-preventing-monopolies-and-safeguarding-freedoms-for-all/">emerges from the pandemic</a>, attitudes seem to have taken a 180-degree turn.</p><p>The recognition that digital identification is increasingly central to the digital public infrastructure (that is, digital spaces for the public good) is gaining currency worldwide. Earlier this month, the European Commission proposed the creation of trusted and secure “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">Digital Identity for all Europeans</a>”. This is expected to go into effect in late 2022. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also spoke in February about the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0023">need for Digital IDs</a>, saying, “The same digital ID technology that protects against money laundering can also help us reach more people with&nbsp;relief.”</p><p>Every country will need to reimagine its technology infrastructure and make it fit-or-purpose for a digital century. While developing countries suffer from lack of technology infrastructure, developed economies have legacy systems that need urgent reimagining. The Clinton era effort of “Reinventing Government” will need a whole new makeover right now in the US with regard to reimagining technology infrastructure. But to really reimagine this, key stakeholders will need to overcome a deep chasm caused by the compartmentalization in thinking about the role of public sector and the private&nbsp;sector.</p><p>In her important work on the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/sites/public-purpose/files/final_the_entrepreneurial_state_and_public_options.pdf">Entrepreneurial State</a>, noted economist Mariana Mazzucato argues that the state as a fixer of market failures offers a limited view. The state as a market shaper and market maker is less recognized in the US, even though the state (through DARPA, NIH, etc.) has had a deep impact on the course of innovation in the private sector over several&nbsp;decades.</p><p>The very nature of infrastructure is such that it is an enabler for private sector economic activity. In the digital era, such infrastructure also has the ability to ”see” every transaction that takes place in these digital spaces. That is why when a website that requires some form of identification asks offers the option to login in with Facebook or Gmail credentials, the big tech platforms get to see much of the activity that the individual does on this third-party website. Similarly, when a payment platform uses the infrastructure provided by Visa or Mastercard, these companies gain insights on financial activity of the individuals that use such a provider.</p><p>At a time where data will be a “factor of production” in the new digital economy, those providing such infrastructure will naturally become massive monopolies or oligopolies. Using antitrust laws to remedy this without recognizing what caused data monopolies in the first place, is like trying to pick up water with a sieve. We need viable and scalable public alternatives for the existing digital infrastructure to truly curb such monopolies. This will provide a level playing field for all private market players, create the basis for interoperability, prevent data monopolies, and make services more accessible for individuals.</p><p>This is, according to a recent <a href="https://www.journalismliberty.org/publications/what-is-digital-public-infrastructure">paper</a> by Ethan Zuckerman, the strongest case for policymakers to take urgent and concrete measures for the development and adoption of digital public infrastructure as a way of shaping the trajectory of the future digital&nbsp;economy.</p><p>We need governments to own this agenda so that any new conception of digital public infrastructure is built on a solid foundation of safeguards. Even as we think about such large-scale deployment of technology, we must deliberately think about unintended consequences of such efforts and mitigate them. Safeguards in the form of technology, law, and institutions must drive the norms and behavior of both the designers of technology and its users, and the government must guarantee these protections. The financial sector or the pharmaceutical industry can offer valuable lessons in this&nbsp;regard.</p><p>Reimagining digital public infrastructure could have a positive, transformative impact on the global economy and global development. But it’s going to be important for the US and Europe to install safe and inclusive, digital public infrastructure (like federated digital ID and payment platforms) to see real change. If they make this kind of investment, we can begin to build a world where gaps in technology won’t limit the development programs governments can implement, the progress they can make, or support they can give people to improve their own&nbsp;lives.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-digital-public-infrastructure-is-no-longer-just-a-development-agenda-6c3915d20598">Reimagining digital public infrastructure is no longer just a development agenda</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We're excited to announce that the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/mainnet/">Ceramic Mainnet</a> is live. For the first time, developers can now create and deploy data streams to a peer-to-peer network of production-ready Ceramic nodes. As an open source platform for decentralized data streams, Ceramic provides a flexible, secure, and scalable infrastructure for managing data and identities in Web3 applications.</p><p>Leading up to today’s launch, Ceramic’s <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/networks/#clay-testnet">Clay Testnet</a> has had over 2,000 active developers, and more than 200 projects have signed up for the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-mainnet-early-launch-program/">Mainnet Early Launch Program (ELP)</a>.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with Ceramic or just getting up to speed on the technology, learn more about the core <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/features/">features</a> and <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/use-cases/">use cases</a> they enable.</p> Who is using Mainnet? <p>A collection of applications are already live on Mainnet or will be going live in the coming weeks including: <a href="https://boardroom.info">Boardroom</a>, <a href="https://zerion.io">Zerion</a>, <a href="https://geoweb.network">GeoWeb</a>, <a href="https://sourcecred.io">Sourcecred</a>, <a href="https://dns.xyz">DNS.XYZ</a>, <a href="https://self.id">Self.ID</a>, and <a href="https://rabbithole.gg">RabbitHole</a> – to name a few. These projects are using Ceramic Mainnet for functionality ranging from decentralized identity and user data storage (via <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/identity/idx/">IDX SDK</a>), to multi-account and cross-chain reputation systems, social networks and community forums, NFT-owned content streams, and much more.</p><p>Want to see content on Mainnet? Check out <a href="https://tiles.ceramic.community">Tiles</a>, a Ceramic browser which displays all streams created on Mainnet – built by members of the Ceramic community.</p> Advancing what's possible on Web3 <p>Ceramic brings the Web3 benefits of permissionless innovation and composability to all information on the web, unlocking a universe of content that can be openly queried, forked and remixed, or frictionlessly shared across applications and organizational boundaries – without relying on a single data center or database server.</p><p>Molly Mackinlay, Project Lead at <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>, said:</p><blockquote>Ceramic and IDX are a key piece of the Web3 puzzle. Placing their bets on IPFS, libp2p, blockchain, and DID-authenticated data, Ceramic gives developers the ability to build completely serverless applications using dynamic, verifiable, decentralized data streams.</blockquote><p>As the world moves closer to realizing the full potential of Web3, open data and identity infrastructure such as Ceramic will complement blockchain’s open value infrastructure, playing a key role for developers looking to build full-stack Web3 applications.</p> Get started with Mainnet <p>Starting today, Mainnet will be progressively rolled out in phases over the next several months beginning with a controlled Early Launch Program (ELP) and ending with a fully permissionless network. This helps ensure a safe and reliable experience for all developers.</p>  ELP Phase 1: Your app must use mainnet nodes hosted by the 3Box Labs organization. This is available today. To join, <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-mainnet-early-launch-program/">sign up for the waitlist</a>.  ELP Phase 2: You can run your own mainnet nodes for your app and no longer need to rely on 3Box Labs infrastructure, but you still need to be onboarded manually. This is available today. To join, <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-mainnet-early-launch-program/">sign up for the waitlist</a>.  Open Network Phase 3: You can openly run your own mainnet nodes or use a third-party node hosting service. No signup or waitlist needed. We aim to release Phase 3 within the next few months.  <p>To learn more about how you can launch your Web3 application on Ceramic's Mainnet, visit <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network">developers.ceramic.network</a>. If you have any questions, join the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> About Ceramic <p>Built on IPFS, Ceramic is a decentralized, open source platform for creating, hosting, and sharing data. With Ceramic's permissionless data streaming network, developers can store streams of information and ever-changing files directly on the decentralized web – and share updates with anyone in the world – all without trusted servers or intermediaries.</p>  Looking for your next challenge? <p>Want to contribute to the Ceramic protocol, network, and ecosystem? <a href="https://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a> is <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/3box">hiring for a variety of positions</a> including Blockchain Engineer, Technical Product Manager, Community Lead, and Software Engineers.</p>

 Documenting WAO’s collaboration with Participate <p>We Are Open is once again collaborating with <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a>, which is always a good time for our members. The folks at Participate are awesome, and have previously sponsored our work on <a href="https://badge.wiki">Badge Wiki</a> among other community endeavours.</p>Images via <a href="https://www.openpeeps.com/">https://www.openpeeps.com</a><p>This time around, we began our conversation from a starting point of our several year old <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/badge-bootcamp-will-be-back-soon-b11859b01873">Badge Bootcamp</a> email course. WAO was looking to update it, while Participate was looking to add some online sessions. However, as we chatted, our conversation quickly led us to something even more interesting: a social learning approach using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice">Communities of Practice</a> (“CoP”) + <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a> (“badges”) to:</p>  Upskill Participate team&nbsp;members  Educate people who are CoP-curious about value&nbsp;cycles  Provide real-world experience of badges to those new to&nbsp;them  <p>It’s always best to start at the beginning, so when we realised our scope and desire had changed, we sketched out personas and a project timeline.</p>Screenshot of Jamboard from a session between WAO and Participate.<p>In one of our workshops, Mark Otter (Participate’s CEO) used the phrase “Crawl, Walk, Run”, which is a perfect metaphor for a scaffolded release of a&nbsp;product.</p><p>This phrasing gave us ideas around how to structure the project — namely:</p>  Crawl — we’d start by upskilling staff users and gathering their feedback. Integrating their ideas into the structure and content would make it better for our “Walk” group of&nbsp;users.  Walk — people (external users) who are curious about CoP and want to learn&nbsp;more.  Run — after we’ve piloted this work with the CoP-curious folks, we engage with Badge Champions&nbsp;. These are people who are motivated and influential in getting an organisation to start thinking about upskilling in a non-traditional way.   Learning Journey&nbsp;Design Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/pathways/">Bryan&nbsp;Mathers</a><p>Too often learning design starts from the premise that there is a ‘body of knowledge’ for those taking the course to work through. The structure is therefore a bit like stepping stones across a river — any deviation and you ‘fall&nbsp;in’!</p><p>As experienced learning designers, and working with Participate who are experts in this, we decided on a different approach.</p>Learning journey&nbsp;design<p>The above structure ensures that there is a core learning experience which situates the participant and helps them to not only learn but *experience* what they are learning. For example, as you can see in the ‘Community as Course’ section, participants not only learn about CoP but get involved in (more than)&nbsp;one.</p><p>At any point, and not just when they’ve finished the above, participants can dive into the ‘Earning is Learning’ courses which help widen and deepen their knowledge and experience around CoP and badges. It might be that some participants never touch this material, which is fine, but the chances are that most will at least be curious to know a little more about either or both at some&nbsp;point.</p> Badge System&nbsp;Design <p>The great thing about badges is that they can be issued to anyone for anything. That means not only can Participate issue badges, but volunteer community moderators can too — and even participants can peer&nbsp;award!</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/issuing-open-badges/">Bryan&nbsp;Mathers</a><p>In this initial structure, we’ve designed badges that recognise the ‘value cycles’ that are central to Communities of Practice. So the badges for ‘Community as Course’ encourage participation, creating value for others, and reflecting on that experience.</p><p>Likewise, with the ‘Earning is Learning’ courses, badges involve not only knowledge acquisition and reflection, but also the *creation* of badges. This ensures that participants have both the theory *and* the practice to uses badges in&nbsp;future.</p><p>Good badge design has three&nbsp;pillars:</p>  A striking and relevant visual&nbsp;image  Clear criteria on how the badge is earned/awarded  A description explaining the value of the experiences recognised by the&nbsp;badge  <p>In addition, and where relevant, it’s really useful to have *evidence* of what the participant did to earn the badge. In our example above, the ‘Value Creator’ badge involves participants joining other communities, situating themselves, and adding value. Capturing that value in the badge evidence, either as a link or a screenshot, helps explain what the participant did, and the (potential) impact it&nbsp;had.</p> Next steps <p>We’re about to embark on a series of internal <a href="https://weareopen.coop/community-calls/">community calls</a> for Participate staff to build momentum around the project. This is an approach we’ve used with Mozilla, Greenpeace, and other organisations to help obtain buy-in. It’s a key part of a healthy <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop/">architecture of participation</a>.</p><p>Separately, but related, we’re considering adding an introductory course to our existing free, email based ones at <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/">learnwith.weareopen.coop</a>.</p><p>Written by Doug Belshaw &amp; Laura&nbsp;Hilliger</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/participation-thats-what-s-gonna-save-the-human-race-pete-seeger-ae57ba8370a5">“Participation.

<p>With equity crowdfunding Startups and SMEs can collect risk capital to finance the birth or the development of their business project.&nbsp; Italy has been among the first countries to regulate this kind of investment creating a real ecosystem and an official registry by Consob. In recent years the sector has evolved in terms of the number of platforms and capital raised, as well as the number of transactions managed, but from a technological point of view few steps have been taken.</p>
<p>The desire to use blockchain technology in 2meet2biz stems from a precise need: to apply the potential of a blockchain to the processes that normally characterize equity crowdfunding campaigns and that, by type, are essentially replicable and procedurizable for all bidding companies.</p>
<p>That’s why 2meet2biz, developed and managed by Migliora Srl, has embarked on an absolutely innovative path: to ensure to its corporate clients, as well as to all investors who join the campaigns, transparency, security and immutability of all processes related to the collection of capital, from the receipt of the initial documentation until the conclusion of the campaign, this thanks to a blockchain technology compliant, moreover, to the eIDAS directives.</p>
<p>For the same reason – to integrate with third party technologies with the aim of improving efficiency and security in economic and financial transactions – 2meet2biz has chosen to use an open banking software system, fully integrated into 2meet2biz, which through APIs securely guarantees financial flows, automating all phases of bank reconciliations and transactions.</p>
<p>2Meet2Biz.com is now part of Commercio.network, a blockchain that since 2018 has enabled all companies around the world to manage the three indispensable fiduciary processes of digital transformation: Creating a digital identity with eID, signing a document with eSignature and certifying the exchange of documents with eDelivery. Thanks to this the customer experience of the platform is ZERO PAPER and the processes from onboarding to eKYC (electronic know your customer) are totally digital.</p>
<p>2Meet2Biz.com has become the 45th of the 100 validator nodes of commercio.network joining the most important European players already present, such as Namirial, Infocert, VAR Group Zucchetti. Being a Validator Node means to participate in the most innovative, sustainable and advanced European project in the Blockchain field, also proposed as a technology for the EBSI call for proposals financed through PCP by the European Commission.</p>
<p>This step from one side is part of a very precise strategy, that is to integrate 2meet2biz with</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commerce Network</p>
<p>third party technologies that allow it to progressively improve the customer experience of all its customers, and on the other hand it is the first step of a wider project to exploit all the potentialities</p>
<p>that this business model intends to offer, from a procedural point of view and not only, ensuring a degree of transparency never seen in its sector in full compliance with EU MICA directives.</p>
<p>2meet2biz intends to guide the processes of crowd campaigns through the digital transformation, with the development and use of SAAS technologies able to make even the investment process innovative, both for principals and investors, maximizing the value chain of the campaigns presented, from their origin to the access to the target market. A new international strategic approach, with a path that will soon be applicable to all investors, involving partners with platforms that comply with the standards required by the European regulatory bodies.</p>

<p>By: FIDO Alliance Staff</p>



<p>The digital security, privacy and authentication landscape is evolving quickly in the European Union with new regulations that could have a broad ranging impact for its citizens, as well as companies around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit: Focus on Europe, which was held on June 17, experts on the authentication market in Europe provided insight into the latest developments including PSD2 SCA (Payment Services Directive Strong Customer Authentication), delegated authentication, eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) and the EU Digital Wallet among other efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Kicking off the virtual summit, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance outlined how the FIDO specifications work and why strong authentication is essential for multiple use cases including ecommerce, Internet of Things (IoT) and identity verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“FIDO’s goal from day one was to certainly reduce reliance on passwords, but in some ways that was just a means to an end, really trying to address the data breach problem, as the vast majority of data breaches are caused by weak credentials,” Shikiar said.</p>



<p>As FIDO is moving forward, there has been a need to strengthen identity verification assurance to support better and safer account recovery. As part of that, Shikiar noted that the FIDO Alliance launched the Identity Verification &amp; Binding Working Group (IDWG) which is driving that work forward.</p>



<p>“We’re seeking to establish best practices for possession based identity verification,” Shikiar said. “That will not only enable safer, easier and stronger account recovery, but doing so will also stop hackers from using the account recovery process as an opening for social engineering account takeovers.”</p>



<p>Helping to Limit Cart Abandonment</p>



  



<p>There is a tangible connection between ecommerce success and strong authentication, according to Rolf Lindemann, VP products at NokNok.</p>



<p>Lindermann noted that during the pandemic, ecommerce grew faster than ever before. But with 13% of credit card online payments not being completed, it’s clear that cart abandonment is still impacting business in a significant manner.</p>



<p>“We learned that authentication friction in general is a major factor for card abandonment,” Lindermann said. “This becomes obvious given that online authentication is at the core of all online transactions. Authentication is the front door to digital services in general.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The path to reducing authentication friction involves the use of FIDO, which Lindermann said can help to enable strong customer authentication that can be implemented in a single convenient step.</p>



<p>Toward a Strongly Authenticated Digital Identity&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Europe and elsewhere around the world, there is a growing conversation about the need to enable and provide some form of digital identity. According to Steve Pannifer, COO of Consult Hyperion, digital identity consists of three things: identification, authentication and authorization.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Pannifer explained that identification is all about asking the question – is this person real, unique and identifiable? Authentication is the process of realizing that an identified person is coming in to use the service again, as the service provider wants to know if it is the same person that established the identity at some point in the past. Authorization ties it all together, which uses identity and authentication to access services.</p>



<p>“Digital identity is not a means in and of itself, it’s a means to an end,” Pannifer said. “The end that it is serving is all of those services that I’m trying to get access to.”</p>



<p>Fabian Eberle, co-founder and COO at <a href="https://keyless.io/">Keyless</a> is also a big believer in digital identity. In a session, Eberle outlined the need for a decentralized system for personal identity management. Such a system puts users in control of their own identity information, and lets them selectively disclose that identity data in a more private and secure way.</p>



<p>Eberle noted that at LUISS Guido Carli University, over 10,000 students are now benefiting from a digital identity system that helps to support remote education services. The Keyless approach benefits from FIDO standards that helps to authenticate a device and identify students in a frictionless approach.</p>



<p>Digital Identity in Europe: eIDAS</p>



<p>In the European Union, there is an effort known as <a href="https://www.eid.as/">eIDAS</a> which is a legal framework for mutual recognition of national digital identity schemes.</p>



<p>“The purpose of eIDAS is cross border access for citizens in any European country to gain access to any public service in the EU,”Sebastian Elfors, senior solutions architect at Yubico explained.</p>



  



  



<p>FIDO standards are being increasingly adopted by European governments to help support eIDAS efforts. Among those that Elfors highlighted is healthcare authentication in Norway, EduID for universities in Sweden and the National Health Service (NHS) in the U.K.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO standards are also helping the Czech Republic with its CZ.NIC top level domain registry which also operates the mojedID (my ID in Czech) service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jaromi Talir, technical fellow at CZ.NIC and member of eIDAS Technical subgroup explained that the domain registry had a requirement to authenticate the identity of domain owners. That requirement led to the creation of mojeID, which has been using FIDO standards since 2019. Talir explained that CZ.NIC uses FIDO to support a multi-factor strong authentication based approach to help authentication user identity.</p>



<p>Using FIDO to Support Delegated Authentication</p>



<p>With the European Union’s Payment Services Directive Strong Customer Authentication (PSD2 SCA), that came into effect in 2021, there are very stringent requirements for merchants to authenticate consumers with payment providers.</p>



  



<p>In a panel discussion, Jonathan Grossar, VP, product development at Mastercard commented that within a few months of the introduction of PSD2 SCA there has been an increase in the number of transactions that have been abandoned by consumers.</p>



<p>“So a problem with PSD2 SCA is that consumers may have to authenticate twice,” Grossar siad. “First with the merchant to have access to the account or to the card that is stored on file and then a second time doing the transaction with the bank and potentially then with a different authentication mechanism.”</p>



<p>All those extra steps introduce additional friction and complexity for both merchants and consumers that can be alleviated with an approach known as delegated authentication. Grossar explained that with delegated authentication, the entire authentication piece is handled&nbsp; with a secure mechanism by merchants. Using FIDO standards in combination with EMVco’s <a href="https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/3d-secure/">3-D Secure</a> standards to share authentication and risk data is the way forward in Grossar’s view.</p>



<p>“FIDO is interoperable across multiple devices and platforms,” Grossar said. “So in short, you have today billions of devices that are enabled with FIDO, and that potentially can be used for delegated authentication.”</p>



<p>Jason Muncey, principal, EU Payment Acceptance &amp; International Expansion, at Amazon is also optimistic about using FIDO for delegated authentication. Muncey commented that even before the PSD2 SCA requirements cart abandonment was just a pain that all merchants have had to live with. In his view, there is a real need to have some form of consistent approach.</p>



<p>Lee Goddard, product director, head of authentication at Worldpay also noted that – there will always be some amount of abandonment potential in that purchase process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think the FIDO approach to delegated authentication will really take things a step further in removing evermore abandonment,” she said.</p>



<p>Remote Identity Verification in Europe</p>



<p>With the pandemic, the ability to do in-person identity verification became challenging, which led to a need for increased remote identity verification in Europe and other areas around the world.</p>



<p>In a panel discussion, Santosh Rajvaidya, senior director, product management at Jumio noted that to date, there is no consistent approach when it comes to remote ID verification in Europe. That situation could be changing with the new digital identity wallet approach from the European Commission that could be the first step in the right direction.</p>



  



<p>“What is happening with digital identity wallet is you do a one time verification of your ID and the identity is created in the digital identity wallet,” Rajvaidya said. “From there on the user can reuse it multiple times across different applications.”</p>



<p>There is now also an ID Verification and Binding Working Group IDWG within FIDO that is doing work that will also help with remote identity verification efforts. Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow, commented that when it comes to verification, user experience and convenience are key attributes.</p>



<p>“Most users aren’t concerned with their identity or the data privacy, they’ll tick the boxes and move on, they just want to get their service,” she said.</p>



<p>Wrapping up the virtual Authenticate Summit, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance emphasized that the FIDO Alliance is in a very good place today, in Europe and around the world.</p>



<p>“We’re seeing more and more companies adopt FIDO authentication,” Shikiar said. “I personally firmly believe that virtually every consumer service online will be offering passwordless login options in the next few years and our hope is that the vast majority of these leverage FIDO.”</p>



<p>Looking forward to the next FIDO Authenticate virtual summits is in September with a focus on government services. Then in October, the FIDO Alliance will be hosting its first live event with the Authenticate Conference in Seattle.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p><a href="http://tiles.ceramic.community">Tiles</a> is the first browser for content on the Ceramic Network. Built by several early Ceramic community members, Tiles is the easiest way to explore all streams being created and updated on the network or to examine the content of any given stream. It also helps developers discover the formats, schemas, and metadata being used by others, enabling them to build their applications with common data formats and patterns.</p><p>With upcoming features such as lenses, Tiles is primed to help Web3 developers create an open-source approach to data management and unlock more expressive UIs and experiences for their users.</p>  The cost of fragmented data <p>We've gotten so used to the fragmentation of data on Web2 that we sometimes forget how much it costs us. Developers and product builders are forced to contend with this fragmentation whenever they want to consume and make use of data from multiple sources. Similarly, users are forced to deal with data lock-in resulting in limited data in any single application or frustrating processes to manually export and connect data across multiple applications – usually with very limited success.</p><p>Oaksprout, one of the creators of Tiles along with his collaborator Izzy, has been trying to work around the patchwork data architecture that exists in Web2 for nearly a decade. He says:</p><blockquote>Services built on top of fragmented data are wildly limited because you can't aggregate information across them, which means that services in the Web2 world are just really, incredibly underpowered.</blockquote><p>Since Web2-powered products run on data stored in private database servers which are independently controlled and managed, there is no way for third parties or the general public to input or agree on the proper formats for certain types of data. Even in cases where a given data object is so common that it should conform to a standard — say, the format for a blog post or how to represent a step in a fitness tracker — each vendor will choose to implement their own model and schema for that data with no natural way to collaborate and coordinate with other vendors storing or consuming data for the same type of object.</p><p>In this paradigm every application exists only within its own silo, unable to connect with other applications or experiences that a user has on the web. Because of this, developers are forced to start cold or succumb to being locked into a specific platform, rather than being able to build on existing patterns that the ecosystem has aligned around and the data that has been created within other applications. If disparate, third-party applications and data sources were able to connect more easily, developers would be able to build richer and far more seamless user experiences, while dramatically accelerating development speed.</p> Consensus on data models <p>One great promise of the distributed web is data interoperability and composability: the ability to use the same content across different contexts, organizations, and applications. In practice, data interoperability requires more than just decentralized storage; it requires the ability for many different, unrelated parties to openly discover, interpret, and transform data formats and schemas - and eventually, over time, converge on them.</p><p>The Tiles team sees Ceramic as a promising solution for enabling distributed parties to come to consensus on data models for any use case. On Ceramic, data formats and schemas are published openly, where they can easily be discovered by others, and updated over time while maintaining a complete version history. &nbsp;This allows developers to examine the data models for popular applications and data sets, to discover standards being used widely, and to use them or extend them.</p><p>Ceramic offers an open-source approach to data, which can revolutionize how we interact with data on the web.</p>  Tiles v1: A stream browser <p>Tiles aims to provide an interface that makes it easy for developers to discover and make use of collaborative data models on Ceramic. The first version of Tiles is a simple streams explorer which lets users input a streamID to see the content it contains and the schema it uses. Users can inspect the content of a stream as well as the stream type, format, metadata, and history.</p>Using Tiles to examine a recently created Ceramic stream<p>Oaksprout believes that by presenting this information in such a simple and open way, Tiles will inspire developers to explore the possibilities of what Ceramic can enable.</p><blockquote>I think that when people can see what's on the network and the kind of streams that are being created, people will intuit what can be done.</blockquote> Unlocking UIs and customizable experiences <p>The value of discovering and building on shared data models starts with reusable, cross-application data – but to the Tiles team, this is only the beginning. In the future, they believe that a foundation of dependable, shared data models will give birth to user interfaces (UIs) that are much more customizable, dynamic, and flexible. When applications no longer need to define their own data models or spend time worrying about normalizing and integrating with data from other applications, they all can dedicate more time and resources to innovating much more freely on the UI and experience. Says Oaksprout:</p><blockquote>All the [related] data on Web3 will have a very similar structure. That means you can decouple the UI from the data layer and present in any way that you want to.</blockquote><p>For example, an application could be built that renders all Web3 blog posts in audio format since the application would be able to dependably ingest blog posts in text format, interpret the schema, and perform any required transformations (if necessary) before rendering the audio output. Everything would already be there to make this possible.</p><p>While it's difficult to predict exactly how this freedom will be deployed within applications and what innovations will emerge from it, the Tiles team is already seeing mounting evidence that end-users want the ability to program and customize their online experiences more than in the past. As one small example, Oaksprout believes that users' obsession with dark mode is only partly about the actual screen brightness, and equally about a desire to express their preferences in their own tools.</p><blockquote>People are tired of having one point of view, a Silicon Valley aesthetic, forced on them.</blockquote><p>The software of today is built rigidly and leaves very little ability for end-users or third-party applications to customize functionality, modify design, or adapt features to better fit their needs, preferences, and desires. The software of tomorrow will enable far more dynamic experiences by building on consensus-driven data models that lower the cost of standardization and reduce the risk of incompatibilities.</p>  Lenses for rendering data in apps at runtime <p>Currently, Tiles only lets users search and explore data streams on Ceramic. However, soon the product will expand into allowing users to view that data in new ways. For any stream, Tiles will allow users to choose a lens (format/view) through which to render and view that content. After a user selects their lens for a given stream, Tiles will transform the UI and display the content in the desired manner. This is all possible due to public schemas.</p><p>Eventually, Tiles aims to enable the dynamic rendering of data into various formats and UIs using a concept it calls "Lenses," which act as a way to view or transform data streams at runtime into the proper format for a given application.</p><blockquote>Tiles will give UIs the benefit of a very consistent consensus layer around data structures.</blockquote><p>At scale, lenses enable the same data to be leveraged across many different applications and experiences without requiring that all parties come to an explicit consensus on data schemas, or worry too much about maintaining version compatibility. Instead, with lenses, data can be transformed as needed between different versions, schemas, or formats directly inside an application's front-end at runtime. These lenses could be used directly in Tiles to examine data, but also deployed by developers to render data in different ways within their own applications. Oaksprout discusses the possibilities for lenses in this clip:</p>The future of apps with lenses Lens curation <p>As Tiles builds towards this ecosystem of open data models and runtime rendering options, they also envision helping the community curate the most useful lenses. For any given schema, the community could curate which lenses are most valuable and which defaults should be used.</p>Discovering and curating lenses<p>Beyond curating smart, global lens defaults for common data, lenses could also be specifically curated for different use cases, communities, or unique individuals. This combination of curating the best lenses globally and the best lenses for a given moment can make Tiles a key component of Web3's open source information flows.</p>  Tiles: Next Steps <p>Apart from further developing the concept of lenses, Tiles will continue to add functionality to their application as more projects onboard onto Ceramic mainnet and more streams are created. In the near future, the Tiles team aims to explore two additional areas of focus:</p>  Maturing their Ceramic indexing service in order to expose the interdependence and intersection of data that can be found on the network  Developing an open set of streams that can be used as data structure building blocks that will serve as frameworks for content on Ceramic  <p>If any of this piques your interest, please join the <a href="https://discord.gg/zgFSeRyWCb">Tiles project discord</a> and start contributing!</p> <p><a href="http://ceramic.network">Website</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a> | <a href="http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic">GitHub</a> | <a href="http://developers.ceramic.network">Documentation</a> |<a href="https://forum.avax.network/"> </a><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX Identity</a></p>

<p>The state of California recently <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">announced their Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record system</a>. It allows Californians to access a digital copy of their vaccine records, rather than having to depend entirely on their physical copy. The main entry point is a QR code containing a rudimentary Verifiable Claim (VC), which makes for great ease of use. However, Blockchain Commons has concerns over how the user experience (UX) design might negatively affect both privacy and security; we are working to address these with our new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone, Blockchain Commons’ first Apple appstore release.</p>

<p>
For a while now, increasingly personal information has been getting encoded as QRs. During the pandemic, COVID tests were  often stored as QRs. There has also been extensive use of QR codes to transmit secure information across an airgap. Many people first saw this use of QRs when they read a QR code for a two-factor authentication seed into their phone’s Authenticator app. At Blockchain Commons, we similarly use QR codes as an encoding method to transmit seeds and keys.</p>

<p>Some possible architectural issues arise from using QR codes for confidential data, such as the fact that you’re actually transmitting the data (not a proof of the data), that the QRs tend to contain all of the data (not just a selection), and that there’s no way to rescind a QR or expire it. Those issues will have to be dealt with at a foundational level as we figure out what can safely be encoded as a QR — and more importantly how to offer restricted proofs rather than complete information.</p>

<p>However, there are also security &amp; privacy UX issues related to the storage of QR codes that need to be resolved no matter what is encoded. The state of California itself demonstrated the bad habits that we’re already developing when they said in <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">their official press release</a>: “individuals are encouraged to screenshot the information and save it to their phone files or camera roll”.</p>

<p>Now, storing QRs as photos on a phone does meet some minimal security requirements. Most phones are closely held and protected by a PIN, a thumbprint, or a faceprint. They’re often backed up to a cloud service and that cloud data is mostly secured as well. Still, there are numerous opportunities for problems.</p>

<p>That’s in large part due to the fact that photos are built to be shared. It’s very easy to send a photo to a friend or a social network, which is great for photos, but less so for your QR codes. In addition, photos are built to be synced. Though your data might be relatively safe if it’s synced to the cloud, it’s not that secure when synced to your desktop computer, which is vulnerable to malware and other attacks.</p>

<p>Photos also aren’t built to be searched and their categorization systems are usually rudimentary. Even if your QR code was safe, you might not be able to easily find it.</p>

<p>
That’s where Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone comes in. Though we can only make sure that our own uses of QR codes are architecturally secure, we can definitely provide better ways to store QR codes, and that’s what QR Tool does.</p>

<p>QR Tool lets you scan any QR code into an encrypted vault. It then protects your code with two-factor authentication: you initilally log in with your Apple login and password, and then anytime you want to view your codes, you additionally must use a biometric authentication, such as a fingerprint. Unlike your semi-porous camera roll, QR Tool was built to keep confidential information secure.</p>

<p>QR Tool also provides proof that your codes weren’t changed. Using <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHash">Lifehash</a> technology, QR Tool links each code to a unique, evocative, and unchanging graphical color representation. This will prove particularly useful when the Lifehash specification is adopted by other companies, so that you can transfer a QR code between applications and verify immediately that it’s the same — something that’s difficult with the QR code alone.</p>

<p>Finally, QR Tool resolves the problem of categorization by automatically recognizing a wide variety of QR codes and giving you the opportunity to change those categorizations as you see fit.</p>

<p>If the future we hope to see more fully featured <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, but there’s no doubt that QRs are with us for the moment, and we need to make sure that they remain secure and easy to use. This is why we released QR Tool. It’s a reference implementation for the Gordian Principles, demonstrating how to store confidential data in a way that’s independent, private, resilient, and open: QR Tool ensures that you hold your own QRs, that they’re safe, and that you can easily transmit them to other services.</p>

<p>If you’ve got QRs of your own to secure, you can purchase QR Tool from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Apple Store</a> or you can compile it directly from the source code found at the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QR Tool repo</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>By Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and Chief Marketing Officer, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>FIDO Authentication has seen remarkable acceptance over the past few years, thanks in large part to standardization by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the subsequent adoption into leading device platforms and browsers. All told, we estimate over 4 billion devices (inclusive of Windows 10 PCs as well as every modern Apple and Android device) now support FIDO Authentication, as do over <a href="https://caniuse.com/webauthn">88% of web browsers</a>. Couple that addressable market with the ability for developers to write to the public FIDO2 WebAuthn API and you can see why so many enterprises are featuring FIDO support in request for proposals (RFPs) and accelerating related development plans.</p>



<p>However, while FIDO definitely does provide a simpler, stronger approach to user authentication, there is still a need to get users more accustomed to the user experience – and to optimize these flows as much as possible.&nbsp; In short, “if you build it they will come” isn’t always sufficient for paradigm-changing technologies. We’ve heard from more and more relying parties that they would benefit from tips on how to most effectively implement FIDO in a way that resonates with consumers and works across major browsers and platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past five years, the Alliance has conducted research that has consistently found consumers want to use FIDO authentication once they understand what it is and to have common “FIDO-enabled” signals to show where to obtain it. This illustrates the need for FIDO to be introduced to consumers in a user-friendly and consistent way in order for our protocols to be adopted at scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this requirement, FIDO’s Board of Directors last year launched a User Experience (UX) Task Force (UXTF), drawing on world-class UX experts from many of our member companies, including Bank of America, eBay, Facebook, Google, HYPR, IBM, Intuit, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Microsoft, Trusona, Visa, and Wells Fargo. The UXTF was tasked with creating recommendations and best practices for how to deploy FIDO, factoring in utilization of FIDO messaging, logos and other visual cues. We partnered with consulting firm <a href="https://blinkux.com/">Blink UX</a> to conduct the first formal usability research of FIDO user journeys, including registration and authentication steps and various use cases – all feeding into our Desktop Authenticator UX Guidelines.</p>



<p>To complement this effort, we constructed a strawman banking user journey that could be used to test various assumptions and to better examine the authentication steps actually employed by users. With IBM’s assistance, a <a href="https://digitalbank-test.com/">website</a> was created to reflect this use case and was utilized during our testing and analyses.&nbsp; The site will remain live as a reference implementation of our UX Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We divided the typical FIDO journey into a series of four major steps:</p>



  Promote awareness of the availability of various biometric sign-ins, then perform the actual sign-in and determine if a user has a FIDO-eligible device that can be used in the authentication process.  Invite users to register via FIDO, especially if they are using Windows Hello or Apple TouchID.  The actual FIDO registration of the user’s desktop authenticator, along with messages showing success or failure.  Making FIDO the primary sign-in path, and issue appropriate confirmation messages.  



<p>The UX tests were done in three different rounds. First was a qualitative series where we walked participants through a mock-up of the site and test. This allowed us to get feedback on some of our initial messaging and visual assumptions, which fed into the final site design. Next, we ran 100 subjects through independent quantitative testing – where they were assigned and had to complete a mock banking task, which included a prompt to enroll for FIDO login. Our last round of testing were qualitative video interviews, which provided an invaluable human element and insights on the FIDO value proposition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collectively, these tests are what helped define and focus our messaging, logos and various other iconography and logic flows that were useful in developing UX guidelines and other best practices for FIDO implementations.</p>



<p>Our preliminary recommendations from these tests are:</p>



  Use a simple biometric image (such as a fingerprint icon) to trigger the initial user registration, then have FIDO logos at each touchpoint to confirm that a user is following the right sequence of steps.  Make sure developers optimize for each type of environment (operating system and device form factors such as laptop or phone) for each FIDO-capable device. For example, Windows and MacOS have different icons that are used to designate fingerprint usage, as shown in the below screencaps.  



  



  Use one of two suggested messaging styles: we tested and validated one style that is simple and one that is to “add an option.” For example, a simple message might say: “You’re eligible for a simpler sign-in! Learn how you can skip your password the next time you sign in. Register now.” And the optional message might say:&nbsp; “Add an easy and safe way to access your account. Register now.”  Take steps to educate consumers and customer support staff on FIDO. Promote FIDO awareness across multiple touch points and marketing channels such as email and direct postal mail campaigns and social media. This should include information about FIDO-capable device availability and <a href="https://loginwithfido.com/">how to use FIDO on Windows 10 Hello and Apple smartphones.</a>&nbsp; This also will help address potential user reluctance around using biometric sign-ins. Although many users view biometric sign-in as desirable, convenient, and secure, some users initially express hesitancy to share biometric or other computer sign-in information with their bank or with FIDO – and hence need to be educated that their biometrics stay safely on their device.  Have a special “problem resolution” path for those customers who run into problems.  



<p>FIDO Alliance’s ultimate goal is to see as many service providers moving their customers away from password-based authentication as soon as possible – and we hope that these UX guidelines can help accelerate this movement.&nbsp; As this is our first foray into usability guidance we’re also open to and appreciative of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/UX-Guidelines">feedback</a> from deploying organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>By David Turner, Director of Standards Development, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Today we are announcing enhancements to two of the core FIDO protocols, the Client To Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) v2.1 and WebAuthn Level 2 – which collectively comprise FIDO2. Both are significant advances in extending FIDO’s capabilities specifically for enterprise users and supporting more complex application use cases. These enhancements come at an appropriate time, given the increased demand and rate of adoption for FIDO methods as the pandemic and remote work continues throughout the world.</p>



<p>The FIDO2 WebAuthn protocol is a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that describe how to enable authentications inside browser sessions. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">Level 2 is the latest version of the standard</a>, which is maintained by the W3C organization and was released in April. This standard makes it easier to write web applications that use FIDO Authentication, which is now supported across the five major endpoint operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, ChromeOS, and iOS).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are six major improvements that we are announcing today:</p>



<p>Enterprise attestation</p>



<p>Today’s announcements increase support for enterprise management of devices and users. The CTAP and WebAuthn protocols have added features that make it easier for enterprises to add specific user identity data during the registration process, so corporate administrators can more easily track key distribution and usage. Because these features can reveal some private user information – information that they would have divulged anyway to their employer – this feature is not available directly to consumers’ authenticators. Instead, authenticators must be pre-programmed (before credential registration) with these enterprise attestations by the enterprises themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cross-origin iFrame support</p>



<p>This feature allows web-based ecommerce transactions to be completed within pop-up windows on a browser, something that was forbidden in earlier FIDO versions as a way to protect potential man-in-the-middle and man-in-the-browser attack scenarios. The new standards make a very safe, secure and encrypted way to accomplish these transactions, without revealing data pulled from multiple domains such as the originating vendor, the user’s bank account, a credit card issuer, and so forth. It also helps in situations when users are connecting via bandwidth-limited circumstances (such as via Bluetooth or poor Wifi signals) to keep the authentication workflow moving without a lot of back-and-forth network traffic and latency delays.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Support for Apple Attestations</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance has been pleased to have Apple as a contributing member for the past 18 months.&nbsp;This feature adds support for Apple’s method of doing attestation on their devices using the WebAuthn protocols.</p>



<p>Better biometric management</p>



<p>The CTAP v2.1 additions include better biometric enrollment and management features, so that users can register multiple fingerprints and other bio-markers. Additionally, enterprises can set minimum PIN lengths. As more mobile devices include facial and fingerprint recognition, this keeps FIDO current with the latest authentication technologies.</p>



<p>Large blob support</p>



<p>An alternative to running a centralized authentication service, this feature includes a way to store things like certificates that may be necessary for other authentication scenarios, such as using encrypted SSH connections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Resident credential improvements&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now called discoverable credentials, this enables passwordless workflows to re-authenticate a user. The authentication dialog automatically finds and applies an existing credential and asks for user confirmation, thus making FIDO easier to use.</p>



<p>Always Require User Verification</p>



<p>This feature allows a user to protect the credentials on their authenticator with some form of user verification independent of the Relying Party. Platform authenticators and other authenticators with the feature enabled will always perform user verification. Some certification programs such as US FIPS 140-3 prohibit the authenticator performing signing operations without authentication.</p>

<p>One of the most frequent questions we get asked is about the technology choice of Cosmos. Why do you use Cosmos technology ? why didn’t you choose Bitcoin or Ethereum ?</p>
<blockquote><p>The answer is simple : Horizontal scalability.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of computing history there were only a few few computers called Mainframes. &nbsp; The first (Bitcoin) and second generation (Ethereum) blockchains are like Mainframes: a single large computer where everyone shares the same computing resources and writes code with Cobol-like languages. Vertical scalability on these blockchains is limited, and horizontal scalability is impossible.</p>
<p>Vertical Scalability:&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes methods to scale the blockchain itself. Moving away from Proof-of-Work and optimizing its components, Tendermint BFT can reach thousands of transactions per second. The bottleneck factor is the application itself. For example, an application such as a virtual machine (e.g., the Ethereum virtual machine) will impose a much lower limit on transaction throughput than an application where transaction types and state transition functions are directly embedded in it (e.g., standard Cosmos SDK application).</p>
<p>This is one reason why application-specific blockchains make sense.</p>
<p>Horizontal scalability:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if the consensus engine and application are highly optimized, at some point the transaction volume of a single blockchain inevitably hits a wall that it cannot cross. This is the limitation of vertical scaling. To overcome it, the solution is to move to multi-chain architectures. The idea is to have multiple parallel chains running the same application managed by a common set of validators, making blockchains theoretically infinitely scalable. The details of horizontal scalability are quite complex and beyond the scope of this introduction.</p>
<p>We need the Internet. A network of networks where everyone runs their own server. We need the Internet of blockchains.</p>
<p>Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by the same consensus mechanism: <a href="http://www.tendermint.com">Tendermint.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is a Cosmos blockchain?</p>
<p>A Cosmos blockchain is a digital ledger maintained by a set of validators that remains correct even if some validators (less than a third) are malicious. Each validator stores a copy of the ledger on their computer and updates it according to the rules defined by the protocol protocol when they receive transaction blocks.</p>
<p>Cosmos technology makes sure that the ledger is properly replicated, which means that every honest party sees the same version of the ledger at all times. A Cosmos-based blockchain has the ability for actors to share a ledger without having to rely on a central authority.</p>
<p>Achieving 15,000 transactions per second, was one of the goals of commerce.network and the only technology that can do this with 100 validator nodes is Cosmos.</p>
<p>For this reason in 2018 we chose <a href="http://www.cosmos.network">Cosmos.</a></p>

<p>The successful applicants will be invited to join a pre-mission in-person networking event in early September. They will then participate in a series of virtual evening sessions from 20 to 29 September 2021.</p>



<p>Those selected will join a programme curated for&nbsp;ANZ&nbsp;scale-ups. This will include sessions from key players in the UK tech ecosystem, who will provide exclusive insights on market opportunities and guidance on capital raising, R&amp;D and support to set up.</p>



<p>British Consul General and Deputy Trade Commissioner Asia Pacific (Australia and New Zealand), Louise Cantillon said:</p>



<blockquote><p>The UK tech sector has reached new heights and is the first country in Europe to reach 100 unicorns [tech companies valued at US$1 billion]. This means the UK now has the largest number of tech unicorns in Europe. With a fantastic track record for supporting tech companies and innovation, the UK is the ideal location for Australian and Kiwi tech companies who are ready to expand internationally.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The UK’s Department for International Trade team is delighted to be running this mission again. Despite physical restrictions, this is a great platform for the tech community to come together and for Australian and&nbsp;NZ&nbsp;companies to explore the opportunities the UK market has on offer. Good luck to everyone applying.</p></blockquote>



<p>DIT’s delegation last year was the largest ever from Australia and New Zealand. 130 tech founders and industry representatives joined the mission.</p>



<p>LTW&nbsp;is part of a broader programme of initiatives to increase digital trade and investment opportunities between the UK and&nbsp;ANZ&nbsp;tech sectors. Earlier this year the UK launched the Digital Trade Network (DTN) for Asia Pacific. The network will support UK-ANZ&nbsp;tech collaboration and support UK tech scale-ups in the region.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;LTW&nbsp;application process is open to Australian and New Zealand companies only. Victorian companies need to apply via the Global Victoria application.</p>



<p>Applications to join the mission will close on Friday 30 July 2021.</p>

<p>How to scale your Blockchain project using the Agile Method</p>
<p>The Agile Method is a particular project management approach that is used in software development. This method helps teams respond to the unpredictability of building software through the use of incremental and iterative work sequences, commonly known as sprints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The general principles of the Agile method</p>
<p>Our top priority is to satisfy the customer by releasing valuable software, right out of the box and continuously.<br>
We embrace changes in requirements, even at advanced stages of development.<br>
Agile processes leverage change for the customer’s competitive advantage.<br>
We frequently deliver working software, ranging from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, preferring short periods.<br>
Clients and developers must work together on a daily basis for the duration of the project.<br>
We base projects on motivated individuals.<br>
We give them the environment and support they need and trust in their ability to get the job done.<br>
A face-to-face conversation is the most efficient and effective way to communicate with and within the team.<br>
Working software is the primary measure of progress. – Agile processes promote sustainable development.<br>
Sponsors, developers, and users should be able to indefinitely maintain a steady pace.<br>
Continued focus on technical excellence and good design enhances agility.<br>
Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential.<br>
The best architectures, requirements, and design emerge from self-organizing teams.<br>
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, after which it adjusts and adapts its behavior accordingly.</p>
<p>History of the Agile Method&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the Agile ideas emerged in the 1970s. Studies and reviews were conducted on the Agile Method explaining its birth as a reaction against traditional approaches to project development. In 1970, Dr. William Royce published a paper discussing the management and development of large software systems. The paper outlined his specific ideas about sequential development. Specifically, his presentation stated that a project could be developed like a product on an assembly line: each phase of development had to be completed before the next phase could begin. The idea required that developers had to first put together all the requirements for a project. The next step was to complete its architecture. Code writing followed, and the development sequences continued in increments aimed at closing integral parts of the project. When these steps are completed, there is little or no contact between the specialized groups completing each phase of the project. The pioneers of the Agile Method believed that if developers studied the process, they would find the most logical and useful solution for software development.</p>
<p>Companies that use the Agile Method</p>
<p>Although there is no official list of companies that use the Agile Method for their projects, IBM is one of the companies that openly uses this method to develop software. In fact, many companies adopt it within their development structure, but they are not always open about their choice to use it. According to IBM, the use of the Agile Method generates significant organizational changes. IBM believes that many Agile software development teams will increase their chances of success by collaborating with reliable guidance. That company also helps clients implement their own Agile software development strategies for their projects and provides critical guidance that will help Agile software development teams avoid common pitfalls of adoption, expansion and implementation.</p>

  <p>According to a recent global study from McKinsey &amp; Company, Covid-19 has accelerated business’ digital initiatives by, on average, seven years.</p>
<p>In acknowledgement of this monumental leap forward, GLEIF has launched several strategic initiatives over the past year designed to broaden the value of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) in the fields of digital identity, digitized counterparty verification and their related use-cases. </p>
<p>As Germany celebrates Digital Day on June 18, GLEIF looks back at these milestones and considers what the future holds for the LEI and the global digital economy.  </p>
<p>The Validation Agent: Opening the door to business ID services for legal entities</p>
<p>In September, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-defines-new-validation-agent-role-for-banks-financial-institutions-to-simplify-and-accelerate-client-lifecycle-management">GLEIF introduced a new role into the Global LEI System called the Validation Agent</a>. The role is designed to help financial institutions and other supervised organizations make immediate gains in client lifecycle management and begin to develop innovative business identity services for their clients.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/validation-agents">Validation Agents</a> leverage their know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulated ‘business-as-usual’ onboarding processes to obtain LEIs for their customers. By equipping their business client base with LEIs, Validation Agents can promote financial inclusion and create new value by pioneering revenue generating digital services in corporate identity management and cross-border supply chain relationships. </p>
<p>Validation Agents can also utilize the LEI to accelerate their internal digital transformation, in areas such as customer onboarding, payments and other transactions, and contract signing.</p>
<p>Since its launch at the end of 2020, the Validation Agent framework has gained significant traction around the world. Two significant institutions, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-confirms-j-p-morgan-as-first-validation-agent-in-the-global-lei-system">J.P. Morgan</a> and the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-welcomes-pioneering-advances-by-china-financial-certification-authority-cfca-which-pave-the-way-for-increased-lei-usage-in-mass-market-digital-identity-products">China Financial Certification Authority (CFCA)</a>, have already completed the qualification process, with many more to follow. </p>
<p>The vLEI: Enabling instant, automated verification of business identity</p>
<p>Until now, the absence of an independent governance authority capable of establishing universal digitized trust between legal entities has presented an industry-wide barrier to innovation. To overcome this obstacle, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-advances-digital-trust-and-identity-for-legal-entities-globally">GLEIF launched a cross-industry development program</a> in 2020 to create a digitally verifiable LEI (vLEI).  When complete, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">the vLEI</a> will extend the Global LEI System to create a fully digitized LEI service that can enable instant and automated identity verification between counterparties operating across all industry sectors, globally. </p>
<p>With GLEIF acting as the ‘root of trust’, the vLEI service creates a cryptographically secure chain of trust that can replace the manual processes required to access and confirm an entity’s LEI data. This will give organizations worldwide the capacity to use their LEI’s non-repudiable identification data relating to their legal status, ownership structure and authorized representatives in a huge number of digital activities, many of them automated, enabling them to participate in the global digital economy for years to come. </p>
<p>As a result, the vLEI has the potential to become one of the most valuable digital credentials in the world; it will be the hallmark of authenticity for all legal entities everywhere.</p>
<p>In February 2021, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-unveils-issuance-and-infrastructure-models-for-verifiable-lei">GLEIF unveiled the official issuance and technical infrastructure models</a> which will support the development of the vLEI and now invites software developers to engage with the program’s stakeholders to explore how the vLEI can be leveraged in future applications. </p>
<p>Digital Certificates: Embedding the LEI to uphold trust in the system</p>
<p>As legal entities’ use of digital certificates continues to grow in both number and use-case application, so too does the time and cost required to maintain them. The increasing complexity of this task is already <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/blog/the-lei-the-missing-ingredient-in-digital-certificate-management">undermining the trust system that digital certificates were designed to create</a>. </p>
<p>To address this problem GLEIF has worked closely with the International Standards Organization (ISO) to <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/iso-standardizes-the-process-of-embedding-leis-in-digital-certificates">standardize the process of embedding LEIs into digital certificates</a> at the point of issuance, which will make certificates easier to manage, aggregate and maintain, as well as increasing transparency across the digital identity ecosystem. <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/the-lei-in-digital-certificates">By becoming the common link between digital certificates</a>, the LEI will provide certainty of identity in any online interaction, making it easier for everyone to participate with confidence in the global digital marketplace. </p>
<p>GLEIF is actively engaged with Certification Authorities (CAs) and Trust Service Providers (TSPs) to support and encourage LEI adoption in digital certificates as part of its new CA Stakeholder Group, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-launches-new-stakeholder-group-to-accelerate-the-integration-of-leis-in-digital-certificates">announced in March 2021</a>. This group aims to facilitate the transfer of mutually beneficial information between stakeholders in a joint effort to develop best practice guidelines and case studies for LEI integration. Following this, GLEIF <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-welcomes-pioneering-advances-by-china-financial-certification-authority-cfca-which-pave-the-way-for-increased-lei-usage-in-mass-market-digital-identity-products">welcomed the first commercial demonstration of an LEI embedded within a digital certificate</a> with the launch of the China Financial Certification Authority’s (CFCA) TrustSign® software in March 2021. </p>
<p>LEI Search 2.0: Enriching and automating access to LEI data</p>
<p>GLEIF has also been hard at work to ensure the LEI’s own tools stay ahead of the digitalization curve. </p>
<p>In 2020, in line with its vision to enable broader, automated use of the LEI, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-answers-industry-demand-for-customized-automated-access-to-rich-lei-data-with-lei-search-2-0-and-companion-api">GLEIF completed its migration to LEI Search 2.0</a>, a new LEI search engine with rich data functionality, and published a companion API enabling third-parties to set up fast, customized and automated searches and retrieve open, higher quality LEI data from within their application environments.</p>
<p>By expanding the number of search parameters available, <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/search/">LEI Search 2.0</a> delivers a new level of transparency over how legal entities have evolved over time, enabling faster and more sophisticated counterparty due diligence, heightened granularity in regulatory oversight procedures and richer reporting potential for market data aggregators. </p>
<p>What’s next? </p>
<p>In the coming months GLEIF will continue working hard to advance these strategic initiatives. </p>
<p>The Validation Agent Framework is maturing and GLEIF’s focus is now on championing the roles benefits and encourage take-up from financial institutions and other supervised organizations around the world. </p>
<p>The vLEI continues to evolve at pace as stakeholders across healthcare, pharmaceutical, telecom, automotive and financial services begin to build out sector-specific applications. </p>
<p>In collaboration with members of the CA Stakeholder Group, GLEIF continues to combat complexity and advance trust and transparency across the digital certificate ecosystem around the world.</p>
<p>The LEI’s legacy is proudly rooted in financial services and regulation. Its future, however, undeniably points beyond to broader, digitized adoption and utilization across public and private sectors around the world. The Global LEI System is the only open, commercially neutral, and regulatory endorsed system capable of establishing digitized trust between all legal entities everywhere. It was established as a public good, and GLEIF remains committed to ensuring that every last drop of value is wrung from the system, and used to the benefit of all.</p>

 ENGIE Energy Access and Energy Web Announce DeFi Crowdfunding Platform to Help Scale Solar, Mini Grids in Sub-Saharan Africa <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/zf9_yiAekJs">Seth Doyle</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/zf9_yiAekJs">Unsplash</a><p>Zug, Switzerland and Berlin, Germany — 17 June 2021 — Today nonprofit Energy Web and<a href="https://www.engie-energyaccess.com/"> ENGIE Energy Access</a> — one of the leading off-grid, Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) solar and mini-grid solutions providers in Africa — announced a partnership to accelerate energy access in sub-Saharan Africa through a decentralized finance (DeFi) crowdfunding platform. The DeFi application will be built on the open-source Energy Web tech stack and enable investors to provide microloans that support clean energy deployment.</p><p>In 2019, an estimated <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/sdg7-data-and-projections/access-to-electricity">580 million people</a> in sub-Saharan Africa remained off grid and in the dark, accounting for three-quarters of the global population without electricity access. After years of steady declines since 2013, that number has risen in 2020 due to the Covid 19 pandemic. Thus rapid deployment of solar home systems (SHSs) and clean energy mini-grids is a crucial humanitarian cause that supports health, quality of life, and economic growth in off-grid regions of the subcontinent.</p><p>ENGIE Energy Access integrates and unites ENGIE’s solar home system companies, Fenix International and ENGIE Mobisol, as well as its mini-grids provider, ENGIE PowerCorner, under one entity and one name. “To date, ENGIE Energy Access has served over 1 million customers and 6 million people in 9 countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The new DeFi platform in partnership with Energy Web will help ENGIE Energy Access deploy more solar faster, by directly tackling a key challenge: access to low-cost financing,” commented Gillian-Alexandre Huart, CEO of ENGIE Energy&nbsp;access.”</p><p>“We’re excited to bring crypto-based decentralized finance to rural electrification in Africa,” said Stefan Zelazny, Head of Software and IT at ENGIE Energy Access and previously CIO at ENGIE Mobisol. “We believe this can accelerate much-needed clean energy deployment throughout the region by connecting impact-oriented investors with unbanked rural customers. Combining the technology that remotely connects and controls our Solar-Home-Systems with the Energy Web Chain will result in the first smart asset-backed NFT where asset use can be controlled via the&nbsp;chain.”</p><p>The first phase of this initiative will focus on integrating the Energy Web software tech stack with ENGIE’s platform to further promote rural electrification in Africa. The crowdfunding platform to be developed by Energy Web will allow micro-investors to finance the installation of clean energy assets by staking Energy Web Tokens (EWT), the native token of the Energy Web Chain, in exchange for a fixed interest rate. This setup will unlock capital from the global cryptocurrency market, bringing a significant new source of capital to clean energy deployment in Africa. To help mitigate the risk for everybody involved, the Community Fund of Energy Web will back this first phase of the platform. Giving people in Africa access to new green electricity solutions utilizing the Energy Web DOS is a great first use case for the Community Fund.</p><p>In the second phase, Energy Web will work together with ENGIE Energy Access to give a unique decentralized identifier (DID) to each one of the home appliances and rooftop solar deployed by ENGIE. This way, one can directly add credits to the appliances owned by locals to support their access to electricity and its services.</p><p>“Creating positive impact in people’s lives is one of our core principles at Energy Web. But the global energy transition must also reach those who don’t yet have access to electricity,” explained Energy Web’s Walter Kok. “We are happy that ENGIE — one of the biggest energy players in the world and one of the founding members of the Energy Web Chain — has embraced the Energy Web technology stack to support such an important mission.”</p><p>About ENGIE Energy Access<br>ENGIE Energy Access is the leading Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGo) and mini-grids solutions provider in Africa, with a mission to deliver affordable, reliable and sustainable energy solutions and life-changing services with exceptional customer experience. The company is a result of the integration of Fenix International, ENGIE Mobisol and ENGIE PowerCorner; and develops innovative, off-grid solar solutions for homes, public services and businesses, enabling customers and distribution partners access to clean, affordable energy. The PAYGo solar home systems are financed through affordable installments from $0.14 per day and the mini-grids foster economic development by enabling electrical productive use and triggering business opportunities for entrepreneurs in rural communities. With over 1,700 employees, operations in nine countries across Africa (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), over 1 million customers and 6 million lives impacted so far, ENGIE Energy Access aims to remain the leading clean energy company, serving millions of customers across Africa by&nbsp;2025.</p><p>For more, please visit<a href="https://engie-energyaccess.com/"> https://engie-energyaccess.com/</a></p><p>Contact&nbsp;: <a href="mailto:stefan.zelazny@engie.com">stefan.zelazny@engie.com</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

 Energy Web Names Chief Commercial Officer Jesse Morris as Energy Web CEO, Outgoing CEO Walter Kok will lead Lab.EnergyWeb <p>Zug, Switzerland — 16 June 2021 — Today we’re excited to introduce <a href="https://lab.energyweb.org/">The Lab (Lab.EnergyWeb)</a>, a new R&amp;D initiative housed within Energy Web to build out cutting-edge functionality, services, SDKs, and other enhancements on the Energy Web stack. Initial projects under development within our new Lab unit include a DeFi application for crowdfunding energy-sector projects in emerging economies via Energy Web Tokens, additional staking models on the Energy Web stack, migrating non-energy crypto applications to the Energy Web Chain, and launching the development of Energy Web Chain 2.0. The announcement comes as we celebrate the second anniversary of the launch of the Energy Web Chain later this week. Walter Kok will lead this new initiative whilst he steps down as&nbsp;CEO.</p><p>In tandem, we’re pleased to announce that Jesse Morris, our longtime chief commercial officer, has been named Energy Web’s new CEO. Since our founding in 2017, Morris’ leadership has been fundamental to the growth of Energy Web into the world’s largest ecosystem of energy companies focused on accelerating the energy transition with open source digital technology.</p><p>“This is an exciting moment for Energy Web, as we move into the next phase of the organization’s evolution,” explained Jules Kortenhorst, EW Foundation Council member and CEO of Energy Web co-founder RMI. “Walter came to Energy Web to launch the world’s first public blockchain tailored to the energy sector. Under his leadership the Energy Web community experienced very rapid growth while adoption of the EW tech stack has scaled in a growing list of major projects around the world — especially impressive against the backdrop of a global pandemic. The next era of Energy Web with Jesse’s leadership promises to be just as revolutionary. Jesse has been instrumental to the success of Energy Web since its incubation and together with Walter leading the Lab we will continue to accelerate the energy transition through digital&nbsp;tech.”</p><p>In a similar move of promoting from within, Kok was Energy Web’s chief operating officer before being named its second CEO in August 2019. He came to Energy Web from a 30+ year career spanning ING Bank, Vodafone Global Enterprise, and NEC Corporation and several startups. Prior to joining the co-founding team of Energy Web, Morris was a principal in the electricity practice at RMI, where he partnered with utilities, technology providers, developers, and regulatory stakeholders to help distributed energy resources become an integral, widely-accessible part of the global electricity system.</p><p>“Walter and I have been working closely together for years now and we’re both excited about our new roles and responsibilities,” reflected Morris. “Me taking the reins as CEO will free up Walter to incubate a series of bleeding-edge crypto and digital projects under the new Lab. This move will make it easier for not just Energy Web as an organization but for our entire community to continue innovating well ahead of the energy&nbsp;market.”</p><p>“Coming from major enterprises like ING Bank and Vodafone, it’s been an incredible experience to lead the Energy Web team. There are so many talents at Energy Web and Jesse stepping into the CEO role is a great example of how we develop the new breed of leaders.” added Kok. “We are growing fast around the world, and I’m thrilled to continue informing our strategy as we forge ahead with The Lab. We will kick-off additional bleeding edge projects to demonstrate the level of innovation that is possible with our EW-DOS today. We are going to speed up the pace and will bring other sectors to our carbon-neutral Energy Web Chain too. Acting our way into new thinking”</p><p>Energy Web’s core team has grown rapidly under Kok’s watch — scaling alongside our ambition and work with the global energy and crypto sectors — almost tripling since the EW Chain’s one-year anniversary in 2020. In less than two years, the EW Chain’s validator network has grown to 44 companies spanning four continents. Some 45,000 wallet addresses have already generated 28 million transactions. Yet the biggest gains are&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>Morris concluded by saying, “The two industries we straddle — crypto and grid digitization — are still in their infancy. For as much as we’ve collectively accomplished until now, we’re just getting started.”</p><p><a href="https://lab.energyweb.org/">Learn more about The Lab at lab.energy.org</a>.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

<p>Over the last couple of weeks I’ve been thinking quite a lot about the concept of the Trust Economy.&nbsp; What is it? And why should we care about it?</p>



<p>My interest was first piqued when I came across two videos on YouTube from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vbPXbm8eTw">Rachel Botsman</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNog-xrc_YA">Philipp Kristian Diekhöner.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trust has always been at the centre of society overall and commerce in particular.&nbsp; There’s a reason why during the first industrial revolution banks always built the most impressive, secure looking buildings in town – so you trusted them to deposit you money there!</p>



<p>Now with the 4th industrial (digital) revolution the old vertical, siloed trust models are breaking down and we are moving to a more horizontal, distributed environment.&nbsp; The decline in trust in the media (fake news) and the lack of trust we are all now feeling with the way big tech is monetising our personal data is creating ever increasing demands from people to significantly improve trust models for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have a strong sense that Aotearoa New Zealand has always projected a reasonably trusted persona globally;&nbsp; good people, good morals, good global citizens etc… and now our Covid-19 response would appear to have bolstered the level of trust people have in us across the planet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An example of this is the <a href="https://brandirectory.com/globalsoftpower/">Global Soft Power Index</a> which for its 2021 ranking had Aotearoa New Zealand as the fastest improving nation in the Index, claiming 16th place in the ranking (up from 22 last year), citing “perceptions of New Zealand have no doubt been bolstered as nations such as the UK and the US cede their usual place as leaders in public health, with both battling repeated waves of the COVID-19 virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There would now appear to be a real opportunity for us to focus on really enhancing our trust position globally.&nbsp; 100% Pure New Zealand was a really strong brand position.&nbsp; Might something like 100% Trusted New Zealand be a branding idea for our future?</p>



<p>And in the context of the digital economy, digital identity and trust go hand in hand as cornerstones of the Trust Economy.</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>

<p>When Energy Web <a href="https://rmi.org/press-release/press-release-energy-web-foundation-launch/">launched in early 2017</a>, we did so with the support of two key cofounders: RMI, a leading global think-and-do tank focused on the energy transition, and Grid Singularity, an award-winning energy blockchain developer.</p><p>Two years later in June 2019 we <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-foundation-launches-worlds-first-public-open-source-enterprise-grade-blockchain-3a67fc457341">launched the Energy Web Chain</a> in partnership with a global community of energy companies, grid operators, and other enterprises that had grown into the <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-foundation-surpasses-100-affiliates-en-route-to-becoming-largest-energy-blockchain-4823616b1579">world’s largest energy blockchain ecosystem</a>. Within the first year of the EW Chain’s operation, solutions and transactions on the network grew quickly, while the validator network <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-chain-celebrates-tripling-of-validator-network-9cdfd830e044'">more than&nbsp;tripled</a>.</p><p>As we now look ahead to the third year of the Energy Web Chain’s growing prominence in the energy and crypto spaces, the cofounders remain as committed as ever to the Energy Web mission of accelerating the energy transition by unleashing the potential of blockchain and other digital technologies.</p><p>For example, RMI partnered with Energy Web and the Alliance for Innovative Regulation (AIR) earlier this year to launch the <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Crypto Climate Accord</a>. Meanwhile, Grid Singularity has continued to focus on <a href="https://gridsingularity.com/d3a/">building energy market exchanges</a> on top of the Energy Web tech&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Thus on this EW Chain anniversary, we are pleased to share these statements from our cofounders, who are re-affirming their commitment to supporting the Energy Web Chain, the Energy Web Community, and the greater Energy Web ecosystem moving&nbsp;forward:</p> Statement from&nbsp;RMI <p>“RMI will continue to strongly support the value created by the Energy Web Foundation and the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System. As a steward of EWF’s mission and a broader champion of the energy transition, RMI commits to employ its EWT only where necessary to build new business models, engage in bonding and chain-related activities, and more broadly stimulate the advance of critical decentralized digital markets that support a rapid transition to a zero-carbon economy. We recognize that building a successful utility token platform will take time and know that EWF is well on its way to creating a world-changing model that fuses decentralized, low carbon generation with distributed ledgers and computing.”</p> Statement from Grid Singularity <p>“Grid Singularity will continue to strongly support the value created by the Energy Web Foundation and the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System. Grid Singularity intends to use held EWT to scale the development of the Grid Singularity energy exchange for peer-to-peer and community trading, to invest in community applications and to contribute to the next growth stage of EWF 2.0, leveraging Polkadot technology, such as by staking, bonding for parachains, and advancing on-chain governance.”</p><p>Their statements are a testament to their continued trust and investment in the potential of blockchain and other decentralized, digital technology—including the evolving Energy Web tech stack—to accelerate the energy transition.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-cofounders-rmi-and-grid-singularity-reaffirm-their-commitment-to-the-mission-81ef02df81bb">Energy Web Cofounders RMI and Grid Singularity Reaffirm Their Commitment to the Mission</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

     <p>Denver, CO (JUNE 14, 2021) – Bonifii, an industry leader in privacy- and security-enhanced solutions, announces the release of CUFX versions 4.5 and 5.0.  More than just a recent update, the two versions are a milestone in the evolution of CUFX (Credit Union Financial Exchange).  Credit unions can share data between banking systems by leveraging CUFX, the open integration standard designed to make products and services available to their members more quickly, while reducing implementation costs. </p>
<p>CUFX was created by and continues to be a community of thought and technology leaders to advance a financial services ecosystem standard that reduces technical complexity, drives down costs, and improves speed to market.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://bonifii.com/2021/02/credit-union-financial-exchange-cufx-to-be-acquired-by-culedger/">With the acquisition by Bonifii earlier this year</a>, CUFX is a protocol for the exchange of data supported by a systems integration standard that will allow credit unions the ability to increase the speed to become more digital,” says John Ainsworth, president/CEO of Bonifii.  “We’re very pleased these new updates will enable greater security and privacy of information transmitted between credit union systems.”</p>
<p>Key Feature of CUFX Version 4.5</p>
 
 CUFX, Version 4.5, has been published and will expand the capability to accept verified credentials, establish secure connection protocols, and pass decentralized identifiers for verification in the credential group message. These new capabilities will enable CUFX to utilize cutting-edge technologies for superior security in communications, identity, and fraud prevention that will benefit not only credit unions and their members but the providers that service this industry.  
 
<p>Key Features of CUFX Version 5.0</p>
 
 Open API 3 upgrade so that users can now show the override and properly show the examples in Swaggerhub. This will allow architects to pass content in the message body where it is more secure and encrypted.  
 New data elements have been expanded for all account types to ensure their availability and consistent use for all account types—deposits, loans, and investments. 
 For remote deposit, the update improves the organization of data for images and image validation for better results.

 If we accept the premise that on the Internet “if you’re not paying, you’re the product”, in the Metaverse you will become a walking — talking billboard. The Metaverse, art by the author of this post <a href="https://www.picmonkey.com/legal/tos">under license by PicMonkey</a>. Intro: Video games&nbsp;now <p>Amongst the changes that “lockdowns” and “new normality” have brought, there is a revalorization of digital interactions as valuable and meaningful. Ironically, what was once regarded as isolationist or a poor substitute for “real life” (an expression used as an interchangeable semantic proxy for “in-person”) experiences, has become the glue that holds the social fabric together.</p><p>Connecting in and through digital spaces has been a staple of 2020: from work or formal education moving to online alternatives, to recreational uses of video platforms. In these virtual spaces, human ingenuity has found new testing grounds to deal with the challenges presented by the pandemic. It can be a thoughtful provocation to say that since lockdowns started, we might have been living in a proto-version of the Metaverse.</p><p>The silver lining is an accelerated digital transformation, even for those areas traditionally reluctant to innovate or that deemed remoteness incompatible with organizational culture (like small businesses adopting digital payments as opposed to inveterate cash-only business practices, or governmental bureaucracies offering online alternatives to otherwise mandatory in-person procedures).</p><p>Amidst this burgeoning digital life, video games have experienced an influx of new players, <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/game-engagement-during-covid-pandemic-adds-15-billion-to-global-games-market-revenue-forecast/">growing revenue</a>, and newfound mainstream respect. One year after designating video game addiction as a <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/addictive-behaviours-gaming-disorder">mental health disorder</a>, the OMS has taken a more nuanced position, acknowledging their positive value for socialization.</p><p>Beyond their collective value, in times of uncertainty video games constitute a space to regain some sense of control and security, as well as a place to <a href="https://anormallostphone.com/">exercise empathy</a>. By design, challenges in gaming are presented to the player with the implicit promise that they can be solved with the tools provided beforehand, and the skills gained along the way. Good game design will equip players with prerequisite skills and knowledge to arrive at that stage with a chance of success, and never confront them with a challenge that is impossible to win. With the unspoken pact that there is always -at least- one guaranteed possibility of triumph, losing just becomes a matter of trying but not a failure. With the reassurance of success looming ahead, losing becomes just another moving part of the game, a rehearsal in the path to&nbsp;winning.</p><p>Considering games as a narrative medium that separates itself from others by its interactivity, gaming presents unprecedented potential as a rehearsal space for empathy. When we play, we are able to try a different skin and participate in a story from a privileged insider perspective that no other medium can&nbsp;match.</p><p>Video games are consumed not only by playing but also by communal activities like engaging in watching others play. Streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube are popular amongst youth due to the added value of interpersonal interaction, a sense of belonging, and community building.</p><p>The Metaverse, defined as an encompassing, persistent, virtual world, can be seen as the newest iteration of the Internet, both an evolutionary step and a fusion of social networks and online gaming. As gaming becomes more ubiquitous and social media platforms resort to gamification mechanics to promote interaction between users, the frontiers between these two worlds tend to blur: platforms become games and games take the place of social media spaces. Twitch, which started as a platform to watch other people play games, has evolved into a community-building space where games are also played with the audience, by using overlays and gamified mechanics of interaction.</p><p>Fortnite has been a pioneer in this space, not only with its “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lJlaP-2HY">Party Royale</a>” mode and providing concerts and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/fortnite-is-screening-an-entire-christopher-nolan-movie-for-free/">movie screenings</a> (separated from the core gameplay but organically integrated as a whole) but also by creating a gaming experience that incentivizes socialization. Gaming platforms have become the new town square, where bonds, friendships, and rivalries are forged over voice&nbsp;chat.</p><p>Besides social aspects of play, in a receding economy for industries related to in-person activities (affected by the pandemic through overstressed supply chains and reduced demand), the video game industry and its ecosystem have been one of the few to increment growth. With changes in consumer behavior driven by stay-at-home routines, it is no surprise that fashion, movies, and other related domains are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gucci-roblox-76339d10f139e9b0d39761bd8426c11e">moving into digital spaces</a> and seeking to create digital doppelgangers of the goods and services they provide in the tangible world. Marketing and advertising are <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/01/the-metaverse-needs-responsible-stewardship-not-greedy-predators/">increasingly interested in the Metaverse</a>, as the next frontier for expanding their brand’s business and targeting prospective new audiences.</p><p>The recent explosion of the NFTs market is a closely related phenomenon, and its rise is partly attributable to their ability to create artificial scarcity. Through maiming their essentially infinitely replicable with near-zero marginal cost attribute, NFTs provide to digital goods the non-fungibility characteristic of analog goods. Decentralized blockchain applications and NFT’s based business models allow the creation of secondary markets for digital goods, providing a foundational economic backbone for the Metaverse.</p><p>Paired with advancements in VR/XR and AR technology, investment and <a href="https://epicgames.com/site/th/news/announcing-a-1-billion-funding-round-to-support-epics-long-term-vision-for-the-metaverse">funding</a> attracting new <a href="https://www.oculus.com/facebook-horizon/">players</a>, all of these factors converge into creating a critical juncture for the pursuit of the Metaverse.</p> “Metaverse/s” and virtual&nbsp;worlds <p>The term Metaverse is attributed to Neal Stephenson and his book Snow Crash, a novel about a protagonist (actually, a Hiro Protagonist) interacting in a persistent, immersive, shared, virtual&nbsp;world.</p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/30455994@N03/4955876395">“Neal Stephenson — Snow Crash”</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/30455994@N03">RA.AZ</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&amp;atype=rich">CC BY&nbsp;2.0</a><p>The concept, which both echoes and modifies the idea of “cyberspace,” a term popularized by the 1984 William Gibson novel “Neuromancer,” has been revisited in other sci-fi works like Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. Both movie and book portray OASIS (which stands for Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), as a massively multiplayer online simulation accessible via haptic devices, that hosts entertainment, commercial and educative hubs.</p><p>People will participate in these spaces through a digital representation of themselves, as avatars or skins, that could assume any possible shape or form. Restrictions will probably come from the terms of service, community standards or policies, intellectual property infringements, or licensing requirements.</p><p>The Metaverse is different from virtual worlds in the sense that it aspires to contain all or several of these virtual worlds, or at least, to create interoperable gateways to connect them, functioning as an all-encompassing, unified portal and hub. That poses an interesting tension between the pretended decentralization where blockchain advocates see an intersection with the Metaverse, against its own monopolistic proposition. One friction that only can be solved by creating a pipeline of true interoperability, both technical and legal, that enables the flow and uniform treatment of data (by uniform data protection laws) and content (likewise, for intellectual property regulations).</p><p>The architecture of the Metaverse can be fragmented into several attributes that should be checked by those aspiring candidates:</p>  ubiquity: the Metaverse will need to encompass different aspects of human experience, from leisure to education, finances, political expression, etc. <a href="https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/cybersex-second-life/Content?oid=80223585">Adult clubs</a> have a prominent role in Second&nbsp;Life.  synchronicity; with events happening in real-time or a shared time-scale  interconnection: allowing the transition between several virtual worlds (relevant questions here will be about the portability of digital goods from one world to another, and if they will remain functional)  persistent, implying that events will take place at its pace no matter whether the person remains or not logged; and that they can`t probably be reset or modified (as in loading a saved&nbsp;game)  virtual/ immersive; being a digital representation that sets the Metaverse apart from AR interfaces that add layers of extended meanings and content to the physical&nbsp;world.  collective and shared; as in virtual worlds populated by other beings ( question remains if human,<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8410872"> artificial,</a> or&nbsp;both)  <p>Necessarily, it should provide a self-representation construct (in the form of skins, avatars, or any sort of digital manifestation able to interact within the virtual world), and arguably, building tools that enable creative outlets for the expansion of these worlds through a <a href="https://blog.siggraph.org/2019/10/siggraph-spotlight-episode-30-tim-sweeney-and-the-metaverse.html/">creator-centric </a>approach.</p><p>Questions remain on how those spaces will be adjudicated and governed. The answers to that will shape further attributes, such as: openness, decentralization, portability, artificial scarcity, and interoperability (allowing to interface with other applications, not just to create with the building tools provided as in user-generated content).</p><p>The core idea behind the Metaverse proposition is to create an immersive digital place that duplicates reality without physical constraints. Nevertheless, that doesn’t necessarily imply that real-world rules don’t apply in the Metaverse. Paraphrasing an iconic Morpheus quote from The Matrix, “some rules can be bent, others can be broken”, and even when the laws of physics may not apply, that most certainly won’t be the case of intellectual property rules and other regulatory frameworks. Governance challenges arise in similar ways to those already existing around the Internet, only to be enhanced by the invasive and intimate nature of this immersive technology with sensors and devices connected close to the body and extracting biometric sensitive data, -like eye-tracking devices-, that is ripe for abuse. Digital wellbeing and the <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/mm/2013/fox-chb-sexualized-virtual-selves.pdf">effects of virtual embodiment representations</a> should be carefully considered.</p>The Matrix, one of the cornerstones of simulation narratives.<p>Adding to that, the fact that it will be a privatized playground, with the potential to construct inferences by statistical mining; and the use of generative artificial intelligence paired with biometric data raises high privacy and self-determination concerns, in an ecosystem that could further lead to reinforcing tech- solipsism tendencies.</p><p>Even with strong contenders like <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/680139/minecraft-active-players-worldwide/">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://www.roblox.com/">Roblox</a>, or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/04/17/fortnite-metaverse-new-internet/">Fortnite</a>, that already have a huge player base and infrastructure to become aspiring Metaverses, the fact remains that there is still none that can claim the title.

<p>By Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Welcome to the Challenge</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance is pleased to announce our first global FIDO Developer Challenge, where participating developer teams will create and demonstrate compelling and innovative applications leveraging FIDO standards and technologies.  Prior challenges based in&nbsp;Korea over the past two years proved to be very successful and&nbsp; we are now pleased to expand this program globally.</p>



<p>FIDO has come a long way since the Alliance’s inception in 2012, going from a whiteboard concept to a core technology supported by billions of consumer devices worldwide.&nbsp; With over 85% of browsers now supporting FIDO Authentication, now is the time for web developers to ditch password-based logins in favor of FIDO’s approach, which provides a superior user experience and prevents phishing and other computer&nbsp;hacks.  We are looking forward to seeing the selection&nbsp; of implementations the developer community comes up with this year, leveraging the public FIDO2 WebAuthn API to bring FIDO Authentications to websites and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Projects we are looking for&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are looking for projects that address a technical or social challenge in today’s world. There is no limit on the development ideas, but we expect implementation of FIDO Authentication to take place in various fields such as Fintech, eCommerce, IoT, retail, blockchain, gaming and education. Samples from the previous regional challenge include projects like FIDO-based IoT storage services for low-income families, FIDO-based drone platforms, FIDO-based smart home security systems, FIDO- and DID-based smart health insurance card services and a FIDO-based passwordless WiFi router control system. We are happy to expand this year’s program globally to attract even more innovative ideas to solve technical and social challenges.</p>



<p>The process</p>



<p>The FIDO Developer Challenge takes place in a virtual format and focuses on implementation of the FIDO2 WebAuthn API. The Challenge is open to students, individual developers, and pre-seed stage venture companies only.</p>



<p>Our website contains all the details on how to participate in the FIDO Developer Challenge. Here are a few milestones we are looking forward to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  We will be accepting applications until July 9. Upon receiving applications from all over the world, we will do the initial screenings and announce the top 20 teams within two weeks of the application submission deadline.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then, we will invite 20 teams to implement the FIDO2 WebAuthn API in their inventions, online services or products.  The teams that successfully implement FIDO2 will be invited to the final evaluation step, where they will give an online presentation and demo. They will also&nbsp; participate in a Q&amp;A with our judges.  The judges will select the top three teams, all of which will be featured in a session at our Authenticate conference (Oct 18-20 in Seattle, WA; USA), with the winner being offered the opportunity to attend with all their expenses paid by the FIDO Alliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Prizes and opportunities</p>



<p>In addition to exposure at Authenticate, the top three teams will receive prizes from FIDO members, awarded public recognition, and the unique opportunity to share their business vision with panels of early-stage investors. More details can be found on the Challenge website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We encourage you to think outside the box, considering new experiences and benefits that FIDO can bring to users and developers alike. Best of luck to you all. We cannot wait to see your submissions!</p>

<p>June 10, 2021, Geneva Switzerland: After more than a year of pandemic restrictions, resulting in a greater than 70% decline in travel and tourism activity, health status exchange will enable economies and borders to reopen. On February 9th, 2021, the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> (GHPC) was launched to build an interoperable bridge blueprint to accommodate varying standards-based health credential formats, driven by disparate governing authorities to serve the complex travel industry.</p><p>To implement a subset of its recommendations, on June 8th, 2021, <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> (LFPH) announced the facilitation of the Global COVID Certificate Network (GCCN), a network of expert collaborators to facilitate trust building and interoperable exchange of COVID certificates for safe reopening of borders globally by operationalizing the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint.</p><blockquote><p>“The first wave of apps for proving one’s COVID status did not allow that proof to be shown beyond a single state or nation, did not avoid vendor lock-in, and did not distinguish between rich health data and simple passes. The Blueprint gives this industry a way to solve those issues while meeting a high bar for privacy and integrity, and GCCN turns those plans into action.”</p></blockquote><p>Brian Behlendorf, General Manager for Blockchain, Healthcare and Identity at the Linux Foundation</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


&nbsp;<p>Good Health Pass Collaborative (GHPC) Releases Draft Blueprint for Digital Health Passes in Advance of G7 Summit </p><p>[Official GHPC press release <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GHPC-Blueprint-Announcement.pdf">here</a>]</p><p>As a global multi-sector initiative to establish guiding principles for digital health passes while streamlining the standards development process, GHPC grew from 25 partners to more than 125 companies and organizations from across the health, travel, and technology sectors within weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>Initiated by leaders from the <a href="https://id2020.org/overview">ID2020 Alliance</a>, a collaborative effort was launched to produce the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint. The Blueprint addresses – in considerable depth and detail – nine technical and interoperability challenges around which global consensus must be reached:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Consistent User Experience</p>  <p>Security, Privacy, and Data Protection</p>  <p>Identity Binding</p>  <p>Standard Data Models and Elements</p>  <p>Credential Formats, Signatures, and Protocols&nbsp;</p>  <p>Paper Credentials</p>  <p>Rules Engines</p>  <p>Trust Registries</p>  <p>Governance and Trust Frameworks</p>  <p>The nine drafting groups brought together more than 120 experts from the health, travel, and technology sectors, managed through a partnership with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> – a <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects">Linux Foundation project</a>.</p><p>On June 7th, 2021, GHPC announced the release of their eagerly-anticipated Blueprint in draft form [download <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/download/attachments/76241/GHPC%20Interoperability%20Blueprint_v1.0.0_June%207%202021.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1623073365535&amp;api=v2&amp;download=true">here</a>] for three weeks of stakeholder consultations and public comments. The primary intention of the announcement was to stimulate discussion at the <a href="https://www.g7uk.org/">G7 Summit</a>, which opens on Friday, June 11th, in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, UK.</p><p>Paul Knowles, Head of the Advisory Council at the Human Colossus Foundation, co-led the Standard Data Models and Elements drafting group, one of the nine interconnected GHPC drafting groups, to spearhead group recommendations on data elements, common models for data exchange, and semantic harmonization. The recommendations of that drafting group will help to enable data interoperability without putting any undue burden on existing health systems and workflows.&nbsp;</p><p>Key recommendations from the Standard Data Models and Elements drafting group include:</p>  <p>Data elements. The drafting group specified standard data elements for three COVID-19 credentials —vaccination, test, and recovery— based on the European Commission’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/policy/network_en">eHealth Network</a> recommendations. The group also defined data elements for a standard travel pass consisting of name, date of birth, and an event-specific status indicator;&nbsp;</p>  <p>A common model for data exchange. To standardize and facilitate the exchange, sharing, and storing of data from multiple sources, the drafting group specified <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/">HL7 FHIR (release 4)</a> as a common data model for COVID-19 credentialing initiatives to promote interoperability between systems that encode healthcare data in different ways.; and</p>  <p>Semantic harmonization. The final group recommendation was <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/cjzegoi58xgpfzwxyrqlroy48dihwz">Overlays Capture Architecture</a> (OCA) as a solution for semantic harmonization between data models and data representation formats, devised explicitly for data object interoperability, acting as a catalyst for standardized credential issuance in multiple languages.</p>  <blockquote><p>“Digital health passes offer our best hope to safely, confidently, and promptly restore global travel and restart the global economy – but only if they are widely trusted and adopted by the public and universally accepted by airlines and border control agencies. The standards proposed in the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint will make it possible for digital health pass systems around the world to be interoperable with one another, thus creating a trusted, convenient, and seamless experience for travellers as well as for airlines, airports, and border control agencies.”</p></blockquote><p>Dakota Gruener, Executive Director, ID2020</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


 <blockquote><p>“To allow international travel to resume safely, we must take every possible step to limit the spread of new Covid-19 variants. We urgently need an internationally-recognised system of health passes so that travellers can quickly and easily prove their health status, in a way that is secure and privacy-preserving. The Good Health Pass Collaborative is doing critical work to develop the standards we need to support this. Now political leaders need to lend their weight to this effort. The G7 group of nations should commit to establish a network of globally interoperable health passes, and set up the necessary working groups to deliver it.”</p></blockquote><p>Tony Blair, Executive Chairman of Tony Blair Institute for Global Change and Former UK Prime Minister</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


&nbsp;<p>Linux Foundation Public Health creates the Global COVID Certificate Network (GCCN) </p><p>[Official LFPH press release <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linux-foundation-public-health-creates-the-global-covid-certificate-network-gccn-301307874.html">here</a> | Official LFPH blog post <a href="https://www.lfph.io/2021/06/08/gccn/">here</a>]</p><p>To implement a subset of its recommendations, on June 8th, 2021, LFPH announced the launch of GCCN, a network of expert collaborators to provide technical implementation guidance to operationalize the Blueprint. GCCN will include a global directory of trust registries to enable cross-border certificate verification, and be a home for toolkits and community-managed support for those building and managing COVID certificate systems. This next phase of implementation will help governments and public health authorities (PHAs) to build interoperable solutions respecting privacy with the aim to reopen international borders.</p><p>GCCN will implement a technological framework in a bid to enable citizens to move safely and freely across borders during the global COVID pandemic. The defined infrastructure hopes to allow interoperable and trustworthy exchanges of COVID certificates between countries for safe travel.</p><p>To knit together all of the necessary components and gain sufficient momentum behind the launch of GCCN, the network partners have focused on alignment with the EU Member States and other key organizations implementing COVID systems for governments and industry alliances.</p><blockquote><p>“We are interested to learn about how LFPH is taking bold steps in creating the Global COVID Certificate Network in order to facilitate trust building and interoperability for safe borders reopening, since it still seems that there are many challenges and barriers to overcome, for example the need for a European eID agreement. The Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) Panel of the European Parliament (EP) is looking into the challenges that the pandemic has introduced, and also we explore potential technological solutions and their impact based on scientific data, credible sources of information and the respect of the European values. I look forward to the next steps of the LFPH that could provide us with more ideas and insights on strategies that enhance the use of a certificate in a safe way, and also to provide further technical options for the EU that could be adopted and could help and enable our system to work in a harmonised way. As soon as we achieve that, then we could immediately share the methodology to connect with the rest of the world and move to the new normal of our post COVID digital era, always in respect of the European charter for human rights and the regulation for privacy and personal data.”</p></blockquote><p>Eva Kaili, MEP and Chair of the STOA Panel of the European Parliament</p>

With the aim to help jurisdictional (and sectoral) governance authorities to reopen international borders while respecting citizen privacy rights, we will continue to offer consultancy and implementation guidance on decentralized technologies across the inputs, semantic, and governance domains.</p><blockquote><p>“A key consideration for international travel requirements is to enable the resolution of digital credentials in multiple languages. The Human Colossus Foundation will contribute to the Global COVID Certificate Network in the development of a transformation pipeline to enable semantic harmonization between the recommended HL7 FHIR (release 4) data model for data exchange and the implementation of OCA where linguistic overlays can support multi-language credentialing following the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0</a> standard."</p></blockquote><p>Paul Knowles, Head of the Advisory Council, Human Colossus Foundation</p>

 Good Health Pass Collaborative Releases Draft Blueprint for Digital Health Passes in Advance of G7&nbsp;Summit <p>In an effort to restore global travel and restart the global economy, the <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> today announced the release of the eagerly-anticipated <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org">Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint</a>.</p><p>The Blueprint — released today in draft form for a three-week period of stakeholder consultations and public comment — is intended to stimulate discussion at the G7 Summit, which will open Friday in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, UK.</p><p>This announcement follows on the heels of a May 18 letter, sent by the Good Health Pass Collaborative to G7 leaders, urging them to adopt a statement of principles for digital health passes. The letter also called for the formation of a working group — composed of senior ministerial staff from G7, G20, and European Union health and transport ministries — with the task of reaching an international consensus on standards by July&nbsp;16.</p><p>Unprecedented global collaboration — between governments, nonprofits, universities, and the private sector — propelled the rapid development and distribution of highly effective COVID vaccines. A similar level of collaboration is urgently needed to ensure that verifiable digital health passes for international travel can be issued and universally accepted worldwide by airlines, border control agencies, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>Most governments already require proof of travelers’ COVID status — either through a recent negative test or, increasingly, proof of vaccination– as a precondition of entry.

<p>In an eﬀort to restore global travel and restart the global economy, the <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative </a>today announced the release of the eagerly-anticipated Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint.</p>
<p>The Blueprint – released today in draft form for a three-week period of stakeholder consultations and public comment – is intended to stimulate discussion at the G7 Summit, which will open Friday in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, UK.</p>
<p>This announcement follows on a May 18 letter, sent by the Good Health Pass Collaborative to G7 leaders, urging them to adopt a statement of principles for digital health passes. The letter also called for the formation of a working group – composed of senior ministerial staﬀ from G7, G20, and European Union health and transport ministries – with the task of reaching international consensus on standards by July 16.</p>
<p>Unprecedented global collaboration – between governments, nonproﬁts, universities, and the private sector – propelled the rapid development and distribution of highly eﬀective COVID vaccines. A similar level of collaboration is urgently needed to ensure that veriﬁable digital health passes for international travel can be issued and universally accepted worldwide by airlines, border control agencies, and others.</p>
<p>Most governments already require proof of travelers’ COVID status – either through a recent negative test or, increasingly, proof of vaccination– as a precondition of entry. While dozens of solutions have been rushed to market to meet this growing demand, they vary greatly in the extent to which they protect user privacy and security and enable individuals to control access to their personal health information.</p>
<p>The absence of internationally recognized, consensus-based open standards – to which all solutions adhere – could leave individuals uncertain about the security and privacy of their data and even unsure of whether their health pass will be accepted for travel.</p>
<p>“Digital health passes oﬀer our best hope to safely, conﬁdently, and promptly restore global travel and restart the global economy – but only if they are widely trusted and adopted by the public and universally accepted by airlines and border control agencies,” said ID2020 executive director, Dakota Gruener. “The standards proposed in the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint will make it possible for digital health pass systems around the world to be interoperable with one another, thus creating a trusted, convenient, and seamless experience for travelers as well as for airlines, airports, and border control agencies.”</p>
<p>Restoring international travel is vital to restarting the global economy. The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that 61.6 million tourism-related jobs worldwide have been lost as a result of the pandemic. In 2020, travel and tourism contributions to global GDP decreased by 49.1%, a loss of $4.5 trillion (USD), nearly 18 times the impact experienced during the 2009 global ﬁnancial crisis.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, it would take years to develop standards for digital health passes.</p>
<p>In February, <a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020 </a>launched the Good Health Pass Collaborative, a multi-sector, global initiative to establish guiding principles for digital health passes and dramatically streamline the standards development process. Within weeks, the Collaborative grew from 25 partners to <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">more</a> <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">than 125 companies and organizations </a>from across the health, travel, and technology sectors.</p>
<p>Nine “drafting groups”, bringing together more than 120 experts from the health, travel, and technology sectors were managed through a partnership with the Trust Over IP Foundation the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative and Linux Foundation Public Health – all projects of the Linux Foundation.</p>
<p>The resulting Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint addresses – in considerable depth and detail – nine technical and interoperability challenges around which global consensus must be reached:</p>
 
 Design principles 
 Creating a consistent user experience 
 Standard data models and elements 
 Credential formats, signatures, and exchange protocols 
 Security, privacy, and data protection 
 Trust registries 
 Rules engines 
 Identity binding (ensuring the authenticity of the holder) 
 Governance 
 
<p>“This draft blueprint is historic, both in its depth and breadth of proposed standards, as well as the number of expert volunteers who contributed their time to its development,” said Gruener. “When we partnered with the Trust Over IP Foundation, we committed to an open and inclusive process. Releasing the draft for public comment today takes that commitment a step further. We felt this was incredibly important, given the range of public and private entities expected to play a role in the issuance and acceptance of digital health passes and the need to build public trust and support their adoption.”</p>
<p>The UK government – in its capacity as president of the G7 – has identiﬁed “leading the global recovery from coronavirus, while strengthening our resilience against further pandemic” as the highest policy priority for this 47th G7 Summit. International agreement on principles and standards for digital health passes are critical to achieving this policy priority.</p>

 Wallet Security WG begins its work 
<p>After a long process of finding leadership, hammering out a charter, and defining an optimistic scope, the new transatlantic leadership is hammering out a tentative work plan and scope reductions to line up all the ducks.  Public meetings have begun this week to include the whole working group in this discussion about deliverables and timelines. Stay tuned and register for the <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/wallet-security">mailing list</a>.</p>
 First public meeting of the Cryptography WG approaches 
<p>A younger group with a narrower scope has, in parallel, also been forming around cryptographic primitives and dependency analysis. Leadership has already been selected by consensus and the charter is being fine-tuned-- a charter DocuSign and a scheduling doodle might be ready for interested parties as soon as time of press for the next newsletter. Join the mailing <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/crypto-wg">list</a> in the meantime if specifying cryptographic primitives across different tooling stacks sounds like a priority for your organization.</p>

 <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar">UNIVERSAL REGISTRAR</a> - An Overview
 
 Issue: Onboarding/getting access to a DID registry is usually DID-registry-specific. 
 Proposals:
 
 Consider the most frequent flows:
 
 Redirect to a webpage (authentication or other operations are performed outside the wallet) 
 Authentication via API (some existing Universal Registrar drivers support this) 
 
 
 Proposal should work for most DID methods (e.g., did:web, Sovrin, sidetree). 
 A more detailed compatibility analysis is required. 
 
 
 Outcomes: Proposals will be further analysed and discussed in the Universal Registration call. Issues will be opened in the Universal Registration repository 
 Discussions about:
 
 <a href="https://github.com/gataca-io/gataca-did-method">Gataca's DID method</a>. 
 Historical resolution &amp; different properties/categories of methods WRT historical options.

<p></p>
 <a href="http://scottishblockchain.net"></a>A headline theme for building Scotland into a world leading digital nation is the development of it’s ‘cryptocurrency ecosystem’. 
 This refers not only to the adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but also the development of the new ventures and products that build upon it to achieve innovative new business models. 
<p>The basic concept is eloquently explained by Anthony Pompliano.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wigz8z6Vm3U">this discussion</a>, from 9m:50s, he describes a tiered financial system that builds upon gold as the foundation asset at level one, the issuing of cash money based on its value at level two, and then an increasing sophistication of electronic use of money at levels three and above.</p>
<p>He states that the cryptocurrency world is in the process of creating an equivalent system, where Bitcoin functions as the level one asset, aka “digital gold”, and we’ll see a comparable services ecosystem build upon it through layers two and above.</p>
<p>Vendor technologies like <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/introducing-the-hiro-platform">Hiro</a> demonstrate a great example of this effect, providing the tools to build upon this layer with new applications, with major market innovations like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/mastercard-plans-to-explore-applications-it-can-build-on-top-of-cbdcs">Mastercard planning</a> to build upon CBDCs, like launching like a&nbsp;<a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/mastercard-gemini-winklevoss-launch-crypto-bitcoin-rewards-card-digital-summer-2021-4-1030353514">crypto rewards card</a>, a great example of a level three service.</p>
<p>In China they are already active and the competitive repercussions are becoming evident. As the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-chinese-banks-promote-cbdc-over-local-payment-firms-for-shopping-festival">Cointelegraph reports</a> the banks are promoting the CBDC, the ‘digital yuan’, over the incumbent payment providers like Alipay and WeChat Pay. JD.com has started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/jd-pays-staff-digital-yuan/">paying staff</a> in the digital yuan.</p>
 Open Banking 
<p>As we consider the dynamics of building a Scottish crypto ecosystem a key industry trend to factor in is Open Banking. This is a <a href="https://digitalscot.net/open-banking-scotlands-global-opportunity/">global market opportunity</a> for Scotland.</p>
<p>Matthew Enubuje <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-hidden-war-for-fintech-millennials-open-banking-vs-crypto-928a86273f4a">provides a helpful overview</a> of where the two sectors overlap, and the potential for their synergy.</p>
<p>He makes the key point that reflects the insights described by Anthony Pompliano, that where the Blockchain industry has excelled at the level one core digital asset infrastructure, they haven’t been as progressive in terms of developing the higher layer of interconnecting, value adding apps. Open Banking has.</p>
<p>The advantages of crypto over Open Banking are mainly those to do with circumventing the banking system and the technological features of the Blockchain – The decentralized control of assets by users themselves not banks, and the transparent integrity of the transactions.</p>
<p>He describes the opportunity for the crypto industry being to basically expand to the higher levels of the ecosystem introduced in this article, citing examples such as <a href="https://nexo.io/">Nexo</a>, a crypto lending platform with&nbsp;no credit checks and instant credit lines, and where their revenue comes from their 5.9% interest on loans.</p>
<p>This adds equity to their crypto as it can be used to get a loan and by users holding it for long periods, they receive 30% dividends and this offsets the demand to supply ratio.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Matthew suggests a few other examples of this ecosystem, such as <a href="https://www.helium.com/">Helium</a>, a crypto company distributing hotspot devices and people earn their crypto when they use it, and the mobile app&nbsp;<a href="https://emma-app.com/">Emma&nbsp;</a>— it lets you connect to your bank accounts and crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>The killer innovation central to both trends is interoperability. Open Banking is achieved through API-based data flow between banks and apps, and for crypto cross-chain integration is the holy grail of its next major phase of evolution. The CoinTelegraph explores this in detail <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-interoperability-evolves-from-blockchain-bridges-to-defi-transfers">here</a>, with major innovations setting out to address the challenge including <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cosmos-set-to-take-lead-in-blockchain-interoperability-with-februarys-stargate-release">Cosmos</a>.</p>
 Building Back Better – Digitizing Scotland’s SMEs 
<p>So in practical terms what does this mean for Scotland, how should we act to exploit their trend and opportunity?</p>
<p>To answer this question we can consider other strategic objectives, with the most notable being to ‘Digitize Scotland’s SMEs’ – To better enable Scotland’s small businesses to make use of technology to grow their business, especially so after the pandemic.</p>
<p>This provides a very practical lens to view the above market insights; in short the ecosystem will be most effective when it produces these types of tools. For example early adopters of crypto payments in Scotland include the Aberdeen <a href="https://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2021/05/04/first-scottish-craft-beer-company-to-accept-cryptocurrency-payments-food-and-drink-news-scotland/">Taproom</a>, an Edinburgh <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/scottish-music-school-now-supports-crypto-payments-for-tuition/">School of Music</a> and a <a href="https://www.falkirkherald.co.uk/business/consumer/falkirk-cafe-among-first-in-scotland-to-accept-cryptocurrency-payments-3192051">Falkirk cafe</a>.</p>
<p>Scotland’s startups making possible this type of service are thus the essential foundation, highlighting ventures like Zumo, who have launched innovations like a <a href="https://www.insider.co.uk/news/edinburgh-fintech-launches-pay-crypto-24090015">virtual payment card</a>.</p>
<p>To the point of this article what’s really key is&nbsp;their <a href="https://developers.zumo.money/">Developers SDK</a>. Accepting payments is just the building block, as highlighted above the real secret sauce for what will be of great value to SMEs is the increasingly sophisticated functionality that builds upon this, in a way that truly supports and enables the growth of their business, such as a loyalty rewards scheme for example. Zumo’s SDK would enable other digital entrepreneurs to create these types of solutions.</p>
<p>With this type of functionality in mind other Scottish startups to highlight include <a href="https://stampede.ai/">Stampede</a>. While not a crypto company they are a great example of a provider of technology to Scottish SMEs, in the hospitality sector, to help them grow their business, via functionality such as a <a href="https://stampede.ai/how-it-works/wifi/#portal">Wifi portal</a>, <a href="https://stampede.ai/how-it-works/automations/#campaigns">email and SMS marketing</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://stampede.ai/how-it-works/gifting/#gifting">digital gift cards</a>.</p>
<p>Given their type of client would include the Aberdeen Taproom mentioned, the most powerful accelerant of Scotland’s ecosystem is the integration of these capabilities, one that combines crypto payments with these digital marketing services, so that Scotland’s SMEs have access to a one stop shop for easily adopting the full suite.</p>
<p>This is the most effective route to achieving the goal of Scotland becoming a world leading digital nation – Scotland’s SMEs are the backbone of its economy, and empowering them to adopt the latest technologies that can grow their business, via utilizing local Scottish tech startups, creates a rising tide that floats all boats multiplying effect.</p>

 <a href="http://scottishblockchain.net"></a>The number one topic at the heart of the Scottish Independence debate is what currency would be used. 
 This <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/snp-must-rethink-its-economic-model-independent-scotland/">OpenDemocracy article</a> sets the scene through a critical analysis of the SNP’s Growth Commission plans, being especially harsh of their currency strategy. 
<p>Thought leaders pioneering alternative ideas in Scotland include Tim Rideout, heading up the <a href="https://www.reservebank.scot/">ReserveBank.scot initiative</a>, Common Weal who have published <a href="https://commonweal.scot/policy-library/how-make-currency-practical-guide">this paper</a> on how to make a Scottish currency, <a href="https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2020/12/04/why-is-scotland-still-debating-whether-it-will-need-its-own-currency-when-independent-when-the-answer-is-so-glaringly-obviously-that-it-will/">Richard Murphy</a> and <a href="https://www.modernmoney.scot/">Modern Money Scotland</a>.</p>
<p>See all of them together discussing the topic on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lzxjVs810Y">this panel discussion webinar</a>.</p>
<p></p>
 Pioneering the Future of Money 
<p>Rather than this being a weak point for the Independence argument, the smart move is to seize it as the moment for global technology leadership it represents, an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone – One being the need for a currency, the second being the aspiration to become a world leading digital nation.</p>
<p>A key trend to highlight are “CBDCs” –&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency">Central Bank Digital Currencies</a>, the full blown digitization of national currencies, which is the grand prize of this space and given Scotland’s history of pioneering financial innovations including founding banks et al, presents us with a unique window to lead the trend globally.</p>
<p>It’s a behemoth of a worldwide opportunity now taking shape – In the USA former CFTC chair Chris Giancarlo has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/35528/digital-dollar-project-names-advisory-group">set up a not-for-profit</a>&nbsp;called the Digital Dollar Foundation, to pioneer the creation of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC).&nbsp;In his presidency campaign Michael Bloomberg&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/us-presidential-contender-michael-bloomberg-proposes-clear-regulatory-framework-for-crypto">proposed creating a regulatory framework</a>&nbsp;for cryptocurrencies in a new financial regulation plan.</p>
<p>The World Economic Forum says it’s time to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/08/why-its-time-to-take-central-banks-digital-currencies-seriously/">take them seriously</a>, CNBC explores&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/central-banks-lay-out-a-framework-for-digital-currencies.html">what they would look like</a>, the US Federal Reserve published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/central-bank-digital-currency-a-literature-review-20201109.htm">a literature review</a>, the IMF a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2020/11/20/Legal-Aspects-of-Central-Bank-Digital-Currency-Central-Bank-and-Monetary-Law-Considerations-49827">set of considerations</a>&nbsp;for their use and Brookings a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/07/23/design-choices-for-central-bank-digital-currency/">set of design options</a>. The Bank of England offers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2020/central-bank-digital-currency-opportunities-challenges-and-design-discussion-paper">this discussion paper</a>&nbsp;to explore the topic in detail and HSBC comments on them&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hsbc.com/insight/topics/central-banks-develop-digital-currencies">here</a>.</p>
<p>Early pioneers include&nbsp;<a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-swiss-snb-currency-digital/swiss-central-bank-says-wholesale-digital-currency-trial-a-success-idUKKBN28D1N5">Switzerland</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ghanas-central-bank-confirms-its-still-looking-to-pilot-a-digital-currency">Ghana</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/marshall-islands-seeks-to-establish-a-self-sovereign-identity-with-new-blockchain-based-currency">Marshall Islands</a>&nbsp;seeking to blaze the trail, and China has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-12-01/in-depth-chinas-digital-currency-ambitions-lead-the-world-101634550.html">ambitions to lead the world</a>&nbsp;in this field.</p>
<p>There are concerns and critics of course. Coin Telegraph writes that they have the&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-bank-digital-currencies-have-the-power-to-upend-global-finance">potential to upend global finance</a>, and also that they are&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-bank-digital-currencies-are-dead-in-the-water">dead in the water</a>, and the Economist asks if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/12/05/will-central-bank-digital-currencies-break-the-banking-system">they will break the banking system</a>.</p>
 “Programmable Money” 
<p>Furthermore the real magic lies in the concept of ‘Smart Money’ aka Programmable Money.&nbsp;This is not just about the straight digitization of money as we understand it, but an entire transformation of how money ‘works’.</p>
<p>As the term suggests it refers to creating an intrinsic intelligence for money.&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2020/09/16/programmable-money-crypto-tokens">Reporting on IBM</a>&nbsp;being awarded a patent for a “bespoke programmable crypto token,” Cointelegraph explores how specific functionality can be programmed into the behaviour of digital monies.</p>
<p>The LSE explores the idea, asking ‘<a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2020/09/14/do-we-need-programmable-money/">Do we need programmable money</a>?’, where they define it in terms of both Open Banking and crypto:</p>
<p>“In non-crypto fintech, ‘programmable money’ seems to refer to leveraging open banking APIs to build new, automated use-cases over legacy bank payment infrastructure but in our crypto world, the ‘programmable money’ refers to digital cash hosted on a blockchain, where cash can be placed under the control of a smart contract.”</p>
<p>A key standard that could make it possible is ‘DAML’, a programming language for creating Blockchain smart contracts that run across multiple infrastructure options. DigitalAsset is the world’s expert on this and explore the trend in more detail in <a href="https://daml.com/daml-driven/why-daml-is-great-to-represent-digital-currency/">this series of blogs</a>.</p>
<p>Not only does this provide the technology to digitally enable currencies as they behave now, but to make possible a future of Programmable Money, where a variety of behaviours and actions can be coded into the flow of money not possible with physical currency.</p>
<p>A Canadian visionary in this field is Alex Tapscott.&nbsp;Indeed he defines it as the wholesale reinvention of capital, a journey he foresees in his 2016 presentation ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=WnEYakUxsHU">Blockchain is Eating Wall Street</a>‘.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Digital assets are smart and programmable. Let’s say you’re sending money to your kid studying in college. You can now program the money to only work at certain retailers like Walmart and Whole Foods, rather than the Ontario Cannabis Store or LCBO.</p>
<p>By rethinking capital, we can reimagine markets, money and finance. Entire swaths of the financial services industry currently worth trillions of dollars — banking, payments and even money itself — will be questioned, challenged and upended in the years to come.”</p>

 <a href="http://scottishblockchain.net"></a>The objective of our <a href="https://digitalscot.net/library/digital-nation/">Digital Nation Action Plan</a> is to identify the individual entrepreneurs visions for how to achieve a world leading Scottish digital nation, and aggregate these into one overall action plan. 
<p>On <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L5Nf6ipWAAID1hdwOVoc5">The Crypto Standard podcast</a> they interview Nick Jones of <a href="https://www.zumo.money/">Zumo</a>, exploring the details of their exciting venture pioneering a cryptocurrency payments app.</p>
<p>Concluding the interview Jordan highlights how Wyoming is becoming a crypto and blockchain global hub, and asks if Scotland could replicate a similar success.</p>
<p>Nick believes this is entirely doable, given how Scotland is a small, relatively cash rich country with highly educated people, and with many pressing social inequality issues to address could act as an incredible ‘sandbox’ for cultivating innovative applications of the technology that leverage Scotland’s <a href="https://www.zumo.money/blog/how-scotland-liberated-smart-money">deep legacy of financial expertise</a>.</p>
<p>To crystallize a strategy to unify Scotland’s many different initiatives and assets around a single vision of making Scotland the Blockchain Capital of Europe, Nick quantifies the end result through stating key metrics such as having 10 of the top 50 startups, three relevant university courses and a £500m venture fund for supporting the ecosystem.</p>
 “Weak on Blockchain” 
<p>The nature of the challenge is very succinctly captured by Andrew Noble of Par Equity in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/6-investors-and-founders-forecast-hockey-stick-growth-for-edinburghs-startup-scene/">this TechCrunch artlcle</a>. While reporting on the general success of Scotland’s startup scene in his analysis he comments that Scotland is “weak on Blockchain”.</p>
<p>He’s not wrong. Scotland has a handful of great Blockchain startups like Zumo, Siccar and Appii, but to Nick’s point we’re well short of how many there should be, there’s no real funding initiatives to address this and adoption in key ‘big lever’ sectors like Government is non existent.&nbsp;Therefore the essence of our Action Plan should be to address exactly this.</p>
<p>A keystone foundation is regulation and legislation, the right approach could either inhibit innovation or unlock an unparalleled scale of economic growth. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/proposed-legislation-in-germany-could-allow-425b-to-flow-into-crypto-report">Coindesk reports</a>&nbsp;a new German law could theoretically bring as much as €350 billion (~$425 billion) of institutional investment into their cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://billatnapier.medium.com/we-need-a-blockchain-act-for-every-country-7ae10f36b3c4">this blog</a> Bill Buchanan describes how countries should legislate a Blockchain Act, emulating pioneers like <a href="https://www.regierung.li/en/press-releases/212310">Liechtenstein</a>, providing the legal framework to truly achieve a wholly digital nation.</p>
 Scaling Scotland’s Blockchain Ecosystem 
<p>Nick offers an ideal starting point for a Digital Nation Action Plan – A big audacious ambition and clear metrics for quantifying when it is achieved.</p>
<p>By incorporating the equivalent views from other Scottish tech entrepreneurs we can refine a detailed strategy and set of steps for truly realizing the goal of building a world leading Scottish digital nation.</p>

   A showcase of the inspiring Covid technology innovation from Scotland's NDS team, and the potential to build world class solutions atop their platform.

<a href="https://digitalscot.net/library/digital-nation/data-platform/"></a></p>
 As <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/scotland/scotland-massively-behind-covid-vaccine-passports-airport-boss-1152056">iNews reports</a>, Scotland is massively behind other countries on the implementation of digital vaccination passports. 
<p>Where many have fully digitized documents Scotland is still relying on a paper-based certificate.</p>
<p>Gordon Dewar, the boss of Edinburgh Airport, said asking travelers to rely on a piece of paper to prove they have had both jabs was “ridiculous” and “embarrassing”.</p>
<p>What is most puzzling and frustrating about this laggard status is that Scotland is actually entirely equipped with the domain expertise and vendor capabilities to easily implement a fully digital passport.</p>
 Platform Architecture 
<p>The core principle of <a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/government-cloud/topic/gaap-scotland/">Government as a Platform</a> is that a common foundation makes possible multiple different services that share this capability, to avoid reinventing the wheel for repeated functions like authentication and data sharing.</p>
<p>With these building blocks in place developers are then freed to concentrate on building the apps that more quickly deliver real business value.</p>
 Vaccination Passports 
  
<p>A great example of the need for this rapid approach is ‘Covid Vaccination Passports’. Clearly there has been a requirement for a quick response to critical public health needs, and one that utilizes existing government systems so that there is a complete integrity of the data produced.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/21/1015353/covid-vaccine-passport-digital-immunity-record/">MIT asks</a> if you will have to carry this on your phone, where it might function like an actual passport, being shown as you arrive at airports, and could also act like a work authorization at your job, or a pass to get into restaurants, bars, and shopping malls.</p>
<p>Highlighting the type of issues that need addressed such as a <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/travelers-using-counterfeit-covid-test-results">booming black market</a> in fake test results that is diminishing trust in printed records and driving demand for cheat-proof digital documents, they define the medical and technology challenges and nature of this opportunity:</p>
<p>“There are a lot of players in the field, including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson-health/health-pass-puts-privacy-first/">IBM</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://thecommonsproject.org/">the Commons Project</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">Covid Credentials Initiative</a>. </p>
<p>They’re coming at the problem from different angles but are ultimately chasing the same goal: let people share required information about their health, while protecting other private information. Yet it’s still too early to rely on any of these for a fast and widespread solution.”</p>
<p>Many governments, as well as airlines and other businesses are trialing or in talks to build “health pass” apps, which let users ask participating labs and health systems to send authenticated test results and other data straight to the app, bypassing verification concerns.</p>
 Scotland’s Opportunity – A Digital Healthcare Ecosystem 
<p>To begin zeroing in on the specific opportunity for Scotland, we can first identify the core technology challenge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Connecting any systems across borders means navigating a patchwork of languages, databases, and privacy laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>This highlights the work of Scotland’s <a href="https://nds.nhs.scot/about/">NDS team</a>, who are building the ‘<a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-health-and-social-care/topic/nes-platform/">National Digital Platform</a>‘, the technical architecture which ensures that key things are only done in one way across Scotland such as how people are identified and where clinical data is stored.</p>
<p>As they explain <a href="https://nds.nhs.scot/blog/the-national-clinical-data-store/">here</a>, their National Clinical Data Store (NCDS) is storing vaccinations data and being made accessible to healthcare staff, via their <a href="https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/42708/turas-vaccination-management-tool">VMT app</a>.</p>
<p>“Under the bonnet, the VMT sends copies of the records of immunisations to the&nbsp;NCDS. For those that may be interested, this is achieved using a “FHIR API” based on the&nbsp;<a title="Opens new window" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core">UK FHIR Core</a>&nbsp;Immunisation Profile. A FHIR API is essentially an industry standard way of sharing digital health data.&nbsp;The&nbsp;NCDS can then&nbsp;securely share citizens’ immunisation history records to other services, again using a FHIR API.”</p>
<p>As we’ll explore in the upcoming and future webinars, Scotland’s opportunity is to build upon this core innovation through a collaborating community, a Digital Healthcare Ecosystem, to flesh it out in multiple directions including ways to expand user uptake and to enable new scenarios for how users interact with and update data.</p>
<p>This is particularly relevant when we consider the broader context of Scotland’s overall digital agenda. In their just released digital strategy, the Scottish Government describes a key objective of:</p>
<p>“Adopt a common approach to online identity where personal data is controlled by the individual.”</p>
<p>This highlights a couple of key vendor solutions:</p>
 
 Appii – Appii has developed their <a href="https://appii.io/health-passport/">Health Passport</a>, a service that verifies your identify through a selfie photo, is populated through recording your test result at one of their partner sites (eg. Lloyds Pharmacy) and provides a digital certification. 
 Digi.me – Digi.me is a specialist in general data sharing services and have developed a number of apps that build on this capability, including a <a href="https://digi.me/covid19/">Covid-19 solution</a>. 
 
<p>What all of this highlights is the importance of the platform approach. A Covid certification service is just one of the many apps governments need to deploy, and each and every one will feature repeated requirements to verify the identity of users and share data across multiple systems.</p>
<p>Furthermore this should feed an innovation ecosystem, where for example the NDS National Clinical Data Store is a data set securely exposed to third party developers so that they can create new apps that leverage the data in new ways, for scenarios like Covid 19 as just one of many that will be required on an ongoing basis. Vendors like Appii and Digi.me would be ideal for this type of accelerated app innovation.</p>

  <p>By March 31, 2022, the Global LEI System will have implemented three new Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) policies to further increase the level of open, standardized, and high-quality legal entity reference data available to users.</p>
<p>From March 1, 2022, all GLEIF services will accept and display data in new Common Data File (CDF) formats in line with the new policies. Public users of the Global LEI System will therefore need to be able to process data in the new format from this date onwards. The month of March will be used as a transition period during which all LEI issuing organizations will migrate to the new formats and perform testing to ensure smooth operations. During this month, therefore, public users of Global LEI System should prepare to support both formats when performing LEI data analysis. This blog outlines the preparatory steps public users are required to take and provides links to more detailed reference information.</p>
<p>Details of the new policies</p>
<p>The new policies apply to:</p>
 
 Legal Entity Events: Specifies events that alter the entity, the relationship data of a legal entity, or result in the retirement and/or creation of LEIs.  
 Fund Relationships: Introduces three new distinct relationship types that can be collected for funds.  
 General Government Entities: Allows certain legal entities to be classified as Government Entities or International Organizations.  
 
<p>How to prepare for the new policies</p>
<p>The following users must take action to implement the updated file formats to ensure uninterrupted access to LEI data beyond March 1, 2022:</p>
 
 All users of the GLEIF Concatenated files 
 All users of the Golden Copy and Delta files 
 All users who access the content of the Golden Copy files via the GLEIF API 
 
<p>GLEIF has published further technical details, example files and additional documentation specifying the transition steps and the impact on associated data <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/common-data-file-format/upcoming-versions">here</a>.</p>
<p>Additional support</p>
<p>Following March 31, 2022, GLEIF anticipates a period of up to one year before the Global LEI System will be fully populated with information on Legal Entity Events, Fund Relationships and Government Entities. Data is generally collected at the time of new LEI issuance or existing LEI renewal.</p>
<p>If you have questions or need additional support ahead of the March 1 deadline, please email GLEIF: <a href="mailto:info@gleif.org">info@gleif.org</a>.</p>

  <p>This blog post summarizes the key highlights of the Digital Immunization Passport (DIP) project. We implemented and evaluated an end-to-end workflow for handling immunization information in a human-centric way, and we provided the necessary infrastructure for all participating stakeholders to demonstrated the functionality in real-world use cases: Yellow Fever and Tick-borne encephalitis vaccination.<br>
The project has received funding from <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/">NGI_DAPSI</a> (DAPSI 1st open call), the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 871498.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The focus of this project is on Data Interoperability &amp; Compatibility through establishing interfaces between health industry and individuals as well as pushing forward on standardized interfaces for data stores. Additionally, we address Data Transparency (Usage Policies and Data Provenance in Semantic Containers) and Security &amp; Privacy (by applying blockchain technology and digital watermarking on data sharing). A key challenge in making institutional data available to individuals is authentication. In this project we demonstrated the use of biometric features to identify individuals and generate a unique identifier that can either be managed as a decentralized identifier (DID) or via a national Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).</p>
<p>The project team consisted of the partners OwnYourData (OYD) and the Human Colossus Foundation (HCF), who shared conceptual and development work. As a result the following deliverables were made available:</p>

 Rory Torres shares her experience as part of Berkman Klein’s latest global research&nbsp;sprint <p>In an increasingly digital world, our experiences online are shaped by data gathered and wielded to tailor experiences. But what control do users have over that data, where it goes, and how it is&nbsp;used?</p><p>Questions of control over personal data were a cross-cutting theme throughout a <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2021-03/research-sprint-examines-digital-self-determination-increasingly-interconnected-world">Research Sprint</a> co-hosted by the <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalasiahub.org/">Digital Asia Hub</a>. The Sprint also examined other important dimensions of self-determination in the digitally networked world, for instance, self-expression and participation in civic life and the digital economy, or relationship-building and well-being, to name just a few application areas.</p><p>The three-month program for graduate students focused on digital self-determination spanning a range of geographies, backgrounds, and contexts. The cohort, who came from 21 countries across the globe, convened regularly to participate in critical discussions and create accessible educational resources — including a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_self-determination">Wikipedia page</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Digital_self-determination">Wikiversity Living Syllabus</a> — on the&nbsp;topic.</p>Mary Rhauline “Rory” Torres, Harvard Law LL.M. ’21 was a participant in a recent Research Sprint from the Berkman Klein Center. Courtesy&nbsp;image.<p>One participant, Mary Rhauline “Rory” Torres, Harvard Law LL.M. ’21, joined the sprint from Mangaldan, Pangasinan, in the Philippines. We spoke with Torres about her experience in the program, what she learned, and how it informed her&nbsp;work.</p> What motivated you to join the Research Sprint and explore digital self-determination? <p>I learned about the Research Sprint when Professor <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/ugasser">Urs Gasser</a> posted it in his Comparative Digital Privacy course. The call to participate resonated with me because there was a huge surge of new Internet participants in South East Asia when the pandemic hit. That’s 40 million new users of the Internet who are basically opening up their lives to the digital world. It’s an exciting place, but also has threats and harms. Even those of us who have been connected for a while are still scrambling to find our place in the digital space. I thought learning about digital self-determination can help all of us make sense of our role in the Internet as individuals and as a community, and thrive in&nbsp;it.</p> How has your understanding of the concept changed or evolved over the past few&nbsp;months? <p>Prior to the Research Sprint, my understanding of digital self-determination was limited to empowering an individual to participate in a digital environment and being equipped to do so responsibly, much like digital citizenship. I didn’t realize how digital self-determination is a labyrinth until we started to talk about it with related concepts like digital rights, digital colonialism, informational self-determination; to situate it in various contexts like digital health, digital economy, digital information; and to ground it in principles that would realize self-determination, such as trustworthy data spaces. It’s all very interesting and&nbsp;complex!</p> The Research Sprint is interdisciplinary and international by design. What was that experience like working with graduate students around the world to explore digital self-determination? <p>The Sprint is composed of an amazing group of people from all over the world with so many diverse backgrounds. There are students studying psychology, communication, political science, social science, and culture. The diversity of language, culture, and studies makes the task of understanding digital self-determination challenging because we all have different contexts. But there’s also beauty in it because it allows us to find connections, confront ourselves with different, sometimes opposing perspectives, and accept and respect&nbsp;that.</p> Your cohort is coming together to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_self-determination">Wikipedia entry</a> on digital self-determination. Could you explain the processes behind that task, and what you hope the impact is of the&nbsp;entry? <p>We started with gathering a bibliography of articles that relate to digital self-determination. Building on that bibliography, the group created an outline in a shared Google document. We’ve since then expanded that outline by communicating through Slack, gathered volunteers to write sections that are of interest to them, and some have met through Zoom or smaller chat groups to get feedback, do peer review, and make&nbsp;changes.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_self-determination">Wikipedia entry</a> is divided into three parts: first, an overview of the history of self-determination in philosophy, psychology, and its legal adaptations, and defining self-determination in the digital sphere; second, identifying practical elements that support the realization of digital self-determination, such as digital infrastructure, equal access, privacy protections; and third, current issues relevant to digital self-determination, including a discussion on regulation and legal frameworks, which I am contributing to.</p><p>Having a Wiki entry on digital self-determination is a big first step to bringing the principle out into the digital space, making it more accessible and understandable, and keeping in mind that the concept is a work in progress.</p> What was the most interesting topic you explored during the&nbsp;program? <p>The session on Information Diet was extremely interesting because it relates so well to our daily lives: living at a place and time where information seems to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time. One of the first things I do in the morning is open my phone, read the “recommended stories” of the New York Times on my account, open the Telegram information group on the situation of COVID-19 in the Philippines, check my emails and I’m bombarded by the newsletters that I’ve subscribed to, and then there’s Facebook. There’s just so much information, so there’s this burden of having no excuse not to know about an important issue. And there’s so much disinformation, that filtering out reliable from unreliable content has become so overwhelming.</p><p>So I really loved Professor <a href="https://sarah.genner.cc/">Sarah Genner</a>’s presentation on Information Diet and what it means to be in the driver’s seat in the digital age and not the other way around and having an overview of how to disconnect, do a digital detox, and avoid digital distractions. While studying for my exams, I used the Pomodoro Technique and the amount of studying I was able to clock in was almost cathartic.</p> Was there a particular speaker that stood out to you, or sparked a new interest? <p>I was fascinated by Professor <a href="https://nishantshah.online/">Nishant Shah</a>’s talk on the formation of our identities in the digital age. He provoked a lot of questions on how an individual defines one’s identity through digital artifacts — that one may or may not have created or uploaded for oneself; how digital spaces may constrain our definition of ourselves in and out of cyberspace; and how do we preserve these identities — or do we even want&nbsp;to?</p> You host a blog about parenting. From your perspective, how should adults address digital self-determination with children? <p>In the same talk, Professor Shah’s example of his nephew’s thousands of photos in the cloud uploaded for him by his relatives resonated with me as a parent. As a mother of a four-year-old, it’s so difficult to restrain me from uploading pictures of my child — what Professor <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/11018/Plunkett">Leah Plunkett</a> calls “Sharenthood.” Parents create digital footprints of our children and so much of their private moments are in the digital space already. But beyond the dangers of violating the privacy of children, the creation of this catalog of children’s lives online may limit their ability to define who they are, to reflect on their experiences, to associate objects to their memories, because so much has already been documented for&nbsp;them.</p><p>So when is digitization too much that it harms children’s self-determination — is a topic I want to explore further. It goes hand-in-hand with other parenting issues in the digital era, like safety. Parents should educate themselves about technology and how our children interact with it because it’s not going away and it plays a large role in how they define themselves and their realities. I personally recommend Professor Urs Gasser’s book “<a href="https://today.law.harvard.edu/the-connected-parent-offers-guidance-insight-into-digital-parenting/">The Connected Parent</a>” as a starting&nbsp;point.</p>Rory Torres with her daughter. Courtesy&nbsp;image. How did your studies as an LL.M. student at Harvard Law School — and your interests in tech and the law — inform or shape your perception of the&nbsp;program? <p>When we talk about law and technology, there’s always a discussion of seemingly competing but often interacting concepts: the individual and the collective, the private and the public, the offline and the online. As an LL.M. student, what I have realized in studying these concepts as they relate to technology is that technology is highly contextual and it is fast-changing, such that, as a student of the law, it is difficult to create a single universal approach to encourage innovation that would provide a positive impact to the world or to address the harms or threats that technology can bring. This is the attitude that I have brought with me to the Research Sprint, and it has helped me broaden my perspective and try to see self-determination from the lens of participants and speakers with various backgrounds and expertise.</p> How did participating in the Research Sprint inform your time at HLS and your future trajectory? <p>Finding my trajectory after HLS is an exercise of self-determination! At HLS, I curated my law and technology courses for business and technology, and Internet and society, because there’s always that tension between commercial interests and social issues. The Research Sprint in particular expanded my thinking beyond legal frameworks and allowed me to explore the field of social science and the Internet, and was especially inspired by Professor Lokman Tsui’s work on free expression, digital rights, and Internet policy in Asia. In relation to that, I’m also keen on exploring Privacy-by-Design and studying how to integrate digital self-determination into its principles, beyond respect for user privacy, and experimenting with startups on how to integrate Privacy-by-Design and digital self-determination as they develop their platforms.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/a-deep-dive-on-digital-self-determination-368c48d87705">A Deep-Dive on Digital Self-Determination</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Rae Rivera, Ph.D., Director of Certification, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance today&nbsp; introduced a significant update to its Metadata Service (MDS). The service provides information about the certification status of authenticators, authenticator capabilities, and any known security issues. The FIDO MDS provides organizations deploying FIDO servers with a centralized and trusted source of information about FIDO authenticators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MDS is a web-based repository where vendors can publish metadata about their certified FIDO authenticators. Relying parties use this information&nbsp; to validate authenticator attestation and prove the authenticity of the device model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With over 100 authenticator products on the market today, and demand for strong authentication on the rise, the need for an easy-to-use repository to load and view FIDO Certified authenticators has grown in importance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just last week, the Biden administration mandated multi-factor authentication for all government agencies to thwart phishing attempts and protect against account takeover.&nbsp; Governments and other regulated industries such as banking and healthcare especially need to know that authenticators being used to access their systems are genuine and meet certain requirements, including FIDO Certification status, compliance and other organizational requirements. The new features in the FIDO MDS allow organizations to more quickly and easily verify the attributes of the FIDO Authenticators being used to log in to their web services and applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s news is significant in several areas:</p>



  The new MDS has a more efficient and effective user interface that greatly simplifies the uploading and publishing of metadata.&nbsp;  There is a simplified API for relying parties to download metadata.  Metadata updates are now available daily instead of monthly, which ensures relying parties have access to the most up-to-date information.  The new MDS data format is now a single JSON structure, making it more compatible with standard web development tools. The new MDS format uses human-readable strings instead of numerical values, making it easier to read and understand.  The MDS data is now linked to the FIDO Certification program, which will ensure the reliability of the validity of metadata of FIDO Certified products.&nbsp;  The service now uses cloud caching to provide high availability and download performance.&nbsp;

  Being able to prove one’s identity is critical in modern society. This is 
no less the case for people being served by humanitarian organizations. 
Indeed, those without official identification are among the most 
vulnerable. While previous solutions to this challenge have relied on 
traditional means, these are not ideal, especially in the context of the 
current COVID-19 pandemic.

            <p>Oldoniyro, Kenya 2018: In a field pilot utilizing cash assistance and blockchain technology conducted by the Kenya Red Cross and IFRC, it was recognized that lack of official ID was a hindrance to receiving assistance. In the published <a href="https://preparecenter.org/resource/blockchain-open-loop-cash-transfer-pilot-project/">learning review</a> it was noted that 25% of the Kenya Red Cross’ caseload have no official IDs, highlighting the need to address the issue of identities. </p><p>Photo credit: Kenya Red Cross</p>
          
        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>In disaster and crisis situations, members of affected communities who do not have an officially recognized form of identification (ID) <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/22297">can face barriers to receiving aid</a>. Without ID, people made vulnerable by their situations cannot prove who they are, making it impossible for aid agencies to “know their customer” – often a pre-requisite for delivering services in an accountable way. While these challenges can sometimes be overcome, for instance through trusted proxies who do have an ID, such analogue solutions are not ideal.</p><p>Through a series of expert interviews and case studies of existing projects, a new report written by <a href="http://www.octd.co.uk">Oxford Centre for Technology and Development</a>, commissioned by IFRC, and supported by the <a href="https://hiplatform.org/digid">DIGID </a>consortium (Norwegian Red Cross, Norwegian Refugee Council, Norwegian Church Aid, Save the Children Norway), <a href="https://hiplatform.org/s/Digital-IdentityAn-Analysis-for-the-Humanitarian-Sector-Final.pdf">Digital Identity: An Analysis for the Humanitarian Sector</a> looks at the opportunities offered by digital identity technologies in humanitarian contexts, but also the risks. The report lists technical, ethical and sustainability aspects of digital ID solutions for organizations looking to explore, learn, and invest in such solutions. </p><p>For affected communities, obtaining a digital ID issued by humanitarian organizations can make it much easier (or indeed possible in the first place) to access services, including cash and voucher assistance, in multiple ways. First, they can use the digital ID to prove their identity where this was not previously possible due to a lack of official ID. Second, they can store certain attributes or credentials digitally, allowing them to have portable access to information such as training or education certificates, health records or legal records that might otherwise be left behind or destroyed when a disaster hits. Third, they can choose to reveal only relevant pieces of information instead of all their digital wallet’s contents.</p>


  <blockquote>
    “Without ID, people made vulnerable by their situations cannot prove who they are, making it impossible for aid agencies to “know their customer” – often a pre-requisite for delivering services in an accountable way.”
  </blockquote>
  

<p>The report points out that in an ideal world, digital ID technology would be “interoperable” throughout the sector whereby different humanitarian organizations would be able to recognize digital ID credentials, check the issuer, and extract only the data that is being shared by the owner of the digital ID. In this way, members of affected communities could avoid having to register repeatedly (and potentially having to relive trauma as they recount their story), better preserving their dignity.</p><p>Meanwhile, the report finds that aid organizations would also benefit from avoiding such repeat registration as their process could be made more time- and cost-efficient by deploying digital ID systems. Another advantage of an interoperable solution would be that trust and collaboration between aid organizations would be enhanced. The DIGID consortium was established for this very purpose: to see how different agencies can work together to best deliver services instead of developing siloed systems.</p><p>But the report also discusses challenges to the successful implementation of digital IDs and makes recommendations to address these: </p>  <p>Developing and rolling out a solution has a considerable cost, in terms of both money and time, including the need to upskill staff and volunteers. </p>  <p>Concerns around data privacy must also be addressed to maintain trust between organizations and the communities they serve. </p>  <p>Digital ID solutions depend on certain levels of literacy and access to technology and devices that can be variable and limited in crisis-affected communities.</p>  <p>Despite these difficulties, the <a href="https://hiplatform.org/s/Digital-IdentityAn-Analysis-for-the-Humanitarian-Sector-Final.pdf">report </a>offers hope that digital IDs will come to form an integral part of delivering humanitarian services, including cash and voucher assistance. In a rapidly evolving ecosystem of assistance and technology, humanitarian actors must involve themselves in the process from the outset, or risk having to play catch-up in an environment over which they have little or no control. </p><p>The DIGID consortium also held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjL1MOv7_Rc">webinar</a> introducing this report, as part of <a href="https://solferinoacademy.com/ifrc-data-digital-week-2021/">Data and Digital Week in April 2021</a>.</p><p><a href="https://hiplatform.org/blog/2021/5/19/digital-ids-in-the-humanitarian-sector-whats-the-big-deal">Permalink</a></p><p></p>
