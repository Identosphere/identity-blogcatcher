<p>Gail Hodges, Executive Director OpenID Foundation</p>
<p>Today the OIDF is proud to announce that the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-16.html">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance</a> (OpenID4VCI) specification has proven interoperability through the pairwise testing of seven issuers and five wallets providers from around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clear evidence of interoperability is a meaningful and timely result as this specification moves through a <a href="https://openid.net/public-review-period-for-proposed-openid-for-verifiable-credential-issuance-1-final-specification/">60 day public review period</a>. At the end of this period, the OpenID Foundation membership will cast their votes to elect this specification as a “Final” specification in line with the OpenID Foundation <a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OIDF_Process-Document_Final_2024-10-19.pdf">Process Document</a>.</p>
 OpenID4VCI Interoperability Objectives&nbsp; 
<p>This OpenID4VCI interoperability project had five objectives:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Prove out the OpenID4VCI specification before the vote to name it a Final specification 
 Provide interoperability results and implementer feedback to the Digital Credentials Protocols WG 
 To provide results on interoperability to standards body partners (e.g. ISO/IEC , W3C, and ETSI) 
 Brief government partners on progress in the standards they have selected to support their ecosystems and projects&nbsp; (e.g. European Commission EUDI Wallet project, NIST NCCoE mDL project, and the Japan Digital Agency pilot project)&nbsp; 
 Provide accurate, proven, open source tests to the global community of issuers, wallets, and vendors for them to prove out their own implementations that use these specifications. 
 
<p>To prove out the technical interoperability objectives, the specifications tested included:</p>
 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-16.html">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance</a>&nbsp; v16 
 The OpenID Foundation’s<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid4vc-high-assurance-interoperability-profile-1_0-03.html#:~:text=This%20document%20defines%20a%20set%20of%20requirements%20for,high%20level%20of%20security%20and%20privacy%20is%20required."> OpenID for Verifiable Credentials High Assurance Interoperability Profile</a> Implementer’s Draft 2.0 
 <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO/IEC IS 18013-5:2021 Mobile Driving License</a> (mDL) and “mdoc” specification 
 ISO/IEC TS 18013-7:2024&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">IETF’s SD-JWT draft 17&nbsp;</a> 
 
 Pairwise Testing 
<p>The invitation to participate in the Interop event was made available to contributors to the DCP WG, those that have signed a DCP WG Contribution Agreement, to ensure any interoperability feedback could be used to inform the OpenID4VCI specs and tests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pairwise interop demonstration was conducted July 16, as the third in a series of interop events from May to July to mature implementations in line with the specifications. In the third OpenID4VCI interop event on July 16th, the participants took part in a 90 minute, remote interop meeting followed by an 8 day window to remediate any bugs asynchronously. &nbsp; During this time, out of the 59 possible issuer/ wallet pairs that could be tested, 47 pairwise tests were conducted. Of those 47 pairs:</p>
 
 87% passed successfully 
 11% failed with resolvable issues&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 2% failed without an immediately obvious issue. 
 
<p>Overall, the implementers and the DCP WG determined that these results did not include any material concerns with the OpenID4VCI v16 of the specification, or the OIDF open source tests on OpenID4VCI. For noting, the results were consistent across a range of scenarios supported by the specification, with implementers demonstrating one or multiple configurations of OpenID4VCI:&nbsp;</p>
 
 OpenID4VCI with SD-JWT, Custom URI initiated and client authentication using wallet attestation-based client authentication with x5c header (designated as “HAIP mode”) 
 OpenID4VCI with SD-JWT, Custom URI initiated and client authentication using client assertion with private_key_jwt&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 OpenID4VCI with SD-JWT, Custom URI initiated, no client authentication&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 OpenID4VCI with mdoc, Custom URI initiated, no client authentication&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 Global Expert Participants 
<p>Leading implementers from around the world included (7 Issuers and 5 wallets). They included:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Bundesdruckerei GmbH 
 Fikua&nbsp; 
 MATTR&nbsp; 
 Open Wallet Foundation (Android “Multipaz”) 
 Lissi GmbH 
 Meeco 
 MyMahi Wallet 
 OpenID Foundation (open source tests) 
 
<p>A big thanks to all of our interop participation teams!</p>
<p></p>
 Why This Demonstration Mattered 
<p>Over the past 18 months, digital credentials have moved from promising prototypes to production pilots in finance, healthcare, transportation, and government services. In the California DMV and OIDF hackathons in October and November 2024, we saw a wide range of use cases demonstrated, and in Europe, we have seen 11 key use cases progressed as part of the European Digital Identity Wallet’s Large Scale Pilots. Earlier this year we conducted a&nbsp; <a href="https://openid.net/openid-foundation-demonstrates-real-world-interoperabiity-of-new-digital-identity-standards/">May 5th Interop event for OpenID for Verifiable Presentation</a>, with pairwise and multi-wallet tests conducted in partnership with the <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/digital-identities-mdl">NIST NCCoE Mobile Driver’s License (mDL)</a> project. &nbsp; In other recent declarations, the<a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2025/05/14/gov-uk-wallet-building-momentum-working-in-partnership/"> UK.Gov</a>, the<a href="https://github.com/e-id-admin/open-source-community/blob/main/tech-roadmap/tech-roadmap.md"> Swiss Confederation</a>, and<a href="https://openid.net/oidf-oidf-j-welcome-the-japanese-digital-agency-west-japan-railway-company-and-the-national-institute-of-informatics-student-vc-project/"> Japan Digital Agency</a> selection the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials in their digital identity projects. Other jurisdictions are poised to follow suit and adopt a similar reference architecture centered on the use of OpenID4VP and OpenID4VCI. This interop event on OpenID4VCI served as the vital pressing testing of interoperability enabled by the specifications. By meeting the specification and interoperability targets, the specs are on track to scale in line with the<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home"> European Digital Identity Wallet</a> and other jurisdictions in the months ahead. To get to this point, there were three key components:</p>
 
 Liaisons and Partnerships: The Foundation has long-term liaisons and partnerships with peer standards bodies such as<a href="https://www.w3.org/"> W3C</a>,<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/27001"> ISO</a>,<a href="https://www.ietf.org/"> IETF</a>, and <a href="https://www.etsi.org/">ETSI</a>. These liaisons and ongoing technical conversations have underpinned the development of interoperable standards demonstrated on July 16th, alongside the large number of leading-edge implementers ready to prove out the specifications together. The results of this interoperability event will be shared via a liaison statement with&nbsp; ISO/IEC 18013-7 WG10 to inform this Work Group’s due diligence on online presentation specifications, and W3C’s work on the Digital Credentials API and ETSIs work on TS 119 472TS 119 472&nbsp; which relate to the EUDIW. 
 Conformance Testing: OIDF developed open-source tests aligned to the specifications for use before and during the interop event. The implementers could prove their implementations against the tests before testing against their peers and provide critical feedback on the tests for the benefit of future implementers. Once the specs and open-source tests are finalized, implementers will be able to self-certify their implementations. Self-certification and other conformance requirements are often vital components of ecosystem governance to ensure all participants in an ecosystem have met the same high bar for security and interoperability.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Remote Interop for Global Participation: Finally, this event was hosted in a remote format, with implementers located in several European countries, New Zealand, San Francisco, and beyond. Even for some implementers not taking part in the live interop event, teams were able to connect across time zones over the following weak to triage issues and close gaps. 
 
 Implementer Feedback&nbsp; 
<p>The feedback from the implementers on the benefits of the July 16th interop is positive and encouraging that we are at an inflection point:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oliver Terbu from<a href="https://mattr.global/"> MATTR</a> stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re proud to have contributed to OpenID4VCI Interop #3 and see the protocol maturing towards real-world deployments. OpenID4VCI’s focus on simplicity and interoperability across diverse ecosystems makes it a cornerstone for scalable and interoperable digital credential issuance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stefan Charsley of MyMahi stated:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“MyMahi worked with a variety of issuer teams to test interoperability for the MyMahi Wallet, demonstrating OpenID’s OpenID4VCI standardization efforts have been applied practically to achieve interoperability at both regional and global levels. We look forward to working with more teams utilizing OpenID standards.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jan Vereecken, of Meeco said:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For Meeco, the interop was a valuable opportunity to test our implementation alongside other participants. It validated the work we’ve done to stay aligned with the evolving OpenID4VCI standard and reinforced our commitment to advancing secure and interoperable digital credential infrastructure. I think events like this are essential to move the whole ecosystem forward. We’re proud to be contributing to that momentum as the DCP WG is finalising the 1.0 version of this specification and practical implementor feedback is crucial to the whole process.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Micha Kraus of Bundesdruckerei GmbH, a German federal technology company, that prints German passports, identity cards and credentials and protects identities and data with solutions “made in Germany, stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This Interop event was an important step toward standardized, harmonized solutions in the ID Wallet domain. As active promoters of standardization, we are proud of the progress in collaboration with our international partners. Our goal is to shape secure, privacy- and user-friendly solutions that users will be happy to adopt in the future. The experience we have gained at the Bundesdruckerei in this project is widening our broad expertise in this field and can be applied to the implementation of the German national EUDIW.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oriol Canadés from <a href="https://fikua.org/">Fikua</a> stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Participating in the OpenID4VCI Interop #2 and #3 was a valuable milestone for Fikua. It allowed us to validate our Issuer implementations across diverse client authentication mechanisms and credential formats. This kind of hands-on collaboration is key to maturing the standard and ensuring real-world readiness. We’re proud to contribute to an ecosystem that prioritizes interoperability, security, and user-centric design.”</p>
</blockquote>
 Voices from the DCP WG and Foundation Leadership&nbsp; 
<p>Torsten Lodderstedt, the specification editor and co-chair of the<a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/"> Digital Credentials Protocol Working Group</a>, expressed gratitude for the live feedback from implementers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Validating these features in real-world scenarios is crucial as we head toward final publication,” he said, inviting new contributors to help the working group evolve the specification beyond its first edition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gail Hodges, Executive Director of the OpenID Foundation said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This interop event proved that verifiable credential issuance using OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance works across platforms, across devices, and for different credential types. The participants, WG members and cochairs are confident that the underlying specification and test suite are on a solid trajectory to achieve recognition as a Final specification and to support implementers in the months ahead. The timing could not be better as over 30 jurisdictions have selected and are deploying OpenID4VCI to support their digital identity credential issuance to digital identity wallets.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
 Next Steps Toward Global Adoption 
<p>The OpenID4VP specifications are on track for final publication mid September 2025, and are currently in the <a href="https://openid.net/public-review-period-for-proposed-openid-for-verifiable-credential-issuance-1-final-specification/">60 day public review period</a> until August 28, 2025, with the voting to be held August 29th to Friday, September 12, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenID Foundation’s open source tests are already available for free and open use on OIDF servers or on an implementer’s own server:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://openid.net/certification/conformance-testing-for-openid-for-verifiable-presentations/">How to run conformance tests for OpenID for Verifiable Presentations</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/certification/conformance-testing-for-openid-for-verifiable-credential-issuance/">How to run conformance tests for OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance</a> 
 
<p>In the weeks ahead, the OpenID4VCI tests will have mdoc credential types added, and other negative and positive tests will be added for completeness. They currently cover the core components required for interoperability and security such as OpenID4VP and OpenID4VCI with DC API, HAIP, for SD-JWT and mdoc, and a range of DCQL queries. By the end of September, the OpenID Foundation intends to open up <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">self-certification</a> for OpenID4VP and OpenID4VCI. Similar to OpenID Connect and FAPI 1.0 and FAPI 2.0, implementers will have the option (but not the obligation) to submit the results of their implementations against the test suite, and the OIDF will review those results and publish them online for a modest <a href="https://openid.net/fee-schedule-to-certify-your-implementation/">fee</a>.&nbsp; The OpenID foundation is also working closely with ecosystem partners to ensure their certification and conformance programs benefit from the OIDF tests and, as appropriate, partner on development and delivery of their ecosystem’s conformance program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In parallel, collaboration with OIDF’s peer standards bodies will continue, such as with W3C, ISO/IEC, ETSI, FIDO, EMVCo and others. In addition, support for key projects will also continue as the&nbsp; <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/digital-identities-mdl">NIST NCCoE Mobile Driving License (mDL)</a> project transitions from “opening a bank account” to the government services use cases, and<a href="https://openid.net/oidf-oidf-j-welcome-the-japanese-digital-agency-west-japan-railway-company-and-the-national-institute-of-informatics-student-vc-project/"> transit in Japan</a> moves through the pilot process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This OpenID4VCI interoperability demonstration is a pivotal milestone in a long journey to finalize these critical wallet specifications,” Gail concluded. “Thank you to every implementer, observer and standards body partner for this interop project a success. Together, we are building a truly global digital identity ecosystem, one that empowers users, protects privacy and delivers real-world value.”</p>

<p>Jay White of Microsoft and Pablo Breuer Secure Additional Terms, Reinforcing Continuity and Strategic Momentum at OASIS</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, 24 July 2025 – OASIS Open, the international standards and open source consortium, announced the results of its 2025 Board of Directors Elections. Three newly elected members and two re-elected members joined the Board in providing strategic governance and leadership to advance OASIS’s mission of solving global challenges through open development and collaboration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OASIS is pleased to welcome new board directors Jason Clinton of Anthropic, Charles Frick of Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), and Sarah Liang of EY. OASIS also congratulates Jay White of Microsoft and Pablo Breuer on their re-election to additional terms. The continuing members of the Board are Jim Cabral, Gershon Janssen, Bret Jordan, Vasileios Mavroeidis, Daniel Rohrer, and Daniella Taveau.</p>



<p>“I’m delighted to welcome Jason, Charles, and Sarah to the Board, and to congratulate Jay and Pablo on their re-election,” said Gershon Janssen of Reideate, OASIS Board President and Chair. “Their expertise will be instrumental as we continue shaping open standards that address global challenges. I also want to thank our departing directors Jason, Daniel, and Omar for their outstanding service and lasting impact they’ve made on the OASIS community.”</p>



<p>New Board Members</p>



<p>Jason Clinton serves as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at Anthropic, where he guides security strategy, including detection and response, compliance, physical security, security engineering, and IT. He brings over a decade of experience in infrastructure security, having previously led efforts in defense against advanced persistent threats and contributed to major operating system and payment platform development. Jason also serves on the Coalition for Secure AI’s (CoSAI) Project Governing Board.</p>



<p>“The rapid advancement of AI makes robust, open standards more crucial than ever,” said Clinton. “Through initiatives like CoSAI, OASIS brings together industry leaders to develop frameworks that protect users while enabling innovation. I’m honored to join the OASIS board and work alongside leaders who share this commitment to responsible AI development.”</p>



<p>Charles Frick, a Chief Scientist in the cyber capabilities development group at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), leads multiple research and pilot efforts focused on cybersecurity automation, machine-speed threat information sharing and operational resilience. He chairs the Indicators of Behavior (IoB) sub-project within the Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA), guiding development and adoption of new standards for behavior-based threat intelligence.</p>



<p>“As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, transparency, interoperability and collaboration are essential,” said Frick. “I’m honored to join the OASIS board and contribute to its vital mission at the intersection of open standards and open source. I look forward to advancing standards that support automation, resilience and trust—especially in areas like behavior-based threat intelligence and cyber-physical system security—so that we can better protect critical infrastructure and global digital ecosystems.”</p>



<p>Sarah Liang is a Partner at EY and serves as the Global Responsible AI Leader, where she drives comprehensive AI governance initiatives throughout the firm and for client solutions worldwide. Her expertise encompasses monitoring the regulatory landscape, aligning with legal and compliance standards, designing AI risk management solutions, and developing responsible AI frameworks that operationalize governance without hindering innovation. Sarah actively participates in key standards organizations, including CoSAI, bringing cross-industry insights and collaborative approaches to standards development.</p>



<p>Liang noted, “I’m honored to join the OASIS Board of Directors. OASIS and the EY organization share a vision of driving the beneficial long-term impact of AI use through transparency, security, trust, and scalability. We have a responsibility to act now and define global standards for AI development and deployment. I look forward to working alongside my fellow board members to help transform businesses through sustainable growth and innovation, while contributing to long-lasting positive change.”</p>



<p>Outgoing Board Members</p>



<p>OASIS expressed sincere appreciation to outgoing Board members Jason Keirstead, Daniel Riedel, and Omar Santos for their valuable service during their tenure as directors. Everyone at OASIS extends our heartfelt thanks for their dedicated leadership and lasting contributions to the organization’s mission.

<p>With iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26, Apple is solving a key problem, though For the first time, Apple is adding support for true passkey portability. This means you can move your credentials from Apple Passwords to a dedicated password manager like 1Password, Dashlane, or Bitwarden, and even move them back. The system handles the transfer securely and locally, so you don’t have to worry about exporting plaint text CSV files and crossing your fingers that nothing gets exposed.</p>



<p>Passkey portability is built on a new standard from the&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a>&nbsp;that lets apps exchange credentials in a private and encrypted way. It uses Face ID, Touch ID, or your device passcode to approve the transfer. From the user’s perspective, it just works. And that’s exactly how it should be.</p>

<p>Reddit has implemented mandatory age verification for UK users to comply with the country’s Online Safety Act, which took effect in July 2025. The legislation requires digital platforms to prevent minors from accessing unsafe content, particularly mature or adult material, following&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/uk-mandates-age-verification-for-online-porn-sites-by-2025-ofcom-announces/">Ofcom’s broader push for stricter online age verification</a>&nbsp;across digital platforms.</p>



<p>The platform’s verification system requires UK users to submit either a government-issued ID, such as a passport, or a selfie through Persona, a third-party identity verification company. The approach follows successful implementations by other platforms, including&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/discord-launches-facial-scan-and-id-age-verification-in-uk-and-australia/">Discord’s recent rollout of facial scan and ID verification in the UK</a>. Persona handles the sensitive data to maintain user privacy, storing uploaded photos or IDs for a maximum of seven days without sharing the information with Reddit.</p>



<p>Reddit retains only the user’s verification status and birthdate, eliminating the need for repeated verification when accessing restricted content. Persona has confirmed it does not access Reddit user data, including subreddit activity. The privacy-focused approach matches emerging standards in digital identity verification, consistent with the principles established by the&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/selfie-based-identity-verification-gets-its-first-global-certification-program/">FIDO Alliance’s certification program for face-based remote identity verification</a>.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>By now you’ve seen one of these:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note the small print in the lower right: “VRM by Admiral.”</p>
<p>By “VRM,” <a href="https://www.getadmiral.com/">Admiral</a> means this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getadmiral.com/"></a></p>
<p>What we’re looking at here is the <a href="https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/consent-management-market">$.5 billion</a> <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/consent-management-market-68100621.html">Consent Management Platform business</a>, currently dominated worldwide by <a href="https://www.onetrust.com/products/consent-management/">OneTrust</a>, with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onetrust.com/news/onetrust-is-leading-the-market-outright/">40% market share</a>. In the US,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.getadmiral.com/privacy-consent">Admiral</a> is the leading provider to publishers, giving it a high profile there. In Europe, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19655v1">the leaders</a> are OneTrust, <a href="https://usercentrics.com/">Usercentrics</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cookieyes.com/">CookieYes</a>.</p>
<p>So here is a challenge for Admiral , OneTrust, and the rest of them: make VRM&nbsp; mean Vendor Relationship Management (like it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_relationship_management">says in Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>Our case: real relationships are based on mutual trust, which can only happen if personal privacy is fully respected as a starting point. Consent management by cookie notice can’t cut it.&nbsp; For real trust, we need people to bring their own terms to every website’s table, and have agreements to those. This is why we, the ProjectVRM community, through <a href="https://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a> (our nonprofit spinoff) and the <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2025/04/06/myterms/">IEEE P7012 (aka MyTerms)</a> working group, created the draft standard (on track to become official early next year) for machine-readable personal privacy terms. Three years ago, I called MyTerms <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">The Most Important Standard in Development Today</a>.&nbsp;The CMP business can help make it so, by <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2025/07/15/the-cluetrain-will-run-from-customers-to-companies/">getting on the Cluetrain</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some opportunities:</p>
 
 CMPs can provide sites &amp; services with easy ways to respond to MyTerms choices brought to the table by visitors. Let’s call this a Terms Matching Engine.The current roster of terms we’re working with at Customer Commons (abbreviated CuCo, hence the <a href="http://cuco.org/">cuco.org</a> shortcut) starts with&nbsp; CC-BASE, which is “service provision only.” It says to a website, “just give me your service, and nothing more.” In other words, no tracking. Yet. Negotiation toward additional provisions comes after that. Those can be anything, but they should be in the spirit of We’re starting with personal privacy here, and the visitor sets the terms for that. 
 There is a whole new business (which, like the VPN, grammar-help, and password management businesses, people would pay for) in helping people present, manage, remember, and monitor compliance with their terms, and what additional agreements have been arrived at. This can involve browser add-ons such as the one pictured &nbsp;on the<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/R-button"> ProjectVRM r-button page</a>. CMP companies can make money there too, adding a C2B business to their B2B ones. 
 Go beyond #2 to provide real VRM. Back in the last millennium, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iainhenderson1/">Iain Henderson</a> pointed out that B2B relationships tend to have hundreds or thousands of variables over which both parties need to agree. <a href="https://www.nitinbadjatia.com/about">Nitin Badjatia</a>, another CRM veteran (and a Customer Commons board member like Iain and myself), has also pointed out that companies like Oracle have long provided AI-assisted ways for B2B relationships to arrive at contractual agreements. The same can work for C2B, once the base privacy agreement is established. There can be a business here that expands on what gets started with that first agreement. 
 Verticals. There can be strong value-adds for regulated industries or companies wanting to acquire and signal accountability, or look for firmer ways to establish a privacy regime better than the called consent, which doesn’t work (except as thin ass-covering for companies fearing the GDPR and the CCPA). For example: banks, insurers, publishers, health care providers. 
 For people (not just corporate clients), CMPs could offer browser plugins or apps (mobile and/or computer) that help people choose and present their privacy terms, track who honors them, notify them of violations, and have r-buttons mean something. Or multiple things. 
 
<p>Here is an example of r-buttons in a browser:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Real relationships, including records of agreements, can be unpacked when a person (not a mere “user”) clicks on either the ⊂ or the ⊃ symbols. There are golden opportunities here for both VRM and CRM vendors. And, of course, companies such as Admiral and OneTrust working both sides—and being truly trusted.</p>
<p>So those are all off the top of my head. Give us more below.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation has launched <a href="https://openid.net/cg/ecosystem-support-community-group/">a new Ecosystems Support Community Group (ESCG)</a> to help public and private sector ecosystem leaders understand the key architectures, decisions, and best practices at the forefront of open banking/open data and digital identity adoption globally.&nbsp;</p>
 Context 
<p>The ESCG arrives at a critical time when 90+ jurisdictions are pursuing open banking/open finance/open data, and 60+ are pursuing digital identity, as per the <a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/the-global-state-of-open-banking-and-open-finance-report/">Cambridge Judge School of Business</a> (2024). The ESCG provides a safe space for architects and other ecosystem leaders to convene with other experts. The trusted relationships in this ESCG can not only help inform local decision processes before launch, but also inform ongoing maintenance, roadmap development, and monitor security issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to OIDF’s other community groups (CGs), the ESCG will not develop specifications. Instead, its purpose is to support ecosystem decision-makers as they build and maintain their ecosystems, providing world class, independent, and opinionated views on how to combine, profile, and implement these to realize the benefits of the specifications.&nbsp;</p>
 Building on the OpenID Foundation’s proven track record 
<p>The OIDF already plays a central role supporting and connecting ecosystem experts in three key ways:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Convening experts in our <a href="https://openid.net/wg/">Working Groups</a> (WGs), such as <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI WG</a>, the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/">Digital Credentials Protocols WG</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">A/B Connect WG</a>, and <a href="https://openid.net/cg/">others</a>. 
 
 
 Supporting ecosystems and individual implementers with certification to OIDF specifications (over 4k implementers self-certified to date).&nbsp; 
 
 
 Providing safe spaces for experts to engage, including the <a href="https://openid.net/cg/death-and-the-digital-estate/">Death and Digital Estate Community Group</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/cg/australian-digital-trust-community-group/">Australian Digital Trust Community Group</a> and OIDF <a href="https://openid.net/calendar/">workshops and conferences</a>.&nbsp; 
 
<p>This ESCG will play an essential and pragmatic role, providing expertise that cuts across other OIDF WGs/CGs, as well as specifications from peer standards bodies.&nbsp;</p>
 Six core guiding principles 
<p>This new ESCG will operate under the following six organising principles:</p>
 
 Sharing: provide a safe community environment for ecosystem governing bodies to share experiences and learnings, and to ask questions. 
 Privacy: Promote the enhancement of user privacy and control by using explicit consent mechanisms, accompanied by best practices for informed consent. 
 Security: identify and promote best current security practices for all ecosystem participants. 
 Interoperability: the ESCG must promote the benefits and mechanisms for interoperability across ecosystems irrespective of use case, industry sector or jurisdiction. 
 Recognition: the ESCG will recognise that each ecosystem will need to make its own pragmatic decisions to support its own route towards interoperability over time.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Cost reduction: Promote a lower cost of adoption and change for ecosystem participants (e.g., data recipients, data providers, ecosystem governing bodies, etc.). 
 
 The global push for digital wallets and open data 
<p>Given the emergence of digital wallet based ecosystems and the global push towards <a href="https://openid.net/uns-dpi-day-elizabeth-garber-on-standards-as-safeguards/">Digital Public Infrastructure</a>, we anticipate that nearly all jurisdictions will push for open data and digital identity deployments in the years ahead. From the 26 ecosystems that the OIDF supports today, we know that most of the decisions each implementer needs to make are very similar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While local laws, requirements, and cultures may lead to differences in configuration, the majority of decisions are harmonized across jurisdictions. Furthermore, new ecosystems benefit from the lessons learned from prior implementations and dramatically reduce time-to-market.</p>
 Preventing fragmentation of ecosystem standards 
<p>As public and private sector ecosystems develop their policies and architectures, they must evaluate technical options, make key governance decisions, and maintain clear communication with implementers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is aware of native ecosystem divergences, which, if left unsatisfied, will lead to amplified challenges for security and interoperability across borders and use cases. This will become increasingly difficult to solve as the global market continues to develop at an accelerating pace, with each jurisdiction at risk of becoming an ‘island’ that cannot interoperate with others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Resolving the resultant global fragmentation would introduce an expensive cost of change for each implementer within a given ecosystem.</p>
 Join the initiative 
<p>The OpenID Foundation’s new <a href="https://openid.net/cg/ecosystem-support-community-group/">Ecosystems Support Community Group</a> is open to all who wish to join the conversation and contribute to the discussion.</p>
<p>What we will do:</p>
 
 Capture existing and emerging ecosystem configurations and develop an Ecosystems Tracker. 
 Evaluate key differences between ecosystem configurations and specifications.&nbsp; 
 Assess how to combine different specifications. 
 Capture and communicate ecosystems’ requirements to other WGs, OIDF’s conformance test team and OIDF, in general. 
 
<p>The new ESCG will also develop, or initiate the development of, best practices and reference architectures to support different types of ecosystems, assisting key decision-making for governance bodies. These guides will provide recommendations for specifications, associated design of conformance testing, and other aspects of ecosystem development and deployment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are an ecosystem leader grappling with the policy, technical, and operational challenges of enabling open banking/open data, and/or digital identity, we hope you will consider joining the ESCG to share your own experiences with your peers.&nbsp;</p>

Here is her take on the day:&nbsp;</p>
 Standards as Safeguards in Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) 
<p>By Elizabeth Garber&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standards play a critical role in our digital future. They are not merely technical specifications: they are essential safeguards that protect populations, enable innovation, and ensure digital infrastructure serves humanity.</p>
<p>As part of the UN’s <a href="https://www.un.org/digital-emerging-technologies/content/open-source-week-2025#:~:text=UN%20Open%20Source%20Week%202025%20facilitates%20global%20dialogue,the%20development%20of%20innovative%20solutions%20to%20global%20challenges.">Open Source Week</a>, DPI Day showcased how DPI can address global challenges and advance the <a href="https://unosd.un.org/content/sustainable-development-goals-sdgs">Sustainable Development Goals</a>. The events, held last month (June 2025) at the UN Headquarters in New York, brought together UN Member States, technologists, and partners to drive collaborative action on DPI for sustainable development – a mission that the OpenID Foundation agrees is&nbsp; fundamental to our collective digital future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding DPI 
<p>The <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099031025172027713/pdf/P505739-84c5073b-9d40-4b83-a211-98b2263e87dd.pdf">World Bank</a> defines Digital Public Infrastructure as “foundational, digital building blocks for the public benefit.” These include digital identity, faster payments, government digital services, civil registry infrastructure, and data exchange technology. Beyond these core examples, DPI encompasses geospatial tools and other reusable building blocks that serve both public and private sectors.</p>
<p>The global landscape of DPI implementations, beautifully captured in the <a href="https://dpimap.org">DPI map</a> developed by <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/people/academics-and-research-fellows/krisstina-rao">Krisstina Rao</a> at the University College London (UCL) , reveals both the promise and the challenges of building digital infrastructure at scale. This is where standards become indispensable.</p>
 Why standards matter in DPI 
 Preventing vendor lock-in 
<p>Vendor lock-in represents a universal threat to sustainable digital development. Major organizations, from the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/reimagining-digital-id/">World Economic Forum</a> to the <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/">World Bank’s ID4D</a> and the <a href="https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0491/">OECD</a>, consistently identify this as a core concern for digital identity systems.</p>
<p>The pattern is familiar. Vendors implement systems using proprietary technologies, embedding themselves deeply into government operations. Once entrenched, they command high fees for upgrades, servicing, and integration, holding critical public services hostage. The resulting harms extend beyond financial waste, to include poor service delivery, insufficient data security, and limited innovation.</p>
<p>Open standards, like those developed by the OpenID Foundation, offer a proven solution. When governments implement robust, tested standards throughout their architecture, they maintain sovereignty over their digital infrastructure. They can hold vendors accountable, switch providers when necessary, and ensure continuous service delivery to the population.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, this isn’t theoretical. In supporting 26 ecosystems in their open data and digital identity deployments, we’ve seen this play out across markets.</p>
 Standards enhance ecosystem security 
<p>The <a href="https://dpi-safeguards-framework.org/frameworkpdf?_gl=1*1rss0jj*_ga*MjAzNjAzMTEyOC4xNzUwMDg1Mzkz*_ga_N2QB2GX10S*czE3NTA5NTY5MjkkbzMkZzEkdDE3NTA5NTcwMDMkajYwJGwwJGgw">UN DPI Safeguards Framework</a> correctly identifies security controls as non-negotiable for protecting individuals and society. Without these essential protections, digital systems become vulnerable to exploitation, leading to cascading harms that affect everyone from individual users to entire economies. And, with <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/">Cybersecurity Ventures</a> projecting cybercrime costs of $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, equivalent to the world’s third largest economy after only the United States and China, the stakes couldn’t be higher.</p>
<p>This staggering figure represents more than just financial losses. It’s a material ‘tax’ on global society that undermines trust in digital systems and slows economic growth. The ripple effects extend far beyond immediate victims, as cybercrime proceeds fuel illicit industries, including arms trafficking, drug cartels, and human trafficking networks, perpetuating cycles of harm that destabilize communities worldwide.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation’s approach to security through standards creates a powerful multiplier effect. As more actors across domestic and international ecosystems adopt rigorous security standards and conformance measures, all digital infrastructure becomes exponentially more resilient. This collective security model operates on the principle that interconnected systems are only as strong as their weakest link. By raising the baseline security position across all participants, standards strengthen the entire ecosystem</p>
<p>Applied alongside other security best practices, this comprehensive approach protects businesses from operational disruptions and reputational damage while shielding individuals from the devastating personal impacts of fraud, scams, and identity theft. More critically, by hardening targets and reducing successful attacks, robust security standards disrupt the economic models of cybercriminals, cutting off funding streams that would otherwise flow to illicit industries and terrorist organizations.</p>
 Enabling true interoperability across sectors and borders 
<p>Perhaps nowhere is the importance of standards more evident than in enabling interoperability across sectors and borders. As highlighted by the DPI Safeguards Framework and explored in-depth by the <a href="https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0491/">OECD principles for Digital Identity</a>, interoperability delivers transformative benefits to society that extend far beyond avoiding vendor lock-in.</p>
<p>At the heart of this lies <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Article 6 of the UK Convention on Human Rights</a>, which recognizes the fundamental right of all people to be recognized as a person under the law, anywhere. This isn’t merely a legal principle, it’s the foundation upon which all other human rights depend. Healthcare, education, marriage, travel…each of these essential rights requires our ability to identify ourselves uniquely before the law, wherever we are in the world.</p>
<p>Standards transform this principle from aspiration to reality. They create the technical bridges that enable us to assert aspects of our identity seamlessly across sectors and borders. Through standardized protocols, an ID issued in one country can be read, verified, and trusted in another. Educational credentials earned in one institution can be validated by employers across the globe. Healthcare records can follow patients as they move, ensuring continuity of care regardless of geography.</p>
<p>This interoperability ensures that identity verification enhances rather than hinders access to essential services. Without standards, each system would operate in isolation, forcing individuals to repeatedly prove their identity through different, incompatible processes – their credentials sometimes unreadable and unusable to the people who need to verify them. This creates barriers that disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>Through the work of&nbsp; the <a href="https://dpi-safeguards-framework.org/frameworkpdf?_gl=1*1rss0jj*_ga*MjAzNjAzMTEyOC4xNzUwMDg1Mzkz*_ga_N2QB2GX10S*czE3NTA5NTY5MjkkbzMkZzEkdDE3NTA5NTcwMDMkajYwJGwwJGgw">DPI Safeguards Working Group</a>, the OpenID Foundation hopes&nbsp; that these interoperability capabilities are built into DPI implementations from the ground up, creating a world where digital identity empowers rather than excludes, and where the promise of Article 6 becomes a practical reality for everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Embedding standards in DPI programs 
 Standards as dynamic policy 
<p>Experience shows that hardcoding specific technologies and standards into legislation creates dangerous rigidity, as technology evolves quickly and the threat landscape even faster. The <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-architecture-and-reference-framework-outline#:~:text=On%203%20June%202021%2C%20the%20Commission%20adopted%20a,a%20set%20of%20common%20guidelines%20and%20best%20practice.">European Union’s Architectural Reference Framework</a> offers a better model, pointing to governance structures that can adapt while maintaining security and interoperability.</p>
<p>For effective DPI implementation, detailed architectural reviews must accompany assessments of standards availability and maturity. These evaluations must consider ecosystem goals and inevitable trade-offs. Technologies tuned&nbsp; to optimize fraud prevention may, for instance, enable unintended surveillance and significant privacy concerns if applied in the wrong context or not properly implemented and governed.</p>
 Certification and conformance requirements 
<p>Robust standards only deliver value when properly implemented. The OpenID Foundation provides free test suites enabling implementers to verify their conformance, democratizing access to security and interoperability. <a href="https://openid.net/certification/about-conformance-suite/">OpenID Foundation tests</a> often include critical elements of liaison partner standards body specifications, such as OIDF’s current tests for <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-final.html">OpenID for Verifiable Presentation</a> that include tests for the W3C Digital Credentials API, the IETD SD-JWT, and the ISO/IEC SC17 18013-5 mdoc, a test suite that will support issuing jurisdiction requirements from the European Commission and others adopting these standards.</p>
<p>For governments, ecosystems, and funding partners that are committed to delivering safe, interoperable systems, mandatory conformance and certification requirements should be embedded into procurement processes, contracts, and ecosystem rules from the outset.</p>
 Engaging with standards bodies and mobilizing standards for digital public good 
<p>Governments should actively engage with international standards bodies to ensure public sector needs and citizen interests shape the technical frameworks governing our digital infrastructure. By participating in the work of organizations like the OpenID Foundation – where contributing is free, membership is straightforward and optional with a marginal cost ($250), &nbsp;multilingual support is provided, and working groups welcome diverse perspectives – governments can embed critical use cases and principles directly into standards development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To accelerate this engagement, particularly for initiatives like the SIDI hub supporting African countries, we will create practical resources, such as reference architecture mapping key standards bodies to their focus areas and participation processes. This work will be published by the soon-to-launch Ecosystem Community Group as a freely available resource on how to layer standards (from OIDF and others) to deliver open data and digital identity ecosystems. Stay tuned for a blog post on the formation of this group, which will have its first meeting July 28th with no cost to contribute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through our continued work with the DPI Safeguards Working Group, the OpenID Foundation remains committed to ensuring that sustained engagement in standards development, combined with updated procurement processes that incorporate conformance requirements, forms the foundation for building digital public infrastructure that is truly inclusive, secure, and serves the global public good.</p>

<p>Global Participation Expands as the Coalition Releases Essential AI Guidance</p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 17 July 2025 – The <a href="https://www.coalitionforsecureai.org/">Coalition for Secure AI</a> (CoSAI), an OASIS Open Project, celebrates its first anniversary since launching at the Aspen Security Forum in 2024. Over the past year, CoSAI has grown into the industry’s leading collaborative ecosystem for AI security, expanding from its initial founding sponsors to more than 45 partner organizations worldwide. Its mission to enhance trust and security in AI development and deployment has resonated widely, attracting premier sponsors EY, Google, IBM, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Palo Alto Networks, PayPal, Protect AI, Snyk, Trend Micro, and Zscaler. Through multiple workstreams, the coalition has produced practical frameworks and research addressing real-world challenges in securing AI systems. Central to CoSAI’s impact this year are the most recent releases of the “Principles for Secure-by-Design Agentic Systems,” which establishes three core principles for autonomous AI, and the “Preparing Defenders of AI Systems” whitepaper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Security Principles Help Safeguard Agentic AI Systems</p>



<p>CoSAI’s Technical Steering Committee (TSC) has released the “Principles for Secure-by-Design Agentic Systems,” a foundational document aimed at helping technical practitioners address the unique security challenges posed by autonomous AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The principles offer practical guidance on balancing operational agility with robust security controls, establishing that secure agentic systems should be Human-governed and Accountable, architected for meaningful control with clear accountability, constrained by well-defined authority boundaries aligned with risk tolerance, and subject to risk-based controls ensuring alignment with expected business outcomes. They must be Bounded and Resilient, with strict purpose-specific entitlements, robust defensive measures including AI-specific protections, and continuous validation with predictable failure modes. Finally, they should be Transparent and Verifiable, supported by secure AI supply chain controls, comprehensive telemetry of all system activities, and real-time monitoring capabilities for oversight and incident response.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.coalitionforsecureai.org/announcing-the-cosai-principles-for-secure-by-design-agentic-systems/">This blog post</a> provides additional context on the principles and how they can be applied in real-world environments.</p>



<p>“As agentic AI systems become more embedded in organizations’ operations, we need frameworks to secure them,” said David LaBianca, Project Governing Board co-chair at CoSAI. “These principles provide a technical foundation for organizations to adopt AI responsibly and securely.”</p>



 New Defender Frameworks Help Organizations Operationalize AI Security 



<p>CoSAI has published another landscape paper, “Preparing Defenders of AI Systems,” developed through our workstream on Preparing Defenders for a Changing Cybersecurity Landscape. The paper provides practical, defender-focused guidance on applying AI security frameworks, prioritizing investments, and enhancing protection strategies for AI systems in real-world environments.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.coalitionforsecureai.org/the-ai-security-wake-up-call-why-your-organization-needs-to-act-now/">companion blog post</a> offers additional insights on how this evolving resource bridges high-level frameworks with practical implementation and will continue adapting as AI threats and technologies advance.</p>



<p>“This paper provides defenders with specific guidance on how security frameworks must be adapted to mitigate risks in the AI transformation─pinpointing gaps in current approaches and prioritizing critical investments,” said Josiah Hagen of Trend Micro and Vinay Bansal of Cisco, CoSAI’s Workstream 2 Leads. “As security practices are aligned with AI adoption realities, organizations are empowered to make informed decisions and protect their assets while ensuring innovation doesn’t outpace defenders. This exemplifies CoSAI’s commitment to connecting emerging threats to AI systems with practical security solutions.”</p>



<p>These foundational outputs from CoSAI’s first year set the stage for even greater impact ahead.</p>



 Looking Ahead: Building a Secure AI Future 



<p>As CoSAI enters its second year, the coalition is positioned to further accelerate AI security innovation through expanded research initiatives, practical tool development, and increased global engagement. With active workstreams producing actionable guidance and a growing community of practitioners, CoSAI continues to drive adoption of secure-by-design AI systems across industries. Its commitment to open source collaboration and standardization remains central to establishing trust in AI technologies. Realizing this vision requires continued collaboration across the AI security community.</p>

 Executive Summary 
<p>The prevailing approach of focusing on broad “ecosystems” for digital credential development is inefficient and limits opportunities. Instead, a more effective strategy involves starting with specific, high-impact credentials, rigorously documenting them in a trusted and public manner, and then allowing organic growth and adoption to naturally form interoperable networks. The Province of British Columbia (BC) is a leading example of this approach, leveraging foundational identity credentials and promoting their open use, which has led to unpredicted and valuable use cases and significant administrative efficiencies. The discussions highlight the “fractal” nature of ecosystems and the critical role of strong governance and transparency in building trust in digital credentials.</p>
 Key Themes and Most Important Ideas/Facts 
 1. The Flaws of an Ecosystem-First Approach 
 
 Too Many Credentials to Tackle: Attempting to develop digital credentials for an entire industry or “ecosystem” simultaneously (e.g., healthcare or finance) is “a massive undertaking, resource-intensive, hard to coordinate, and risks spreading us too thin, leading to weak, untrusted credentials.” (Digital Credentials Presentation). As Kyle Robinson notes, “there’s just too many different types of credentials and different authorities for those credentials to really get a good handle on.” (Meeting Transcript). 
 Constrains Opportunities: Pre-planning an entire ecosystem creates a rigid scope, preventing the discovery of “unexpected opportunities that could arise organically.” (Digital Credentials Presentation). Eric Drury echoes this, stating that “building a use case for an ecosystem is much more complicated than building a use case for a single credential.” (Meeting Transcript). 
 
 2. Recommendation: Start with Specific, High-Impact Credentials 
 
 Build Trust and Quality: The core recommendation is to “focus on a few high-impact credentials, like a digital CPA certification. By putting all our effort into making them robust and trustworthy, we create a gold standard that people rely on. Trust drives adoption.” (Digital Credentials Presentation). 
 Foundational Credentials as Catalysts: BC’s strategy focuses on “foundational credentials,” such as “identity of a person, identity of a business.” These are “foundational credentials which… kind of start right at the core of everything and then other credentials are built on top of those.” (Meeting Transcript). This layering allows for credentials like a “licensed doctor” to build upon a verified personal identity. 
 Open More Doors Through Ripple Effects: Strong, well-executed credentials “create ripple effects.” (Digital Credentials Presentation). BC has observed this with their “lawyer credential,” where “all these what we call verifiers, or relying parties, started popping up, saying, oh, we could use that too, we could use that too, we could use that too.” (Meeting Transcript). This organic growth leads to “unpredicted” opportunities. 
 
 3. Credential Documentation: The Foundation of Trust 
 
 Trusted Location: “Documentation must reside in a secure, reputable platform to ensure credibility.” (Digital Credentials Presentation). The BC Gov’s Digital Trust Toolkit is highlighted as a model for “transparent, trusted documentation that stakeholders can rely on.” (Digital Credentials Presentation). This toolkit serves as a “source of truth of governance documentation for credentials that are in production.” (Meeting Transcript). 
 Active Promotion and Public Visibility: Documentation is insufficient without visibility. It “needs to be public, publicly exposed. So that a verifier can look at that document and have enough information to read it to be able to trust it.” (Meeting Transcript). This active promotion through various channels (webinars, industry forums, social media) “builds awareness and encourage adoption among users and organizations.” (Digital Credentials Presentation). 
 Transparency of Issuance and Revocation: Trust extends beyond the technical aspects of a credential; it requires confidence in the “issuance process that the issuing authority goes through to be able to issue that to the right person, with the right attribute information.” (Meeting Transcript). Furthermore, visibility into “revocation status” is critical. If a ledger were to disappear, the ability to check revocation status would be lost, underscoring the need for robust infrastructure. 
 
 4. The Nature of Ecosystems and Organic Growth 
 
 Fractal Nature of Ecosystems: The discussion introduces the concept of ecosystems as “fractal.” As Carly Huitema explains, “You can zoom in all the way into grains of dirt, and there’s an ecosystem there. And then you can zoom all the way out to the planet scale ecosystem.” (Meeting Transcript). This implies that “person is a microcosm” that can be “observed in other ecosystems,” with “boundaries are always fuzzy.” (Meeting Transcript). 
 Market-Driven Adoption: The “overall drive of all of this is driven by those relying parties and verifiers.” When they “see value in doing something with credentials they will implement it, and they will tell their friends. And that’s sort of how you can see that growth and that adoption happening.” (Meeting Transcript). This organic growth is preferred over top-down, pre-defined ecosystem planning. 
 Savings and Efficiency as Drivers: Digital credentials offer tangible benefits, such as “a ton of administrative time” savings for verifiers. For example, the City of Vancouver is realizing benefits where “nothing needs to be reviewed because the technology’s already trusting the stuff that the province is producing. So they don’t have to, like, have somebody manually reveal a form.” (Meeting Transcript). 
 
 5. Trust Beyond BC: Scaling and Interoperability Challenges 
 
 Establishing “Legitimacy”: A key challenge is distinguishing “legitimate” from “non-legitimate” credentials beyond the issuing authority. BC addresses this by publishing the issuer DID, schema ID, and credential definition ID on the Candy ledger. This allows relying parties to cryptographically verify the origin. 
 Cross-Jurisdictional Interoperability: The question of how this scales beyond BC is raised, particularly when different jurisdictions (e.g., Alberta, Rhode Island, Utah) might make different technical choices for their credentials. This mirrors the non-digital world where regulations define accepted IDs. 
 Role of Trust Registries and Standards Bodies: The idea of “trust registries” is introduced as a potential solution for looking up legitimate issuers and their governance frameworks across jurisdictions. This could be driven by “standards bodies,” which could publish “trust registries published on their websites, or in some type of technology to say, hey, this standards body here, these are all of the organizations that we have audited and are following.” (Meeting Transcript). 
 Government’s Evolving Role: While government’s primary role remains issuing foundational IDs and enforcing laws, its new role in “building and supplying software to citizens” (e.g., the BC Wallet app) is seen as a way to “help adoption.” (Meeting Transcript). The future may see OS manufacturers playing a larger role in built-in wallets. 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>The discussion reinforces that while the concept of a broad “ecosystem” might be a useful descriptive tool, the practical and successful implementation of digital credentials should pivot towards a credential-first approach. By focusing on building trust and quality in individual, high-impact credentials, making their governance transparent and public, and fostering organic adoption through demonstrated value, digital trust networks can emerge and grow naturally, leading to widespread benefits. The BC government’s experience serves as a compelling case study for this evolving strategy.</p>

<p>For the good of both.</p>
<p>Customers need privacy, respect, and the ability to provide good and helpful information to the companies they deal with. The good clues customers bring can include far more than what companies get today from their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management">CRM</a> systems and from surveillance of customer activities. For example, <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2025/07/11/market-intelligence-that-flows-both-ways/">market intelligence that flows both ways</a> can happen on a massive scale.</p>
<p>But only if customers set the terms.</p>
<p>Now they can, using a new standard from the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a> called <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/">P7012</a>, aka <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2025/04/06/myterms/">MyTerms</a>. It governs machine readability of personal privacy terms. These are terms that customers proffer as first parties, and companies agree to as second parties. Lots of business can be built on top of those terms, which at the ground level start with service provision without surveillance or unwanted data sharing by the company with other parties. New agreements can be made on top of that, but MyTerms are where genuine and trusting (rather than today’s coerced and one-sided) relationships can be built.</p>
<p>When companies are open to MyTerms agreements, they don’t need cookie notices. Nor do they need 10,000-word terms and conditions or privacy policies because they’ll have contractual agreements with customers that work for both sides.</p>
<p>On top of that foundation, real relationships can be built by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_relationship_management">VRM</a> systems on the customers’ side and CRM systems on the corporate side. Both can also use <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2024/05/23/personal-ai-vs-corporate-ai/">AI agents</a>: <a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/">personal AI</a> for customers and corporate AI for companies. Massive businesses can grow to supply tools and services on both sides of those new relationships. These are businesses that can only grow atop agreements that customers bring to the table, and at scale across all the companies they engage.</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing that four guys (me included)† had in mind when they posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060215200432/http://www.cluetrain.com/">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>* on the Web in April 1999. A <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=book+the+cluetrain+manifesto&amp;ia=web">book version</a> of the manifesto came out in early 2000 and became a business bestseller that still sells in nine languages. Above the manifesto’s 95 theses is this master clue**, written by <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2021/12/21/rage-in-peace/">Christopher Locke</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>MyTerms is the only way we (who are not seats or eyeballs or end users or consumers) finally have reach that exceeds corporate grasp, so companies can finally deal with the kind of personal agency that the Internet promised in the first place.</p>
<p>The MyTerms standard requires that a roster of possible agreements be posted at a disinterested nonprofit.&nbsp; The individual chooses one, the company agrees to it (or not). Both sides keep an identical record of the agreement.</p>
<p>The first roster will be at <a href="https://customercommons.org/">Customer Commons</a>, which is ProjectVRM’s 501(c)3 nonprofit spinoff. It was created to do for personal privacy terms what <a href="https://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> does for personal copyright licenses. (It was Customer Commons, aka CuCo, that the IEEE approached with the idea of creating the MyTerms standard.)</p>
<p>Work on MyTerms started in 2017 and is in the final stages of IEEE approval process. While it is due to be published early next year, what it specifies is simple:</p>
 
 Individuals can choose a term posted at Customer Commons or the equivalent 
 Companies can agree to the individual’s choice or not 
 The decision can be recorded identically by both sides 
 Data about the decision can be recorded by both sides and kept for further reference, auditing, or dispute resolution 
 Both sides can know and display the state of agreement or absence of agreement (for example, the state of a relationship, should one come to exist) 
 
<p>MyTerms not a technical spec, so implementations are open to whatever. Development on any of those can start now. So can work in any of the six areas listed above.</p>
<p>The biggest thing MyTerms does for customers—and people just using free services—is getting rid of cookie notices, which are massively annoying and not worth the pixels they are printed on.&nbsp; If a company really does care about personal privacy, it’ll respect personal privacy requirements. This is how things work in the natural world, where tracking people like marked animals has been morally wrong for millennia. In the digital world, however, agreements need to be explicit, so programming and services can be based on them. MyTerms does that.</p>
<p>For business, MyTerms has lots of advantages:</p>
 
 Reduced or eliminated compliance risk 
 Competitive differentiation 
 Lower customer churn 
 Grounds for real rather than coerced relationships (CRM+VRM) 
 Grounds for better signaling (clues!) going in both directions 
 Reduced or eliminated guesswork about what customers want, how they use products and services, and&nbsp; how both might be improved 
 
<p>Lawyers get a new market for services on both the buy and sell sides of the marketplace. Companies in the CMP (consent management platform) business (e.g. Admiral and OneTrust) have something new and better to sell.</p>
<p>Lawmakers and Regulators can start looking at the Net and the Web as places where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_contract">freedom of contract</a> prevails, and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adhesion-contract.asp">contracts of adhesion</a> (such as what you “agree” to with cookie notices) are obsolesced.</p>
<p>Developers can have a field day (or decade). Look for these categories to emerge</p>
 
 Agreement Management Platforms – Migrate from today’s much-hated consent management platforms (hello OneTrust, Admiral, and the rest). 
 Vendor Relationship Management (VRM) Tools and services&nbsp;–&nbsp;Fill the vacuum that’s been there since the Web got real in 1995. 
 Customer Relationship Management (CRM) –&nbsp;Make its middle name finally mean something. 
 Customer Data&nbsp;Return (CDR) –&nbsp;Give, sell back, or share with customers the data you’ve been gathering without their permission since forever. Talking here to <a href="https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/">car companies</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/electronics/privacy/how-to-turn-off-smart-tv-snooping-features-a4840102036/">TV makers</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/07/07/if-you-see-this-on-your-phone-your-apps-are-spying-on-you/">app makers</a>, and every other technology product with spyware onboard for reporting personal activity to parties unknown. 
 Platform Relief –&nbsp; Free customers from the walled gardens of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and every other maker of hardware and software that currently bears the full burden of providing personal privacy to customers and users. Those companies can also embrace and help implement MyTerms for both sides of the marketplace. 
 <a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/">Personal AI (pAI)</a>– Till and plant a vast new <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2024/06/11/pai-greenfield/">greenfield</a> for countless companies, old and new. This includes Apple (which can make <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/b">Apple Intelligence</a> truly “AI for the rest of us” rather than Siri in AI drag), <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-builders-accelerator/">Mozilla (with its Business Accelerator for personal AI)</a> , <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/">Kwaai</a> (for open source <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work#Personal_(not_personalized)_AI">personal AI</a>), and everyone else who wants to jump on the train. 
 Big meshes of agents, such as<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work#Networked_Personal_AI"> what these developers are all working on</a>. 
 
<p>In the marketplace, we can start to see all these things:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527/">Predictions made by The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge</a> finally come true. 
 New dances between customers and companies, demand and supply. (“The Dance” is a closing chapter of&nbsp;The Intention Economy.) 
 New commercial ecosystems can grow around a richer flow of clues in both directions, based on shared interest and trust between demand and supply. 
 Surveillance capitalism will be obsolesced — and replaced by an economy aligned with personal agency and respect from customers’ corporate partners. 
 A new distributed P2P fabric of personally secure and shared data processing and storage — See what <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/kwaainet">KwaaiNet&nbsp;</a>+ <a href="https://www.verida.ai/">Verida</a>, for example, might do together. 
 
<p>All aboard!</p>
 
<p>†Speaking for myself in this post. I invite the other two surviving co-authors to weigh in if they like.</p>
<p>*At this writing, the Cluetrain website, along with many others at its host, is offline while being cured of an infection.&nbsp; To be clear, however, it will be back on the Web. Meanwhile, I’m linking to a snapshot of the site in the Internet Archive—a service for which the world should be massively grateful.</p>
<p>**The thesis that did the most to popularize Cluetrain was “Markets are conversations,” which was at the top of Cluetrain’s ninety-five theses. Imagining that this thesis was just for them, marketers everywhere <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=marketing+conversation+cluetrain">saw marketing, rather than markets, as “conversations.”</a> Besides misunderstanding what Cluetrain meant by conversation (that customers and companies should both have equal and reciprocal agency, and engage in human ways), marketing gave us “conversational” versions of itself that were mostly annoying.&nbsp; And now (thank you, marketing), every damn topic is now also a fucking “conversation”—the “<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22the+climate+conversation%22">climate conversation</a>,” the “<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22the+gender+conversation%22">gender conversation</a>,” the “<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22conversation+about+data+ownership%22&amp;ia=web">conversation about data ownership</a>.” I suspect that making “conversation” a synonym for “topic” was also a step toward making every piece of propaganda into a “narrative.” But I digress. Stop reading here and scroll back to read the case for MyTerms. And please, hope that it also doesn’t become woefully misunderstood.</p>

 The OpenID Foundation’s perspective on secure digital infrastructure 
<p>The blog post released today by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/securing-core-cloud-identity-infrastructure-addressing-advanced-threats-through-public-private"> Securing Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration</a> outlines vulnerabilities in cloud identity infrastructure and the urgent need to address these challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We applaud CISA’s call for public-private collaboration, and their readiness to take a leadership role in identifying and helping to close the gaps. The OIDF stands ready to collaborate with CISA, NIST, cloud service providers (CSPs), other standards bodies and the wider stakeholder community to address these persistent threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, one promising body of specification work is<a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/"> the Shared Signals Framework</a> and its associated CAEP and RISC signals, a family of work highlighted in a<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-03/CSRBReviewOfTheSummer2023MEOIntrusion508.pdf"> 2024 report</a> regarding the summer 2023 Microsoft Online Exchange incident.</p>
<p>We encourage CSPs, government agencies, and other ecosystem participants to engage in OIDF specification development as we address these emerging threats. Active participation from all parts of the cybersecurity community ensures that the standards address the needs of the various stakeholders.</p>
<p>We expect that remediating such complex threats will require not only standards, certification, and best practices, but strategic thinking on how to scale the adoption of these tools across ecosystems, including (but not limited to) the US Government’s own technical estate.&nbsp;</p>

 1. Introduction 



<p>The automotive industry is undergoing transformative changes, including the shift to software-defined and autonomous vehicles, advanced IT-like architectures, over-the-air (OTA) updates, and the rise of in-vehicle commerce. While these changes offer new revenue opportunities, they also bring significant cybersecurity threats.</p>



<p>Global cybersecurity legislation, such as UN Regulation 155, UN Regulation 156, and ISO/SAE 21434, aim to protect vehicles from emerging threats. The FIDO Alliance plays a crucial role by providing standards for secure authentication, device onboarding, and biometrics certification.</p>



<p>Utilizing standards helps automotive companies ensure consistent security, leverage collective expertise, and avoid proprietary solutions that have the potential to stymie new markets and revenue. FIDO standards apply to various automotive applications, including consumer services, in-vehicle solutions, workforce authentication, and manufacturing, ensuring robust cybersecurity across the industry.</p>



<p>This paper provides companies within the automotive ecosystem an insight into the standards and services the FIDO Alliance offers together with a review of current and future use cases.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance is seeking feedback and partnership with industry experts to help ensure that FIDO’s programs are fit for purpose and successfully help companies meet cybersecurity needs, improve driver experiences, and tap into new opportunities.</p>



 2. Evolution of the automotive industry 



<p>The automotive industry has 140 years of history and is currently going through changes that affect all aspects of the industry:</p>



 
 Electrification and sustainability 



 Software-defined vehicles and connectivity 



 Autonomous and assisted driving 



 Shifting business models: Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) and direct sales 



 Supply chain disruptions and geopolitical risks 



 New revenue streams: data monetization and services 



 Rollout of EV charging infrastructure and its energy grid impacts 



 Changing consumer expectations and digital experiences 
 



<p>These changes bring potential upside to manufacturers in terms of new revenue opportunities and improved vehicles, but they also introduce considerable cyber threats.</p>



<p>Vehicles have evolved from isolated mechanical systems into interconnected cyber-physical platforms (often created by various entities) that integrate complex software, hardware, and communication networks. Manufacturers implement these systems to provide end users with a better vehicle and an enhanced driving experience, but they also bring an increased risk of cyber threats associated with new “attack surfaces”. These potential threats come in many forms, from malicious hackers to state funded actors. To minimize these threats, it is now a fundamental priority for manufacturers, their suppliers, regulators, and other industry stakeholders to focus on cybersecurity.</p>



 3. Meet the challenges and seize the opportunity 



<p>Automotive cybersecurity professionals have a massive challenge in front of them. On one side they need to react to the rise in threats and account for the associated legislation that has been developed to protect consumers. On the other side they need to be open to supporting new business models such as in-vehicle commerce, value added vehicle features such as subscription services, as well as additional cybersecurity for factories and offices. While there is no one simple solution to meet all of these needs, utilizing standards and certification programs from organizations such as the FIDO Alliance can help greatly.</p>



 4. Automotive cybersecurity and global legislation 



<p>National governments and international organizations have enacted regulations that require stringent cybersecurity measures throughout the automotive lifecycle, including design, operation, and even end-of-life. These frameworks aim to shield vehicles from emerging threats and establish a baseline for safety and trust across the automotive ecosystem. Major worldwide examples include:</p>



 
 United Nations Regulation 155 and United Nations Regulation 156: mandate that vehicles incorporate a Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) and a Software Update Management System (SUMS) 



 ISO/SAE 21434: provides the foundation for global automotive cybersecurity engineering, outlining processes for managing cyber risks throughout the entire vehicle lifecycle 



 China’s GB 44495-2024 and GB 44496-2024: regulate the Cyber Security Management System (CSMS) and govern secure software updates in a granular fashion 



 India’s AIS 189 and AIS 190: align with UN R155 and R156, to regulate the cybersecurity of connected vehicles 



 United States: Publication of cybersecurity best practices by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that emphasize secure vehicle development processes, incident response plans, and continuous risk monitoring 
 



<p>Refer to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-addressing-cybersecurity-challenges-in-the-automotive-industry/#appendix-a-global-legislation-applicable-to-automotive-cybersecu">Appendix A</a> to learn more about these standards.</p>



 5. The FIDO Alliance and FIDO standards 



<p>The FIDO Alliance is an open industry association with a focused mission: reduce the world’s reliance on passwords. To accomplish this, the FIDO Alliance promotes the development of, use of, and compliance with standards for user authentication and device onboarding.</p>

 6. FIDO for automotive cybersecurity compliance 



<p>Meeting the demands of the primary automotive cybersecurity standard ISO/SAE 21434 and subsequently the most prominent regulation, UN R155, hinges on strong identity management and secure device onboarding. While these standards don’t prescribe FIDO protocols per se, they outline key principles where FIDO offers tangible benefits.</p>



<p>ISO 21434, particularly Clauses 8 and 9 concerning risk assessment and threat mitigation, calls for strategies to prevent unauthorized access. FIDO’s passwordless authentication directly addresses this by eliminating weak credentials and reducing risks from phishing and credential stuffing, common threats to connected vehicle systems. Additionally, Clause 10’s focus on secure software deployment aligns with FIDO Device Onboard (FDO), ensuring only authenticated devices join the ecosystem, mitigating supply chain attacks and unauthorized software injections. This direct mapping of FIDO’s capabilities to specific clauses demonstrates its value in achieving compliance.</p>



<p>Beyond these founding standards, FIDO’s approach has broad applicability to emerging regulations, providing OEMs with a pathway to meeting global compliance demands and bolstering cybersecurity resilience across their connected car ecosystem. Some examples include China’s GB 44495-2024 and India’s AIS 189, which call for regional automotive cybersecurity standards and reinforce the need for features such as secure authentication in the software-defined vehicle (SDV) era. China’s GB regulation, similar to UN R155, emphasizes authenticity and integrity in remote updates, where FIDO’s passkey-based authentication provides a compliant approach to verifying access. India’s regulations, currently still in draft, align with UN R155, highlighting the importance of securing vehicle-to-cloud communications and identity management.</p>



 7. Overview of emerging use cases where FIDO standards may apply 



<p>FIDO standards can be applied to a wide range of scenarios. These can be customer-facing, embedded within the vehicle, or as part of the manufacturer’s IT infrastructure.</p>



<p>High level overview of some of some of these scenarios include but not limited to:</p>



 
 In-vehicle commerce: This includes payments using credentials stored and managed in vehicle to enable convenient fueling, EV charging, parking reservations, car washes or even in-vehicle marketplaces managed by the car manufacturer. Implementation of passkeys to authenticate the associated car user and biometric component certification are most relevant to these use cases. 



 Authentication to personalized services: These applications include easy access to customized automotive settings (for example, headrest and seat adjustments) as well as to informational and entertainment content. 



 In-vehicle solutions: This segment includes applications such as car-to-cloud connectivity and onboarding of ECUs and zone controllers within the vehicle. Implementation of FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) is most applicable to these applications. 



 Workforce authentication: These applications include controlling workforce access to IT systems whether at a development office, manufacturing site, or dealership. Implementation of passkeys and FIDO USB authentication keys are most applicable to these applications. 



 Manufacturing: Modern manufacturing facilities are moving towards software defined control, AI, and robotic systems. The secure deployment of these solutions is often time consuming and expensive. Implementation of FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) can accelerate deployments and increase security. 
 



 8. FIDO Alliance technology overview 



<p>In the same way that Ethernet started as an IT networking solution, FIDO standards were not specifically created for automotive applications. However, they are highly relevant in modern vehicles where robust cybersecurity is a critical, foundational element rather than just a desirable feature. FIDO standards, such as passkeys, are being used as is in the automotive world today.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance technology portfolio for automotive applications can be broadly grouped into three main areas:</p>



<p>Passkeys: The FIDO Alliance is transforming authentication through open standards for phishing-resistant sign-ins using passkeys. Passkeys are more secure than passwords and SMS OTPs, easier for consumers and employees to use, and simpler for service providers to deploy and manage. Automotive manufacturers leverage passkeys for a wide variety of use cases.</p>



<p>Device Onboarding: The FIDO Alliance establishes standards for secure device onboarding (FDO) to ensure the safety and efficiency of connected devices in segments such as industrial and enterprise. In the automotive sector, manufacturers can apply this standard to the connections between Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and zone controllers or connections between the vehicle itself and the cloud services that facilitate over-the-air software updates. This standard has been adopted by Microsoft, Dell, ExxonMobil, Red Hat and others.</p>



<p>Biometrics certification: The FIDO Alliance offers a certification program tailored to specific applications that uses independent test labs to measure performance of biometric sensors (such as iris or fingerprint sensors). Biometric sensors are becoming an increasingly important component of vehicles. Typical use cases might be to automatically configure the driver’s seat position or as part of a payment system. In these two examples the definition of “good technical performance” can differ greatly. Samsung, ELAN Microelectronics, Thales, Qualcomm, Mitek, iProov, and others have had biometric components certified by FIDO Alliance.</p>



 9. FIDO Alliance technology deep dive 



<p>To better understand how automotive manufacturers and the FIDO Alliance can work together, this section discusses current FIDO technologies and how they might integrate with automotive applications.</p>



<p>9.1 Passkeys and user authentication</p>



<p>A passkey is a FIDO authentication credential based on FIDO standards, that allows a user to sign in to apps and websites with the same steps that they use to unlock their device (biometrics, PIN, or pattern). With passkeys, users no longer need to enter usernames and passwords or additional factors.</p>



<p>Passkeys are the signature implementation of FIDO authentication standards, and they offer secure yet simplified sign-in to a wide range of services. Passkeys are supported by all major device operating systems and browsers and have been utilized by many industry leaders including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Amazon, Walmart, PayPal, and Visa.</p>



<p>The following diagram illustrates how passkeys can be used for in-car applications, such as when a driver signs in to a cloud service.</p>







<p>Figure 1:Sample passkey usage in automotive</p>



<p>Passkeys rely on a technology known as public key cryptography (PKC), in which a virtual key pair is created, one private and the other public. For each private key (stored on the user’s device) there exists a matching public key (stored on the server) that is used to check signatures created with the private key.</p>



<p>In the diagram, a user (the driver in this case) first registers with a cloud service such as a payment service. During the registration process, a private and public cryptographic key is created by the FIDO Authenticator. The private key is stored securely in the infotainment system of the vehicle and is associated with that driver. The public key is stored on the cloud of the service provider.</p>



<p>When the driver wants to sign in to the service, a request is sent from the vehicle to the cloud service. The service then sends an authentication request to the vehicle. This challenge can only be successfully authorized by the user that holds the matching private key. To make sure that request is genuine, the driver is asked to confirm that they want to sign in. This is typically achieved via a biometric sensor such as fingerprint or face. Once this verification is complete, the user gains access to the service. Several FIDO hardware and software components are used for this process.</p>



<p>9.2 Passkey components</p>



<p>Three FIDO Certified components are used in the example:</p>



<p>FIDO authenticator</p>



<p>A FIDO authenticator is a software component or a piece of hardware that can perform FIDO authentication to verify possession and/or confirm user identity. In the example, the FIDO authenticator likely resides in the car infotainment system.</p>



<p>FIDO server</p>



<p>The server provides an application with a programming interface that can be leveraged with a FIDO Certified client to perform strong authentication. The server sits inside the cloud application.</p>



<p>Biometric components</p>



<p>Biometric components can identify an individual and are often used to compliment a FIDO authenticator. These sensors can take multiple forms including fingerprint, iris and face. The FIDO Alliance certifies the efficacy of biometric subsystems including end-to-end performance, differential assessment of demographic groups, and presentation attack detection (PAD).</p>



<p>Although the example is an in-vehicle use case, the same passkey technology can be applied inside a factory, development center, or dealership to ensure that systems are resilient to phishing attacks or other common password attack vectors.</p>



<p>9.3 In-vehicle biometrics</p>



<p>Installation of biometric components in vehicles is expected to increase rapidly over time. The performance needs of these components will vary by sensor type and target application. Today, the FIDO Alliance offers a comprehensive independent certification program for biometric components such as fingerprint and iris sensors. By specifying in a request for quote (RFQ) that products should be FIDO Certified, automotive manufacturers can simplify selection of sensors. For more information on FIDO Certification, visit <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">https://fidoalliance.org/certification/</a>.</p>



<p>9.4 FIDO Device Onboard (FDO)</p>



<p>When a computer device (such as an ECU) first connects to its management platform (the zone controller), it needs to be onboarded and provisioned. A parallel example might be the connection between a vehicle and its cloud. FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) was developed by FIDO Alliance members to meet the automation and high security requirements of such onboarding experiences.</p>



<p>With FDO, a device is first connected to the (wired or wireless) network and then powered up. The device then automatically and securely onboards to the management platform. FDO is based on a zero-trust architecture and therefore offers a high level of security as both the device and the management platform must cryptographically authenticate themselves to each other. FDO also provides resilience to supply chain attacks.</p>



<p>A number of leading technology providers have demonstrated implementations of FDO solutions including Dell, Microsoft, Red Hat, Intel, and ASRock.</p>



 10. FIDO technology use cases deep dive 



<p>The FIDO Alliance has identified several use cases where FIDO technology can be applied to support the automotive industry. This section discusses possible use cases with the hopes of fostering further conversations.</p>



<p>10.1 Consumer use cases</p>



<p>Historically, many cybersecurity applications have been “behind the scenes”. In modern vehicles there is an increasing number of new applications that directly impact the driver and passenger in-vehicle experience and open new revenue opportunities for manufacturers. One such area is the emergence of in-vehicle commerce.</p>



<p>Several factors are driving in-vehicle commerce:</p>



 
 Technological advancements  Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) allow for continuous updates and new functionality without hardware modifications.  
 
 Autonomous driving introduces a new use case for vehicles as productivity or leisure spaces. 
 
 



 Changing consumer expectations
 
 Consumers demand experiences in their vehicles akin to those offered by their smartphones and other digital devices. 
 
 



 Revenue opportunities
 
 By acting as platforms for digital services, vehicles open new revenue streams for car manufacturers and service providers. 
 
 
 



<p>10.2 Identity verification, authentication, and authorization</p>



<p>The growing connectivity and services associated with modern vehicles brings about new requirements for identity verification, authentication, and authorization.</p>



 
 Identity verification: The process of confirming a person’s identity. It can involve comparing information provided by a person with records in a database or with the person’s physical documents such as a driver’s license. 



 Authentication: Confirms that a person is who they say they are when attempting to sign in to systems, services, and resources. 



 Authorization: The step after authentication that determines user access in terms of accessing data or performing actions. 
 



<p>Unlike other computing devices, such as smartphones and wearables, vehicles often have multiple users including family members, friends, co-workers, or renters. Each user may need access to services or to perform transactions tied to their unique identities and credentials. Therefore, vehicular computing resources must be cyber secure and capable of managing secure access and authentication for a diverse user base, including third-party service providers.</p>



<p>10.3 In-vehicle commerce and authentication</p>



<p>Commerce services in vehicles are closely tied to payments, making strong and user-friendly authentication essential. Drivers must trust that transactions are secure, manufacturers aim to minimize liability for unauthorized payments, and financial institutions require robust, standards-compliant authentication mechanisms. In addition, regulatory frameworks, such as Europe’s Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2), mandate strong customer authentication (SCA) for cardholder-initiated transactions.</p>



<p>SCA requires a combination of at least two out of three factors:</p>



 
 Possession (something the user has, for example, a key, phone, or vehicle) 



 Inherence (something the user is, for example, biometrics like fingerprint or facial recognition) 



 Knowledge (something the user knows, for example, a PIN or password) 
 



<p>If the passkey authenticator is not natively integrated into the vehicle, authentication must be implemented using alternative multi-factor configurations. This can be achieved through software-based approaches, such as combining a PIN (knowledge) with the vehicle as a possession factor, or through hardware-based methods, such as biometric authentication (inherence) via fingerprint sensors or facial recognition, again anchored by the vehicle as the possession factor.</p>



<p>In-vehicle commerce can be broadly categorized into three main areas:</p>



<p>On-demand features</p>



 
 With on-demand features, vehicles now allow users to activate specific functionalities based on their needs. This includes advanced driver-assistance systems, comfort features like heated seats, and performance upgrades. 



 On-demand features can be offered through flexible subscription models or pay-per-use systems. These features enhance customer satisfaction and create additional revenue streams for manufacturers. 
 



<p>Vehicle-related services</p>



 
 Vehicle-related services are seamlessly integrated services that include fueling, EV charging, parking reservations and payments, car washes, and toll payments. 



 To maximize user convenience, the vehicle acts as a payment hub without reliance on a smartphone. 
 



<p>Convenience features</p>



 
 With implementation of convenience features such as shopping, entertainment, education, and even remote work functionalities, the vehicle becomes an extension of the user’s digital ecosystem. 



 Examples include ordering coffee or groceries on the go, streaming movies, or attending virtual meetings during commutes. 



 These categories illustrate that vehicles are no longer just modes of transportation but platforms that enable various service providers to engage with drivers and passengers. 
 



<p>10.4 Driver ID Verification for vehicle access control</p>



<p>Vehicle access requires a high level of authentication and is well suited to biometric sensors.</p>



 
 Keyless entry and ignition: Biometric systems like fingerprint and facial recognition can replace traditional keys to provide secure, biometric-based authentication for vehicle access and ignition. 



 Anti-theft measures: Vehicles can utilize biometric authentication to prevent unauthorized usage or theft, including carjacking. 



 Vehicle and OEM services: Vehicles can use biometric authentication as the first step to assessing a driver’s rights and privileges in determining how vehicle services can be accessed. 
 



<p>10.5 Personalization, fleet management and autonomous vehicles</p>



<p>Vehicles are often shared and the ability to automatically adapt to a specific driver is an important capability. The criteria and threshold for identification and authentication varies greatly depending on the specific application. For example, adjusting a driver’s seat adjustment versus passenger authorization for an autonomous vehicle.</p>



<p>10.5.1 Personalization</p>



 
 Adaptive in-car settings: Biometric recognition can identify drivers or passengers in order to adjust seat positions, climate controls, infotainment preferences, and navigation routes according to stored profiles. 



 Adaptive usage-based services: By seamlessly authenticating the driver, the automaker can provide use-based insurance or leasing and financing options for personal and commercial scenarios. 



 Fleet management 



 Shared vehicles and fleets: Biometric-enabled processes ensure smooth transitions between users in car-sharing or fleet systems, loading personal settings for each verified driver. 



 Compliance tracking: Digital wallets can hold compliance documents (for example, licenses and vehicle inspection reports) to reduce paperwork and enhance audit readiness by asserting compliance attributes to authorized users. 
 



<p>10.5.2 Autonomous vehicles</p>



<p>Passenger authentication and ID verification: In self-driving cars, biometric systems authenticate passengers to ensure authorized use and personalized experiences.</p>



<p>Why key possession is not sufficient authentication</p>



<p>There are several reasons why a physical key is not a sufficient form of user authentication.</p>



 
 A physical key verifies access to the vehicle but does not confirm the identity of the individual using it. In scenarios such as ridesharing, fleet management, or multi-user vehicles, relying solely on key possession fails to distinguish authorized users from unauthorized users. 



 As discussed earlier, for payment use-cases there is a need in some markets to be compliant with SCA regulations. A key only satisfies the possession factor and therefore does not meet the SCA requirements for secure payments. 



 A vehicle key can be lost, stolen, or duplicated allowing unauthorized individuals to gain access. Without additional layers of authentication, transactions made in the vehicle could be fraudulent. 



 Multi-party and platform complexity: In-car commerce involves multiple stakeholders such as Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), service providers, and users. Authentication must ensure that the user is authorized to transact across all platforms and services, necessitating identity verification beyond simple possession. 
 



<p>10.6 Electronic systems and manufacturing use cases</p>



<p>10.6.1 In-vehicle ECU, zone controller, and compute onboarding</p>



<p>As the compute level rises within vehicles, the need for efficient and fast communication becomes increasingly important. In response to this need, cars are increasingly moving to an IT-centric architecture with Ethernet becoming the networking technology of choice to link zone controllers and ECUs inside a vehicle.</p>



<p>In addition to high speed and secure communication, there is a need to ensure that both the device (ECU) and the management platform (Zone controller) are cryptographically authenticated against each other. Although initially developed for IoT and IT systems, the FIDO Alliance team believes that FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) can be a fast and secure way to automate the onboarding process. As FDO is an open standard, automotive manufacturers can benefit from economies of scale savings versus paying for the development and maintenance of proprietary solutions.</p>



<p>In addition to speed and security, FDO also provides resilience to supply chain attacks and grey market counterfeits.</p>



<p>10.6.2 Car to cloud onboarding</p>



<p>As the complexity of car features grows and autonomous driving technology increases, a modern car is essentially a computer on wheels that requires a vast amount of software for all functions to operate.</p>



<p>Most sources agree that a typical modern car is managed by software generated by around 100 million lines of code. The very nature of this complexity confirms that the days when vehicle software can be frozen at vehicle product launch is no longer realistic.</p>



<p>Software updates are now a mandatory feature of modern automobiles and a secure and efficient way of connecting the vehicle to the manufacturer’s cloud is essential.</p>



<p>FDO provides a secure and fast method for vehicles to onboard to their management platforms, making Over the Air (OTA) software updates possible.</p>







<p>Figure 2:FIDO fit for in-vehicle systems</p>



<p>Additionally, new updates to the FDO standard are expected to allow software to securely deploy to bare ECUs or zone controllers, which would greatly simplify dealership repairs and upgrades.</p>



<p>10.7 Workforce authentication (passkeys/FIDO keys)</p>



<p>For many years the IT industry has been using FIDO authenticators to ensure that only authorized staff have access to systems. The risks associated with attacks in this space have been highlighted by the recent challenges faced by some automotive dealers.</p>







<p>Figure 3:FIDO fit for workforce authentication</p>



<p>A cyberattack on a software provider for car dealerships occurred in June of 2024 and disrupted the operations of thousands of dealerships in North America. This attack caused major disruptions, including delays for car buyers and an estimated $1 billion in collective losses for dealerships.</p>



<p>10.8 Manufacturing use cases</p>



<p>Factories are using classic fixed function manufacturing functions such as motion control and PLCs less as they move towards use of far more flexible and intelligent software defined control and AI based vision systems. This transition introduces large numbers of general-purpose computers to the factory floor.</p>



<p>At installation, each server or industrial PC needs to be onboarded to its respective management platform (on-premises or cloud). This onboarding process typically requires that skilled technicians manually configure the credentials or passwords in the devices, a process that is slow, not secure, and expensive.</p>



<p>With FIDO Device Onboard (FDO), a technician can plug in an industrial PC and have it automatically and securely onboard the management server platform.</p>



<p>The following diagram shows how FDO is used to onboard the industrial PCs to the local servers which are in turn onboarded to the manufacturing cloud.</p>

 11. Why using standards helps 



<p>Cybersecurity standards, such as those from the FIDO Alliance, offer value in ways that are hard for any single company to achieve. These consensus-based standards represent maturity and provide consistency for the industry, which are crucial for reliable authentication and authorization. FIDO cybersecurity standards are based on diverse expertise, provide clarity in a changing cybersecurity landscape, and offer essential guidance for certification authorities and regulators as they develop new laws.</p>



<p>Although the automotive industry has utilized standards almost since its inception, there are still areas where companies have tried to develop their own proprietary solutions. Such solutions rarely add value for the manufacturers and require engineering talent to develop and time to maintain.</p>



<p>As the automotive computing platform is a system of systems, the automotive industry can benefit from lessons learned by related industries. Open standards supported by certification programs help streamline product and service development.</p>



<p>FIDO’s standards are essentially commoditizing authentication elements that are critical to cybersecurity, but that are not natural areas for competitive differentiation. By leveraging standards, vendors and manufacturers can now focus their resources and development efforts on higher-value services.</p>



<p>11.1 Benefits of partnering with the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Diverse expertise: The FIDO Alliance brings together skilled professionals from various companies, including cloud players, credit card companies, and manufacturers.</p>



<p>Ecosystem cohesion: Standards ensure quality, security, and interoperability within ecosystems, which is crucial for applications like payments.</p>



<p>Adapt to emerging threats: The threat landscape is always evolving. As an example, quantum computing represents a significant threat to commonly used encryption techniques. Although quantum computing is in a relatively early stage of maturity, standards groups such as the FIDO Alliance are already defining how to create quantum resilient solutions.</p>



 12. FIDO Certification programs for the automotive industry 



<p>The FIDO Alliance’s world-class certification programs validate that products conform to FIDO specifications and interoperate effectively and assess security characteristics and biometric performance. With over 1,200 FIDO Certified products from hundreds of vendors around the world, these programs unlock the value of FIDO’s open standards for vendors and buyers. By specifying FIDO Certification in their RFQ’s, manufacturers can be sure that their suppliers will deliver performant, secure, and interoperable products.</p>



<p>Automotive OEMs can seek out and leverage components that are already certified (for example, authenticators or biometric components) and FIDO Alliance’s certification team is also developing an automotive profile with its lab partners that replicates in-car environments for more precise biometric tests. The Alliance seeks automotive sector feedback to help us collectively:</p>

 14. Appendix A – Global legislation applicable to automotive cybersecurity 



<p>National governments and international organizations have enacted regulations that require stringent cybersecurity measures throughout the automotive lifecycle, from design to operation and even end of life. These frameworks aim to shield vehicles from emerging threats and establish a baseline for safety and trust across the automotive ecosystem.</p>



<p>United Nations Regulations 155 and 156: These are the most prominent and clearly defined automotive cybersecurity regulations. Adopted under the WP.29 framework in 2021, UN R155 and R156 are globally recognized and mandate that vehicles incorporate a Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) and a Software Update Management System (SUMS). These regulations are prerequisites for type approvals in over 50 countries, including most EU nations, Japan, South Korea, and Australia (UNECE, 2021).</p>



<p>ISO/SAE 21434: This standard provides the foundation for global automotive cybersecurity engineering, outlining processes for managing cyber risks throughout the entire vehicle lifecycle. It complements existing regulations and aids manufacturers in complying with mandatory regulations such as UN R155 (ISO, 2021).</p>



<p>China’s GB 44495-2024 and GB 44496-2024: Introduced in the summer of 2024, these regulations mirror UN R155 and R156 but are more detailed in specificity. GB 44495 outlines cybersecurity requirements for connected vehicles, while GB 44496 governs secure software updates. China’s focus on intelligent connected vehicles highlights its ambition to lead in autonomous and connected technologies (Shadlich, 2024).</p>



<p>India’s AIS 189 and AIS 190: India has introduced AIS 189 and AIS 190, standards aligned with UN R155 and R156, to regulate the cybersecurity of connected vehicles. These frameworks emphasize risk management, monitoring, secure communication protocols, and secure software updates, similar to UN R155/R156 (Vernekar, 2024).</p>



<p>United States: While there are no mandated federal regulations for automotive cybersecurity, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has published cybersecurity best practices. These guidelines emphasize secure vehicle development processes, incident response plans, and continuous risk monitoring. They align with ISO/SAE 21434 and offer a proactive approach to mitigating vulnerabilities in connected vehicles (NHTSA, 2022).</p>

<p>Reflections on recent conversations about digital identity, sovereignty, and the erosion of foundational principles</p>

 Echoes from Geneva 

<p>I wasn’t present at the <a href="https://globaldigitalcollaboration.org/">Global Digital Collaboration</a> conference (GDC25), but the observations shared by colleagues who attended have crystallized some issues I’ve been wrestling with for years. I should note there’s a selection bias here: I’m the author of the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md">10 principles of self-sovereign identity</a>, so my community tends to have strong opinions about digital identity. Still, when multiple trusted voices independently report similar concerns, patterns emerge that are worth examining. And these weren’t casual observers sharing these concerns. They were seasoned practitioners who’ve spent decades building identity infrastructure. Their collective unease speaks to something deeper than technical disagreements.</p>

<p>It’s hard to boil the problems at GDC25 down to a single issue, because they were so encompassing. For example, there was a pattern of scheduling issues that undercut the community co-organizing goal of the conference and seemed to particularly impact decentralized talks. One session ended up in a small, hot room on the top floor that was hard to find. (It was packed anyway!) Generally, the decentralized-centric talks were in bad locations, they were short, they had restricted topics, or they were shared with other panelists.</p>

<p>I think that logistical shuffling of events may point out one of the biggest issues: decentralized systems weren’t given much respect. This may be true generally. There may be lip service to decentralized systems, but not deeper commitments. Its value isn’t appreciated, so we’re losing its principles. Worse, I see the intent of decentralization being inverted: where our goal is to give individuals independence and power by reducing the control of centralized entities, we’re often doing the opposite — still in the name of decentralization.</p>

 The Echo Chamber Paradox 

<p>The problems at GDC25 remind me of Rebooting the Web of Trust (RWOT) community discussions I’ve been following, which reiterate that this is a larger issue. We debate the finer points of zero-knowledge proofs and DID conformance while missing the forest for the trees. Case in point: the recent emergence of “<a href="https://genuinein.com/DIDMethod"><code>did:genuineid</code></a>” — a centralized identifier system that fundamentally contradicts the “D” in DID.</p>

<p>Obviously, decentralization is a threat to those who currently hold power (whether they be governments, corporations, billionaires, or others who hold any sort of power), because it tries to remove their centralization (and therefore their power), to instead empower the individual. But if we can’t even maintain the semantic integrity of “decentralized” within our own technical community, devoted to the ideal, how can we fight for it in the larger world?</p>

 The Corpocratic Complication 

<p>GDC25 was held in Geneva, Switzerland. 30+ standards organizations convened to discuss the future of digital identity. Participants spanned the world from the United States to China. There was the opportunity that GDC25 was going to be a truly international conference. Indeed, Swiss presenters were there, and they spoke of privacy, democratic involvement, and achieving public buy-in. It was exactly the themes that we as decentralized technologists wanted to hear.</p>

<p>But from what I’ve heard, things quickly degraded from that ideal. Take the United States. The sole representative of the country as a whole attended via teleconference. (He was the only presenter who did so!) His talk was all about Real ID, framed as a response to 9/11 and rooted in the Patriot Act. It lay somewhere between security-theatre and identity-as-surveillance, and that’s definitely not what we wanted to hear. (The contrast between the US and Swiss presentations was apparently jarring.)</p>

<p>And with that representative only attending remotely, the United State’s real representatives ended up being Google and Apple, each advancing their own corpocratic interests, not the interests of the people we try to empower with decentralized identities.</p>

<p>This isn’t just an American problem. It’s a symptom of a deeper issue happening across our digital infrastructure. It’s likely the heart of the inversions of decentralized goals that we’re seeing — and likely why those logistical reshufflings occurred: to please the gold sponsors. In fact, the conference sponsors tell the story: Google, Visa, Mastercard, and Huawei were positioned as “leading organizations supporting the advancement of wallets, credentials and trusted infrastructure in a manner of global collaboration.”</p>

<p>While Huawei’s presence demonstrates international diversity—a Swiss conference bringing together Europe and Asia—it also raised questions about whose vision of “trust” would ultimately prevail. When payment platforms and surveillance-capable tech giants frame the future of identity infrastructure, we shouldn’t be surprised when the architecture serves their interests first.</p>

<p>This echoes my concerns from <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-ssi-bankruptcy/">“Has SSI Become Morally Bankrupt?”</a>. We’ve allowed the narrative of self-sovereignty to be co-opted by the very platforms it was meant to challenge. The technical standards exist, but they’re being implemented in ways that invert their original purpose. Even <a href="https://unece.org/trade/events/global-digital-collaboration-conference-international-trade-identity-across-borders">UNECE sessions acknowledged</a> the risk of “diluting the autonomy and decentralization that SSI is meant to provide.”</p>

 The Sovereignty Shell Game 

<p>Google was partnered with German Sparkasse on ZKP technology and that revealed a specific example of this co-opting.</p>

<p>Google’s open-sourcing of its Zero-Knowledge Proof libraries, announced July 3rd in partnership with Germany’s network of public savings banks, was positioned as supporting privacy in age verification. Yet as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dr-carsten-st%C3%B6cker-1145871_opening-up-zero-knowledge-proof-technology-activity-7348195852085067776-nKDB">Carsten Stöcker pointed out</a>, zero-knowledge doesn’t mean zero-tracking when the entire stack runs through platform intermediaries. Carsten noted that Google has “extensive tracking practices across mobile devices, web platforms and advertising infrastructure.” Meanwhile, the Google Play API makes no promises that the operations are protected from the rest of the OS.</p>

<p>The Google ZKP libraries (“longfellow-sk”) could be a great <a href="https://news.dyne.org/longfellow-zero-knowledge-google-zk/">building block</a> for truly user-centric systems, as they link Zero-Knowledge Proofs to legacy cryptographic signature systems that are still mandatory for some hardware. But they’d have to be detached from the rest of Google’s technology stack. Without that, there are too many questions. Could Google access some of the knowledge supposedly protected by ZKPs? Could they link it to other data? We have no idea.</p>

<p>The European Union’s eIDAS Regulation, set to take effect in 2026, encourages Member States to integrate privacy-enhancing technologies like ZKP into the European Digital Identity Wallet, but integration at the platform level offers similar dangers and could again invert the very privacy guarantees ZKP promises.</p>

 Historical Echoes, Modern Inversions 

<p>Identity technology’s goals being inverted, so that identity becomes a threat rather than a boon, isn’t a new problem. In <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/echoes-history/">“Echoes of History”</a>, I examined how the contrasting approaches of Lentz and Carmille during WWII demonstrate the life-or-death importance of data minimization. Lentz’s comprehensive Dutch identity system enabled the Holocaust’s efficiency; Carmille’s deliberate exclusion of religious data from French records saved lives. Even when they’re decentralized, today’s digital identity systems face the same fundamental questions: what data should we collect, what should we reveal, and what should we refuse to record entirely?</p>

<p>But we’re adding a new layer of complexity. Not only must we consider what data to collect, but who controls the infrastructure that processes it. When Google partners with Sparkasse on “privacy-preserving” age verification, when eIDAS mandates integration at the operating system level, we’re not just risking data collection: we’re embedding it within platforms whose business models depend on surveillance. Even if the data is theoretically self-sovereign, the threat of data collected is still data revealed — just as happened with Lentz’s records.</p>

<p>The European eIDAS framework, which I analyzed in a <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/eidas/">follow-up piece to “Echoes from History”</a>, shows how even well-intentioned regulatory efforts can accelerate platform capture when they mandate integration at the operating system level. As I wrote at the time, a history of problematic EU legislation that had the best of intentions but resulted in unintended consequences has laid the groundwork, and now identity is straight in that crosshairs. One of the first, and most obvious problems with eIDAS is the mandate “that web browers accept security certificates from individual member states and the EU can refuse to revoke them even if they’re dangerous.” There are many more — and I’m not <a href="https://news.dyne.org/the-problems-of-european-digital-identity/">the only voice</a> on eIDAS and EUDI issues.</p>

<p>Supposedly self-sovereign certificates phoning home whenever they’re accessed is another recent threat that demonstrates best intentions gone awry. This not only violates privacy, but it undercuts some of our best arguments for self-soveereign control of credentials by returning liability for data leaks to the issuer. The <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/news/No-Phone-Home/">No Phone Home</a> initiative that Blockchain Commons joined last month represents one attempt to push back on that, but it feels like plugging holes in a dam that’s already cracking. It all does.</p>

 The Builder’s Dilemma 

<p>What troubles me most is the split I see in our community. On one side, technology purists build increasingly sophisticated protocols in isolation from policy reality. On the other, pragmatists make compromise after compromise until nothing remains of the original vision.</p>

<p>The recent debates about <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-method-web"><code>did:web</code> conformance</a> illustrate this perfectly. Joe Andrieu correctly notes that <code>did:web</code> can’t distinguish between deactivation and non-existence — a fundamental security boundary. Yet <code>did:web</code> remains essential to many implementation strategies because it bridges the gap between ideals and adoption. It provides developers and users with experience with DIDs, but in doing so undercut decentralized ideals for those users. We’re caught between philosophical purity and practical irrelevance.</p>

<p>In my recent writings on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/ValuesDesign/">Values in Design</a> and the <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/RightToTransact/">Right to Transact</a>, I’ve tried to articulate what we’re fighting for. But values without implementation are just philosophy, and implementation without values is just surrender.</p>

<p>The Global Digital Collaboration highlighted this tension perfectly. International progress on digital identity proceeds apace: Europe, Singapore, and China all advance their frameworks, but there are still essential issues that invert our fundamental goals in designing self-sovereign systems. Meanwhile, the U.S. remains even more stalled, its position represented only by the platforms that benefit from the status quo. Alongside this, technical standards discussions proceed in isolation from the policy, regulatory, and social frameworks that will determine their real-world impact.</p>

 Where Do We Go From Here? 

<p>I find myself returning to first principles. When we designed <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2246">TLS 1.0</a>, we understood that technical protocols encode power relationships. When we established the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md">principles of self-sovereign identity</a>, we knew that architecture was politics. Ongoing battles, such as those between Verifiable Credentials and ISO mDLs, between DIDComm and OpenID4VC, demonstrate disagreements over these power relationships made visible in technological discussions.</p>

<p>The question now is whether we can reclaim our ideals before they’re completely inverted by the side of centralized power and controlled architecture.</p>

<p>The path forward requires bridging the gaps Geneva revealed:</p>

 
   Between corporate platform dominance and global digital sovereignty 
   Between the promise of decentralization and the reality of recentralization 
   Between technical standards and policy reality 
   Between privacy absolutism and implementation pragmatism 
 

 A Personal Note 

<p>After three decades of building internet infrastructure, I’ve learned that the most dangerous moment isn’t when systems fail, it’s when they succeed in ways that invert their purpose. We built protocols for human autonomy and watched them become instruments of platform control. We created standards for decentralization and see them twisted into new forms of centralization.</p>

<p>This conversation continues in private Signal groups, in conference hallways, in the space between what we built and what we’ve become. The <a href="https://dfrlab.org/2024/10/01/analysis-a-brave-new-reality-after-the-uns-global-digital-compact/">Atlantic Council warns</a> of power centralizing “in ways that threaten the open and bottom-up governance traditions of the internet.” When critics from across the geopolitical spectrum — from sovereignty advocates to digital rights groups — all sense something amiss, it suggests a fundamental architectural problem that transcends ideology.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s time for a new architecture: one that acknowledges these inversions and builds resistance into its very foundations.</p>

<p>But that’s a longer conversation for another day.</p>

 

<p>Christopher Allen has been architecting trust systems for over 30 years, from co-authoring TLS to establishing self-sovereign identity principles. He currently works on alternative approaches to digital identity through <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/">Blockchain Commons</a>.</p>

  <p>The Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) is a foundation for Dynamic Data Economy structuring and presenting data in a traceable and verifiable way. Recognising today’s need of interoperability between standards, the release of OCA v2, the architecture takes a major leap forward, introducing a modular and extensible approach in the definition of overlays.</p> Community 2.0 <p>The new specification centers around making overlays easier to define, share, and validate — even by non-technical users. At its core, OCA v2 introduces the concept of Community Overlays, empowering ecosystems to create and maintain their own overlay definitions without deep technical barriers. </p><p>We used the term Community (i.e. not ecosystem) to stress the need of creating the flexibility to create specific overlays for a given purposes shared by multiple users. For example, in science this approach helps to define the ultra-precise meaning of certain datasets while keeping them in line with common standards. In compliance, the approach enables the definition of data structures that must match specific regulatory constraints in a given jurisdiction. In supply-chain, the approach enables domain specific definitions of data exchanges to be used across the entire chain without requiring a centralised authority.</p> Definition of Community-Driven Overlay <p>Enabling Community Overlays required a different approach to the way the overlays are defined. Instead of specifying them in the OCA specification, we created a Domain-Specific Language (DSL), which allows us to create overlay definitions, which we called OVERLAYFILE.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/the-human-colossus-foundation/oca-spec/discussions/92">OVERLAYFILE</a> is a text-based file which can consist of one or many definitions of various overlays. If you are familiar with programming, think of it as a *.h (header) file from C++. If you are not familiar with technology, think of it as the exact structure of the dataset your boss, team, department or company validated for use. </p><p>Having clearly defined overlays, the relevant  tooling support any community-defined overlay and simplify the way we manage overlays in the whole ecosystem. When you use it, you have the cryptographic assurance to use what the community has validated for use. </p><p>A new file type, <code>.overlaysfile</code>, allows communities to formally define their own overlays. By separating overlay definitions from usage, ecosystems can establish governance and enable cross-project reusability. <a href="https://github.com/the-human-colossus-foundation/overlays-repository">Overlay repositories</a> further support this, enabling easy distribution and import of overlays.</p> Enhanced Modularity and Validation <p>The new approach allows overlays to define schemas, ensuring proper structure and data integrity. Tooling can now validate authored overlays against community-defined schemas, reducing errors and increasing trust.</p> OCA Bundle in JSON format <p>An <a href="https://oca.colossi.network/specification/#bundle">OCA Bundle</a> is a set of OCA objects serving as envelop for distribution and usage of the semantic. With v2 we finally introduced long waiting new encoding format which replace old .zip file by simple JSON object. This new format was in test since quite some time in reference implementation of OCA and now it is official part of the OCA specification allowing to simplify the tooling and the way how the bundle is transmitted.</p> OCA Specification v2 <p>Finally we release RC1 of <a href="https://oca.colossi.network/specification/">Overlays Capture Architecture Specification v2.0.0</a> which is signal for readiness of mentioned features and functions. The process of implementation already started in our reference implementation which can be followed at <a href="https://github.com/THCLab/oca-rs/tree/v2">oca-rs</a>.</p><p>Below you would find the list of major changes which version 2.0.0 brings:</p>  <p>Sensitive overlay replaces PII's flagging in capture base. This enables an enhanced approach to privacy and other risks flagged directly in the schema</p>  <p>Categories from the Label overlay have move to presentation layer. Thus strictly enforcing the distinction between data inner structure and meaning with data presentation.</p>  <p>Upgrade to “Community Overlays” of certain previously “core overlays”. - all overlays listed below are nominated as community overlays and hosted  in an Overlays Repository.</p>   <p>Information</p>  <p>Transoformation</p>  <p>Presentation</p>  <p>Layout</p>  <p>Conditional</p>  <p>Unit mapping</p>   <p>Introduce SemVer for all objects</p>  <p>Support for 639-1 and 639-3</p>  <p>Support for namespacing in overlay name</p>   OCA2.0 build for stronger, verifiable data integrity <p>All objects of the Overlays Capture Architecture, the Capture Base, Overlays and Bundle are compatible with CESR encoding. This ensures that those objects can be authenticated using <a href="https://dkms.colossi.network/">DKMS</a> a KERI based decentralised key management. </p><p>This is pivotal to establish cryptographically verifiable integrity of data objects. This property enables the implementation of distributed governance models - a topic that will receive much attention at the Human Colossus Foundation</p> Webinar at DSWG <p>The Technology Council, who is responsible for maintaining the OCA specification and reference implementation, hosted a webinar during the Decentralised Semantic Working Group where they delved into the details of the design of the new architecture and all the features of version 2.0.</p>





















  
  



<p>Decentralised Semantic Working Group - Overlays Capture Architecture 2.0</p>


   Looking Ahead <p>With OCA v2, the Overlays Capture Architecture moves closer to its vision of an open, extensible semantic ecosystem where organizations and communities can seamlessly create, validate, and share schemas.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity experts are urging internet users to take immediate steps to secure their online accounts, after largest-ever data leak exposed more than 16 billion login credentials including from major platforms like Google, Facebook, Apple, and even government services.</p>



<p>The breach, discovered by researchers at Cybernews, is believed to have been carried out using infostealers that harvested login data and other sensitive credentials from multiple platforms. “This is not just a leak – it’s a blueprint for mass exploitation,” Cybernews said in a statement. “With over 16 billion login records exposed, cybercriminals now have unprecedented access to personal credentials that can be used for account takeover, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing.”</p>

<p>Look up&nbsp;customer journey or&nbsp;customer experience (aka CX) and you’ll find nothing about what the customer drives, or rides. All results will be for systems meant for herding customers like cattle into a chute that the CX business (no kidding) calls a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sales+funnel">sales funnel</a>:</p>
 <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sales+funnel&amp;ia=images&amp;iax=images"></a><p>Do any customers want to go down these drains?</p> 
<p>But let’s stick with the journey metaphor, because there are good people in the marketing business who have thought deeply about how people buy and own things. Chief among those people is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/estebankolsky/">Estaban Kolsky</a>, of <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/">Constellation Research</a>. He visualizes the journey in a way that not only gives weight to the ownership experience, but separates it from the sales experience :</p>

  

<p>As for our actual experience, we spend 100 percent of our lives with things we own, and just a tiny percentage on buying them. So the real ratio should look more like this:</p>

 
  
 

<p>And yet, as I pointed out several years back in&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2013/07/13/turning-the-customer-journey-into-a-virtuous-cycle/">Turning the Customer Journey Into a Virtuous Cycle</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…consider the curb weight of “solutions” in the world of interactivity between company and customer today. In the BUY loop of the customer journey, we have:</p>
<p>1. All of advertising, which&nbsp;<a href="http://www.magnaglobal.com/">Magna Global</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://news.magnaglobal.com/magna-global/press-releases/advertising-growth-2013.print">expects to pass $.5 trillion, more than a decade ago</a></p>
<p>2. All of CRM/CX, which <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/customer-relationship-management-crm-market-103418">now exceeds $100 billion</a></p>
<p>3. All the rest of marketing, which has too many segments for me to bother looking up</p>
<p>So, in the OWN loop we have a $0 trillion greenfield.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To enter that greenfield, we need customers&nbsp;to be in charge of&nbsp;their&nbsp;side of these&nbsp;relationships— preferably through means for&nbsp;interaction that customers themselves control—on terms that are agreeable to both sides, rather than the one-sided terms we suffer every time we click AGREE on a cookie notice.</p>
<p>To help imagine how that will work, I volunteer a real-world example from my own life.</p>
<p>A few years back, I bought a pair of <a href="http://lamofootwear.com/">LAMO</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://lamofootwear.com/index.php/men/moccasins/men-s-moc.html">Mens Moc</a>s at a shopping mall kiosk in Massachusetts. Here’s one:</p>

  

<p>I like them a lot. They’re very comfortable and warm on winter mornings. In fact I still wear them, even though the soles have long since come apart and fallen off. Here is how they looked after a few years of use:</p>

 
  
 

<p>I’m showing this so you, and LAMO, can see what happens, and how we can both use my experience—and those of other customers—to change the world.</p>
<p>See, I like LAMO, and would love to help the company learn from my experience with one of their products. As of today, there are four choices for that:</p>
 
 Do nothing (that’s the default)

 Get “social” by tweeting to&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2014/04/19/market-intelligence-that-flows-both-ways/LAMOFootwear">@LAMOfootwear</a>&nbsp;or posting to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Lamofootwear/">LAMO’s Facebook page</a>. (For wisdom on “social” relations between brands and presumed fans, see&nbsp;<a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/">Bob Hoffman</a>‘s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adrants.com/2014/04/bob-hoffman-says-marketers-are-drowning.php">talk on the topic</a>.) 
 
<p>So here is a fifth choice: give these moccasins their own virtual cloud, where LAMO and I can share intelligence about whatever we like, starting (on my side) with reports on my own experience, requests for service, or whatever. Phil Windley calls these clouds&nbsp;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pico+phil+windley&amp;ia=web">picos</a>, for&nbsp;persistent compute objects. Picos are breeds of what Bruce Sterling calls <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spime">spime</a>: persistent intelligence for things. Picos have their own operating system (e.g., Wrangler, which Phil most recently posted about <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2016/07/pico_labs_at_open_west.shtml">here</a>), and don’t need intelligence on board. Just scan a QR code, and you’ll get to the pico. Here’s the QR code on one of my LAMO moccasins:</p>

  

<p>Go ahead and scan the code with your phone. You’ll get to a page that says it’s my moccasin.</p>
<p>That’s just one view of a potential relationship between me and Lamo — one in which I can put a message that says “If found, call or text _______.” Another view is on my own dashboard of things in my OWN cycle, and direct connections to every one of those companies. That relationship can rest on friendly terms in which I’m the first party and the company is the second party. (For more on that, see <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2025/04/06/myterms/">here</a> and <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>So look at the relationship between me and Lamo as a conduit (the blue cylinder below) that lives in the pico for my mocassin. That conduit goes from my&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_relationship_management">VRM (vendor relationship management)</a>&nbsp;dashboard to Lamo’s&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management">CRM (customer relationship management)</a>&nbsp;system. There is no limit to the goodness that can pass back and forth between us, including intelligence about how I use my moccasins.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what can happen at either or both ends of that conduit.</p>

 
  
 A pico for a product is a CRM dream come true: a standard way for every copy of every product to have its own unique identity and virtual cloud (in which any data can live), and standard way any customer can report usage and other intelligence about any product they own—without any smarts needing to live on the thing itself.
<p>If I scan that QR code, I can see whatever notes I’ve taken. I can also see whatever LAMO has put in there, with my permission. Also in that cloud is whatever programming has been done on it. Here is one example of simple relationship logic at work:</p>
<p>IF this QR code is scanned, THEN send LAMO a note that Doc has a new entry in our common journal.</p>
<p>Likewise, LAMO can send me a note saying that there is new information in the same journal. Maybe that information is a note telling me that the company has changed sole manufacturers, and that the newest Mens Mocs will be far more durable. Or maybe they’ll send a discount on a new pair. The correct answer for what goes in the common journal (a term I just made up) is: whatever.</p>
<p>Now let’s say LAMO puts a different QR code, or other identifier, in every moccasin it sells. Or has a CRM system that is alert to notifications from customers who have turned their LAMO moccasins into picos, making all those moccasins smart. LAMO can then not only keep up with its customers through CRM-VRM conduits, but tie interactions through those conduits to the dashboards of their accounting systems (from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xero.com/">Xero</a>&nbsp;or other companies that provide enriched views of how the company is interacting with the world).</p>
<p>This is one huge potential key to the future of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service">customer service</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management">customer relationship management (CRM),</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_centre">call centers</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program">loyalty programs</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process">continuous improvement</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience">customer experience (CX)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_engagement">customer engagement (CE)</a>&nbsp;and other complicated ways businesses today try to solve all relationship problems from the maker’s or the seller’s side alone.</p>
<p>Follow the links in the last paragraph (all to Wikipedia), and you’ll find each of them has “multiple issues.” The reason for that is simple: the customer is not involved with any of them. All those entries make the sound of industries talking to themselves — or one hand slapping.</p>
<p>This is an old problem that can only be fixed on the customer’s side. Before the Internet, solving things from the customer’s side — by making the customer the point of integration for her own data, and the decider about what gets done with that data — was impossible. Now that we have the Internet, it’s very possible, but only if we get our heads out of business-as-usual and back into our own lives. This will be good for business as well.</p>
<p>A while back I had meetings with two call center companies, and reviewed this scenario:</p>
 
 A customer scans the QR code on her cable modem, activating its pico. 
 By the logic described above, a message to the call center says “This customer has scanned the QR code on her cable modem.” 
 The call center checks to see if there is an outage in the customer’s area, and — if there is — finds out how soon it will be fixed. 
 The call center sends a message back saying there’s an outage and that it will be fixed within X hours. 
 
<p>In both cases, the call center company sai,d “We want that!” Because they really do&nbsp;want to be fully useful. And — get this —&nbsp;they are programmable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in too many cases, they are programmed to avoid customers or to treat them as templates rather than as individual human beings who might actually be able to provide useful information. This is old-fashioned mass-marketing thinking at work, and it sucks for everybody. It’s especially bad at delivering (literal) on-the-ground market intelligence from customers to companies.</p>
<p>Call centers would rather be sources of real solutions rather than just customer avoidance machines for companies and anger sinks for unhappy customers. The solution I’m talking about here takes care of that. And much more.</p>
<p>Now let’s go back to shoes.</p>
<p>I’m not a hugely brand-loyal kind of guy. I use Canon cameras because I like the long-standing 5D user interface more than the competing Nikon ones, and Canon’s lens prices tend to be lower. I use Apple computers because they’re easy to get fixed and I can open a command line shell and get geeky when I need to. I drive a 2017 VW wagon because I got it at a good price. And I buy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockport_(company)">Rockport</a>&nbsp;shoes because, on the whole, they’re pretty good.</p>
<p>Used to be they were great. That was in the ’70s and early ’80s when Saul and Bruce Katz, the founders, were still in charge. That legacy is still there, under Reebok ownership; but it’s clear that the company is much more of a mass marketing operation than it was back in the early days. Still, in my experience, they’re better than the competition. That’s why I buy their shoes. Rockports are the only shoes I’ve ever loved. And I’ve had many.</p>
<p>So here is a photo I took of wear-and-tear on two pairs of Rockport casual shoes I still use, because they’re damned comfortable:</p>

 
  
 

<p>Shots 1 and 2 are shoes I bought in June 2012, and are no longer sold, near as I can tell. (Wish they were.) Shots 3 and 4 are of shoes called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rockport.com/off-the-coast-2-eye/offthecoast2eye.html?start=31&amp;dwvar_offthecoast2eye_color=offthecoast2eye_navy&amp;cgid=mens-footwear-categories-casual">Off The Coast 2 Eye</a>. I bought mine in late 2013, but didn’t start wearing them a lot until early this year. I bought both at the Rockport store in Burlington Mall, near Boston. I like that store too.</p>
<p>The first pair has developed a hole in the heel and loose eyelet grommets for the laces around the side of the shoe. The hole isn’t a big deal, except that it lets in water. The loose eyelets are only a bother when I cross my feet sitting down: they bite into the other ankle. The separating outer sole of the second pair is a bigger concern, because these shoes are still essentially new, and look new except for that one flaw. A design issue is the leather laces, which need to be double-knotted to keep from coming undone, and even the double-knots come undone as well. That’s a quibble, but perhaps useful for Rockport to know.</p>
<p>I’d like to share these experiences privately with Rockport, and for that process to be easy. Same with my experiences with LAMO moccasins.</p>
<p>It could be private if Rockport and LAMO footwear came with QR codes for every pair’s pico — it’s own cloud. Or if Rockport’s CRM or call center system was programmed to hear pings from my picos.</p>
<p>Ideally, customers would get the pico along with the shoe. Then they would have their own shared journal and message space — the conduit shown above — as well as a programmable system for creating and improving the whole customer-company relationship. They could also get social about their dialogs in their own ways, rather than only within Facebook and Twitter, which are the least private and personal places imaginable.</p>
<p>This kind of intelligence exchange can only become a standard way for companies and customers to learn from each other if the code for picos is open source. If Rockport or LAMO try to “own the customer” by locking her into a closed company-controlled system — the current default for customer service — the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things">Internet of Things</a>&nbsp;will be what Phil calls “<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">the Compuserve of things</a>”. In other words, divided into the same kind of closed and incompatible systems we had before the Net came along.</p>
<p>One big thing that made the Internet succeed was&nbsp;substitutability of services. Cars, banks, and countless other product categories you can name are large and vital because open and well-understood standards and practices at their base have made substitutability possible.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2014/03/substitutability_is_an_indispensable_property_for_the_internet_of_things.shtml">Phil says we can’t have a true Internet of Things without it</a>, and I agree.</p>
<p>The smartest people working for companies are their customers. And the best way to activate customer smarts is&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2015/02/15/a-master-app-to-give-customers-scale/">by giving them scale</a>. That’s what picos do.</p>
<p>As a bonus, they also give companies scale. If we can standardize picos, we’ll have common and standard ways for any customer and any company to relate to each other through any VRM + CRM system. Think about how much more, and better, intelligence a company can get from its customers this way, rather than through the ones barely succeeding now, where the company does all the work, and fails to know an infinitude of useful stuff customers could be telling them. Think about how much more products can be improved, an iterated over time. Think about how much more&nbsp;genuine&nbsp;loyalty can be created and sustained with this kind of two-way system.</p>
<p>Then think how much companies can save by not constantly spying on customers, guessing about what they might want, spamming them with&nbsp;unwanted and unnecessary sales messages, maintaining systems try to relate but actually can’t, and herding customers into imaginary funnels that customers would loathe if they could see what’s going on.</p>
<p>It’s a lot.</p>
<p>So let’s start working on growing a sane world of business that’s based on market intelligence that flows both ways, instead of the surveillance-based guesswork and delusional imaginings of marketing that smokes its own exhaust. We can do it, privately, and at scale.</p>

<p>OpenID Foundation’s <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> and many invited experts have worked extensively on the specification to make it simpler, easier to understand, more secure, and more interoperable. This version has been through&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/12/Formal-Security-Analysis-of-FAPI-2.0_FINAL_2022-10.pdf">formal security analysis</a>&nbsp;by the University of Stuttgart.</p>
<p>Since the FAPI 2.0 implementer’s drafts were published, there have been many editorial changes: new introduction sections, formatting, corrected typos, section renumbering, updated references to sections of this document and other specifications, and added acknowledgments. Details of the updates are summarized, including any impacts on existing FAPI 2.0 implementations, in this March 2025 blog:&nbsp; <a href="https://openid.net/implementers-guide-fapi-2-final-vs-implementers-draft-2/">Implementer’s Guide: FAPI 2.0 Final vs. Implementer’s Draft 2.0</a>.</p>

<p>The approval of these FAPI 2.0 Final Specifications and the launch of the conformance tests and certifications is an important milestone, not only for the OpenID Foundation, but also:</p>
 
 
<p>global open finance/open data ecosystems that have adopted prior versions of FAPI and are transitioning to FAPI 2.0,</p>
 
 
<p>and new ecosystems coming online with plans to adopt FAPI 2.0 final specifications and certifications.</p>
 
 
<p>The OpenID Foundation kindly thanks the FAPI Working Group co-chairs and the many contributors for getting the FAPI 2.0 final specifications successfully across the finish line. It also thanks the certification program team for the development and launch of the conformance tests and certifications.</p>

<p>Microsoft has said that it’s ending support for passwords in its Authenticator app starting August 1, 2025.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s move is part of a much larger shift away from traditional password-based logins. The company said the changes are also meant to streamline autofill within its two-factor authentication (2FA) app, making the experience simpler and more secure.</p>



<p>Over the past few years, Microsoft has been pushing for a passwordless future using technologies like&nbsp;<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/microsoft-sets-passkeys-default-for-new.html">passkeys</a>, Windows Hello, and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2-2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/">FIDO2-based authentication</a>. These methods offer better protection against&nbsp;<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/microsoft-warns-of-large-scale-use-of.html">phishing</a>&nbsp;and password reuse, which are still major attack vectors. While it may feel like a hassle at first, this change is actually aimed at reducing your risk in the long run.</p>

<p>Invitation to comment on OpenDocument Version 1.4 before call for consent as OASIS Standard - ends September 7th</p> 


<p>OASIS Members and other interested parties,</p>



<p>OASIS and the Open Document TC [1] are pleased to announce that Open Document Version 1.4 CS01 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>The OpenDocument Format (ODF) is an open XML-based document file format for office applications to be used for documents containing text, spreadsheets, charts, and graphical elements. The file format makes transformations to other formats simply by leveraging and reusing existing standards wherever possible. As an open standard under the stewardship of OASIS, OpenDocument also creates the possibility for new types of applications and solutions to be developed other than traditional office productivity applications.</p>



<p>The TC received three Statements of Use from Microsoft, Allotropia Software GmbH, and The Document Foundation [3].</p>



<p>The candidate specification and related files are available here:</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is excited to announce a new collaboration agreement with <a href="https://cloudsignatureconsortium.org/">the Cloud Signature Consortium (CSC)</a>, marking a significant step forward in the standardization of digital credentials and cloud based signatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation leads the global community in creating identity standards that are secure, interoperable and privacy-preserving, while the Cloud Signature Consortium builds standards for cloud based digital signatures that support web and mobile applications while complying with demanding electronic signature regulations worldwide.</p>
<p>This partnership brings together two leading organizations to create unified, interoperable standards that will support critical initiatives, like <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home">the EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet) project</a>.</p>
 Strengthening the foundation for digital identity 
<p>As digital identity solutions become increasingly central to both public and private sector operations, the need for cohesive, interoperable standards has become essential for successful implementation.</p>
<p>This collaboration between the OpenID Foundation’s <a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/">Digital Credentials Protocols (DCP) Working Group</a> and the CSC Technical Committee ensures that cloud based digital signatures and credential presentation protocols will work seamlessly together.</p>
<p>The partnership is particularly timely as European governments advance the EUDI Wallet initiative, which requires robust, standardized approaches to digital identity verification and electronic signatures. By aligning technical specifications, a stronger foundation is being created for these next generation identity solutions.</p>
 Avoiding fragmentation, maximizing impact 
<p>Rather than developing competing standards in parallel, both organizations recognized the value of coordinated development. This collaboration will prevent technical duplication while ensuring comprehensive coverage of digital identity use cases, from credential issuance and verification to secure electronic signatures in cloud environments.</p>
<p>“The synergy between OpenID Foundation’s credential presentation protocols and CSC’s cloud signature standards creates powerful possibilities for the digital identity ecosystem,” said Luigi Rizzo, Chair of the CSC Technical Committee. “This partnership ensures that organizations implementing EUDI Wallet and similar initiatives will have access to mature, interoperable standards that work together seamlessly.”</p>
 What this means for the industry 
<p>Both specifications developed through this collaboration will be made freely available for reference in government legislation, regulations, and private sector policies. This open approach supports the shared vision of establishing truly global digital infrastructure that serves users, businesses, and governments alike.</p>
<p>The partnership represents a new model for standards development in the identity space, one that prioritizes interoperability and user experience over organizational boundaries. As the two organisations work together on these critical specifications, they are building the technical foundation for a more connected, secure digital future.</p>
<p>For identity professionals working on digital wallet implementations, credential management systems, or electronic signature solutions, this collaboration signals a maturing ecosystem where standards work together rather than compete. The result will be more robust, interoperable solutions that can scale globally while meeting the most demanding regulatory requirements.</p>
 About the CSC 
<p>The Cloud Signature Consortium is a global group of industry, government, and academic organizations committed to driving standardization of highly secure and compliant digital signatures in the cloud. Inspired by the rigorous requirements of the European Union’s Regulation on Identification and Trust Services (eIDAS), our common technical specification helps ease solution interoperability, streamlines compliance with e-signature regulations, and opens the market for uniform adoption of cloud-based digital signatures around&nbsp; the world.</p>
 About the OpenID Foundation 
<p>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate.

 Briefing Document: India’s Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) 
<p>Date: June 26, 2025<br>
Source: Excerpts from Trust over IP Ecosystems and Governance Working Group Meeting<br>
Presenter: Aakash Guglani from the <a href="https://digitalindiafoundation.org/">Digital India Foundation</a>.<br>
Topic: Enhancing Trust using Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)<br>
Excerpt: India’s Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and Unified Payment Interface (UPI) revolutionize financial inclusion, bringing over 500 million people into the digital economy. This open-source, mobile-first system builds trust and breaks traditional payment monopolies.</p>
 
 Executive Summary 
<p>This briefing document provides an overview of India’s Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), focusing on its development, impact, and future direction as presented by Aakash Guglani from the Digital India Foundation. The DPI, particularly the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Aadhaar, has been instrumental in formalizing India’s economy, empowering its vast and diverse population, and challenging traditional payment monopolies. It represents a unique, policy-driven approach that blends public and private sector participation, aiming for broad inclusivity rather than just serving the affluent.</p>
 I. Core Philosophy and Context 
 
 Addressing India’s Unique Challenges: India’s DPI was developed to address the needs of its “100 million plus” households, representing “500 million people” who were largely deprived and excluded from the burgeoning digital economy. Traditional private platforms primarily targeted the “top 1%,” while public approaches lacked state capacity and risked centralization. (00:07:39, 00:10:50) 
 A “Digital Public Infrastructure” Approach: India adopted a “distro public infrastructure” model, which emphasizes diversity, choice, openness, and sovereignty. It’s a collaborative effort involving both public and private sectors. (00:11:08) 
 Contrast with Other Models: Unlike purely private platforms or a “totally state-led model” like China’s, India’s DPI is designed to be a democratic solution. “We could not go with private platforms, and we never had the state capacity like China to go for a totally state-led model.” (00:09:30, 00:16:40) 
 
 II. Key Components and Their Impact 
 A. Aadhaar: Unique Digital Identity 
 
 Foundation of DPI: Over the last 10 to 15 years, India has established “more than 1.3 billion Aadhaar,” a unique digital identity based on 10 biometrics (fingerprints and iris scan) for “99% of Indians.” (00:11:37, 00:11:50) 
 Enabled EKYC: Aadhaar facilitated “EKYC (Know Your Customer),” drastically reducing the cost of customer acquisition for banks. The cost of KYC dropped from “$25 to $1.” (00:12:02, 00:21:16, 00:21:21) This cost reduction made it economically viable for banks, previously reluctant due to high offline verification costs, to open “zero-cost accounts” for the rural and unbanked population. (00:21:21, 00:21:29) 
 Broad Financial Inclusion: This initiative, known as “JanDhan Yojna,” led to “more than 500 million people [having] bank accounts, which is totally zero cost.” (00:19:53, 00:21:10) 
 
 B. Unified Payments Interface (UPI) 
 
 Solution to Payment Friction: UPI addressed significant problems in India’s financial landscape, including limited digital transactions, high costs for credit card usage, reliance on paper receipts, and lack of “information collateral” for poor individuals seeking credit. (00:15:08, 00:16:56) 
 Massive Adoption and Interoperability: As of March 2025, UPI recorded “more than 18 billion transactions.” (00:18:30) 
 Over 200 banks are integrated, and it’s “totally interoperable.” A payment between a customer from Bank A and a merchant from Bank B takes “less than 10 seconds” via a QR code scan. (00:18:37, 00:18:42, 00:18:54) 
 There is “no MDR (Merchant Discount Rate)” for most transactions, which incentivizes small vendors like vegetable sellers to adopt digital payments. (00:19:04, 00:19:15) 
 “Every part of the country is using UPI,” demonstrating “deeper usage” even in poorer regions. (00:31:47, 00:31:52) 
 Economic Empowerment: For retailers, UPI reduces the “cost of business” by allowing them to “service 3-4 people at a time” without handling cash and change. (00:29:21) 
 It empowered women by ensuring that earnings from their stores went directly to their bank accounts, preventing misuse of physical cash. (00:30:13, 00:30:24) 
 Challenging Global Monopolies: UPI has fundamentally reshaped the global payment landscape. It involves a diverse range of participants including “Visa, Mastercard, Google Pay, Phone Pay, American Express.” (00:33:45, 00:33:50) 
 “It is not dominant by two major players,” effectively “break[ing] monopoly of private players.” (00:33:50, 00:33:58) 
 UPI has “crossed the transaction volumes of Visa and Mastercard combined.” (00:34:14) 
 “46% of real-time payments across the world happen out of India.” (00:34:21) 
 Beyond the “Bottom of the Pyramid”: DPI, including UPI and EKYC, has also benefited the middle and upper-middle classes. The reduced KYC cost facilitated the opening of “more than 190 million DMAT accounts” (online stockbroking accounts) between 2016 and 2024, many for “first-time users.” (00:34:43, 00:35:08, 00:35:14, 00:35:52) This formalizes the economy and encourages savings. 
 
 III. Enablers and Policy Framework 
 
 Government Subsidies: An ongoing annual government subsidy of “$0.2 billion for MDR” (Merchant Discount Rate) for UPI usage is in place. This is viewed as an investment in “public railroad” or “public highway” infrastructure due to its immense “inclusion value.” (00:40:41, 00:40:54, 00:41:09) 
 Agile Policy: The success of DPI is underpinned by “agile policies.” Examples include: 
 The central bank’s allowance for EKYC (2012-2013). (00:45:04) 
 An IT Act making “digital documents equivalent to offline documents” for digital locker services. (00:45:21) 
 The RBI’s Digital Payments Committee recommending UPI. (00:45:49) 
 Government procurement shifting to “totally digitally” platforms using UPI. (00:46:39) 
 Leadership and Trust: The Prime Minister’s public use of UPI and foreign leaders using it in India “enhances trust in people,” creating a “virtuous cycle.” (00:47:01) 
 Mobile-First, Low-Tech, Multilingual: The platforms are designed to be mobile-first, multilingual, and low-tech, supporting feature phones and even “offline availability.” (00:39:31, 00:39:38) 
 Internet Penetration: Government efforts to provide “free internet” increased coverage from 25% to 48%, a “major contributor for UPI.” (00:33:11) 
 Indigenous Development: All platforms are “indigenously made,” addressing specific Indian problems. (00:39:38) 
 
 IV. Future Directions and Challenges 
 
 Next Stage: Credit Enablement: With 500 million bank accounts and 1.2 billion digital identities, the focus shifts to empowering users by providing credit. (00:36:00, 00:36:26) 
 Account Aggregator: A framework allowing individuals to consent to share their financial data between banks, mutual funds, insurance providers, etc., using the EKYC framework, to facilitate consumer and business loans. (00:36:41, 00:36:53) 
 Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN): This leverages the transaction data from informal vendors (e.g., vegetable sellers) who now have “information collateral” on their transaction frequency and average ticket size, making it “easier for banks to also financialize them.” (00:37:29, 00:37:35, 00:37:49) This moves DPI beyond just a base to “formalize the economy.” (00:37:49) 
 Global Export of DPI: India aims to share its open-source DPI frameworks, including UPI APIs on GitHub, “freely to anyone around the world.” This includes cross-border payment solutions and sharing its vaccination system. (00:38:16, 00:38:34, 00:38:42) 
 Future Open Data Platforms: The “India Stack was the beginning,” with future initiatives including digital commerce, online financial information sharing, online credit availability, digitization of health records, AI-based voice, and digital skills. (00:38:54, 00:39:04) 
 Tech Sovereignty: India advocates for “tech sovereignty” to avoid reliance on foreign private entities that could “cut off my access” due to geopolitical tensions, as seen in the Russia-Ukraine war. The aim is to prevent private companies from engaging in “geopolitical positioning.” (00:48:14, 00:49:06, 00:49:32, 00:49:45) 
 Fraud and Cybersecurity: With massive scale, the system faces “more than a million cyberattacks” annually, including those from state and non-state actors. (00:51:38, 00:51:49, 00:51:53) 
 Common frauds include “digital arrest” scams using AI-based voice to demand UPI transfers. (00:53:00, 00:53:07) 
 RBI is implementing measures like mandating brokers to use “authenticated UPI IDs,” displaying the recipient’s name before transfer, and nudging users not to pay while on a call. (00:55:54, 00:56:03, 00:56:10) 
 The direct debit nature of UPI makes reversing fraudulent transactions difficult once money is transferred. (00:54:47) 
 Ongoing efforts include public advisories and potential future escrow services. (00:53:23, 00:57:00) 
 
 V. Conclusion 
<p>India’s DPI journey, marked by the success of Aadhaar and UPI, demonstrates a powerful model for digital inclusion and economic formalization in a democratic context. By leveraging agile policy-making, strategic government investment, and open-source technology, India has built a robust digital public good that empowers its citizens and offers significant lessons for the Global South. The ongoing challenge lies in mitigating fraud and expanding the system to foster greater financial empowerment through credit, while maintaining technological sovereignty.</p>

 OIDF leads critical discussion on digital identity futures 
<p></p>
<p>IGF 2025 explores pathways for developing and least developed countries to achieve inclusive digital transformation</p>
<p>At the recent<a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/en/dashboard/igf-2025"> Internet Governance Forum (IGF) 2025 in Lillestrøm</a>, a pivotal conversation about one of the most pressing challenges facing developing and least developed countries (DLDCs) took place – <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2025-ws-290-sovereignty-and-interoperable-digital-identity-in-dldcs">how can digital identity interoperability be balanced with national sovereignty?</a></p>
<p>Co-hosted by<a href="https://www.aficta.africa/"> AfICTA</a>, <a href="https://sidi-hub.community/">the Sustainable and Interoperable Digital Identity (SIDI) Hub</a>, <a href="https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/foreign/">the Norwegian Tax Agency</a> and the <a href="https://www.digdir.no/digdir/about-norwegian-digitalisation-agency/887">Norwegian Digitalization Agency,</a> the workshop brought together policymakers, technical experts, and civil society actors from across Africa, Asia, and Europe to unpack what sovereignty truly means today, and how digital identity systems can be designed to respect it.</p>
<p>Through both moderating and contributing to this discussion, the OpenID Foundation demonstrated its dedication to advancing inclusive digital identity solutions globally.</p>
 From global principles to regional practice 
<p>The workshop was moderated by Gail Hodges, Executive Director of the OpenID Foundation and Co-Organizer of the SIDI Hub. She opened with an emphasis on the critical need for digital identity systems that enable cross border functionality, while reinforcing national autonomy over data, infrastructure, and policies.</p>
<p>Complementing this role, Naohiro Fujie, Chair of<a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/"> OpenID Foundation Japan</a>, provided substantial technical insights from Japan’s experience with <a href="https://openid.net/oidf-oidf-j-welcome-the-japanese-digital-agency-west-japan-railway-company-and-the-national-institute-of-informatics-student-vc-project/">cross border educational credentials</a> using open standards like<a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/"> OID4VCI/VP</a>. He also commented on Japan’s recent enablement of My Number Card with Apple ID in Wallet, Japan’s bilateral relationships with the European Union and Asian countries to advance interoperability across borders. Fujie-san’s contributions demonstrated how Japan’s approach to knowledge transfer, implementations with standards, and bilateral relationships can offer replicable models for African nations seeking to implement interoperable digital identity systems as well.</p>
<p>Similarly, Tor Alvik, Subject Director for Digital from the Norwegian government, elaborated on the learnings from both the Nordic and the Baltic countries participating in the Nobid alliance for cross border digital identity, and the practical challenges faced as early adopters of digital identity. Their pragmatic regional approach and learnings could also be of value to African peers seeking to accomplish similar objectives.</p>
 Digital identity as the foundation for inclusion 
<p>The session reinforced several fundamental principles that emerged from the expert panel discussions:</p>
 Digital identity serves as the gateway to inclusion 
<p>Without recognized digital identities, individuals remain digitally invisible and economically marginalized, unable to access essential services, including banking, education, healthcare, and mobility. Countries implementing early enrolment strategies, such as Nigeria’s National Identification Number (NIN) issuance at birth, demonstrate how to establish robust citizen registries that ensure long term inclusion and help bridge Africa’s digital divide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Successes in digital identity are not evenly distributed across countries or regions, so sharing best practices from leading countries, leading regions, and leading multi-stakeholder projects like Nigeria and the Sustainable and Interoperable Digital Identity (SIDI) Hub, can help close the gaps to benefit all jurisdictions and their residents.</p>
 Cross border interoperability is essential for regional economic integration 
<p>Interoperability of digital identity within a country, region or globally is not inevitable. It will require consistent, concentrated effort by stakeholders within jurisdictions and across jurisdictions to realize sustainable, and scalable outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to reach its full potential, seamless identity verification across borders must facilitate the free movement of people, goods, and services. Digital identity systems, therefore, need to be embedded within AfCFTA’s digital trade protocols, with successful national models providing blueprints for regional scaling. Learnings can be gleaned from within Africa like the ECOWAS project, as well as from outside Africa like the Nordic and the Baltic states Nobid project, the EU Digital Identity Wallet, and Japan’s bilateral relationships.&nbsp;</p>
 National sovereignty must be preserved within interoperable frameworks 
<p>Countries require strong data protection laws, robust trust frameworks, and regulatory alignment to maintain control over their citizens’ data. This balance demands sustained political will, institutional commitment, and tailored support that recognizes varying levels of digital readiness across African countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Efforts like SIDI Hub can help jurisdictions identify, and easily close, gaps in their policies compared to global best practices. Through careful and consistent approaches to policy and technology stacks, all jurisdictions, including those in Africa, can meet their domestic sovereignty goals, and their ambitions for pan-African and global trade.&nbsp;</p>
 Regional models and global lessons 
<p>The workshop highlighted successful implementations across different regions:</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.aficta.africa/about-us/aficta-board/100-dr-jimson-olufuye-profile">Dr. Jimson Olufuye of AfICTA</a> emphasized Africa’s strategic role in shaping the<a href="https://www.un.org/digital-emerging-technologies/global-digital-compact"> UN Global Digital Compact</a>, noting how principles of sovereignty and inclusiveness must be central to digital identity deployment under the AfCFTA framework.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amessinoukossi/">Dr. Kossi Amessinou from Benin’s Ministry of Economy and Finance</a> presented the ‘C’est Moi’ initiative, a government issued identity card offered free to citizens, as a concrete example of nationally led innovation that serves both policy objectives and inclusion goals while maintaining interoperability within the<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=ECOWAS%20region&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;ghc=1&amp;lq=0&amp;pq=ecowas%20region&amp;sc=12-13&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=BEDC9DDA939A4A238C2C9A01D855E5B9"> ECOWAS</a> region.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://nimc.gov.ng/nimc-management/director-general">Abisoye Coker-Adusote, Director General of Nigeria’s NIMC</a>, detailed the country’s integrated NIN ecosystem and its push toward digital ID interoperability at national, regional, and global levels, highlighting the importance of initiatives like the SIDI Hub’s trust framework mapping efforts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tor-alvik/">Tor Alvik Subject Director from Norway’s Agency for Public Management and eGovernment</a> contributed Nordic perspectives, sharing lessons from regional digital identity cooperation across the Baltics and Scandinavia. This included successful trust based models that maintain legal independence, while enabling shared infrastructure collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
 The SIDI Hub’s global impact 
<p><a href="https://sidi-hub.community/team/">Debora Comparin from the Secure Identity Alliance</a> outlined the SIDI Hub’s mission to co-develop sustainable, open, and interoperable digital ID solutions in collaboration with over 45 countries. The Hub’s work on<a href="https://sidi-hub.community/publications/#Topical%20reports"> use cases</a>, including refugee identification, digital education credentials, and opening a bank account, demonstrates how practical implementations can span continents, while embedding sovereignty by design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debora highlighted the work delivered to date (published at <a href="http://sidi-hub.community">here</a>) and the plan ahead, including a reference architecture to deliver digital identity interoperability for the African Cup/ Olympics ‘champion use case’, and a tool for scaling digital identity trust framework mapping.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Actionable pathways forward 
<p>The workshop identified concrete steps for accelerating progress:</p>
 
 Regional interoperability pilots could be encouraged between states with advanced systems, such as Nigeria and neighbouring countries, to provide practical insights into cross border functionality and identify implementation gaps. All panelists saw the value of a bias to concrete action like this by countries and regions.&nbsp; 
 National policies and implementations that leverage international standards will be on a fasttrack to enable domestic, regional and global interoperability while respecting sovereignty, trust framework mapping and compatibility with regional and global identity protocols. 
 Trust framework mapping within jurisdictions, and across regions and globally, is vital for cross border movement of people and trade. The efforts by SIDI Hub to study 10 jurisdictions’ trust frameworks and map them into shared values and characteristics can help not only align existing digital identity implementations, but the next wave of jurisdictions to map their own policies, identify gaps, and remediate those gaps with insights into current best practices. 
 Public and private collaboration, combined with citizen education campaigns, will build trust and demonstrate real world value through practical applications, like transportation discounts, healthcare access, and financial services. 
 
 Sustaining momentum through standards leadership 
<p>The session concluded with strong support for continuing SIDI Hub’s work, particularly in advancing open standards, reference architecture to enable interoperability, mapping trust frameworks, and multi-stakeholder engagement. The OpenID Foundation’s involvement, both as a convening force and technical contributor, demonstrates how standards organizations can drive meaningful progress in global digital identity adoption and interoperability.</p>
<p>As digital identity systems become foundational infrastructure for cross border trade, education, and financial inclusion, the collaborative approach demonstrated at IGF 2025 provides a blueprint for ensuring that interoperability and sovereignty work hand in hand. With appropriate standards, governance, and partnerships, developing and least developed countries can shape digital identity systems that are both globally connected and locally controlled.</p>
<p>Plans are afoot to continue the work between SIDI Hub and our Norwegian, Japanese and African partners&nbsp; to identify ways in which we might jointly address friction points in progress towards the introduction of an African Free Trade Area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workshop’s outcomes will inform ongoing policy and technical implementation across Africa and beyond, with the OpenID Foundation continuing to play a crucial role in facilitating the standards development and international cooperation necessary for inclusive digital transformation.</p>

  <p>We’re excited to announce that Human Colossus Foundation (HCF) will participate in <a href="https://globaldigitalcollaboration.org/">GC25: Global Digital Collaboration on Wallets &amp; Credentials</a>, taking place on July 2, 2025. This important event, hosted by the Swiss Confederation, brings together leading organizations and innovators to shape the future of digital wallets, credentials, and interoperable identity systems.</p><p>At HCF, we believe that empowering individuals to control their own digital space is foundational to building a sustainable and trustworthy digital society. This vision is captured in our ongoing work around the concept of the Digital Self, as discussed in our blog post <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/digital-self-part-1">Self Actioning System, a preferred systematic embodiment of “Digital Self”</a>. Central to this idea is the belief that enabling global digital collaboration can only emerge when individuals have sovereignty over their credentials and interactions.</p> HCF on Governance in Digital Trade <p>As part of GC25, HCF will also participate in the panel discussion "Governance in Digital Trade – Decentralization as Response to Challenges in a Multi-Polar World." moderated by Stephan Wolf from the Verifiable.Trade Foundation and including the Digital Governance Institute, FIWARE, and the Asia PKI Consortium, we will bring forward the necessity of a digital governance able to consider the sovreignty of peer-to-peer connections in a multi-polar world. </p><p>The world is changing rapidly, placing supply chains and financial systems under increasing pressure. In a multi-polar landscape shaped by shifting tariffs and transformative AI, flexibility and speed have become essential. Digitalisation and open networks provide a clear path to inclusive global market participation. However, governance remains a largely overlooked but crucial topic.</p><p>This session will explore current initiatives but also deal with challenging questions. By examining these questions from different perspectives, the panel aims to bridge public and private demand to address the complexities of modern global trade.</p><p>HCF will contribute its perspective on how decentralized governance models, such as those enabled by the Dynamic Data Economy, can empower organizations and individuals alike.</p> Digital Self: Enabling Individual Agency <p>The Digital Self represents a shift from centralized data control to individual empowerment, allowing each person to define, manage, and protect their digital identity and data assets. Events like GC25 are critical because they convene diverse stakeholders to co-create frameworks and standards that make this shift possible — from verifiable credentials to interoperable wallets.</p> Introducing the Dynamic Data Economy <p>HCF is contributing to this discussion through the introduction of the Dynamic Data Economy (DDE), a groundbreaking approach outlined in our <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/dde-launch">launch announcement</a>. The DDE offers an infrastructure where data is not merely a static asset but a dynamic, contextual element that individuals can control and share on their terms.</p><p>This model supports privacy, promotes innovation, and opens the door to new economic models centered around consent and transparency — all essential ingredients for a human-centric digital future.</p> Looking Ahead <p>Our participation in GC25 aligns with our mission to advance data governance standards that prioritize individual autonomy. By collaborating with global leaders at this event, we aim to further the conversation on building infrastructures that respect and reinforce the Digital Self.</p><p>We invite all who share this vision to join us in exploring how we can collectively build a more equitable, dynamic, and user-controlled digital ecosystem.</p>





















  
  






  <p>Stay tuned for more updates from GC25 and beyond!</p>

<p>Apple this week provided a glimpse into a feature that solves one of the biggest drawbacks of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, the industry-wide standard for website and app authentication that isn’t susceptible to credential phishing and other attacks targeting passwords.</p>



<p>The import/export feature, which Apple&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/279/?time=1152">demonstrated</a>&nbsp;at this week’s Worldwide Developers Conference, will be available in the next major releases of iOS, macOS, iPadOS, and visionOS. It aims to solve one of the biggest shortcomings of passkeys as they have existed to date. Passkeys created on one operating system or credential manager are largely bound to those environments. A passkey created on a Mac, for instance, can sync easily enough with other Apple devices connected to the same iCloud account. Transferring them to a Windows device or even a dedicated credential manager installed on the same Apple device has been impossible.</p>

<p>These USB or NFC keys offer something beyond the usual passwordless methods, like synced device&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/passkey-passkey-authentication">passkeys</a>&nbsp;or biometric logins. Here, you’re not relying on cloud-stored credentials or browser memory. Instead, everything depends on holding the key and verifying it with something only you know, like a PIN or fingerprint.</p>



<p>This shift to hardware security keys is gaining momentum across industries. Dashlane, for instance, has just rolled out an update that enables users to make a FIDO2 key their main passwordless login for unlocking credential vaults.</p>

<p>For modern IT or Internet users, logging in to a website or app using a password is all too familiar. Increasingly, however, passwords create security concerns as they can be easily cracked or stolen. This is where passwordless authentication provides a more secure and convenient alternative.</p>



<p>“Password fatigue is real. Users demand faster, frictionless ways to authenticate without remembering complex strings,” said Edwardcher Monreal, Principal Solutions Architect for IAM Consumer Authentication Solutions at HID.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Matariki is a time for remembrance, celebration, and looking toward the future. Traditionally, Matariki was a time to honour ancestors, celebrate the harvest, and acknowledge the changing seasons.</p>



<p>Today, we stand at a pivotal moment where two transformative technologies – digital identity and artificial intelligence – are reshaping the fabric of society.&nbsp; As the marginal cost of knowledge approaches zero, decentralised systems offer abundance creation through co-operation, as opposed to sticking with a more traditional scarcity-based approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For DINZ members, the adoption playbook demands conscious choices: about focus, trade-offs, standards, and sovereignty. As local momentum builds around the world’s first decentralised credential identity ecosystem, the question is no longer whether disruption will occur – but how we collectively shape it, and who it serves. Perhaps Moby put it best in his 2002 song&nbsp;<a href="https://genius.com/Moby-we-are-all-made-of-stars-lyrics">“We are all made of stars.”</a></p>



<p>It is hard to believe we are still using multi-password sign-on and facsimiles of identity proofs in an era where nearly everything we do is online. For those frustrated by the pace of change, it is important to remember we’re building a system for 30 years, of which the past five years has been very much design and build. The next five years will be about driving adoption.</p>



<p>With a tsunami of digital credentials hitting global markets, the race to be “first to issue” DISTF accredited credentials is on!&nbsp; At the starting line are the DIA,<a href="https://nzta.govt.nz/about-us/app/">&nbsp;NZTA</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anthony-kemp-1823a833_digitalidentity-decentralizedid-airnewzealand-activity-7331960356912721920-xYEI?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAHxKLgBrtQdrwLhAiLxm2nGUcgL8XDyPu4">&nbsp;Air NZ</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/helen-littlewood-18b76b62_kiwiaccesscard-activity-7338074511315038209-Qhav?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAHxKLgBrtQdrwLhAiLxm2nGUcgL8XDyPu4">&nbsp;Hospitality NZ</a>, alongside other go-to-market models such as&nbsp;<a href="https://mattr.global/article/the-future-of-identity-is-interoperable-and-apple-just-stepped-in">Apple and Google’s online proxies.</a></p>



<p>Techweek Highlights</p>



<p>Those fortunate enough to attend&nbsp;<a href="https://techweek.co.nz/news/digital-public-infrastructure-the-invisible-foundation-for-new-zealands-digital-future">Digital Public Infrastructure: The Invisible Foundation for NZ’s Digital Future</a>&nbsp;in the General Assembly room in Parliament would have heard Minister Collins deliver the powerful message that “digital identity is the key to unlocking productivity in New Zealand.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Minister’s call to action was compelling, raising the question of whether centralised apps are the answer for a citizen-centric experience at this particular technology inflection point still open for debate.</p>



<p>It is encouraging to see a shared understanding that the implementation of<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202504/new-zealand-issues-tender-for-digital-id-services-accreditation-infrastructure">&nbsp;digital public infrastructure</a>&nbsp;(DPI) will provide New Zealanders with an inclusive,<a href="https://unifysolutions.net/news/the-future-is-verifiable-rethinking-digital-identity-connected-nation/">&nbsp;future-ready trust layer</a>&nbsp;that enhances privacy, security, provenance and fraud prevention, while preserving Aotearoa’s economic sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, an interoperable<a href="https://mattr.global/article/the-benefits-of-decentralised-identity-for-your-organisation">&nbsp;decentralised identity ecosystem</a>&nbsp;will support the profound productivity improvements presented by hyperscale AI, without diminishing human agency by moving our data (and your soul) into someone else’s “cloud”.</p>



<p>Digital Trust Hui Taumata – Update<br><br>We have secured the world’s foremost native digital credential architect and builder James Monaghan to deliver the international keynote and host roundtable discussions at the Digital Trust Hui at Te Papa on 12 August, 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>This must-attend identity conference promises to be more “Doey” than Hui. Our valued sponsors will showcase the most exciting identity projects in this space, and show how accelerating adoption of Trust Technology can help mitigate concerns around AI-related risks.<br><br>Roundtable discussions are currently being shaped around four key focus areas:</p>



 
 Regulatory barriers to change&nbsp;(public policy enablers such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/document/00HOHPBReferenceStOrdersChapter5BOmnibus1">omnibus bills&nbsp;</a>to allow digital identity implementation) 



 Identity for natural persons&nbsp;(early adopters,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/security/you-should-delete-yourself-from-the-internet-heres-how/news-story/aaddd6bb8374152247203b1458458c5f?utm_campaign=EditorialSB&amp;utm_source=News.com.au&amp;utm_medium=Facebook&amp;utm_content=SocialBakers&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawLFQT9leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHhjdy-TUhX0DC7lSiHs3IXrY4CP77IWszd6KqdY3jfxmyNbrbaOY3OR3KS4p_aem_lJxDBqBiG">Privacy and taking control,</a>&nbsp;proof of age, everyday applications, online verification, ID assurance hierarchy) 



 Identity for legal entities&nbsp;(identity as a service, AML, license to operate, compliance, monitoring, directory enabled and real world asset marketplaces) 



 Identity for machines&nbsp;(delegation, reputation, agents, bots, agentic commerce) 
 



<p></p>



<p>Assuming sufficient interest from government and industry sponsors, we plan to arrange an ecosystem design workshop with James Monaghan while he is in Wellington.</p>



<p>The Census Goes Digital: A Shift Towards Data-Driven Public Infrastructure</p>



<p>Stats NZ has officially retired the traditional census, opting instead for a new approach that leverages integrated administrative data. This marks a significant shift in how the government collects and uses trusted digital information – reinforcing the need for secure, privacy-preserving identity systems to ensure accuracy, inclusion, and transparency. It’s a timely reminder of the critical role digital identity plays in building smarter, citizen-centric public services.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/in-depth/564560/the-traditional-census-has-been-switched-off-what-happens-now">Read the full RNZ article</a>.</p>



<p>Welcome to Our New Chair – Maria Robertson</p>



<p>Please join me in welcoming&nbsp;Maria Robertson as the new Chair of DINZ. You can read her introductory statement to the DINZ community&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2025/06/24/introductory-statement-chair-of-the-executive-council-digital-identity-nz/">on our website.</a></p>



<p>As we reset the DINZ playbook and hone our focus to accelerate adoption, Maria has already started to elevate our thinking thanks to her extensive experience across the public service, infrastructure and secondary industries.</p>



<p>Suffice to say, the first few weeks have been a baptism by fire, but I’m&nbsp;thoroughly enjoying being back in the identity services world at such a pivotal time. Your feedback is encouraged as we strive to fan the flames of adoption by issuers, holders and relying parties for the empowerment of all New Zealanders.</p>

<p>With a background in executive leadership across public service and advisory roles I have advocated for and delivered the transformative potential of digital identity as public infrastructure. Whether enabling seamless access to services, supporting mobility and consent, or underlining trust in our digital economy, identity – in all of its forms – is foundational to a modern, resilient society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DINZ plays a crucial convening role across government, iwi, industry, and civil society. As Chair, my focus is to champion practical progress: supporting policy and technical frameworks that uphold te ao Māori perspectives on identity, ensuring identity solutions reflect the needs of all New Zealanders, and advocating for interoperability that positions us as globally connected and locally grounded.</p>



<p>Our mission is urgent and clear: to enable every person in Aotearoa to participate safely and confidently in the digital world. I look forward to working with all our members to realise that vision.</p>

<p>In a world where AI can create photos, videos, and even voices that look and sound&nbsp;real, how do we know what to trust?</p>
<p>Every day, more content we see online is generated or altered by AI. That’s not always a bad thing. AI can help us create amazing art, get work done faster, or imagine new possibilities. But it also opens the door to misinformation, impersonation, and confusion. When anyone can create content that looks authentic, how do we tell what’s&nbsp;actually&nbsp;real?</p>
<p>To enhance human trust in AI systems and explore how AI itself can be used to address complex trust challenges in digital ecosystems, Trust over IP (ToIP), a project of LF Foundation Decentralized Trust, has launched a new&nbsp;<a href="https://lf-toip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/pages/22982892/AI+Human+Trust+Working+Group">AI and Human Trust (AIM) Working Group</a>. It builds on the work done over the past three years by ToIP’s AIM task force.</p>
<p>The recently released white paper from the working group,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/insights">ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP): Strengthening Trust in Human and AI Interactions</a>, offers a way forward for building, maintaining and verifying interactions involving AI technologies. It brings together three powerful tools, the&nbsp;Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP)1, the C2PA Specification2, and the work of the&nbsp;Creator Assertion Working Group (CAWG)3,&nbsp;to build a system of&nbsp;authenticity&nbsp;for the digital world.</p>
<p>The key components include:</p>
 
 TSP (Trust Spanning Protocol)&nbsp;provides a strong foundation for&nbsp;online&nbsp;trust&nbsp;between people, platforms, and tools—making sure that when something claims to come from someone, it actually does. (The “Connector”) 
 The&nbsp;C2PA Specification&nbsp;is a growing standard that helps attach a digital “nutrition label” to content—showing when it was made, how it was edited, and by what capture devices or software. (The “How” and the “What”) 
 CAWG (Creator Assertion Working Group at DIF)&nbsp;focuses on making sure that individual and organizational content creators can identify themselves with their content and provide additional information for their audience to understand their content. (The “Who”) 
 
<p>Why do we need all three? Because content authenticity isn’t just about how something is created. It’s also about who made it, and how it gets communicated through public networks while retaining the integrity of actions made to it. C2PA gives us technical metadata about tools and edits. CAWG ensures the&nbsp;human&nbsp;creator is identified and attributed. And TSP makes the entire chain, from camera or AI tool to multiple individual human collaborators to final distribution platform,&nbsp;trustworthy at every step. Together, they provide a complete system covering creation, collaboration, and distribution.</p>
<p>All put together, these can help us answer the most important question about this digital artifact:&nbsp;Can I trust this?</p>
<p>This isn’t just a technical fix. It’s a new way to think about digital truth. And the paper lays out a path toward a future where users can more confidently trust the source and actions made to digital content in a way that’s accountable, verifiable, and respectful of creators.</p>

So it’s serious stuff.</p>
 
 Here’s one graphic from the piece, with its caption: 
 
 
 
 <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/research/envisioning-recommendations-on-an-llm-based-agent-platform/"></a><p>Illustration of the Rec4Agentverse. The left side depicts three roles in the RecAgentverse: the user, the Agent Recommender, and Item Agents, along with their interconnected relationships. In contrast to traditional recommender systems, the Rec4Agentverse has more intimate relationships among the three roles. For instance, there are multi-round interactions between 1) users and Item Agents and 2) the Agent Recommender and Item Agents. The right side demonstrates how the Agent Recommender can collaborate with Item Agents to affect the information flow of users and offer personalized information services.</p> 
 
 
 With VRM, however, we need our own personal AI agents, and useful data that’s not limited to what’s gathered by surveillance (which we can assume is most if not all of the Information layer). 
 
 So I started a conversation with ChatGPT. I’ll divide it into sections: 
 
 Who wrote the CACM piece 
 The state of recommendation science 
 Who is working on personal AI 
 How one can get started 
 Forms of personal data to manage 
 
<p>There’s a lot here. The meat of it, for ProjectVRM purposes, starts in section 3. (The first two are more about what we’re up against.) Please read the whole thing and help us think through where to go with the challenge facing us. As we see in section 3, we do have&nbsp;some stuff on our side.</p>
 1. Who wrote the CACM piece 
 
 Me: 
 
 Can you tell me more about the authors here: https://cacm.acm.org/research/envisioning-recommendations-on-an-llm-based-agent-platform/? 
 
 ChatGPT: 
<blockquote>
 
 &nbsp;Jizhi Zhang 
 
<p>Affiliation: University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Data Science Lab (inferred from USTC page)&nbsp;<a href="https://data-science.ustc.edu.cn/_upload/tpl/15/04/5380/template5380/publication/cacm-zjz.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cacm.acm.org+14data-science.ustc.edu.cn+14x.com+14</a>.<br>
Research Interests: Recommendation systems, LLM-based agent platforms, and interactive intelligent systems—his lead authorship and continued work on Prospect Personalized Recommendation on LLM-Based Agent Platform&nbsp;(arXiv Feb 2024) reinforce this&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18240?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>.</p>

 &nbsp;Wanhong Xu 
 
<p>Affiliation: USTC Data Science Lab (USTC LDS), contributor to the same article&nbsp;.<br>
Role: Emerging researcher whose latest publication is this Rec4Agentverse article, indicating an early-career focus in LLM-based recommender systems&nbsp;<a href="https://data-science.ustc.edu.cn/_upload/tpl/15/04/5380/template5380/publication/cacm-zjz.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">linkedin.com+8data-science.ustc.edu.cn+8linkedin.com+8</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
  Broader Context &amp; Contributions 
 
<p>The group operates at the intersection of&nbsp;Large Language Models, agent-oriented systems, and recommender systems, pioneering a&nbsp;Rec4Agentverse paradigm&nbsp;that treats LLM-powered agents as “recommendable” items collaborating with one another—an evolution of traditional recommendation frameworks<a href="https://cacm.acm.org/research/envisioning-recommendations-on-an-llm-based-agent-platform/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cacm.acm.org+5cacm.acm.org+5cacm.acm.org+5</a>.<br>
Their work continues earlier research (e.g.,&nbsp;Prospect Personalized Recommendation…&nbsp;in Feb 2024), solidifying their ongoing commitment to expanding intelligent, conversational recommendation platforms&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18240?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
  Why This Matters 
 
<p>Academic Thought Leadership: Jizhi Zhang and colleagues are pushing forward thinking about how recommendations can evolve when&nbsp;agents—not passive items—are central.<br>
Institutional Backing: All deeply connected to&nbsp;USTC’s Data Science Lab, underscoring strong Chinese academic investment in AI-driven recommender innovation.<br>
Collaborative Reach: Including scholars like Tat‑Seng Chua broadens the research to include international perspectives in multimedia and retrieval systems.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>In summary: This team is a multidisciplinary cohort—centered at USTC with international collaboration—who are pioneering the idea that&nbsp;LLM agents can become interactive, dynamic items in recommender systems. Their work positions them at the forefront of intelligent agent systems and could reshape how platforms personalize experiences in the future.</p>
 
 
<p>If you’re curious about any individual’s past publications, citation impact, or related work (e.g., on Agent4Rec), I’d be happy to dive deeper!</p>

<p>3. The state of recommendation science</p>
<p>Me:</p>
<p>How large is the emerging science, within the AI field, of recommendations?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
 
<blockquote>
 
<p>The&nbsp;science of recommendations, particularly within the AI field, is not just&nbsp;emerging—it’s a&nbsp;massive, rapidly evolving subfield&nbsp;that is both academically rich and commercially dominant. That said, it’s also entering a&nbsp;new phase, driven by the rise of&nbsp;large language models (LLMs),&nbsp;interactive agents, and&nbsp;multimodal platforms.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
  Academic Scope 
 
 
 1.&nbsp;Established Field: Recommender Systems 
 
<p>Recommender systems (RecSys) are a well-developed domain within AI and machine learning, with roots in the&nbsp;1990s.<br>
Annual conferences like:<br>
ACM RecSys&nbsp;(since 2007)<br>
SIGIR,&nbsp;KDD,&nbsp;WSDM, and&nbsp;NeurIPS&nbsp;regularly feature recommendation research.<br>
Thousands of papers annually on topics like:<br>
Collaborative filtering<br>
Matrix/tensor factorization<br>
Deep learning for recommendation<br>
Fairness, transparency, and explainability in RecSys<br>
Reinforcement learning and bandit algorithms for personalization</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p> As of 2024, over&nbsp;60,000 papers&nbsp;in academic databases (e.g., Google Scholar) are tagged or indexed under “recommender systems”.</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
 
 
 
  Current Trends &amp; Expanding Frontiers 
 
 
 2.&nbsp;LLMs + Recommendation = New Subfield 
 
<p>A&nbsp;major shift&nbsp;is underway: integrating&nbsp;Large Language Models (LLMs)&nbsp;into recommendation systems.<br>
These go beyond “you may also like” to:<br>
Use&nbsp;natural language context&nbsp;and dialogue<br>
Generate&nbsp;explanations, not just rankings<br>
Support&nbsp;conversational recommendation<br>
Coordinate&nbsp;agent ecosystems, e.g., multi-agent reasoning environments</p>
 
<p>Example paradigms:</p>
 
<p>RecMind&nbsp;– reasoning-aware recommendation agents<br>
Rec4Agentverse&nbsp;– treating agents as recommendable entities<br>
ChatRecs&nbsp;– integrating LLMs into live user conversations</p>
 
 
 
 
 3.&nbsp;Multimodal &amp; Multitask Integration 
 
<p>Systems increasingly blend&nbsp;text, image, video, behavior, and&nbsp;user feedback.<br>
LLMs allow richer personalization using&nbsp;complex user intent&nbsp;derived from unstructured data.</p>
 
 
 
 
 4.&nbsp;Industry Investment 
 
<p>FAANG companies (especially YouTube, Netflix, Amazon, TikTok, and Spotify) base their core user experience on&nbsp;AI-driven recommendation.<br>
Billions of dollars are spent optimizing:<br>
Ranking quality<br>
Engagement prediction<br>
Real-time inference<br>
Federated and privacy-preserving personalization</p>
 
 
 
 
  Estimate of Scope 
 
<p>Area</p></blockquote>

  In Summary 
 
 
<p>The&nbsp;science of recommendation&nbsp;is:</p>
 
<p>Not new, but rapidly&nbsp;evolving<br>
Core to AI applications, especially with LLMs and agents<br>
One of the most commercially and socially impactful domains&nbsp;in modern AI<br>
Growing into new subfields&nbsp;(e.g. Rec4Agentverse, LLM Rec, multi-agent Rec)</p>
 
<p>Let me know if you’d like a visual map of how the recommendation science ecosystem is structured—or who the top authors and institutions are in this space</p>

 3. Who is working on personal AI 
 
 Me: 
 
 And who, if anyone, is working to provide customers with their own personal AI tools: ones that work for them, to empower their own agency in the marketplace? By which I mean truly personal AI, and not the kind personalized by some external LLM (or similar) system. 
 
 ChatGPT: 
<blockquote>
 
<p>That’s an essential and forward-looking question—especially as most “AI for you” today really means&nbsp;“AI about you, for someone else.”</p>
 
 
<p>While Big Tech firms dominate&nbsp;personalized AI, a growing ecosystem is focused on&nbsp;truly personal AI—that is,&nbsp;AI you own, that&nbsp;works&nbsp;for you&nbsp;(not advertisers or platforms), and that&nbsp;enhances your agency&nbsp;in the marketplace and your life.</p>
 
 
<p>Here are the most notable&nbsp;people, projects, and initiatives&nbsp;advancing&nbsp;truly personal AI&nbsp;today:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
  1.&nbsp;Kwaai and pAI-OS&nbsp;(South Africa / Global) 
 
<p>Kwaai&nbsp;is building an open-source, user-sovereign personal AI OS called&nbsp;pAI-OS.<br>
Designed to&nbsp;run locally or at user discretion, with full&nbsp;data ownership,&nbsp;modular agent systems, and&nbsp;plugin capability.<br>
Aligns with&nbsp;IEEE P7012 (“MyTerms”)&nbsp;privacy standards (see below).<br>
Actively exploring&nbsp;intentcasting,&nbsp;customer signaling, and&nbsp;VRM&nbsp;(Vendor Relationship Management).<br>
Site:&nbsp;<a href="https://kwaai.ai/">https://kwaai.ai</a></p>
 
 
 
 
  2.&nbsp;Indie AI and Personal Agent projects 
 
 
<p>Several smaller open-source initiatives are trying to build&nbsp;personal agent toolkits&nbsp;that you can host and configure:</p>
 
 
 Examples: 
 
<p>AutoGen Studio (Microsoft)&nbsp;– allows building agent workflows, some of which can be user-defined.&nbsp;But it’s not yet fully personal or private.<br>
Langroid&nbsp;– open-source framework for local agent-based LLM systems. Designed for extensibility, can be made personal with effort.<br>
OpenDevin,&nbsp;Superagent,&nbsp;Auto-GPT&nbsp;– can be self-hosted, though most are still tool-centric rather than user-centric.<br>
Personal.ai&nbsp;– A commercial startup that&nbsp;says&nbsp;it is personal, but uses centralized storage and fine-tuning, so actual user control is limited.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;Reality check: Most of these still rely on external LLMs (like OpenAI or Anthropic), even if they&nbsp;claim&nbsp;to be “your AI”.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
  3.&nbsp;Solid Project&nbsp;(by Tim Berners-Lee) 
 
<p>While not AI per se,&nbsp;Solid&nbsp;is a&nbsp;decentralized identity and data storage architecture&nbsp;that allows individuals to store their own data in&nbsp;personal data pods.<br>
AI tools can be layered on top to access only the data you choose to share.<br>
Foundation for&nbsp;personal AI assistants&nbsp;that can work&nbsp;with your data, not on others’ clouds.<br>
<a href="https://solidproject.org/">https://solidproject.org</a></p>
 
 
 
 
  4.&nbsp;IEEE P7012 – MyTerms 
 
<p>A standard being developed to&nbsp;flip the notice-and-consent regime—so individuals, not companies, dictate the terms of data use.<br>
Backed by&nbsp;Customer Commons&nbsp;and designed to support&nbsp;intentcasting&nbsp;and&nbsp;personal marketplace signaling.<br>
This enables&nbsp;a personal AI to serve as your agent, enforcing your terms and engaging the marketplace on your behalf.</p>
 
 
 
 
  5.&nbsp;Project VRM&nbsp;(Vendor Relationship Management) 
 
<p>Initiated by&nbsp;<a href="https://projectvrm.org/">Doc Searls</a>&nbsp;to empower&nbsp;customers with tools to manage vendors, not just the reverse.<br>
Envisions&nbsp;personal tools (including AI)&nbsp;to:<br>
Signal intent<br>
Manage service contracts<br>
Retain records of offers, purchases, warranties<br>
Avoid manipulation, surveillance, and lock-in</p>
 
<p>Project VRM is not a software project per se, but a&nbsp;framework&nbsp;guiding developers to build personal tools that support individual autonomy.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
  6.&nbsp;Open-source LLM stacks for local use 
 
 
<p>Several local LLM projects can be&nbsp;combined with personal data layers&nbsp;to build truly personal AI:</p>
 
<p>LM Studio&nbsp;– runs local models on desktop<br>
PrivateGPT&nbsp;– local inference + local documents<br>
Ollama&nbsp;– macOS-native interface for fast-running models like LLaMA, Mistral<br>
LangChain / LlamaIndex&nbsp;– frameworks for building RAG systems with local documents</p>
 
<p>These aren’t personal AI&nbsp;systems&nbsp;yet—but they are&nbsp;key ingredients.</p>

  The Gap 
 
 
<p>Despite this promising landscape,&nbsp;no major platform today delivers a fully integrated, easy-to-use personal AI&nbsp;that you own, configure, and direct—yet. But:</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
<p>A personal AI revolution is underway, led by privacy advocates, open-source communities, and a few visionary developers—not Big Tech.</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>Would you like help putting together a DIY stack for your own personal AI toolkit based on this landscape?</p>
 
</blockquote>
 Me: 
 
 Can you name some of the people in the personal AI revolution, and tell me what that DIY stack would contain? 
 
 ChatGPT:

Seamless&nbsp;data portability&nbsp;and contract enforcement (IEEE P7012 is working on it)<br>
Trusted&nbsp;personal AI app ecosystem&nbsp;(some apps, like Beeper or Obsidian, are getting close)</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Would you like a tailored recommendation for building a personal AI stack based on your technical skill level or use cases (e.g., journaling, research, negotiation, shopping, data querying)?</p>
 
</blockquote>
 
 
 4. How can I get started?  
 
 Me: 
 
 Yes. My technical skill level is modest at best. I can write HTML and do very basic stuff in the command line. I have an extra laptop I can devote to solo work, and Ethernet to a 2.1GB/s symmetrical fiber connection to the Internet with no data limits. 
 
 
 ChatGPT: 
<blockquote>
 
 
<p>Great — with your setup (modest technical skills, spare laptop, blazing-fast fiber), you’re in an excellent position to begin building a&nbsp;practical personal AI system&nbsp;without diving too deep into complex dev work. Here’s a recommended stack tailored to&nbsp;your current skills and goals:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  YOUR PERSONAL AI STARTER STACK (2025) 
 
 
 
 
  1.&nbsp;Platform Base 
 
 
 
 
<p>Use a&nbsp;Linux distribution&nbsp;designed for ease of use and AI tinkering:</p>
 
 
<p>Recommended:&nbsp;<a>Pop!_OS</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu 24.04<br>
</a>Easy GUI, good hardware compatibility, lots of online support<br>
Optional: Use your laptop in&nbsp;“air-gapped” mode&nbsp;for privacy and full local control</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  2.&nbsp;Run a Local LLM with LM Studio 
 
 
<p><a href="https://lmstudio.ai/">LM Studio</a>&nbsp;(macOS/Windows/Linux) lets you&nbsp;run LLaMA 3,&nbsp;Mistral,&nbsp;Phi-3, and others&nbsp;without coding.<br>
Built-in UI — chat with models locally, no internet required after download.<br>
You can download 7B or 13B models based on your hardware.<br>
Best for: private journaling, summarizing files, answering questions.</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;Why it’s ideal for you:</p>
 
 
<p>GUI-based<br>
Just click and download models<br>
No API keys or command-line needed once installed</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  3.&nbsp;Chat with Your Files (PrivateGPT / LlamaIndex) 
 
 
<p>PrivateGPT&nbsp;or&nbsp;GPTPilot&nbsp;can let you ask questions across PDFs, emails, and notes stored on your machine.<br>
Start simple: drop files into a folder, let the AI index them.<br>
Optionally install via Docker&nbsp;(one command), or use their prebuilt apps.</p>
 
 
<p> Use case:</p>
 
 
<p>“Summarize this research PDF”<br>
“What did I write about project X last month?”<br>
“Find the email where someone mentioned a refund”</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  4.&nbsp;Knowledge Base + Journaling with Obsidian 
 
 
<p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>&nbsp;= Markdown-based knowledge base.<br>
Everything you write stays local.<br>
You can point LM Studio to your notes to&nbsp;query your own memory.</p>
 
 
<p> Easy way to:</p>
 
 
<p>Keep private journals<br>
Index your life<br>
Ask your AI things like “What are my goals for June?”</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  5.&nbsp;Personal Data Management with Datasette 
 
 
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>&nbsp;by Simon Willison lets you&nbsp;browse and query your own data&nbsp;with simple SQL and CSV files.<br>
Feeds AI with structured personal info (purchases, inventory, plans, etc.)<br>
You can install it with a single terminal command:<br>
bash<br>
CopyEdit<br>
<code>pip install datasette datasette serve your-data.db<br>
</code><code>datasette serve your-data.db</code></p>
 
 
<p> Combine with LM Studio to get responses like:</p>
 
 
<p>“What subscriptions do I need to cancel?”<br>
“When did I last back up my photos?”</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  6.&nbsp;Optional: Browser Helper Agent (Local, Simple) 
 
 
<p>Use&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT">AutoBrowser</a>&nbsp;or a simpler Puppeteer script to&nbsp;automate browsing tasks&nbsp;(like checking prices, news, account activity).<br>
Start with prebuilt scripts. No coding needed if you copy/paste working examples.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  7.&nbsp;Privacy Boosters 
 
 
<p>Run&nbsp;Tailscale&nbsp;or&nbsp;WireGuard&nbsp;to access your AI remotely if needed.<br>
Use&nbsp;LocalAI&nbsp;or&nbsp;Ollama&nbsp;if you later want to run everything without GUI (more advanced).</p>

</blockquote>
 
 
 
 5. Forms of personal data to manage 
 
 Me: 
 
 The personal data I need to manage are health records (from 20-plus providers), financial records (fewer than health), travel records (including the kind kept by apps that watch my movements), subscriptions and other recurring payments, shows I have watched and on what channels or services (data gathered by my Samsung and Roku TVs and presumably shared with others but to which I don’t yet have access), continuing work and work history with various clients and employers, contacts, archival and current calendars, real estate, personal items bought or acquired from various sources and where they are kept or stored, and business dealings. What would be the file structure for all that, and how would I manage it? Note that I am not talking about shopping yet; that’s a separate concern. 
 
 ChatGPT: 
 
<p>Thanks for the detailed breakdown — you’re describing the foundation of a&nbsp;true personal data architecture: structured, queryable, and under your control. Let’s build you a&nbsp;file structure and management strategy&nbsp;that matches your needs&nbsp;without overcomplicating the tech.</p>
 
  Recommended Top-Level Folder Structure 
<p>This folder structure is designed to be&nbsp;future-proof,&nbsp;machine-readable, and&nbsp;human-usable. Use&nbsp;plain folders,&nbsp;CSV/JSON/Markdown files, and optional&nbsp;SQLite databases&nbsp;to store structured data. You can later layer tools (like LLMs or Datasette) on top.</p>

  Strategy for Managing It All 
 1.&nbsp;Use Consistent File Types 
 
 



Data Type
File Format




Structured entries
<code>.csv</code>,&nbsp;<code>.json</code>,&nbsp;<code>.sqlite</code>


Notes or logs
<code>.md</code>&nbsp;(markdown)


Documents
<code>.pdf</code>,&nbsp;<code>.docx</code>,&nbsp;<code>.txt</code>


Images/attachments
store in&nbsp;<code>attachments/</code>&nbsp;subfolder per topic



 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.&nbsp;Naming Conventions (Machine + Human Friendly) 
<p>Use ISO-like formats to make things sortable and parseable:</p>
 
 yaml 
 
 
 CopyEdit 
 
 
 <code>2024-06-16_labresults_providerX.csv<br>
2023_Q4_taxes_federal.pdf<br>
clientA_2022-11_contract.pdf</code> 
 
 
 3.&nbsp;Data Capture Tools 
<p>You don’t need to build it all manually:</p>
 
 
<p>Use&nbsp;Obsidian&nbsp;for ongoing notes (e.g. travel journal, work logs)</p>
 
 
<p>Use&nbsp;Paperless-ngx&nbsp;(optional) to OCR and tag your scanned PDFs (health, finance)</p>
 
 
<p>Use&nbsp;GPS History Export&nbsp;from Google and Apple for travel/locations</p>
 
 
<p>Use&nbsp;email filters or Zapier&nbsp;to auto-download bills, statements, confirmations</p>
 
 
 
 4.&nbsp;Querying and Reviewing 
<p>Add one or more of these later:</p>
 
 
<p>Datasette&nbsp;→ browse and search CSVs/SQLite locally</p>
 
 
<p>LM Studio&nbsp;+ PrivateGPT → ask, “When did I last visit Dr. Chen?” or “What devices are in storage?”</p>
 
 
<p>LlamaIndex&nbsp;→ index your file tree and let AI search/summarize it</p>
 
 
 
  Summary of Benefits 
 
 



Goal
This Setup Delivers




Total local control
You decide access, storage, retention


Future AI-readiness
Structured enough for agents to use


Easy to back up
Plain files, portable databases


Modular growth
Start simple, layer in AI when ready



 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Would you like me to generate a starter template with folder structure and some CSV/Markdown file formats filled in with mock data for each domain? That way you can load it directly into your system and start customizing.</p>
 
 
<p>Me again:</p>
<p>That’s it for now.</p>
 
 What should my next request be, or what other direction would you like me (or us) to take this? 
 
 
 Or, what are the learnings we have so far in this field that barely exists? 
 
 Oh, and excuse whatever inaccuracies ChatGPT may have floated above. Or give me fixes. 
 
 Thanks.

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, June 18, 2025 –&nbsp;A shared commitment to community and service led to a meaningful partnership between Edge, a nonprofit organization that recently transitioned to a fully virtual workforce, and MENTOR Newark, a local organization dedicated to supporting youth through mentoring and empowerment programs.</p>
<p>When Edge found itself with available office space, it began the search for a subtenant. A mutual business contact introduced Edge’s Executive Director of Human Resources and Administration, Amy Olavarria, to Thomas Owens, Executive Director of MENTOR Newark. Olavarria elaborates, “We had been working with a realtor to sublease the space but couldn’t find a good match, until we were introduced to Thomas and learned about his organization’s mission and their need for a new headquarters,” said Olavarria. “I’ve met several of the young adults in the program, and they’re all so mature, motivated, and well-mannered. It’s inspiring to see, and MENTOR Newark is truly an incredible organization.”</p>
<p>Previously located in a lower-level space in the same building, MENTOR Newark had involved its students in renovating their former office, so the move came with some uncertainty. “Our students were deeply involved in creating the previous space, so I wasn’t sure how they would connect with the new one,” admitted Owens. “But when they walked in, they immediately saw the possibilities and were genuinely excited. They appreciated the new amenities, including the kitchen, private bathrooms, and most importantly, their own dedicated area called the Student Office.”</p>
<p>That sense of ownership was on full display during an open house in April 2025, where community members gathered to tour the space and meet the young leaders of MENTOR Newark. “People were moved, and saw the students taking responsibility for the space, engaging with guests, and leading parts of the event,” shares Owens. “There was dancing, laughter, and a strong sense of pride. When people learned it all came together through a partnership between two nonprofits, it left a lasting impression.”</p>
<p>For Edge, the partnership with MENTOR Newark was a natural extension of its mission and community commitment. “Edge is honored to have Thomas and his organization in this space,” adds Olavarria. “Even though MENTOR Newark and Edge are two nonprofits in different industries, we share a common goal: to help and serve the people in our communities and beyond. Working with MENTOR Newark is perfectly aligned with Edge’s brand promise of CONNECTED. COMMITTED. COMMUNITY. I attended their grand opening, and the atmosphere was one of home, community, and acceptance—regardless of age or background. It was a powerful feeling of unity and peace.”</p>

<p>v1.1 of the 3 specifications includes one powerful new moving part</p> <p>As CAWG activity picks up steam at DIF, there are a few details the rest of DIF and the broader community of decentralizers might want to be tracking: </p>  The specification includes a powerful new indirection called an Identity Aggregator, which designates an external authority to translate a long-lived identifier embedded in signed credentials (at time of publication) to one or more identifiers with local significance anywhere an asset is used (at time of republication or consumption).  Industry-specific identifier schemes are being researched by a distinct task force within the group for prototyping and getting adoption in media verticals.  Registering/organizing external metadata standards and DID interop are on-going discussions.   Wait, what Working Group is this? <p>If you're following from a distance, you have a vague sense that CAWG is a DIF working group doing something-something C2PA. If that distance is a long distance, you might know C2PA is a big-name, media-authenticity initiative with many mega-corporations signed on. The reality is actually more decentralized than meets the eye: CAWG is specifying open-world extension points that use Verifiable Credentials to let all kinds of claims and all kinds of actors embed metadata and rights declarations in C2PA documents, not just the big boys. </p><p>As the name would imply, "creators" is a capacious term which includes influencers, independents, rights-holders unions, creative agencies, freelancers, and even anonymous social media microcelebrities alike. The extension points and interoperability mechanisms this group is working on bring verifiability at various scales at once, and to various kinds of ecosystems and markets. The "Assertions" that these creators are inserting into signed C2PA manifests embedded in professional media assets are the open-world extension point that let C2PA manifests contain arbitrary metadata (treated in a separate specification being iterated by the group), arbitrary trust signals, and arbitrary attached credentials. </p> Enter the Aggregator <p>The Identity Claims Aggregator (often referred to as "aggregator" in the group) names a piece of software (which can be internal or external to an authoring tool) that tracks multiple identifiers enabling verifiable credentials (issued against them) to be inserted meaningfully. It also witnesses proofs of (and later attests to) control of many kinds of external identifiers, and generally organizes the chaos of the world's many overlapping identifier schemes and attestation formats. To the outside observer, this might seem a very complicated translation mechanism, but to the decentralized identity veteran, this is a familiar necessity. Every verifiable credential scheme eventually needs this kind of translator/aggregator role, if it is to be an open system or even if it is "only" going to federate across the tech stacks of multiple existing systems. </p>Taken from section 8.1.1.2 of the v1.1 Identity Assertion specification<p>The conversation so far in the working group has been working its way from the general to the concrete: do aggregators only aggregate identifiers and information sources known at the time of authoring/inserting, or can an aggregator add on new attestations at a later time? Must aggregators limit themselves to public identifiers, or can they use an internal/aggregator-specific one? Can an aggregator host a live API for post-facto information to be passed out-of-band, like additional credentials or updated credentials? How tightly, if at all, should this group specify such an API, if so? These are the high-level questions being debated on the back-burner of CAWG meetings this summer.</p> The Aggregator-Indirection Question <p>Zooming in a little more, there are further questions being tackled. Aggregators model a great happy-path solution for embedding declarations and strong identifications into each asset, but what about the many unhappy paths? For example, what if a creator’s assertions are scattered across many identifiers and credential types, and embedding those assertions requires all kinds translations and metadata to be legible? What if identifiers change, or new assertions become relevant after publishing– can “placeholder” or indirection identifiers be used to query data sources that continue receiving assertions after publication? Can an indirection or service be used to display more or less assertions depending on audience, or changeable-over-time consent policies? Can assertions and identities be “self-custodied”? What is the “account recovery” story for these increasingly complex use-cases?</p><p>While adding the aggregator was the biggest change in v1.1, it will be a long while until the exact scope and limits of this role are decided. It may well be that some advanced features get postponed to a later stage in the roadmap, because of the sheer complexity they entail, but it will definitely be an ongoing topic simmering in the background whenever smaller debates come up.</p> Separate Work Stream: Industry-Specific Identifiers <p>In parallel, a subgroup is meeting separately to research and sanity-check the integration of major media-industry identifier schemes and metadata schemes, looking for interop corner-cases and relevant prior art.<br><br>Interested parties are encouraged to pop into the subgroup's github issues and meetings if they are working on (or just curious about, or experienced with) industry associations and media archiving best practices. The usual IP caveats apply: if joining a live call as a non-DIF member or commenting on github issues, refrain from going into concrete detail on anything "patentable" like implementation details or solutions.</p> Other Big Questions between V1.1 and v2.0 <p>These advanced features of the aggregator aren’t the only big questions that we can expect to simmer and percolate across the next few "minor versions". Additionally, the interop issues around existing metadata standards (not just major W3C standards, but real-world ones from industry and library sciences) are potentially inexhaustible, as the group's Metadata specification gives scaffolding for inserting any structured metadata into assertions.</p><p>A slightly less vast but still very open-ended interoperability question is which DID methods to recommend or even require of all implementers, and how to manage or triage the remainder of the list of possible current (and future!) DID methods. Intersecting with the ongoing work of the DID Method Standardization Working Group, and older efforts like DID Traits to define equivalence or translatability between DID methods with similar architectures, semantics and guarantees, there is something of a simmering backlog-debate about which forms of DID make how much sense for the CAWG use-cases.</p><p>Of course, the evaluation of DID methods for these tiered-accreditation and decentralized reputation use-cases necessarily includes more than just technical analysis; legal and business readiness factor in as well, including competitiveness and market health/structure considerations to keep media authenticity from being a perk in closed ecosystems. Luckily, the new co-chair Scott Perry brings much experience and open lines of dialogue with multiple working groups at the Trust-over-IP Foundation which work on exactly these aspects of DID technology and business processes. In particular, agentic identity is a topic that ToIP generally, and Scott specifically, are bringing into the scope of the WG, so keep an eye out for issues and PRs along those lines in the coming months as well.</p>

 A values-based list of barriers faced by 14–19 year olds in the&nbsp;UK <p>In this post, we continuing to share outputs from a project we’re working with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/responsible-innovation-centre?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Responsible Innovation Centre for Public Media Futures</a> (RIC), hosted by the BBC. We’ve already published:</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-does-ai-literacy-look-like-for-young-people-aged-14-19-8b4d798eb369">What does AI Literacy look like for young people aged 14–19?</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-makes-for-a-good-ai-literacy-framework-423c57f01e9a">What makes for a good AI Literacy framework?</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/core-values-for-ai-literacy-0dfb0ce5145f">Core Values for AI Literacy</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/ai-literacy-or-ai-literacies-52d3c58f8b7e">AI Literacy or AI Literacies?</a>  Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>This project has involved both desk research and input from experts in the form of a survey, individual interviews, and a roundtable which we hosted a couple of weeks ago. One area we wanted to ensure we understood were gaps in existing provision around AI Literacies for young people.</p><p>The gaps we identified were focused on the 14–19 age range in the UK, with a long list of areas with many themes. We have organised and summarised these around the core values identified in a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/core-values-for-ai-literacy-0dfb0ce5145f">previous post</a>.</p><p>The gaps reflect a pattern seen across education, media, and wider society: provision is uneven. It is often shaped by short-term thinking and competing interests. Overall, it is limited by a lack of clear leadership or coordination.</p><p>Unfortunately, many interventions around AI Literacies are focused on technical skills or compliance. These do not connect with young people’s real interests or lived experiences, nor do they address the deeper ethical, social, and cultural questions raised by AI.</p><p>As a result of this, many learners — especially those already facing disadvantage — are left with fragmented support and few opportunities to develop genuine agency or critical judgement.</p> Human Agency and Informed Participation   Lack of systemic, rights-based frameworks: There is little structured provision to help young people shape, question, or influence AI, with most education focused on adapting to technology rather than encouraging agency or clarifying institutional responsibilities.  Dominance of industry narratives: Commercial interests and tech industry funding often drive the agenda, narrowing the conversation and limiting opportunities for young people to challenge prevailing narratives or understand the political dimensions of AI.  Insufficient progression and curriculum integration: There is no standardised, dynamic curriculum or progression framework for AI Literacies, especially for post-16 learners, and limited integration across subjects beyond computing or digital studies.  Teacher confidence and support gaps: Many teachers lack confidence, training, and adaptable resources to support the development of AI Literacies, resulting in inconsistent, sometimes contradictory, messaging and limited support for critical engagement.  Disconnect between knowledge and action: Awareness of AI bias, manipulation, or power structures does not reliably translate into agency or behavioural change, with motivation and broader social context often overlooked.   Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion   Persistent digital and social divides: Access to tools and resources to develop AI Literacies is highly unequal, shaped by school policies, family resources, and broader digital divides, with privileged students often able to bypass restrictions.  Lack of cultural and global adaptation: Most resources are developed in the global north and do not reflect the needs or realities of diverse cultural, socioeconomic, or linguistic backgrounds, including those from in the global south.  Barriers for marginalised groups: AI tools and resources can disadvantage non-native English speakers, students with disabilities, and those with limited digital access, reinforcing existing inequalities.  Neglect of visual and multimodal literacy: There is insufficient focus on images, deepfakes, and multimodal content, despite their growing importance for misinformation and manipulation.  Resource design and authenticity: Overly polished, anthropomorphised, or inaccessible resources can alienate young people; there is a need to co-design authentic, relatable, and context-driven materials that reflect lived experiences with young people from a range of background   Creativity, Participation, and Lifelong&nbsp;Learning   Short-termism and lack of sustainability: Funding and interventions are often short-lived, with little focus on long-term, joined-up strategies or progression frameworks.  Imbalance between creativity and consumption: Most young people are consumers, not creators, of AI content; there is insufficient emphasis on participatory, creative, and hands-on engagement with AI.  Restrictive and risk-averse policies: Overly strict barriers on access to AI tools in schools can limit meaningful learning opportunities and create anxiety or underground use.  Missed opportunities for experiential and peer learning: There is underuse of hands-on, constructionist, and peer-led approaches, which are effective for this age group and for a rapidly evolving field like AI.  Failure to address entrenched digital habits: Many interventions come too late to shift established digital habits; young people may have high digital skill but lack guidance on purposeful, critical, or participatory use.   Critical Thinking and Responsible Use   Overemphasis on technical skills: Current provision is skewed towards prompt engineering and functional tool use, with insufficient attention to understanding different kinds of AI, ethical reasoning, systemic impacts, and critical engagement.  Insufficient ethical, environmental, and societal focus: Real-world harms, environmental costs, and the broader impact of AI are rarely discussed, leaving gaps in understanding responsible use.  Media and information literacy gaps: Algorithmic and data literacy gaps: Young people struggle to understand how data shapes AI outputs, how to assess real versus fake (including deepfakes), and how to evaluate, challenge or seek redress for algorithmic decisions or AI-generated content.  Anthropomorphism and mental models: Many young people, particularly younger teens, misattribute human-like qualities to AI, affecting their critical judgement and ability to interrogate outputs.  Lack of robust assessment and evidence: There is a shortage of baseline data on AI literacy levels and limited frameworks for evaluating the effectiveness and impact of interventions, especially in terms of behavioural change.   Upholding Human Rights and Wellbeing   Disconnection from youth interests and lived experience: AI Literacy resources often fail to connect to young people’s real interests (creativity, sports, mental health), focusing instead on employability or compliance.  Socio-emotional and privacy risks: Young people may use AI for companionship or advice, sharing sensitive information without understanding privacy or data risks; frameworks rarely address identity, trust, or changing markers of adulthood.  Confusion and inconsistency in terminology: There is no consensus on what “AI literacy” means, and inconsistent definitions can intimidate learners or place excessive responsibility on individuals.  Unclear responsibility and leadership: It remains unclear who should lead on the development of AI Literacies. Schools, parents, government, industry, and third sector bodies all have a role to play, but the current situation leads to fragmented provision and a lack of accountability.  Neglect of digital relationships and boundaries: The role of AI as an “invisible third party” in relationships, and the shifting boundaries of privacy and identity, are rarely addressed in current resources.   Next up <p>We’re still finalising our framework for AI Literacies and will be sharing it soon.

<p>At <a href="https://globaldigitalcollaboration.org/">Global Digital Collaboration</a> on July 2nd, a full day of sessions co-curated by DIDAS and partners will address how privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) and trustworthy governance models can become core enablers of digital trust across sectors and jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The day begins with a&nbsp;high-level update session&nbsp;featuring SPRIND, Google, EPFL, Johannes Kepler University, and others. It will explore the current maturity, post-quantum readiness, and practical deployment of PETs such as BBS+, SD-JWT, and ZK-mDoc. The session aims to establish shared terminology and frameworks for unlinkability and selective disclosure across global credential ecosystems.</p>
<p>In parallel, the&nbsp;e-democracy workshop series&nbsp;(Part 1 &amp; 2), led by the Center for Digital Trust (C4DT) at EPFL, DIDAS, the Human Colossus Foundation, and other civil society actors, will explore how digital services like e-ID and e-collecting e-voting and related challenges which must be redesigned for resilience to protect public trust, prevent fraud, and ensure accountability. The sessions aim to define foundational principles for a trustworthy digital democracy, co-created by experts in law, governance, cryptography, and policy.</p>
<p>Running alongside, a&nbsp;collaborative mapping session&nbsp;by Johannes Kepler University, Orange, Ethereum researchers, DIDAS, EUDI and other Global Ecosystems and pilot teams are invited to identify and classify global use cases where PETs-particularly zero-knowledge proofs-are essential. The session will help align performance and privacy requirements across deployment contexts, feeding into implementation roadmaps and standards discussions.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a&nbsp;deep dive on unlinkability&nbsp;will be led by experts from Google, SPRIND, EPFL and the Linux Foundation’s decentralized trust initiatives. This session will focus on the risks of issuer–relying party collusion in credential ecosystems, and why unlinkability is non-negotiable for use cases like transport and location-sensitive infrastructure.</p>
<p>Later, a technically grounded session titled&nbsp;“ZKProofs: From Crypto Potential to Regulatory Acceptance”&nbsp;will bring together Google, ETSI, and NIST to map out viable ZKP schemes, their mobile-readiness, and interoperability features. The goal is to bridge the gap between cryptographic innovation and institutional trust, and to align stakeholders around a roadmap for responsible, cross-border adoption and acceptance.</p>
<p>The day concludes with a&nbsp;multi-stakeholder roundtable&nbsp;moderated by DIDAS with invitees from the ITU, the OpenWallet Foundation, LF Decentralized Trust, OECD, UNHCR the Swiss confederation, the EU Commission and other country delegates and potential funding partners to explore long-term collaboration structures. This final session will address how to sustain PET development through ongoing working groups, interoperable governance, and shared funding models.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://groups.oasis-open.org/communities/tc-community-home2?CommunityKey=67afe552-0921-49b7-9a85-018dc7d3ef1d">OASIS XACML</a> Technical Committee (TC) is currently engaged in an effort to produce a successor to XACML version 3.0, and we’re looking for input from the community. The goals of this new version(s) are:</p>



 
 To modernize the language to make it more accessible to a wider audience, 



 To add new features to extend the expressibility of the language and support new use cases, and 



 To simplify the language where possible. 
 



<p>The headline change is the decision to abstract the core language to remove its dependence on XML and XML Schema, i.e., to make it syntax-agnostic. This will facilitate the use of other syntaxes for representing the core language. The TC has decided to define representations for at least JSON and YAML, while continuing to support XML. To reflect this expanded scope and modernized approach, the effort is being referred to as “XACML Next Gen” rather than “XACML 4.0.”</p>



<p>The XACML TC intends that implementations will be able to claim conformance with the core language by implementing one or any combination of the possible syntaxes. XML will not be required.</p>



<p>There is a strong desire in the XACML TC to find a new name for the core language to show that it is no longer tied to XML. Various suggestions are on the table, but there is no clear frontrunner at this time. The new name should lend itself to distinct acronyms for each supported syntax for simple identification. Regardless of the new name and version number for the core language, there is consensus in the TC that the XML representation of the core language will be known as XACML 4.0 in recognition of its antecedent. So the moniker “XACML 4.0” will reference only part of the TC’s eventual outputs.</p>



<p>The major structural change to the core language is the merging of PolicySet and Policy into a single construct that will carry the name “Policy.” A new Policy may contain embedded policies, policy references, rules, and variable definitions. This change removes some duplication from the core language where essentially the same thing was defined under separate names for both policy sets and policies, for example, PolicySetId and PolicyId. There is now only PolicyId. There are no longer separate policy combining algorithms and rule combining algorithms, just combining algorithms.</p>



 Current Changes In Progress 



 



 1.  Support for JSON and YAML Policies 



<p>One of the most anticipated updates in XACML Next Gen is the addition of JSON and YAML as alternative policy representation formats. While XACML has traditionally been based on XML, these new formats aim to:</p>



 
 Simplify policy authoring by providing more concise and readable structures. 



 Improve integration with modern applications that rely on JSON-based APIs. 



 Reduce verbosity compared to XML, making policies easier to maintain. 



 Improve readability and auditability by allowing the substitution of many URIs with short string names using standardized and user-defined vocabularies.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Implications for Policy Writers:</p>



 
 Policies can now be expressed in JSON or YAML, reducing the learning curve for those unfamiliar with XML. 



 JSON and YAML formats align with modern infrastructure-as-code practices, allowing policies to be managed like other configuration files. 
 



 



 2.  Simplified and More Efficient Policy Structure 



<p>To make policies easier to write and maintain, XACML Next Gen is introducing:</p>



 A. Flattened Policy Hierarchy 



 
 The distinction between Policy and PolicySet is being removed, creating a single structure that can contain both rules and sub-policies. 



 This means fewer elements to track and simplifies how policies are nested and combined. 
 



 B. Common Structure for Obligations and Advice 



 
 The structure of an obligation or advice instance is practically the same, except for naming. Obligation and Advice will be replaced by a common Notice structure with the semantic differences indicated by a boolean flag. 



 Likewise, for the various structures related to obligations and advice. 
 



 C. Targets Revised 



 
 Targets in policies have been changed to Boolean expressions, giving them the same expressive power and flexibility as Conditions in rules. 



 Targets have been removed from rules; a Condition is sufficient. 
 



 D. Decluttering 



 
 CombinedDecision, ReturnPolicyIdList, and MustBePresent have been given sensible defaults so that they can usually be omitted, reducing clutter. 
 



<p>E. Global Variables for Reusability</p>



 
 Variables will be defined globally and reusable across multiple policies, reducing redundancy and improving clarity. 



 Policy writers will be able to import global variables without having to redefine them within each policy. 
 



 F. Composite Functions for Simpler Expressions 



 
 Policy authors will be able to define custom functions that can be reused across multiple rules, reducing repetition. 



 Example: Instead of repeating the same logical expression in multiple places, writers can define it once and reference it when needed. 
 



 



 3.  Improved Policy Efficiency 



 A. Optimized Rule Evaluation 



 
 New ternary conditional functions (similar to a ? b : c in programming languages) allow policy writers to define logic more concisely. 
 



 B. Aggregate Functions for Policy Simplification 



 
 XACML Next Gen will introduce functions like min, max, sum, and average, enabling policy writers to perform calculations on groups of attributes without excessive nesting. 
 



 C. Shortcuts for Common Operations 



 
 New functions like empty-bag() and non-empty-bag() make it easier to check for missing attributes without verbose expressions. 
 



 D. JSONPath 



 
 Support for JSONPath will be added to the language. Like support for XPath, it will be optional to implement. 



 Support for newer XPath versions will be added. 
 



 



 4.  Naming and Structural Changes 



<p>To better reflect its expanded scope beyond XML, there are ongoing discussions about renaming XACML to something more format-agnostic. Current discussion can be viewed [<a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/xacml-spec/issues/35">here</a>].<br><br>Regardless of the naming decision, the XML version will continue to be referred to as XACML, ensuring backward compatibility.</p>



 



<p>XACML Next Gen is shaping up to be a more flexible, efficient, and modern policy definition framework. By introducing JSON and YAML, flattening policy structures, and adding global variables and composite functions, the new version aims to make policy authoring easier and less error-prone, while the addition of canonical string identifiers will significantly improve the readability and audibility of policy corpora.<br><br>We Want Your Feedback</p>



<p>The XACML TC is eager to hear from the broader community as we move forward with this next-generation effort. Whether you’re a longtime implementer, a policy expert, or simply someone with a stake in access control, your input can help shape a modern, more accessible, and flexible standard. We’re especially interested in feedback on new feature requirements, potential use cases, naming ideas for the core language, and thoughts on the move toward syntax-agnostic design.

 Collaborating to respond to UNESCO’s call for think pieces <p>A couple of months ago, after seeing a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VqOiy--QKFkretDUTn4aLvXiygpZNnEw/view?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">UNESCO call for contributions</a>, Doug began wrangling a group of thinkers and educators to respond to the call in a collaborative and open way. Naturally, I got involved, and thus we thought this story would be a good one for the WAO blog :)</p><p>There were six of us on that stormy night…</p>  Bryan Alexander – an internationally known futurist, researcher, writer with this<a href="https://bryanalexander.org/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop"> popular blog</a> and newsletter,<a href="https://aiandacademia.substack.com/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop"> AI, academia, and the Future</a>.&nbsp;  ​Helen Beetham – a researcher and consultant in digital education who has edited several standard texts including Rethinking Pedagogy for a Digital Age. Her articles on AI, education, and society can be found at<a href="https://helenbeetham.substack.com/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop"> imperfect offerings</a>.  ​Doug Belshaw – co-founder of We Are Open Co-op, working at the intersection of systems thinking, digital literacies, and Open Recognition. Doug's writings can be accessed via his<a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop"> website</a>.  ​Laura Hilliger – concept architect, open strategist, and co-founder of We Are Open Co-op. Her<a href="https://laurahilliger.com/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop"> website</a> contains links to her blog and newsletter.  ​Ian O'Byrne – Associate Professor of Literacy Education at the College of Charleston. He maintains an active presence through his<a href="https://wiobyrne.com/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop"> website</a> and weekly newsletter Digitally Literate.  ​Karen Louise Smith – Associate Professor in the Department of Communication, Popular Culture and Film at Brock University. She teaches courses related to social media, surveillance, and new media policy and her writing can be accessed via her<a href="http://karenlouisesmith.net/wp/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop"> website</a>.  <p>The six of us met up online to chat about how we might collaborate to respond to UNESCO’s call, and decided that we would each write our own think pieces. We then met up regularly to chat about where we were, what ideas were floating around and get inspiration from one another. Once we had drafts, we each read each other's pieces offering comments and suggestions.&nbsp;</p><p>Our finished pieces can be found at this linktree: <a href="https://linktr.ee/ai_future_education?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">https://linktr.ee/ai_future_education</a></p><p>After we submitted our think pieces to UNESCO, we decided to do a roundtable event hosted by Doug. Over 100 people signed up, with 50 more on the waitlist. Participants gathered to discuss the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education. The event brought together educators, tech experts, and policymakers to dissect our six pieces on AI's future role in learning environments.</p><p>This blog post summarises our very nuanced discussion surrounding AI's role in education. If you’re interested in this type of thing, we’d recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIgNyHRxCos&amp;ref=blog.weareopen.coop">the full session</a>.</p> 1. Personalized Learning <p>One of the themes discussed was personalized learning facilitated by AI. While AI can functionally analyze student data to tailor curricula and pacing, we talked about the emotional and social dimensions of learning. The lack of empathy in AI systems hinders holistic education, which requires human interaction.</p> 2. Equity and Access <p>We talked about the theory that AI could democratize access to quality education, but we highlighted significant challenges. Unequal access exacerbates existing disparities in educational opportunities, and it is not just infrastructure that is inequitable in our education system.</p> 3. The Educator's Role <p>AI’s impact on educators’ roles was another theme in our conversation. While AI can handle routine tasks like grading, potentially reducing administrative burdens, there are concerns about over-reliance on technology displacing human interaction. We argued for understanding teachers as mentors, facilitators, guardians and creatives to try and make clear that “efficiency” is not a goal in education.</p> 4. Privacy and Bias <p>We talked a lot about the ethical implications surrounding various aspects of AI. From data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and transparency in AI decision-making, we stressed the importance of ethical guidelines and accountability measures.</p> 5. Collaboration <p>We talked a bit about the potential for collaboration between educators and AI. We tried to think about what a complementary relationship with AI might look like for education. While AI might enhance some of our teaching tools, it cannot be allowed to overshadow the irreplaceable human element.</p> 6. The Future of Education <p>In conclusion, we know and spoke about the fact that any technology and its implementation in education must be approached with caution and balance. Our conversation underscored that AI is not a panacea but a technology that exists within a particular context, and that like any technology, it’s how we use it that matters.</p><p>Go deeper:</p>  This is the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIgNyHRxCos&amp;ref=blog.weareopen.coop">​Recording</a> for the full session&nbsp;  We made an AI generated <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f8n4B_HzEXUhhSUqcTUpYmsWUSPQy7EDfB42VS2wuBE/edit?referrer=luma&amp;tab=t.0&amp;ref=blog.weareopen.coop#heading=h.pbm7aujexa0g">​Chat summary</a>  <a href="https://linktr.ee/ai_future_education?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">​All of our think pieces</a> are worth a close read.

 Exploring the plural, context-dependent, and socially-negotiated nature of new literacies <p>Over the past couple of months, we’ve been working on an ‘AI Literacy’ project with the <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Frd%2Fprojects%2Fresponsible-innovation-centre&amp;ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Responsible Innovation Centre for Public Media Futures</a> (RIC), hosted by the BBC. We’ve already published:</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-does-ai-literacy-look-like-for-young-people-aged-14-19-8b4d798eb369">What does AI Literacy look like for young people aged 14–19?</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-makes-for-a-good-ai-literacy-framework-423c57f01e9a">What makes for a good AI Literacy framework?</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/core-values-for-ai-literacy-0dfb0ce5145f">Core Values for AI Literacy</a>  <p>In this post, we want to explore the tension we’ve felt between referring to ‘AI Literacy’ in the singular, versus referring to a plurality of ‘AI Literacies’. Ultimately, although our original brief used the singular form (as do many of our peers) we have decided to take the latter, plural, approach — for reasons we will explain below.</p> <p>One very practical reason to emphasise ‘AI Literacies’ is that it is difficult to talk about ‘delivering’ a literacy. “Literacy” always begs the question of context: What does literacy mean to this particular person in this particular setting at this particular moment? What it means to be ‘AI literate’ is going to look very different to someone working in a corporate office job, compared to a teenager using AI for a creative project. Additionally, there are multiple literate behaviours when we think about AI — for example, understanding the socio-economic reality of the AI landscape versus knowing how to prompt an LLM to get the kind of information or answer you are looking for.</p><p>AI Literacies are therefore both plural and context-specific. They are also socially-negotiated. Literate behaviours depend on the community with which an individual is interacting. This becomes evident through a few examples.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>If you are a parent of teenagers, you will have experienced a time when they respond in a way which makes sense to them and their friends, but not to you. You are likely to have to ask them what they mean or use a resource like the Urban Dictionary. Other behaviours such as using a particular emoji might be hilarious for reasons you cannot quite comprehend.</p><p>These “rhetorics of communication” are an important part of literacy practices, especially in the digital realm. They constitute ways of interacting with other people within a techno-social system which itself privileges and foregrounds certain kinds of behaviours, while either explicitly or implicitly discouraging others. For example, contemporary chat apps allow you to see not only that a message has been delivered, but whether it has been read. The act of not reading a particular message may be seen in multiple lights: Is the person ignoring me? Are they mad at me? Are they offline in the forest?</p><p>Any time we are communicating in ways which are mediated by technologies, part of literate behaviour involves understanding the “affordances” that the technology provides as well as understanding how that technology might be shaping our behaviour.</p><p>If you were, for example, quickly texting your teenager while at work, you might send your text and then open a workplace chat window which looks and feels very much like the social one which you have just been using. However, because the context is different — as well as perhaps both the demographic makeup and number of people in the chat — you act differently. =Your literate behaviours are thus socially-negotiated, meaning that you vary your behaviour in different situations.</p><p>As we start to understand AI Literacies, we need to think about the most common way in which people experience generative AI — by prompting a Large Language Model (LLM) through a chat window. The chat window is a familiar technology, but the fact that there isn’t a human on the other side of it is not. Part of AI Literacies therefore involves exhibiting and modifying our behaviours based on our knowledge and experience of factors that surround this particular chat window.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>With personal or workplace chats, what is outside of the frame informs literate behaviours inside the frame. Similarly, when we are interacting with AI, the more we know about what is outside the frame, the more we can develop appropriate literate behaviours inside the frame. Again, these literate behaviours are plural: will others be able to tell that you are using the outputs of an LLM? (will they mind?) They are based on context: should you trust the company behind the technology you are using? And they are socially-negotiated: are there environmental concerns of which you should be aware?</p><p>Angela Gunder’s <a href="https://openedculture.org/projects/dimensions-of-ai-literacies/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Dimensions of AI Literacies</a> provides a helpful way to think about these issues. Building on my work on the <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/thesis?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Essential Elements of Digital Literacies</a>, Gunder’s framework sets out a series of overlapping dimensions that shape how people interact with AI. This approach supports the idea that AI Literacies are not a fixed set of skills, but a collection of practices negotiated within communities and shaped by context.</p><p>AI Literacies, like Critical Media Literacies, Digital Literacies, Information Literacies, Data Literacies, and a whole host of “new” literacies, should be considered to be fundamentally plural. What counts as “literate behaviours” are socially-negotiated based on context. Words and phrases, however, are important to describe what we mean. And that is why we will be referring to AI Literacies in the project we’re doing with the RIC for the BBC.</p> Coming soon <p>We are working on a public version of our landscape setting and framework for AI Literacies. We’ll be sharing that soon.

<p>At Blockchain Commons, we design open infrastructure that prioritizes privacy, autonomy, and human dignity. That’s why I support and personally signed the <a href="https://nophonehome.com">No Phone Home Initiative</a>. It is not just a position, it’s a call to preserve a foundational principle of decentralized identity: Credentials must be verifiable without enabling surveillance!</p>

 Why “No Phone Home” Matters 

<p>The problem is simple: when verifying a digital credential such as a mobile driver’s license or a diploma, many systems require contacting the original issuer. This creates a digital trail of who is verifying what, when, and why. That trail can be used to profile and surveil, allowing issuers to track credential holders without their knowledge.</p>

<p>Manu Sporny, in an email to the W3C Credentials Community Group (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2025Jun/0008.html">June 3, 2025</a>), clarified the stakes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Retrieving a status list could be misinterpreted as ‘phoning home’ … but it’s not anywhere near the same level of “phoning home” that contacting the issuer and telling them ‘I’ve got Steve here at
booze-hut.com, is he over 21?’ achieves.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the threat of direct identity leak is just the tip of the iceberg. That’s because credential presentation isn’t a one-off event. It’s recurrent. Even when identifiers or interactions are pseudonymous, repeated verifications leak sensitive metadata, allowing issuers or third parties to correlate time, location, and use-pattern metadata into behavioral profiles.</p>

<p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation talks about some of this in <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/no-phone-home/">“Nearly 100 Experts Are Saying ‘No Phone Home’”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The risks multiply when applied across domains. Federated protocols developed for use within organizations become surveillance systems when used between different sectors or jurisdictions. Phone home capabilities that seem innocuous within a single domain can become tools for tracking and control when applied broadly without aggressive oversight and fine-tuning.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Problematically, this is how these systems are designed to work! As Kim Hamilton Duffy says in the first of a series of articles <a href="https://kimdhamilton.com/latent_surveillance/">on mDL privacy</a> that she’s currently working on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This isn’t an unintended consequence—it’s an architectural feature that can trivially enable persistent record-keeping of when and where you use your credentials, creating patterns that can be analyzed long after the original transaction by unknown third parties.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This also reveals yet another danger: how “normal” it feels to let credential issuers remain silently in the loop.</p>

 Revocation Without Surveillance 

<p>Some argue that checking for the revocation of a credential requires phoning home. But that’s a false dilemma. In the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2025Jun/0009.html">same W3C thread</a>, Sporny noted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are a few ways to retrieve a status list without directly contacting the issuer that use commonly deployed web technology.””</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Technical mitigations discussed and developed by the community include:</p>

 
   Large, pseudonymous status lists (e.g., Bitstring Status List) 
   Use of CDNs or file mirrors to avoid direct issuer contact 
   Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) for unlinkable status fetching 
 

<p>There are still issues with these potential mitigations. For example, Kyle Den Hartog (Pryvit NZ) raised <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2025Jun/0004.html">concerns</a> about status list misuse:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“An issuer creates a bitstring list of sufficiently large size, but only includes 1 active credential index per bitstring list. All other indexes are spoofed. The rest of the list would look active to the holder/verifiers but could still be a tracking mechanism by the issuer.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, these edge-case attacks reinforce why the core architecture must be surveillance-resistant by default.</p>

<p>Privacy isn’t the only issue with revocation checking: it’s also a structural risk. If we tie credential validity to live status checks, we quietly shift power from holders to issuers. It becomes a form of dependency injection, one that contradicts the goal of self-sovereign identity.</p>

 Not Just Technical: It’s Ethical 

<p>This isn’t just a technical issue. It goes to the ethical heart of self-sovereign identity design.</p>

<p>Daniel Hardman offered this framing in a <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2025May/0050.html">related thread</a> on edge cases:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Verifiable credentials verify without issuer coordination; that is what the ‘verifiable’ in ‘verifiable credential’ means.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joe Andrieu argued in the same <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2025May/0009.html">May 2025 thread</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>*The identity system that wins is going to be the one we can use in any circumstance by anyone. … It’s my wallet. I expect it to serve me, as a user agent. I do not accept that it might also serve the state as a surveillance platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At Blockchain Commons, we agree. The ability to verify credentials offline, without depending on a central service, is essential for resilience and civil liberties.</p>

<p>A report prepared for the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/publications/aclu-digital-id-state-legislative-recommendations">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) put it clearly by requiring “No Issuer ability to track via phone home mechanism” and saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One way a digital ID can differ from physical ID is that it can enable the issuers of the digital ID to track where, when, and to whom one shows their ID. This tracking can reveal very private and sensitive information about the digital ID holder — namely, when and where, online or off, they present their ID. Standards and technologies should be designed so that the issuer (or any of its agents or contractors) cannot engage in any of these forms of tracking.”</p>
</blockquote>

 Emergencies Are Not an Excuse 

<p>Some use cases such as disaster response or first responder tracking have prompted discussions around consent-based “check-ins.” These are complex and worthy of consideration. But the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#verification">VC Data Model 2.0 spec</a> is clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Credential status specifications MUST NOT enable tracking of individuals, such as an issuer being notified (either directly or indirectly) when a verifier is interested in a specific holder or subject. Unacceptable approaches include “phoning home …”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But compliance doesn’t equal safety. Even digital credentials that conform to existing standards—such as ISO 18013-5—can still include implementation choices that enable surveillance. Privacy must be baked into system design, not retrofitted through policy disclaimers.</p>

<p>As Alexis Hancock of the <a href="https:www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</a> warned (via <a href="https://statescoop.com/no-phone-home-mobile-drivers-license-privacy/">State Scoop</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We have to act now because governments are enthusiastic about digital ID, but if we don’t pin down these basic principles now, it’s going to be a problem later.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can build systems that are opt-in, purpose-specific, and out-of-band, without compromising the privacy baseline for everyone else.</p>

 Our Commitment 

<p>At Blockchain Commons, we believe decentralized identity should empower the individual, not quietly report on them. We are actively designing open standards such as <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/blob/master/Docs/GordianEnvelope.md">Gordian Envelope</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/dCBOR-2023.md">dCBOR</a> to support truly private, verifiable, interoperable credentials.</p>

<p>We support “No Phone Home” because surveillance should never be the default. And we invite others to join us in making sure the future of identity remains decentralized, private, and just.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Welcome to the May edition of the Digital Identity NZ newsletter. This month, we’re excited to introduce our new Executive Director, share insights from Techweek25’s Foundations for Tomorrow Event.</p>



<p>Andy Higgs Appointed as New Executive Director</p>



<p>We’re pleased to announce that Andy Higgs has joined Digital Identity NZ as our new Executive Director.</p>



<p>Andy brings over 20 years of experience across digital identity, AI strategy, and innovation in both public and private sectors. His background includes leadership roles at Futureverse and Centrality, where he focused on self-sovereign identity solutions and ecosystem partnerships.</p>



<p>His experience extends to policy development with the Department of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, including work on the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework and the Consumer Data Right.</p>



<p>Andy’s collaborative approach will be valuable as DINZ continues to work alongside members to build a trusted digital identity ecosystem for everyone in Aotearoa.</p>







<p>Digital Public Infrastructure: Foundations for Tomorrow Event<br><br>During Techweek25, government, industry, and public sector leaders gathered at Parliament’s Legislative Chamber to discuss how digital public infrastructure (DPI) could transform service delivery across New Zealand.<br><br>Key takeaways for the digital identity community:</p>



 
 Ministerial vision:&nbsp;Hon Judith Collins KC announced plans for an all-of-government app allowing citizens to store digital credentials, receive notifications, and access services in one secure digital space.<br>&nbsp; 



 Economic benefits:&nbsp;Pete Herlihy from AWS highlighted that digital identity is one of four core components of DPI that can deliver significant economic growth—between 1-2% of GDP in developed nations.<br>&nbsp; 



 Human-centered approach:&nbsp;Deloitte’s Adithi Pandit emphasised how unified digital infrastructure could enable more joined-up social services and reduce fragmentation.<br>&nbsp; 



 Implementation plans:&nbsp;Public Service Commissioner Sir Brian Roche indicated a move toward greater centralisation with prescribed platforms and standards to make digital infrastructure a low-cost utility.<br>&nbsp; 



 Industry perspective:&nbsp;Xero founder Rod Drury called for greater urgency in digital identity implementation, suggesting New Zealand could leverage its small size to move quickly and “solve digital identity by Christmas.”

  <p>ABSTRACT: “Fair Witnessing” is a new approach for asserting and interpreting digital claims in a way that mirrors real-world human trust: through personal observation, contextual disclosure, and progressive validation. It can be implemented with the decentralized architecture of Gordian Envelopes to allow individuals to make verifiable statements while balancing privacy, accountability, and interpretability. At its core, fair witnessing is not about declaring truth, it’s about showing your work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the early days of decentralized identity, we referred to what we were working on as “Verifiable Claims.” The idea was simple: let people make cryptographically signed statements and allow others to verify them. But something unexpected happened. People assumed these claims would settle arguments or stop disinformation. They saw the term “verifiable” and equated it with “truth.”</p>

<p>The reality was more modest: we could verify the source of a claim but not its accuracy. We could assert that a claim came from a specific person or organization (or even camera or other object) but not whether that claim was unbiased, well-observed, or contextually complete.</p>

<p>This misunderstanding revealed a deeper problem: how do we represent what someone actually saw and how they saw it, in a way that honors the complexity of human trust?</p>

 A Heinleinian Inspiration 

<p></p>

<p>Iin Stranger in a Strange Land, Robert Heinlein described a special profession: the Fair Witness. A Fair Witness would be trained to observe carefully, report precisely, make no assumptions, and avoid bias. If asked what color a house was, a Fair Witness would respond, “It appears to be white on this side.”</p>

<p>It is this spirit we want to capture to fulfill the promise of the original verifiable claims.</p>

<p>A Fair Witness in our digital era is someone who not only asserts a claim but also shares the conditions under which it was made, including context, methodology, limitations, and bias:</p>

 
   What were the physical conditions of the observation? 
   Was the observer physically present? 
   Did they act independently? 
   What interests or leanings might have shaped their perception? 
   How did they minimize those biases? 
 

<p>These are not just nice-to-haves. They are necessary components of evaluating a claim’s credibility.</p>

 Beyond Binary Trust 

<p>Fair witnessing challenges binary notions of trust. Traditional systems ask a “yes” or “no” question: do you trust this certificate? This issuer?</p>

<p>But trust is rarely binary like this in the real world. It is layered, contextual, and progressive. The claim made by a pseudonymous environmental scientist might start out with low trust but could grow in credibility as:</p>

 
   They reveal their professional history. 
   Others endorse their work. 
   They disclose how they mitigated their potential biases. 
 

<p>Trust builds over time, not in a single transaction. That’s <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-progressive-trust-lifecycle/">progressive trust</a>.</p>

 Trust as a Nested Statement 

<p>To marry a fair witness claim to the notion of progressive trust requires the nesting of information. As shown in the example of the environmental scientist, the witnessing of an observation gains weight as the context is added: turning the scientist’s claims into a fair-witness statement required collecting together information about who the scientist is, what their training is, and what their peers think of them.</p>

<p>But as noted, progressive trust isn’t something that occurs in a single transaction: it’s revealed over time. We don’t want it to all be revealed at once, because that could result in information overload for someone consulting a claim and could have privacy implications for the witness.</p>

<p>A progressive trust model of fair witnessing requires that you show what you must and that you withhold what’s not needed—until it is.</p>

 Privacy and Accountability, Together 

<p>This model strikes a crucial balance. On one hand, it empowers individuals (fair witnesses) to speak from experience without needing permission from a centralized authority. On the other hand, it allows others to verify the integrity of the claim without requiring total exposure.</p>

<p>There are numerous use cases:</p>

 
   You can prove you were trained without revealing your name. 
   You can demonstrate personal observation without revealing your exact location. 
   You can commit to a fact today and prove you knew it later. 
 

 Fair Witnessing with Gordian Envelope 

<p>The demands of Fair Witnessing go beyond the capabilities of traditional verifiable credentials (VCs), primarily because VCs can’t remove signed information but maintain its validation—and the ability to do so is critically important if you want to nest information for revelation over time.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a technology already exists that provides this precise capability: Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a>, which allows for: the organized storage of information; the validation of that information through signatures; the elision of that information; the continued validation of the information after elision; and the provable restoration of that information.</p>

<p>Any subject, predicate, or object in Gordian Envelope can itself be a claim, optionally encrypted or elided. This enables a deeply contextual, inspectable form of expression.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
 
   Alice could make a fair-witness observation, which would be an envelope. 
   Information on the context of Alice’s assertion can be a sub-envelope. 
   A credential for fair witness training can be a sub-envelope. 
   Endorsements of Alice’s work as a fair witness can be sub-envelopes. 
   Endorsements, credentials, and even the entire envelope can be signed by the appropriate parties. 
   Any envelope or sub-envelope can be elided, without affecting these signatures and without impacting the ability to provably restore the data later. 
 

<p>It’s progressive trust appropriate for use with fair witnessing in an existing form!</p>

 Toward a New Epistemology 

<p>Being a Fair Witness isn’t about declaring truth. It’s about saying what’s known, with context, so others can assess what’s truth. Truth, in this model, is interpreted, not imposed. A verifier—or a jury—decides if a claim is credible, not because a central authority says so, but because the Fair Witness has provided information with sufficient context and endorsements.</p>

<p>In other words, fair witnessing is not about what is true, but about how we responsibly say what we believe to be true—and what others can do with that.</p>

<p>This is epistemology (the theory of knowledge) that’s structured as a graph. It’s cryptographically sound, privacy-respecting, and human-auditable. It reflects real-world trust: messy, contextual, and layered. By modeling that complexity rather than flattening it, we gain both rigor and realism.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>In a world of machine-generated misinformation, ideological polarization, and institutional distrust, we must return to the foundations: observation, context, and human responsibility.</p>

<p>Fair witnessing offers a new path forward—one that is verifiable, privacy-respecting, and grounded in how humans actually trust.</p>

<p>After decades of cautiously watching from the sidelines, governments around the world have started investing in, rolling out, and regulating digital identity systems on aggressive timelines. These foundational changes to government infrastructure and the economy are happening largely outside public awareness, despite their generational consequences for privacy.</p><p>Digital identity systems implemented by governments today will shape privacy for decades. Whatever ecosystems and technical architectures are established in the coming years could ossify quickly, and it would take enormous political will to make changes at such a foundational level if society develops buyer's remorse once the ripple effects become clear.</p><p>That's why nearly 100 experts across technology, policy, and civil liberties have united around one principle: digital identity systems must be built without latent tracking capabilities that could enable ubiquitous surveillance. Thus, the <a href="https://nophonehome.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">nophonehome.com petition</a>.</p> Who's Behind This <p>Civil society groups working on legal advocacy and industry oversight (ACLU, EFF), cybersecurity experts (including Bruce Schneier), privacy-by-design software companies of various sizes (Brave, many DIF members), and experts from university faculties (Brown, Columbia, Imperial College London) all signed on. The list includes authors of collaborative open standards, chief executives, state privacy officers, and other public servants. This is not a coalition of "activists" so much as a broad coalition of experts and policy-watchers sounding an alarm about consequential decisions passing largely unnoticed by the average citizen and end-user.</p><p>The breadth of this coalition reflects widespread concern about the technical and policy implications of embedded tracking capabilities.</p> What "Phone Home" Means <p>As a general rule, "phone-home" is a shorthand for architectural principles of tracking enablement (just as "no phone-home" refers to tracking mitigation, broadly speaking). When a verifier of credentials interacts directly with the credential's issuer—even if just to check validity or revocation status—they are "phoning" the credential's "home." This opens the subject and/or the holder of that credential to privacy risks, no matter how well the request is anonymized or handled. These API connections create data that can be combined, correlated, and abused, especially when verifiers share information or when issuers abuse their role.</p><p>The risks multiply when applied across domains. Federated protocols developed for use within organizations become surveillance systems when used between different sectors or jurisdictions. Phone home capabilities that seem innocuous within a single domain can become tools for tracking and control when applied broadly without aggressive oversight and fine-tuning. Over time, little mismatches and slippages in how these protocols work get exploited and stretched, amplifying glitches.</p><p>In the worst-case scenario, some systems enable real-time revocation decisions, giving issuers—potentially governments—immediate control over citizens' ability to access services, travel, or participate in society. A natural tendency to "over-request" foundational documents in situations where such strong identification is unjustified is amplified by familiarity, lack of friction, and other UX catnip; all the SHOULDs in the world won't stop verifiers from doing it. And verifiers over-asking without also providing a fallback or "slow lane" can make a sudden or temporary unavailability of foundational credentials painful or even exclusionary. The side-effects and externalities pile up dangerously in this industry!</p><p>Technologists see these kinds of capabilities (phone-home of any kind, remote revocation, low-friction foundational identity requests) like loaded guns in Act 1 of a Chekhov play: "If this capability exists within a digital identity system, even inactively, it will eventually be misused."</p> The Scale and Timing Problem <p>Most foundational identity systems being implemented for national-scale deployment include system-wide phone home tracking capabilities, either actively or latently. Many policymakers involved in these rollouts are not even aware of the tracking potential built into the standards they are adopting.</p><p>Four factors make this moment critical:</p>  Scale of deployment: These systems will serve billions of users across developed nations, effectively replacing physical credentials.  Precedent-setting effects: When one jurisdiction adopts tracking-enabled systems, it influences global practices and standards.  Infrastructure persistence: Technical decisions made today will persist for decades, becoming prohibitively expensive to change once embedded.  Mission creep inevitability: Capabilities developed for legitimate purposes like fraud prevention naturally accrue new private-sector and/or public-sector use-cases over time due to natural market pressures. Today's private-sector usage is tomorrow's public-sector secondary data market.   The Fallacy of "Privacy by Policy" <p>The fundamental problem with latent tracking capabilities is that policies change, but technical architecture persists. If a system has surveillance capability—even if unused—it will eventually be activated. Emergencies, changing administrations, or shifting political priorities can quickly justify "pressing the button" to enable widespread tracking.</p><p>The solution is simple: they cannot press a button they do not have.</p><p>Consider AAMVA's recent decision to prohibit the "server retrieval" capability throughout the U.S.—a positive step that we welcome. However, most low-level implementations (e.g. core libraries) will likely implement the entire specification and leave it to the last-mile implementers to honor (or not) this policy. As an incubator of new specifications and prototypes, DIF feels strongly that jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction policies is just "turning off" what the specification still instructs software to implement for later policies to turn back on at the flick of a switch. We believe the underlying ISO specification needs to remove "server retrieval" completely, lest every authority in the U.S. remain one emergency away from activating broad, identity-based surveillance of all citizens.</p> Privacy-Preserving Alternatives Exist <p>The choice between security and privacy is false. Offline-first verification operates without server communication—the credential contains cryptographic proofs that can be validated independently. The ISO 18013-5 standard itself includes "device retrieval" mode, a privacy-preserving alternative that functions entirely offline.</p><p>Even credential revocation can be implemented without phone home capabilities. Privacy-preserving revocation systems are in production today, proving that security and privacy can coexist.</p><p>The technology exists. The standards exist. What has been missing is commitment to prioritize privacy over the operational convenience of centralized tracking.</p> Moving Forward <p>Awareness is growing. We welcome developments like AAMVA's prohibition of server retrieval, but more work is needed across the broader digital identity ecosystem to eliminate latent surveillance capabilities entirely.</p><p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation develops standards that prioritize privacy, supports implementations that respect user autonomy, and advocates for technical architectures that prevent tracking and add friction to data misuse. Our membership includes many technologists and vendors designing tracking-free alternatives for these and other use cases.</p><p>We encourage you to read the full No Phone Home statement at <a href="https://nophonehome.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://nophonehome.com</a>.

<p>OASIS Members Advance Digital Lexicography with an Interoperable Data Model for Dictionaries</p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 29 May 2025 – Members of OASIS Open, the global open source and standards organization, have approved the <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/lexidma/dmlex/v1.0/OS/">Data Model for Lexicography (DMLex) Version 1.0</a> as an OASIS Standard, a status that signifies the highest level of ratification. Developed by the OASIS Lexicographic Infrastructure Data Model and API Technical Committee (LEXIDMA TC), DMLex v1.0 establishes a groundbreaking framework for internationally interoperable lexicographic work, advancing innovation in digital dictionaries, language services, and related industries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved with DMLex v1.0. This is a lifechanging milestone for lexicography, paving the way for a new level of digitisation and for truly innovative applications,” said Michal Měchura, Chair of the OASIS LEXIDMA TC. “By providing a common framework for structuring and exchanging lexicographic resources, DMLex empowers language documentors around the world to manage their content more effectively, to collaborate and to build smarter language technologies.”</p>



<p>Lexicography has undergone a profound transformation in the digital age, with dictionaries now being compiled from language corpora and consumed through web platforms, mobile apps, and integrated into search engines, writing tools, and machine translation software. However, legacy data models have been hampering further innovation. DMLex v1.0 addresses these challenges by introducing a modular, IT-friendly, and content-rich data model designed to meet the needs of both lexicographers and technology developers. DMLex has been designed to be easily and straightforwardly implementable in XML, JSON, RDF, NVH, as a relational database, and as a Semantic Web triplestore.</p>



<p>OASIS encourages widespread adoption of DMLex v1.0 and invites feedback from lexicographers, developers, and other stakeholders to further enhance its capabilities. Participation in the LEXIDMA TC is open to all through <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/join-a-tc/">membership in OASIS</a>. For more information, visit the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/tc-lexidma">TC homepage</a> and read Michal Měchura’s <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2025/01/30/the-road-to-dmlex/">blog post</a> exploring the goals and impact of DMLex.</p>

 In 1958, Oliver R. Smoot, a student at MIT, was famously used as a human measuring stick to measure the length of the Harvard Bridge. Smoot, measuring a mere 5 foot 7 inches (1.70 m), would lay down on the bridge as his associates noted his position.

<p>WAO is currently working with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/responsible-innovation-centre?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Responsible Innovation Centre for Public Media Futures</a> (RIC), which is hosted by the BBC. The project, which you can read about in our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-does-ai-literacy-look-like-for-young-people-aged-14-19-8b4d798eb369">kick-off post</a>, is focused on research and analysis to help the BBC create policies and content to help improve the AI Literacy skills of young people aged 14–19.</p><p>We’re now at the stage where we’ve reviewed academic articles and resources, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-makes-for-a-good-ai-literacy-framework-423c57f01e9a">scrutinised frameworks</a>, and reviewed input from over 40 experts in the field. They are thanked in the acknowledgements section at the end of this post.</p><p>One of the things that has come up time and again is the need for an ethical basis for this kind of work. As a result, in this post we want to share the core values that inform the development of our (upcoming) gap analysis, framework, and recommendations.</p> Public Service Media Values <p>Public Service Media (PSM) organisations such as the BBC have a mission to “inform, educate, and entertain” the public. The Public Media Alliance lists <a href="https://www.publicmediaalliance.org/understanding-public-service-media/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">seven PSM values</a> underpinning organisations’ work as being:</p>  Accountability: to the public who fund it and hold power to account  Accessibility: to the breadth of a national population across multiple platforms  Impartiality: in news and quality journalist and content that informs, educates, and entertains  Independence: both in terms of ownership and editorial values  Pluralism: PSM should exist as part of a diverse media landscape  Reliability: especially during crises and emergencies and tackling disinformation  Universalism: in their availability and representation of diversity  <p>These values are helpful to frame core values for the development of AI Literacy in young people aged 14–19.</p> AI Literacy Core Values <p>Using the PSM values as a starting point, along with our input from experts and our desk research, we have identified the following core values. These are also summarised in the graphic at the top of this post.</p> 1. Human Agency and Empowerment <p>AI Literacy should empower young people to make informed, independent choices about how, when, and whether to use AI. This means helping develop not just technical ability, but also confidence, curiosity, and a sense of agency in shaping technology, rather than being shaped by it (UNESCO, 2024a; Opened Culture, n.d.). Learners should be encouraged to question, critique, adapt, and even resist AI systems, supporting both individual and collective agency.</p> 2. Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion <p>All young people, regardless of background, ability, or circumstance should have meaningful access to AI Literacy education (Digital Promise, 2024; Good Things Foundation, 2024). Ensuring this in practice means addressing the digital divide, designing for accessibility, and valuing diverse perspectives and experiences. Resources and opportunities must be distributed fairly, with particular attention to those who are digitally disadvantaged or underrepresented.</p> 3. Critical Thinking and Responsible Use <p>Young people should be equipped to think critically about AI, which means evaluating outputs, questioning claims, and understanding both the opportunities and risks presented by AI systems. In addition, young people should be encouraged to understand the importance of responsible use, including understanding bias, misinformation, and the ethical implications of AI in society (European Commission, 2022; Ng et al., 2021).</p> 4. Upholding Human Rights and Wellbeing <p>Using a rights-based approach — including privacy, freedom of expression, and the right to participate fully in society — helps young people understand their rights, navigate issues of consent and data privacy, and recognise the broader impacts of AI on wellbeing, safety, and social justice (OECD, 2022; UNESCO, 2024a).</p> 5. Creativity, Participation, and Lifelong Learning <p>AI should be presented as a tool for creativity, collaboration, and self-expression, not just as a subject to be learned for its own sake. PSM organisations should value and promote participatory approaches, encouraging young people to contribute to and shape the conversation about AI. This core value also recognises that AI Literacy is a lifelong process, requiring adaptability and a willingness to keep learning as technology evolves (UNESCO, 2024b).</p> Next Steps <p>We will be running a roundtable for invited experts and representatives of the BBC in early June to give feedback on the gap analysis and emerging framework. We will share a version of this after acting on their feedback.</p><p>If you are working in the area of AI Literacy and have comments on these values, please add them to this post, or get in touch: <a href="mailto:hello@weareopen.coop">hello@weareopen.coop</a></p> Acknowledgements <p>The following people have willingly given up their time to provide invaluable input to this project:</p><p>Jonathan Baggaley, Prof Maha Bali, Dr Helen Beetham, Dr Miles Berry, Prof. Oli Buckley, Prof. Geoff Cox​, Dr Rob Farrow, Natalie Foos, Leon Furze, Ben Garside, Dr Daniel Gooch, Dr Brenna Clarke Gray, Dr Angela Gunder, Katie Heard, Prof. Wayne Holmes, Sarah Horrocks, Barry Joseph, Al Kingsley MBE, Dr Joe Lindley, Prof. Sonia Livingstone, Chris Loveday, Prof. Ewa Luger, Cliff Manning, Dr Konstantina Martzoukou, Prof. Julian McDougall, Prof. Gina Neff, Dr Nicola Pallitt, Rik Panganiban, Dr Gianfranco Polizzi, Dr Francine Ryan, Renate Samson, Anne-Marie Scott, Dr Cat Scutt MBE, Dr Sue Sentance, Vicki Shotbolt, Bill Thompson, Christian Turton, Dr Marc Watkins, Audrey Watters, Prof. Simeon Yates, Rebecca Yeager</p> References   Digital Promise (2024).

   The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) has created an open technical standard providing publishers, creators, and consumers the ability to trace the origin of different types of media.  Over the last year, the organization has been creating a governance framework and conformance program (based on the ToIP Metamodel) and is ready to launch it this quarter.

 Briefing Document: Review of C2PA and its Governance 
<p>Date: May 15, 2024<br>
Source: Excerpts from “GMT20250515-145218_Recording_2560x1440.mp4”<br>
Presenter: Scott Perry, Co-chair of Trust over IP’s Foundations Steering Committee, Founder and CEO of the Digital Governance Institute, Co-chair of the Creator Assertions Working Group at the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF).<br>
Topic: C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) and the Application of Trust over IP’s Governance Metamodel.</p>
 1. Executive Summary 
<p>This briefing summarizes a presentation by Scott Perry on the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) and the application of the Trust over IP (ToIP) governance metamodel to its conformance program. The C2PA is an industry-wide initiative creating a technical standard to attach “truth signals” or provenance information to digital objects. Facing a critical need to operationalize and govern this specification to ensure market trust and adoption, the C2PA has adopted the ToIP governance metamodel. This framework provides the necessary structure to establish a conformance program, define roles and responsibilities, manage risks, and create trust lists for compliant products and certification authorities. The program is set to officially launch on June 4th, initially focusing on self-assertion for conformance and introducing two levels of implementation assurance, with plans for independent attestation and higher assurance levels in the future.</p>
 2. Key Themes and Ideas 
 
 The Problem of Trust in Digital Objects: The presentation highlights the growing challenge of establishing trust and authenticity for digital content in a world of easily manipulated or AI-generated media. This is particularly relevant for industries like telecommunications struggling with identity and verification, as noted by a participant’s observation about OTPs and SMS verification. 
 C2PA as a Standard for Provenance and Authenticity: The C2PA specification aims to provide a technical solution by creating a “content credential” or manifest that is cryptographically bound to a digital object. This manifest acts as a ledger of actions taken on the object, providing a history and “nutrition label” of its source and modifications. “basically, it’s all of the major tech companies except Apple… coming together to create a standard for provenence, authenticity, truth signals on digital objects that can be digitally attached to digital objects.” 
 Content Credential (Manifest): This is the core mechanism of the C2PA. It is a digitally attached ledger of actions taken on a digital object, such as “Camera took picture,” “edited picture,” or “an AI took this picture.” This manifest is “bound to it and linked to it” in a “cryptographically binding format,” providing tamper evidence. 
 Scope of C2PA Responsibility: The C2PA primarily focuses on “created assertions,” which are “product-driven,” documenting actions taken within a product (e.g., a camera generating a picture, Photoshop editing an image). 
 Distinction from “Gathered Assertions”: The C2PA does not take responsibility for “gathered assertions,” which are claims made by individuals or organizations outside of a product (e.g., “I Scott Perry took the picture” or industry-specific identifiers). These are the purview of other groups like CAWG (Content Authenticity Working Group) and related efforts like the Creator Assertions working group at DIF. 
 Binding Mechanism: The C2PA uses X.509 certificates to bind the generator product to the digital asset. “when a picture is taken, the X509 certificate will be used will be binding it will be used to bind it bind the product to the asset.” This requires camera manufacturers and other product vendors to obtain certificates from approved Certification Authorities (CAs). 
 The Need for Governance: While the C2PA created a technical specification, they recognized the critical need for a governance framework to operationalize and control the standard’s implementation and use in the market. “the key aspect is you have a spec out but you can’t control the use of the specification… they couldn’t get, you know, their arms around, you know, the on controlling its the specification use.” 
 Application of ToIP Governance Metamodel: Scott Perry highlights how the ToIP governance metamodel provided the necessary structure for the C2PA to build its conformance program. “I came in with my toolkit from the the trust over IP project and it worked beautifully. It just created the structure to allow them to make the right decisions for themselves.” 
 Key Components of the Governance Program (based on ToIP):Risk Assessment: Started with a “threats and harms task force” to identify major risks, particularly around the tampering of evidence and manifests. 
 Governance Requirements and Framework: Defined primary documents (specification, security requirements, legal agreements) and control documents (privacy, inclusion, equitability requirements). A key output is a glossary of terms for the new ecosystem. 
 Governance Roles and Processes: Identified key roles: the Governing Authority (C2PA Steering Committee), the Administering Party (Conformance Task Force), and Governed Parties (CAs, Generator Product companies, Validator Product companies). 
 Legal Agreements: Formal agreements are being established between the C2PA and governed parties outlining roles, responsibilities, conformance requirements, and dispute resolution mechanisms. 
 Conformance Criteria and Assurance: Defined based on the C2PA specification and implementation security requirements. The program includes “four levels of of assurance around the implementation of products,” though initially rolling out with two levels. These levels are tied to “security objectives” and assessed against the “target of evaluation” (the product and its supporting infrastructure). 
 Conformance Process: Involves an intake form, application review, assessment of infrastructure (initially self-assertion, moving towards independent attestation), legal agreement signing, and adding records to trust lists. 
 Residual Risk Assessment and Adaptation: The program includes a process to learn from the rollout, identify unmet requirements or issues, and adapt the program for continuous improvement. 
 Trust Lists (Registries): Central to the program are trust lists identifying approved Generator Products, Validator Products, and Certification Authorities. A timestamp authority trust list is also being added. 
 Levels of Assurance: The program is defining levels (initially rolling out two) to reflect different degrees of confidence in the implementation of the C2PA specification and associated security requirements. Achieving a higher level of assurance requires meeting all requirements for that level. 
 Self-Assertion (Initial Rollout): Due to the complexity of auditing and getting the program launched quickly, the initial phase requires participants to self-assert that they meet the specification and requirements. 
 Conformance Certificate: Upon successful conformance, products will receive a certificate tied to an OID (Object Identifier) denoting the assurance level they have achieved. This OID in the manifest’s certificate will identify the assurance level of the provenance information. 
 JPEG Trust and Copyright: While C2PA provides provenance information that can be used for copyright, it doesn’t define ownership or copyright laws. JPEG Trust is mentioned as an organization creating an ISO standard focused on copyrights in concert with the C2PA standard. 
 Relationship with W3C: The C2PA is actively engaged with the W3C, with discussions happening at the technical working group level regarding related standards like PROV (for provenance). 
 Future Directions: Plans include introducing higher levels of assurance, implementing independent attested conformance, developing quality control software for assessing product compliance, and establishing a fee structure for the conformance program. 
 CAWG (Content Authenticity Working Group) as a Broader Ecosystem: CAWG is viewed as a potentially larger ecosystem dealing with identity, metadata, endorsements, and AI learning process specifications, which will need to create their own applications and standards that can integrate with the C2PA foundation. 
 
 3. Important Ideas and Facts 
 
 The C2PA is the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity. 
 It includes major tech and product manufacturers, excluding Apple initially but aiming to include them. 
 The core technical output is the Content Credential (Manifest), a digitally attached ledger of actions on a digital object. 
 The manifest provides tamper evidence and binds the product to the asset using X.509 certificates. 
 C2PA focuses on “created assertions” (product-driven actions), leaving “gathered assertions” (individual/organizational claims) to other groups like CAWG. 
 The Trust over IP governance metamodel has been successfully applied to structure the C2PA conformance program. 
 The program addresses threats and harms related to tampering and requires adherence to implementation security requirements. 
 The C2PA conformance program will officially launch on June 4th at the Content Authenticity Initiative symposium in New York City. 
 The initial launch will include two levels of implementation assurance and a self-assertion confidence model. 
 Key outputs of the governance program are legal agreements and trust lists of conforming products and certification authorities. 
 The C2PA standard is becoming an ISO standard this year. 
 Timestamp authorities will play a crucial role in providing trust signals related to the time of claim assertion. 
 The program includes mediation and dispute resolution mechanisms in its legal agreements. 
 The governance program provides the structure for the C2PA to “operationalize the spec” and control its use.

<p>Abstract</p>



<p>Session hijacking is a growing initial attack vector for online fraud and account takeover. Because FIDO authentication reduces the effectiveness of other simpler forms of compromise, such as credential stuffing and phishing, cybercriminals turn to theft and re-use of bearer tokens. Bearer tokens are a form of credential which include session cookies used by browsers connecting to websites and OAuth access tokens used by other thick client application types such as native mobile applications. When these credentials are long-lived and can be “lifted and shifted” from the machine where they were created to be usable by a bad actor from another machine, their tradable value is significant. Emerging technologies such as Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) for browsers and Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) for OAuth applications seek to reduce the threat of session hijacking. This article describes how these technologies address the problem of session hijacking and how they complement strong phishing resistant authentication in online ecosystems.</p>



<p>Audience</p>



<p>This white paper is for chief information security officers (CISOs) and technical staff whose responsibility it is to protect the security and life cycle of online identity and access management from online fraud.&nbsp;</p>

 1. Introduction 



<p>Authentication and authorization are integral parts of an identity lifecycle, especially for online credential ecosystems. The growing threat of online identity fraud with costly security incidents and breaches has enterprises looking for ways to protect and secure their workforces from account takeover through different attack vectors such as phishing, credential stuffing, and session hijacking. For authentication, FIDO authentication with passkeys provides users with “Safer, more secure, and faster online experiences”, and an increase in the adoption of passkeys has contributed to a reduction of the success of attack vectors of credential phishing, credential stuffing, and session hijacking accomplished via man-in-the-middle (MITM) phishing attacks. However, what happens after the authentication ceremony?</p>



<p>After authentication, browsers and application clients are typically issued other credentials. Enterprise applications generally fall into two primary categories: those that are web browser based and use session cookies for state management and those that are thick client applications using OAuth access tokens (this includes some browser-based single page applications and most native mobile applications). Both types of credentials (session cookies and access tokens) are considered, in their basic use, as “bearer” tokens. If you have the token (the session cookie or the access token), then you can continue to transact for the lifetime of that token as the user who authenticated and owned it.This whitepaper explores adjacent technologies that address the “lift and shift” attack vector for bearer tokens and how these technologies complement FIDO-based authentication mechanisms. In particular, this paper focuses on the proposed web standard Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) for protecting browser session cookies and OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) for protecting OAuth grants.</p>



 2. Terminology 



<p>session hijacking: An exploitation of the web session control mechanism that is normally managed for a session cookie.</p>



<p>credential stuffing: An automated injection of stolen username and password pairs (credentials) into website login forms to fraudulently gain access to user accounts.</p>

<p>access token: A credential used by a client-side application to invoke API calls on behalf of the user.</p>



<p>session cookie: A credential managed by browsers to maintain session state between a browser and a website.</p>



<p>bearer token: A token (in the context of this whitepaper may refer to either an access token or a session cookie) so called because whoever holds the token can use it to access resources. A bearer token on its own can be “lifted and shifted” for use on another computing device.</p>



<p>sender-constrained token: A token protected by a mechanism designed to minimize the risk that anything other than the client which established the token during an authentication process could use that token in subsequent requests for server-side resources.</p>



<p>Device Bound Session Credential (DBSC): A proposal for a W3C web standard defining a protocol and browser behavior to establish and maintain sender-constrained cookies. The mechanism uses proof of possession of an asymmetric cryptographic key to help mitigate session cookie hijacking.OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Procession (DPoP): A mechanism for implementing sender-constrained access tokens that requires clients to demonstrate possession of an asymmetric cryptographic key when using the token.</p>



<p>OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Procession (DPoP): A mechanism for implementing sender-constrained access tokens that requires clients to demonstrate possession of an asymmetric cryptographic key when using the token.</p>



 3. Adjacent/complementary technologies for a secure ecosystem 



<p>While FIDO authentication technology can effectively eliminate phishing and credential stuffing attacks that occur during the login process, the addition of solutions to mitigate threats associated with bearer token theft is equally important. Bad actors whose attacks are thwarted during the login process will go after the next weakest link in the chain and try to steal post-authentication bearer tokens. This section explores two of these technologies for protecting bearer tokens: Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) protect browser-based session cookies and Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) protects OAuth grants. Alternative approaches to protect bearer tokens are also discussed.</p>



<p>Because no single piece of technology can protect against all threats, a combination of multiple techniques is required for adequate protection.</p>

<p></p>



<p>3.1 Browser session cookie security</p>



<p>Before discussing Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC), you will need to understand the problem being addressed regarding browser session cookies. Session hijacking via cookie theft allows an attacker, who possesses stolen cookies, to bypass end-user authentication, including any strong or multi-factor authentication (MFA). This is particularly problematic when browsers create long-lived session cookies (which are a type of bearer token), since these cookies can be traded as alternatives to a user’s primary authentication credentials and then used from the attacker’s machine. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, financial loss, and damage to an organization’s reputation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attackers perform cookie theft through various methods such as man-in-the-middle phishing of a user’s existing MFA login process (when phishing-resistant authentication such as FIDO is not used), client-side malware, and occasionally through vulnerabilities in server-side infrastructure or software. Regardless of how cookie theft is perpetrated, when successful, these attacks are not only dangerous, but also hard to isolate and detect. Complementary technologies, such as Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC), minimize the risks associated with browser cookie theft by making stolen cookies impractical to use from any machine other than the machine to which they were issued during authentication.</p>



<p>3.2 Device Bound Sessional Credentials – DBSC</p>



<p>DBSC refers to a proposed web standard currently in development within the Web Application Security working group of the W3C[2]. The goal of DBSC is to combat and disrupt the stolen web session cookies market. This is achieved by defining an HTTP messaging protocol and required browser and server behaviors to result in binding the use of application session cookies to the user’s computing device. DBSC uses an asymmetric key pair and in browser implementations the private keys should be unextractable by an attacker – for example stored within a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), secure element, or similar hardware-based cryptographic module.</p>



<p>At a high level, the API in conjunction with the user’s browser and secure key storage capabilities, allows for the following:</p>



 
 The server communicates to the browser a request to establish a new DBSC session. This includes a server-provided challenge. 



 The browser generates an asymmetric key pair, then sends the public key along with the signed challenge to the server. This process is referred to as DBSC registration. Browser implementations of DBSC should use operating system APIs that facilitate secure, hardware-bound storage and use of the private key. 



 The server binds the public key to the browser session by issuing a short-lived, refreshable auth_cookie which is then required to be transmitted in subsequent browser requests to the web server. 
 



<p>As the auth_cookie regularly expires, a mechanism is required for the browser to refresh the auth_cookie asynchronously to primary application web traffic. The refresh process requires signing a new server-issued challenge with the same private key created during DBSC registration, thereby re-proving (regularly) that the client browser is still in possession of the same private key.</p>



<p>Limiting the lifetime of the auth_cookie to short periods of time (for example, a few minutes) disrupts the market for trading long-lived session cookies. An attacker can only use stolen session cookies (including the auth_cookie) for a brief period, and cannot perform a refresh operation, since the private key required to perform a refresh operation is not extractable from the client machine.</p>



<p>DBSC may be introduced into existing deployments with minimal changes to the application. This is important as DBSC could easily be incorporated as a web plugin module in existing server-side technology (for example, Apache module, Servlet Filter, or reverse proxy functionality). This permits enterprises to roll out deployment of DBSC in phases without a complete overhaul of all current infrastructure and companies can prioritize certain critical endpoints or resources first.</p>



<p>DBSC server-side implementations can also be written in a manner that permits semantics, for example: “If the browser supports DBSC, use it, otherwise fallback to regular session characteristics.” This allows users to gain the security advantages of DBSC when they use a browser that supports it without having to require all users to upgrade their browsers first.</p>



<p>Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/dbsc">Device Bound Session Credentials explainer</a> for more details on the DBSC protocol and standard, including a proposal for enterprise-specific extensions that adds attestation to DBSC keypairs.</p>



<p>3.2.1 What makes DBSC a technology complementary to FIDO?</p>



<p>The DBSC draft standard permits the login process to be closely integrated with the DBSC API. While FIDO is a mechanism that makes authentication safer and phishing resistant, DBSC is a mechanism that makes the bearer credential (session cookie) safer post-authentication. They complement each other by reducing the risk of account takeover and abuse, making the entire lifecycle of application sessions safer.</p>



<p>3.2.2 Alternative solutions</p>



<p>DBSC is not the first standard to propose binding session cookies to a client device. Token Binding is an alternative that combines IETF RFCs 8471, 8472, and 8473. Token Binding over HTTP is implemented via a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension and uses cryptographic certificates to bind tokens to a TLS session. Token Binding has had limited browser adoption and is complex to implement as it requires changes at the application layer and in TLS security stacks. The Token Binding over HTTP standard has not been widely adopted and only one major browser currently offers support.</p>



<p>3.2.3 Advice</p>



<p>The DBSC standard relies on local device security and operating system APIs for storage and use of the private key that is bound to the browser’s session. While these private keys cannot be exported to another device, the key is available on the local system and may be exercisable by malware residing on the user’s device. Similarly, in-browser malware still has complete visibility into both regular session cookies and short-lived auth_cookies. DBSC is not a replacement for client-side malware protection, and the threat model for DBSC does not provide protections from persistent client-side malware. Ultimately, the user must trust the browser.</p>



<p>As browsers start to support DBSC over time, it will be important for servers to be able to work with a mix of browsers that do and do not include support for this technology. Some enterprises may dictate that corporate issued machines include browsers known to support DBSC, but many will not. It will be necessary for server-side implementations to take this into consideration, using DBSC when the browser responds to registration requests, and tolerating unbound session cookies when the browser does not. When building or choosing a commercial solution, ensure you consider this scenario, and include the ability to implement access control policies that strictly require DBSC in highly controlled or regulated environments or for specific applications.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, DBSC is in early evolution. It remains to be seen whether or not it will be widely adopted by browser vendors. The hope is that incubating and developing this standard via the W3C will result in wider adoption than previous proposals, similar to the way that the WebAuthn API has been adopted to bring passkey authentication to all major browser implementations.</p>



 4. OAuth grants 



<p>The previous section introduced DBSC as a means to protect against session cookie theft in web browsers. Thick application clients, including mobile applications and single-page web applications, typically use stateless API calls leveraging OAuth grants instead of session cookies. An OAuth grant may be established in several ways, with the&nbsp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252">recommended pattern for thick clients</a> being to initially use the system browser to authenticate a user, and grant access for an application to act on their behalf. Conceptually this is remarkably similar to browser-based sessions, including the ability and recommendation, to use FIDO authentication for end-user authentication when possible. At the conclusion of the browser-based authentication portion of this flow, control is returned to the thick client application or single-page web application where tokens are established for use in programmatic API calls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The challenge that occurs from this point forward is almost identical to that described for browsers – the OAuth tokens are bearer tokens that if exposed to a bad actor can be used to call application APIs from a remote machine instead of from the legitimate application.</p>



<p>This section describes the use of DPoP, a technology for protecting the “lift and shift” of credentials used in OAuth-protected API calls which, just like DBSC, makes use of an asymmetric key pair and ongoing proof of possession of the private key.</p>



<p>4.1 Demonstrate Proof of Possession (DPoP)</p>



<p>OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) is an extension of the existing OAuth 2.0 standard for implementing device bound (or sender-constrained) OAuth access and refresh tokens. It is an application-level mechanism that allows for the tokens associated with an OAuth grant (that is, refresh tokens and access tokens) to bind with the requested client using a public and private key pair. This requires the client to prove ownership of its private key to the authorization server when performing access token refresh operations and to resource servers when using access tokens to call APIs.</p>



<p>6. OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252</a></p>



<p>High assurance OpenID specifications, such as <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">Financial-grade API (FAPI 2.0)</a>, mandate the use of sender-constrained tokens and DPoP is the recommended method for implementing this requirement when Mutual TLS (mTLS) is not available.</p>



<p>At a high level, DPoP requires that:</p>



 
 The client generates a per-grant public/private key pair to be used for constructing DPoP proofs. Best practice implementations should use operating system APIs to ensure the private key is non-extractable. 



 On initial grant establishment (for example, exchanging an OAuth authorization code for the grant’s first access token and refresh token), a DPoP proof (a JWT signed by the client’s private key that contains, among other things, a copy of the public key) is used to bind a public key to the grant. 



 Requests to a resource server using an access token obtained in this manner must also include a DPoP proof header, continuously proving possession of the private key used during grant establishment. This is done for every API request. Resource servers are required to check if an access token is sender-constrained, confirm the public key, and validate the DPoP proof header on each API call. 



 For public clients, subsequent refresh_token flows to the authorization server’s token endpoint must also contain a DPoP proof signed with the same key used during initial grant establishment. This is particularly important as the refresh tokens are often long-lived and are also a type of bearer token (that is, if you have it you can use it). The authorization server must enforce the use of a DPoP proof for these refresh token flows and ensure signature validation occurs via the same public key registered during initial grant establishment. 
 



<p>Unlike a plain bearer access token which can be used by any holder, DPoP based access tokens are bound to the client that initially established the OAuth grant, since only that client can sign DPoP proofs with the private key. This approach minimizes the risks associated with malicious actors trading leaked access tokens.</p>



<p>Refer to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449">DPoP RFC 9449</a> – OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) for more information.</p>



<p>4.2 What makes DPoP a complementary technology to FIDO?</p>



<p>FIDO can be leveraged for phishing resistant end-user authentication during establishment of an OAuth grant. Refresh and access tokens obtained by a client following this authentication should be safeguarded against “lift and shift” attacks just like session cookies in browser-based apps. DPoP is a recommended solution for protecting these OAuth tokens from unauthorized post-authentication use. Together, FIDO for end user authentication and DPoP for binding OAuth tokens to a client device complement each other to improve the overall security posture for identities used in thick client applications.</p>



<p>4.2.1 DPoP alternative solutions?</p>



<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705">RFC8705</a> – OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens describes a mechanism that offers a transporter layer solution to bind access tokens to a client certificate. While it has been approved for use in <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">FAPI 2.0</a> for open banking solutions, it is not particularly suitable for public clients such as native mobile applications.</p>



<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9421">RFC9421</a> – HTTP Message Signatures defines an application-level mechanism for signing portions of an HTTP message. Key establishment and sharing between the client and verifier are not defined by this specification, although this could be performed in a trust on first user manner during initial grant establishment in a similar manner to DPoP. There is no known public specification that maps the use of HTTP message signatures to the use case of sender-constrained bearer tokens in an OAuth client application. In the absence of such a public specification, widespread adoption for this use case is unlikely.</p>



<p>4.2.2 Advice</p>



<p>Sender-constrained tokens are a good idea, and, in some deployments, they are a regulatory requirement. For example, use of the FAPI profiles of OAuth is now mandated by many sovereign open banking initiatives. DPoP is a relatively simple way to achieve this requirement and is flexible enough to cover a wide range of application client types. That said, care must still be taken to adhere to the security considerations of DPoP. Pay close attention to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449#section-11">section 11 of RFC9449</a>, as well as apply other application security strategies for native or browser based single page applications as your scenario dictates. Remember that DPoP is focused solely on addressing the threats associated with token exfiltration, which include trading and use by malicious actors. It should be considered part of a defense-in-depth strategy for OAuth applications.</p>



 5. Conclusion 



<p>The intent of this paper is to inspire thinking around how different web security standards fit together and how those standards relate to the use of FIDO authentication for users. There are so many standards and standards bodies that it is often hard to understand which compete in the same space and which augment one another to form part of a comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy for identity fraud protection in online applications.</p>



<p>This paper tackled a specific, prevalent application security problem – the malicious trading and use of stolen cookies and access tokens. This paper also showed how technologies such as DBSC and DPoP mitigate the threats associated with token theft and how these technologies are complementary to FIDO authentication. Paired with FIDO, DBSC and DPoP provide greater overall identity fraud protection for your applications.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/blogs/community-platform-project/building-power-and-making-change-community-strategies-and-tools?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">cross-posted on the Amnesty UK blog</a></p><p>Community-driven change is more important than ever. Whether we are advocating for social justice, environmental sustainability, or political reform, collective action is how we create lasting impact. But how do we build a movement that starts with individual curiosity and grows into sustained activism? That’s where the Amnesty International UK (AIUK) community platform project comes in — a digital hub designed to empower individuals, support collaboration, and drive meaningful change.</p><p>This blog post outlines how the platform and community strategy work together to guide people from discovery of the AIUK community to becoming activists within it.</p> 1. Discovery <p>The journey of community-driven change starts with discovery. This is the stage where individuals first come into contact with AIUK. Maybe they learn about an issue, identify it as important, and begin to consider how they might want to get involved. Or maybe they meet someone at a demonstration, and discover the community first-hand.</p><p>AIUK social media, through broadcasting, is just one tool that helps people discover Amnesty International UK. AIUK makes complex issues accessible and relatable. We want to do the same as AIUK highlights grassroots efforts and community initiatives.</p><p>We want to encourage posts that show:</p>  Our dedicated community and highlight key grassroots initiatives and campaigns.  Signposts to find local groups or events based on interests.  Digital actions, such as petitions or downloading campaign guides, to help users take their first steps.  <p>Such content ensures that even people who are new can find relevant AIUK communities and take the first steps toward engagement.</p> 2. Intention to Engage <p>Once someone discovers a cause they care about, the next step is forming an intention to engage. This stage is all about commitment — moving from passive interest to active participation.</p><p>By showcasing community on the AIUK website, we both invite people in and celebrate what the community is achieving. We want to present clear pathways for involvement and help community members inspire others to take steps towards action.</p><p>We need to figure out processes that help:</p>  Goal-setting: Encouraging community members to set personal milestones, like committing to attend 100 meetings.  Sharing success: Telling success stories and finding testimonials that effectively attract new people while celebrating community achievements.  Balancing information: Showcasing static information about past successes with dynamic, real-time updates on current campaigns from the community.  <p>By making it easy for people to express their intent and take small but meaningful steps, we build confidence and lay the groundwork for deeper engagement.</p> 3. Taking Action: Turning Intent into Impact <p>With intention comes action, and this is where real change begins. At this stage, people start to feel a sense of belonging and are ready to contribute to a cause they care about.</p><p>A knowledge base can help equip users with actionable tools. We’ll need clear resources and learning pathways that:</p>  Guide people to the right information: Whether it’s organising a protest, writing letters to policymakers, or starting a local campaign, the knowledge hub can provide step-by-step guidance tailored to issues we work on.  Help people collaborate: People should be able to connect with others who share their interests and work together on projects — whether virtually or in person. Best practices and community policies may also be at home in the knowledge hub.  Show them into the community: Make sure that people feel supported and seen as they take action. Create an architecture of participation that brings them into the community platform.  <p>This stage is about turning isolated actions into collective power, with the support of the community ensuring that every contribution counts.</p> 4. Sustaining Action: Building Lasting Commitment <p>Sustained action is the key to creating lasting change. Too often, movements fizzle out after an initial burst of energy, but with a strong community strategy and integrated platform, we can keep momentum going.</p><p>To sustain engagement, the community platform needs to help people align with others in the AIUK movement. We need to think about:</p>  Feedback loops: Regular check-ins with the community to understand their needs and ensure that we are adapting the community strategy and platform accordingly.  A recognition ecosystem: Using digital badges and shoutouts for individuals or groups who demonstrate consistent commitment to help us make activism more visible.  Storytelling opportunities: Sharing success stories and lessons learned will inspire others and keep motivation high.  <p>By encouraging a sense of belonging and purpose, we ensure that members find reasons to continue building collective power for human rights.</p> 5. Becoming an Activist: Empowering Future Leaders <p>The final stage is becoming an activist. At this point, individuals understand that community isn’t one person, but rather all of us. They begin to work on behalf of others, coordinate together and lift people up with their leadership.</p><p>These leaders will use other coordination tools and processes and that’s great! We want to empower the development of activist and leadership skills. We’ll need:</p>  Decentralised coordination best practices: For members who are ready to take on larger roles, such as leading groups or campaigns.  Mentorship programs: Connecting experienced activists with newcomers to share knowledge and build networks.  Advocacy training: Workshops, webinars, and resources focused on effective communication, policy advocacy, and community organising.  <p>Through these efforts, we can go beyond nurturing individual leaders to continue building a movement.</p> The Power of Community Work in Driving Change <p>The journey from discovery to becoming an activist is a process of gradual engagement and empowerment. There is a system of platforms, processes and content that help AIUK move people towards becoming an activist. Although we use various digital tools, the journey is an emotional and social one.</p><p>We are working hard to make sure the community platform project harnesses the collective strength of our community and makes a difference that lasts.</p>

 <a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/">Personal AI</a>. This is AI that is as much yours as your shoes, your bike, and your PC. Personal, not personalized. 
 
<p>To explain how these will work together, start here:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not long after <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527/">The Intention Economy</a> came out in May, 2012, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Thomson_(executive)">Robert Thomson</a>, Managing Editor of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/">The Wall Street Journal</a>, wanted the book’s opening chapter to serve as the cover essay for the Marketplace section of an upcoming issue. <a href="https://hbr.org/hbrpress">Harvard Business Review Press</a> didn’t like that idea, so I wrote an original piece based on one idea in the book: that shoppers will soon be able to tell the market what they’re looking for, in safe, secure and anonymous ways—a kind of advertising in reverse that the book called “personal RFPs” and has since come to be called “intentcasting.” This became <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444873204577535352521092154">The Customer as a God</a>: The image above was the whole cover of the Marketplace section on Monday,&nbsp; July 23, 2012. The essay opened with these prophetic words: “It’s a Saturday morning in 2022…”</p>
<p>It is now a Friday morning in 2025, and that godly future for customers is still not here. Yes, we have more market power than in 2012, but we are digital serfs whose powers are limited to those granted by&nbsp; Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and other feudal overlords. This system is a free market only to the degree that you can choose your captor.&nbsp; This has led to—</p>
<p></p>
<p>The IONBA (Internet Of Notning But Accounts) is based on a premise: that the best customers are captive ones. In this relic of the industrial age, customers are captive to every entity that requires logins and passwords. Customers also have no ways of their own to globally control what data is collected about them, or how. Or to limit how that data is used.&nbsp; This is why our digital lives are infected by privacy-killing data-collection viruses living inside our computers, phones, TVs, and cars.</p>
<p>If you didn’t know about those last two, dig:</p>
 
 Consumer Reports says “<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/electronics/privacy/how-to-turn-off-smart-tv-snooping-features-a4840102036/">All smart TVs—from Samsung, LG, you name it—collect personal data</a>.”&nbsp;They also come with lame “privacy” controls, typically buried deep in a settings menu. (Good luck exhuming them. The ones in our TCL and Samsung TVs have all but disappeared.) 
 Mozilla calls new cars “<a href="http://the%20Worst%20Product%20Category%20We%20Have%20Ever%20Reviewed%20for%20Privacy">the Worst Product Category We Have Ever Reviewed for Privacy</a>.” There is also nothing you can do to stop your car from reporting on everything your car does—and everything you do, including sexual ativity—to the carmaker, insurance companies, law enforcement, and who knows who else. This data goes out through your car’s cell phone, misleadingly called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telematic_control_unit">telematics control unit</a>. The antenna is hidden in the shark fin on your car’s roof or in an outside mirror. 
 
<p>Businesses are also starting to lose faith in surveillance, for at least eight reasons:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2015/01/16/privacy/">People hate it</a>. 
 They also fight it. By 2015 ad blocking and tracking protection were <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">the biggest boycott in world history</a>.

 <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/big-tech-digital-advertising-regulation/">Regulatory pressure against it is getting bigger all the time</a>. 
 Advertisers are finally remembering that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4733724_The_Waste_in_Advertising_Is_the_Part_That_Works">brands are made by ads aimed at populations</a>, while personalized ads are just digital junk mail. 
 Customers are using AI tools for guidance toward a final purchase, bypassing marketing schemes to bias purchasing decisions along the way. For more on that, see <a href="https://marketoonist.com/2025/05/marketing-ai-agents.html">Tom Fishburne’s cartoon</a>, and <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/marketings-new-middleman-ai-agents/">Bain’s report</a> about it. 
 
<p>So our four roads to The Intention Economy start with the final failings of the systems built to prevent it. Now let’s look at those roads.</p>
<p>1—IEEE P7012 “MyTerms”</p>
<p><a href="https://projectvrm.org/2025/04/06/myterms/">MyTerms</a>, <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">the most important standard in development today</a>, will be a keystone service of <a href="https://customercommons.org">Customer Commons,</a> the nonprofit spinoff of ProjectVRM. It will do for contract what Creative Commons did for copyright: give individuals a new form of control. With MyTerms, agreements between customers and companies will be far more genuine mutual, and open to new forms of innovation not based on the kind of corporate control that typifies the IONBA. For example, it can open Visa Intelligent Commerce to conversations and relationships that go far past transaction. Take for example <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/market-intelligence-that-flows-both-ways-e822fa74530">Market intelligence that flows both ways</a>. While this has been thinkable for a decade or more (that last link is from 2016), it’s far more do-able when customers and companies have real relationships based on equal power and mutual interests. These are best framed up on agreements that start on the customer’s side, and give customers scale across all the companies with which they have genuine relationships.</p>
<p>2—First Person Project (FPP)</p>
<p>To me, FPP begins with the vision <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2015/11/25/remembering-big-davy/">“Big Davy” Sallis</a> came up with while he was working for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314191743/http://visaeurope.com/">VISA Europe</a> in 2012, and read the The Intention Economy. At the time, he wanted Visa to make VRM a real category, but assumed that would take too long. So he decided to create a VRM startup called <a href="https://www.qredo.com/">Qredo</a>. Joyce and I consulted Qredo until&nbsp; <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2015/11/25/remembering-big-davy/">Davy</a> died (far too young) in 2015. Qredo went into a different business, but <a href="http://searls.com/qredo1/">a draft I created for Qredo’s original website</a> survives, and it outlines much of what the&nbsp; FPP will make possible. That effort is led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drummondreed/">Drummond Reed</a>, another friend and collaborator of Davy’s and a participant in ProjectVRM from the start. Drummond says the FPP is inspired by <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2014/03/19/why-we-need-first-person-technologies-on-the-net/">Why We Need First Person Technologies on the Net</a>, a post published here in 2014. That post begins,</p>
<blockquote><p>We need&nbsp;first person technologies&nbsp;for the same reason we need first person voices: because there are some things only a person can say and do.</p>
<p>Only a person can use the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronouns">pronouns</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;“I,” “me,” “my” and “mine.” Likewise, only a person can use tools such as screwdrivers, eyeglasses and pencils. Those things are all&nbsp;first person technologies. They were invented for individual persons to use.</p>
<p>We use first person technologies the same unique ways we use our voices.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among other things, the First Person Project will fix how identity works on the Internet. With FPI—First Person Identity—interactions with relying parties (the ones wanting “your ID”) don’t need your drivers license, passport, birth certificate, credit card, or account information. You just give them what’s required, on an as-needed basis, in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">verifiable credentials</a>. The credentials you provide can verify that you are a citizen of a country, licensed to drive, have a ticket to a game, or whatever. In other words, they do what Kim Cameron outlined in his<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065"> Laws of Identity</a>: disclose minimum information for constrained uses (Law 2) to justifiable parties (Law 3) under your control and consent (Law 1). The credential you present is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier">DID: a Decentralized Identifier</a>. No account is required.</p>
<p>Trust in FPI also expands from individual to community. Here is how Phil Windley explains it in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2025/04/establishing_first_person_digital_trust.shtml">Establishing First Person Digital Trust</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Alice and Bob met at IIW, they didn’t rely on a platform to create their connection. They didn’t upload keys to a server or wait for some central authority to vouch for them. They exchanged DIDs, authenticated each other directly, and established a secure, private communication channel.</p>
<p>That moment wasn’t just a technical handshake—it was a statement of first-person identity. Alice told Bob, “This is who I am, on my terms.” Bob responded in kind. And when they each issued a verifiable relationship credential, they gave that relationship form: a mutual, portable, cryptographically signed artifact of trust. This is the essence of first-person identity—not something granted by an institution, but something expressed and constructed in the context of relationships. It’s identity as narrative, not authority; as connection, not classification.</p>
<p>And because these credentials are issued peer-to-peer, scoped to real interactions, and managed by personal agents, they resist commodification and exploitation. They are not profile pages or social graphs owned by a company to be monetized. They are artifacts of human connection, held and controlled by the people who made them. In this world, Alice and Bob aren’t just users—they’re participants.</p></blockquote>
<p>This also expands outward into community, and webs of trust. You get personal agency plus community agency.</p>
<p>The FPP covers a lot more ground than identity alone, but that’s where it starts. Also, Customer Commons is a funding source for the FPP, and I’m involved there as well.</p>
<p>3—Visa Intelligent Commerce</p>
<p>The press release is <a href="https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.21361.html">Find and Buy with AI: Visa Unveils New Era of Commerce</a>. Less blah is <a href="https://corporate.visa.com/en/products/intelligent-commerce.html">Enabling AI agents to buy securely and seamlessly</a>. Here’s the opening copy.</p>

<p>4—Personal AI</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rezarassool/">Reza Rassool</a> was also inspired by The Intention Economy when he started <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/">Kwaai.ai</a>, a nonprofit community developing open-source <a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/">personal AI</a>. I now serve Kwaai as its volunteer Chief Intention Officer.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what personal AI will do for this woman:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Looks great, but we’re stuck in IONBA, she has little control over her personal data in all those spaces. For example,</p>
 
 She doesn’t have the digital version of what George Carlin called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLoge6QzcGY">a place for my stuff</a>.” (Watch that video. It’s brilliant—and correct.) 
 She has few records of where she’s been, who she’s been with and when—even though apps on her phone know that stuff and are keeping it inside the records of her giant overlords and/or selling it to parties unknown, with no way yet for getting it back for her own use. 
 Her finances are possibly organized, but scattered between the folders she keeps for taxes, plus the ones that live with banks, brokers, and other entities she hardly thinks about. It would be mighty handy to have a place of her own where she could easily see all her obligations, recurring payments, subscriptions, and other stuff her counterparties would rather she not know completely. 
 Her schedules are in Apple, Google, and/or Microsoft calendars, which are well app’d and searchable, but not integrated. She has no digital calendar that is independent and truly her own. 
 Her business and personal relationship records are scattered across her contact apps, her Linkedin page, and piles of notes and business cards. She has no place or way of her own to manage all of them. 
 Her health care records (at least here in the U.S.) are a total mess. Some of them ares inside the MyCharts and patient portals provided by separate (and mostly unconnected) health care specialists and medical systems. Some of it is in piles of printouts she has accumulated (if she’s kept them) from all the different providers she has seen. Some of it is in fitness and wellness apps, all with exclusive ways of dealing with users. None of it is in a unified and coherent form. 
 
<p>So the challenge for personal AI is pulling all that data out of all her accounts, and putting it into forms that give her full agency, with the help of her personal AIs.&nbsp; Personalized AIs from giants can’t do that. <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/10/personal-vs-personalized/">We need our own personal AIs</a>.</p>
<p>And there we have it: Four roads to a world where free customers prove more valuable than captive ones. And we’re making it happen. Now.</p>

<p>Passkeys are unique digital credentials tied to a user’s personal device and offer a way to authenticate identity without the need for traditional passwords or one-time text codes.</p>



<p>Passkeys never leave the device and so cannot be reused across websites, which makes them resistant to phishing and other common attacks.</p>

<p>DIF members showcased their vision at this year's European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC 2025), bringing together experts who are defining the future of human-centric digital identity. As AI capabilities accelerate, DIF members are tackling both the architectural foundations and philosophical implications of self-sovereign identity, and EIC provided an excellent forum to share how they are solving digital identity's most complex challenges.</p> The Philosophy Behind Standards: Values in Digital Identity <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-sabadello-353a0821/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Markus Sabadello</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/danube-tech/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Danube Tech</a> and DIF Steering Committee member, delivered a compelling talk examining the philosophical underpinnings of digital identity standards. His presentation, "The Worldviews behind Digital Identity Standards," argued that technical choices in standards like OID4VC, DIDComm, SD-JWT-VC, and the W3C verifiable credential data model reflect deeper philosophical trajectories variously aligned with European values like Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.</p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/world-views-behind-digital-eic25?ref=blog.identity.foundation"></a>Markus Sabadello presents "The Worldviews behind Digital Identity Standards"<p>Sabadello illustrated how technologies like <a href="https://book.didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm</a> prioritize fraternity through peer-to-peer connections, while JSON-LD enables innovation and liberty through permissionless semantic flexibility and self-publishing. As the industry standardizes wallets and verifiable credentials, he emphasized that these standards should be evaluated not only on technical merits but also on how they impact human values like sovereignty and equitable participation.</p><p>The talk concluded with an important reminder that technology is never value-neutral, highlighting the need to align digital identity standards with humanistic values while avoiding the pitfalls of fragmentation from competing, politically and commercially driven standards.</p> AI and Identity: A New Frontier <p>Another highlight of the conference was the Verifiable AI talk and panel series. In his talk "Private Personal AI and Verified Identity for AI Agents", <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alastairijohnson/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Alastair Johnson</a> (CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nuggets?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Nuggets</a>) explored the challenges of implementing truly private personal AI that protects user sovereignty while creating verifiable identities for AI agents.

<p>ISL began its life as the Me2B Alliance, striving to create standards to enable greater power symmetry in the digitally facilitated relationship between consumers (“Me-s”) and the companies whose technology they use (“B-s”). We called this the M2B relationship. For mobile apps, all too often it’s a case of “Me2 Who Knows?!” People have a right to know who’s legally responsible for the apps they use, and it is anything but clear in mobile app stores today. App stores are failing to make clear the legal entity who is responsible for apps. ISL has filed responsible disclosures with Apple starting in late 2024 but our repeated attempts have been dismissed. </p>
 Anatomy of Responsible Party Info in the App Stores 
<p>Both Google and Apple allow for two kinds of developer accounts: individual and organization. The creation of either type of account requires identity validation, but it’s a lower bar for individuals than for organizations. Individuals must provide a government issued ID credential before being allowed to open a developer account. This validates the individual’s name and address. Organizations, however, must provide a DUNS number to validate the legal existence of the organization. <a>1</a><a>2</a></p>
<p>▶ Problem 1: How effective is this level of identification authentication? ISL recently found an app developer with 15 apps in the Google Play store with no verifiable legal existence whatsoever. Thus, the process is imperfect at best.</p>
<p>In both stores, the “Account Holder” (to use Apple’s language) is the individual/entity who is in a legal relationship with the app store [owner]. </p>
<p>Figures 1a and 1b show two parts of an Apple App store listing. Note that the name in blue under the app name appears to be the Account Holder (Figure 1a). Note that the Information section of the app listing shows five other places where we expect to see the same Account Holder name and websites.</p>
 <p>Figure 1a: Apple App Store Example – App Header</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 1b: Apple App Store Example – App Information</p> 
<p><br>
Figures 2a and 2b show a similar annotated view of the Google Play Store app listing. Between Figures 2a and 2b, there are six instances where the Account Holder name appears.</p>
 <p>Figure 2a: Google Play Store Example – Part 1</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 2b: Google Play Store Example – Part 2</p> 
<p><br>
This all seems fine. What we see in practice, though, is that the various links and names presented in the app store listing that should be definitively showing the name of the legally party responsible for the app often have inconsistencies. Which brings us to additional problems.</p>
<p>▶ Problem 2: Account Holders can create additional user accounts within their account, including users with permissions to submit/delete apps.<a>3</a> There’s seemingly no governance over this capability, left strictly in the hands of the Account Holder.</p>
<p>▶ Problem 3: The app store app listing doesn’t indicate if the developer of the app is an individual or a company. This information matters. People deserve to know if they’re using an app developed by an individual developer, or by a company. No matter what, so long as apps are collecting personal information, people have an unconditioned right to know who gets their data and what they’re doing with it.</p>
<p>▶ Problem 4: The Apple app store doesn’t disclose the location of the responsible app developer but the Google Play store does.<a>4</a> The great thing about app ecosystems is that they foster worldwide participants. The problem is that the responsible developer can be oceans away from consumers, making it difficult or impossible to hold the developer accountable if there are issues.</p>
<p>▶ Problem 5: Apps have broken developer links. It’s wildly confusing when the name in blue or green font under the app name is different from the name that appears when you click on the developer link. Imagine if you went to a grocery store and there was a loaf of bread with no brand or company information. You wouldn’t want to eat that. When you click on the Developer Website link for the app shown in Figure 1b you find yourself not only not at a site that says Kepler47, you find a non-functional page for audiojoy.com (Figure 3).</p>
 <p>Figure 3 Developer website URL for 12 Step AA NA Daily Meditation from the Apple App Store: <a href="https://audiojoy.com/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi">https://audiojoy.com/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi</a></p> 
<p><br>
▶ Problem 6: The Account Holder name from the listing header doesn’t match the name in the privacy policy OR in the App Support link. Figures 4a and 4b illustrate a case where the listed developer in the listing header is Will Aitchison (Figure 4a), but the privacy policy fails to indicate a legally responsible data controller entirely (Figure 4b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 4a: Account Holder name</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 4b: Privacy policy link for app by Will Aitchison: <a href="https://www.firststeporegon.org/docs/PrivacyPolicy_25-05-2018.pdf">https://www.firststeporegon.org/docs/PrivacyPolicy_25-05-2018.pdf</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 4c: Privacy Policy from “Developer’s Website”</p> 
<p>Note that there’s another layer of confusion for the First Step Oregon app, namely, the privacy policy found on the App Support page differs from the privacy policy linked in the app store (Figure 4c). This case is a case where the app developer was likely an individual affiliated with the organization who wrote and submitted the app on behalf of the company. Still, it leaves a question for users: who is responsible? Who does the user contact in the case of issues?</p>
<p>The Boggle: Arcade Edition app in the Apple store shows a similar situation. The Account Holder appears to be Zynga Inc. from the app store listing header (Figure 5a). But when you click on the  App Support link you see the Take-Two Terms of Service (Figure 5.b). Similarly, the linked privacy policy is also Take-Two’s. Finally, this app includes a copyright showing Zynga Inc. in the information section (Figure 5c). In this instance, the original Account Holder (Zynga Inc.) was acquired by another company (Take-Two). Zynga appears to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Take-Two based on its California business registration status, but the “hybrid” information in the app store is confusing.<br>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 5b: Boggle App Support Link</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 5c: Boggle App store listing – Information Section</p> 
<p>Interestingly, not all Zynga games in the app store show Take-Two info at the App Support link. Figure 6b shows the App Support link for FreeCell, another Zynga game.  </p>
 <p>Figure 6a: FreeCell App store listing header</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 6b: FreeCell App Support link</p> 
<p><br>
▶ Problem 7: App Information shows two different names. Figures 7a and 7b show elements of the Apple app store listing for the app, Count Money and Coins – Photo Touch Game. In the Information section of the app store listing, Innovative Investments Limited is shown as the Seller, but Grasshopper Apps is the copyright registrant.</p>
 <p>Figure 7a: Count Money and Coins App store listing header</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 7b: Count Money and Coins app – Information section</p> 
<p><br>
▶ Problem 8: App store listings with broken privacy policy links. It’s relatively easy to find apps in the app stores whose privacy links are simply broken, non-functional. This is what we found with most of the Innovative Investments Limited apps (Figure 7c).</p>
 <p>Figure 7c: <a href="http://www.grasshopperapps.com/privacy-policy">http://www.grasshopperapps.com/privacy-policy</a></p> 
 Conclusions  
<p>NONE of this should be happening today. App stores receive 30% of all app revenues and thus have ample resources to programmatically monitor these situations. Consumers should never have to conduct forensic research in order to figure out who they’re entering into a business relationship with. Here’s a recap of what the app store owners should do:</p>
 
 Make it crystal clear on your label who the legal entity responsible for the app is (I’ll call this “responsible developer”). 
 Make sure ALL instances in and related to the app store listing consistently show the same responsible developer name. 
 Make sure there is valid, working contact information for the responsible developer.  
 Indicate if the developer is an individual or an organization. <br>
 a. Ideally, we’d like to know the organization type, as this effects their legal obligations. For instance, for-profit vs. non-profit vs. government entities.<br>
 b. It’s also important to indicate coarse location information of the developer—i.e. city, state and country. 
 Make sure privacy policy links are functional all the time. 
 
<p>Here are Recommendations for app consumers:</p>
 
 If there isn’t a privacy policy, don’t install the app.  
 If there are no privacy details provided in the Apple store, don’t install the app.  
 If there’s no developer contact information provided, don’t install the app.

 Final Thoughts 
<p>We are well past the point of understanding the risks of these things, yet we see no systemic changes under development on the part of Apple and Google to put safety measures in place. Perhaps shining this light on some of the issues can help spur action. </p>

 Summary of roles and permissions for Apple developer accounts: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/account/access/roles/">https://developer.apple.com/help/account/access/roles/</a> 
 Location of the developer was met with some warranted and some dubious pushback from Android developers as shown on this Reddit thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/17w3pgz/google_started_displaying_full_legal_name_and/?rdt=50889">https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/17w3pgz/google_started_displaying_full_legal_name_and/?rdt=50889</a> . Mandatory disclosure of an individual developer’s location presents some risks. That said, the developer is capable of getting every user’s location information so it seems a reasonable requirement.

<p>Blockchain Commons was pleased to receive another grant this year from <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a> and their Bitcoin Development Fund grant to support our work with developers and implementers to expand the usage of FROST.</p>

<p>To quote HRF’s <a>press release</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For nonprofits operating under authoritarian rule, securing Bitcoin is critical for survival. If private keys (which control access to bitcoin) are compromised, funds can be seized and movements dismantled. Blockchain Commons is a [not-for-profit] supporting the development of FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signature), a protocol that strengthens multisignature wallets (bitcoin wallets with multiple private keys) by making them more secure, private, and flexible for shared custody. With this grant, Blockchain Commons will help build critical infrastructure to keep civil society groups operational and financially resilient under dictatorships.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blockchain Commons has previously held and documented <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/#events">four meetings</a> supporting FROST in 2023 and 2024, and we plan to continue with that later in 2025. Thanks to HRF, we also are expanding that work this year with the development of a FROST signing tool and the creation of a brief “Learning FROST from the Command Line” course. Our goal, as ever, is to help support the implementers who are creating FROST and to make it easier for developers to incorporate FROST into their wallets.</p>

<p>For more on FROST, see our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">FROST developer pages</a>.</p>

<blockquote>A decentralized repository for secure, scalable genomic data sharing &amp; AI-driven personalized healthcare insights — powered by OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph&nbsp;(DKG).</blockquote> OriginTrail powers the future of ethical AI in healthcare with&nbsp;ELSA <p>We’re excited to announce that <a href="https://origintrail.io">OriginTrail</a> is joining forces with the <a href="https://elsa-ai.eu">ELSA</a> (European Lighthouse on Secure and Safe AI) initiative to shape the future of decentralized, privacy-preserving artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. Digital healthcare today faces three pressing challenges: safeguarding patient privacy, bridging fragmented data silos for seamless interoperability, and meeting strict regulatory requirements without stifling innovation.</p><p>At the heart of this collaboration lies a DeReGenAI — a decentralized repository for secure, scalable genomic data sharing and AI-driven personalized healthcare, powered by the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). This initiative tackles the most pressing challenges in digital health: enabling secure, compliant, and user-sovereign sharing of sensitive genomic data while unlocking the full potential of AI-driven personalized healthcare.</p> Trustworthy AI needs trustworthy infrastructure <p>AI is transforming healthcare — but for it to do so responsibly, it must be built on a foundation of trust, transparency, and ethics. That’s exactly what OriginTrail brings to the table within the ELSA consortium: an open-source, decentralized infrastructure that ensures data privacy, ownership, and interoperability at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>By integrating OriginTrail DKG, DeReGenAI becomes a decentralized repository that puts patients in control of their most personal asset — their genomic data. This&nbsp;enables:</p>  User-managed permissions: Patients decide who can access their data, when, and for what&nbsp;purpose.  Privacy-preserving monetization: Individuals can opt to share their data with research institutions or health providers on their own&nbsp;terms.  AI-ready interoperability: Seamless interaction with AI systems while maintaining the integrity and provenance of the&nbsp;data.  <p>At its core, the OriginTrail DKG act as a knowledge graph of knowledge graphs — a globally distributed network where each participant maintains control over their own knowledge node. These nodes interact in a fully decentralized manner, eliminating the risks of centralized data silos and single points of&nbsp;failure.</p><p>Here’s why this&nbsp;matters:</p>  Global scale: Access data from diverse sources without compromising security.  Privacy-first architecture: Data sovereignty is seamlessly integrated into the infrastructure.  Compliance-ready: Designed with GDPR and other regulatory frameworks in&nbsp;mind.  Interoperable: Built for seamless integration with AI technologies and healthcare systems.   How does DeReGenAI work? <p>To power the next generation of personalized healthcare, DeReGenAI employs decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG) — an evolution of how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with external&nbsp;data.</p><p>Instead of querying a centralized source, the LLMs in DeReGenAI leverage the OriginTrail DKG to retrieve verified, decentralized knowledge. This&nbsp;unlocks:</p>  More accurate AI insights,  Context-aware healthcare recommendations,  Trustworthy and verifiable AI behavior.  <p>The ELSA initiative brings together top-tier European academic, industrial, and technology partners, such as University of Oxford, The Alan Turing Institute, NVIDIA, and others, to build a future where AI is both effective and ethical. As part of the ELSA initiative, OriginTrail is used to build a trusted data ecosystem for the AI age — one where people, not platforms, control their data, and where innovation never comes at the cost of&nbsp;ethics.</p><p>We’re proud to be driving this change, and even prouder to be doing it alongside an incredible group of partners.</p><p>Learn how OriginTrail is powering the shift to human-centric AI at <a href="https://origintrail.io/">https://origintrail.io/</a>.</p><p>Trust the&nbsp;source.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-powers-the-future-of-ethical-ai-in-healthcare-with-elsa-d59b628438be">OriginTrail powers the future of ethical AI in healthcare with ELSA</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Current Landscape 



<p>The public safety sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation, embracing new technologies to enhance emergency response, law enforcement, and disaster management. However, this shift also brings challenges such as data security risks, privacy concerns, and the need for reliable information verification in critical situations.</p>



<p>When DIACC was established in 2012, its goal of creating a secure digital ecosystem extended to all sectors, including public safety. As a trusted authority in digital identity and authentication, DIACC’s mission is more crucial than ever as public safety agencies increasingly rely on digital systems and data sharing to protect communities.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust, Canada can strengthen its public safety infrastructure, improve emergency response times, and enhance collaboration between various agencies. Interoperable frameworks, such as the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF), ensure that public safety systems remain secure, adaptable, and trusted.</p>



 Advancing Digital Trust in Public Safety 



 1. Enhancing Emergency Response and Coordination 



<p>Implementing robust digital trust solutions can significantly improve emergency response by:</p>



 
 Enabling secure, real-time data sharing between agencies 



 Verifying the authenticity of emergency communications 



 Facilitating rapid and accurate identification of individuals in crises 
 



 2. Leveraging the DIACC PCTF for Public Safety 



<p>DIACC encourages public safety agencies to adopt the PCTF as a tool to:</p>



 
 Implement secure identity verification for first responders and emergency personnel 



 Enhance the integrity of emergency alert systems 



 Improve interagency collaboration through trusted data exchange 
 



 3. Addressing Privacy Concerns in Surveillance and Data Collection 



<p>To balance public safety needs with individual privacy rights, DIACCweDIACC recommendss:</p>



 
 Implementing transparent data collection and usage policies 



 Adopting privacy-preserving technologies in surveillance systems 



 Ensuring proper authentication and authorization for access to sensitive data 
 



 4. Combating Misinformation in Crisis Situations 



<p>Digital trust frameworks can help public safety agencies:</p>



 
 Verify the authenticity of information during emergencies 



 Establish trusted channels for disseminating critical updates 



 Collaborate with social media platforms to combat the spread of false information 
 



 5. Enhancing Cybersecurity in Critical Infrastructure 



<p>Public safety agencies can use digital trust solutions to:</p>



 
 Secure communication networks used in emergency response 



 Protect critical infrastructure from cyber threats 



 Implement robust identity and access management systems for sensitive facilities 
 



 Best Practices and the Way Forward 



 1. Adopt Emerging Technologies 



<p>Public safety agencies should leverage technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) to enhance their digital trust capabilities and improve emergency response. AI can be used for real-time data analysis and decision-making, while DLT can ensure the integrity and immutability of critical information.</p>



 2. Foster Cross-Sector Collaboration 



<p>DIACC encourages collaboration between public safety agencies, technology providers, and other stakeholders to develop standardized digital trust practices.</p>



 3. Educate and Train 



<p>DIACC is committed to educating public safety personnel and the public about digital trust through:</p>



 
 Specialized training programs for emergency responders 



 Public awareness campaigns on the importance of verified information during crises

 Overview 
<p>This briefing summarizes a presentation by Carly Huitema from Agri-food Data Canada (ADC) to the Trust over IP (ToIP) Ecosystem and Governance Working Group. The presentation focuses on ADC’s efforts to improve research data management in the agri-food sector, specifically through the development of the “Semantic Engine” suite of tools. A central theme is the importance of “FAIR” data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and how machine-readable data schemas, particularly using the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) standard, contribute to achieving this goal. The discussion also highlights the advantages of derived identifiers (digests) over assigned identifiers for reproducibility, authenticity, and decentralization, and ADC’s ongoing work to integrate their tools and schemas into existing research infrastructure.</p>
 Key Themes and Important Ideas 
 
 
 
 Improving Research Data Management in a Decentralized Ecosystem: The research data ecosystem is described as highly decentralized with independent research groups. While guided by best practices, mandates for standardized approaches are often slow to adopt. Incentives can be conflicting, particularly the “publish or perish” culture versus the time needed for thorough data documentation. Long-term planning (e.g., 50-year repository funding) is a crucial consideration. ADC, a project at the University of Guelph funded by multiple Canadian sources (CFREF, Genome Canada, UoG, OMAFA, Compute Ontario, etc.), aims to address these challenges by working directly with researchers. 
 Making Agri-food Data FAIR: A core objective of ADC is to make agri-food data FAIR:
 
 Findable: Ability to identify and locate data resources and their context. 
 Accessible: Ability to access (with permission) and use data once found, often requiring open protocols. 
 Interoperable: Using standards for data to ensure compatibility, including standard vocabularies. 
 Reusable: Data with sufficient context (licenses, provenance, descriptions) can be reused by others for replication or new research. Carly Huitema states: “Findable is the ability to identify and find resources as well as their context. If it’s accessible that once found you can access it with permission and use it interoperable. Certainly lots of our work at Trust Over IP is about how to ensure interoperability of standards including vocabularies and reusable that that there are licenses and provenance and other things that help make this data reusable.” 
 
 
 Data Requires Context: Data alone is insufficient; it needs context to be useful. This context includes details like sample source, analysis methods, data schemas, catalogue information, data licenses, data governance agreements, associated publications, methodologies, scripts, and contributors. 
 The Semantic Engine: ADC is developing the Semantic Engine, a suite of tools designed to help researchers create “rich contextual and machine-readable data schemas.”
 
 The Semantic Engine aims to make the process of documenting data less daunting for researchers. 
 It functions as a self-teaching web app, providing guidance and tutorials. 
 The engine uses the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) standard for writing schemas. 
 
 
 Data Schemas and Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA):
 
 A data schema describes the attributes of a dataset (e.g., columns in a table) and provides detailed information about them (type, units, description, format, etc.). 
 OCA is highlighted as an international and open standard for documenting schemas, developed by the Human Colossus Foundation. Two key advantages of OCA:
 
 Embeds Digests: OCA schemas can embed derived identifiers (digests/fingerprints) for the schema itself and for its constituent parts. This is crucial for reproducibility and authenticity of digital artifacts. 
 Organized by Features: OCA structures schemas by features (e.g., all descriptions, all units) rather than attribute by attribute (e.g., JSON-LD, XML Schema). This organization offers advantages:
 
 Task-based Governance: Allows for governance at the feature level (e.g., assigning responsibility for translation features). 
 Optimized for Feature Management: Facilitates adding or removing features (like languages or units) without altering the identifiers of other features. 
 Mix-and-Match: Enables easier combination and reuse of different schema components. 
 ADC has developed an “OCA Package” which wraps the core OCA standard with extensions for community-specific features and developing standards, allowing for gradual migration of these features to the core standard as they become accepted. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Assigned vs. Derived Identifiers:
 
 Assigned Identifiers (Names): Created by a governance body, linked to an object via a lookup table. Resolution requires trusting the authoritative governance body and their lookup table. “If you find an object, you cannot figure out the identifier – you must go to the authoritative body and look it up in their table.” Resolution services can only be hosted or delegated by the governance body. 
 Derived Identifiers (Digests/Fingerprints): Calculated directly from a digital object using a hashing function. They are unique fingerprints for a specific version of the object. Key for reproducibility and authenticity: “You can identify the resource originally used. You can verify the resource is the same one that was originally used.” Anyone can calculate a derived identifier, build a resolution service, and verify the resolution service is pointing to the correct object. Derived identifiers enable objects to be hosted in multiple locations. Carly Huitema humorously quotes, “If you liked it, then you should have put a digest on it.” Derived identifiers are excellent for snapshots but do not handle dynamic content or versioning directly. Versioning requires a governing authority or a decentralized identifier (DID) system where subsequent versions are linked and controlled. 
 
 
 Tools Provided by the Semantic Engine:
 
 Schema Authoring Web App: Guides researchers through creating machine-readable schemas. 
 Data Entry Excel Generator: Creates an Excel spreadsheet with headers and schema descriptions based on the authored schema, helping standardize data collection. Includes the schema’s derived identifier. 
 Data Entry on the Web / Data Verification Engine: A tool to verify data sets against the rules defined in a schema. Allows researchers to quickly check for inconsistencies before combining data from multiple sources. 
 
 
 Integration into Research Infrastructure: ADC is working to integrate their schemas and tools into existing Canadian and international research infrastructure.
 
 Schemas can be deposited into long-term research data repositories (e.g., Borealis in Canada), often receiving assigned identifiers like DOIs. 
 These schemas, with their embedded derived identifiers, can then be found through federated search engines that index multiple repositories (e.g., Lunaris in Canada, OpenAIRE in Europe).  
 This allows researchers to publish papers referencing schemas by their identifiers, enabling others to find and verify the schema used. 
 
 
 Addressing IP and Sensitive Data:
 
 The Semantic Engine itself does not store user data or schemas, reducing IP concerns related to the platform. 
 Schemas are generally less sensitive than the actual data, allowing them to be more openly shared. This enables discovery of datasets and potential collaborations without exposing proprietary information. 
 Schemas can include flags for sensitive data attributes (e.g., farm location). While ADC’s tools don’t currently enforce access controls based on these flags, this information in the machine-readable schema can be used by internal pipelines or other systems to manage sensitive data appropriately (e.g., triggering anonymization). 
 
 
 Future Directions: ADC plans to continue integrating with research infrastructure, add digests as identifiers to more objects, and develop tools for other machine-readable standards (e.g., cataloging metadata, policy rules). They also aim to increase the number of features supported in the schema description process (e.g., range rules, ontology framing). 
 
 
 
 Key Takeaways for ToIP 
 
 The FAIR data principles are highly relevant to decentralized ecosystems and align well with ToIP goals. 
 Derived identifiers (digests) offer significant advantages for reproducibility, authenticity, and decentralized resolution, making them a powerful tool for digital objects within a trust framework. 
 The architecture of data schemas (feature-by-feature vs. attribute-by-attribute) has implications for governance, versioning, and the application of derived identifiers to schema components. 
 Integrating decentralized identity and verifiable credentials concepts (like OCA) into existing research infrastructure can enhance discoverability, interoperability, and trust in scientific data. 
 The Semantic Engine provides a practical example of building user-friendly tools to generate machine-readable metadata, addressing the challenge of widespread adoption of such standards.

		<p>This document and podcast were generated by Google’s NotebookLM. They provide information about <a href="https://www.glia.net/richard-whitt">Richard Whitt</a>‘s vision for a more human-centric internet built on trust, as presented to the Ecosystem &amp; Governance Working Group (EGWG) of the Trust over IP Foundation on March 20, 2025. It also draws from materials related to the <a href="https://www.glia.net/">GLIA Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.glianetalliance.org/">GliaNet Alliance</a>, founded by Richard Whitt.</p>
<p>The current state of the web is characterized by surveillance capitalism, where companies prioritize data extraction and manipulation, leading to a lack of trust. Richard Whitt argues that this undermines human agency and necessitates a shift towards a web built on trustworthy intermediaries.</p>
<p>His proposed solution centers around the concept of Net Fiduciaries, a new category of entities that would prioritize users’ interests through the application of fiduciary duties like care and loyalty, similar to professionals in medicine and law. This would be a voluntary approach, driven by ethical considerations and good business practices, rather than imposed regulations on existing platforms.</p>
<p>The GliaNet Alliance is a coalition of companies and organizations committed to this vision. Its goal is to build a “web worthy of trust” by fostering ethical technology practices and using transformative governance principles. The alliance operates as a community of practice, with working groups focusing on areas like business models, policies, practices, and standards.</p>
<p>Key concepts discussed include:</p>
 
 The SEAMS cycle (Surveillance, Extraction, Analysis, Manipulation), which describes the problematic data practices prevalent on the web. 
 Glea, the ancient Greek word for glue, symbolizing trust as the social glue. 
 A multi-layered approach to change, encompassing governance, markets, technology (edge tech), and public policy. 
 The importance of authentic personal AI agents that operate on behalf of the user, contrasting with the “double agent” nature of current AI assistants that primarily serve platform interests. 
 The distinction between agenticity (capability) and agentiality (acting on behalf of) in AI systems. 
 The potential for interoperability between AI agents across different platforms. 
 
<p>The alliance is exploring ways to demonstrate trust to the public, potentially through analogies (like a “doctor for your web life”), marketing that emphasizes fiduciary duties, and clear communication about data handling practices. They are also considering mechanisms for recourse in case of breaches.</p>
<p>Richard Whitt’s book, “Reweaving the Web,” further elaborates on these ideas, outlining the problems with the current web and proposing practical steps to create a more user-centric digital future. The book has received positive testimonials from prominent figures in the tech and policy fields.</p>
<p>The GliaNet Alliance is in its early stages, focused on building its community, establishing governance structures, and exploring business models that align with its ethical principles. They are also engaging with policymakers and exploring potential collaborations, including with the Trust over IP Foundation. Consumer Reports is an anchor member and is exploring branding its AI agent as a GliaNet project. Kwaai.ai, an open-source LLM project, is also part of the alliance, aiming to build a platform with fiduciary duties to developers and agents.</p>

<p>At the 2025 RSAC Conference in San Francisco, our team met with dozens of industry experts, cybersecurity professionals, and investors to find out more about the biggest security technologies and trends that are impacting your business.&nbsp;</p>



 Tech-Specific Innovation 



<p>While AI was one of the hottest topics at the show, it wasn’t the&nbsp;only&nbsp;topic of discussion; we also heard a lot about the evolving ransomware ecosystem and what organizations need to be doing today to prepare for the arrival of “Q-Day”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But perhaps the second-biggest discussion piece was around identity and access security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the rise of AI-powered deepfakes and fraud attempts, we’re seeing more need than ever before for organizations to make the switch from passwords to more secure methods of authentication, such as Passkeys—and many experts were optimistic that this space will see a lot of adoption over the next year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key Insights:</p>



 
 Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance:&nbsp;“We’re going to see Passkey deployment continue to grow in regulated industries. That’s really important, because addressing the higher assurance use cases and taking passwords out of play there will give greater confidence for more and more companies to deploy Passkeys at scale, which will further accelerate our journey towards putting passwords fully in the rear-view mirror.”

<p>Microsoft has officially shifted to <a href="https://www.msspalert.com/news/world-password-day-puts-a-spotlight-on-passwords-passwordless">passkeys</a>, such as facial recognition, fingerprint scans, and PINs, as the default sign-in method for all new accounts beginning this month, marking its most significant step yet toward a password-free future, according to <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-microsoft-passwordless-world-password-day/">TechRepublic</a>.</p>



<p>The move coincides with World Password Day and aligns with the tech giant’s broader commitment to the Passkey Pledge, an industry initiative to eliminate passwords in favor of more secure, phishing-resistant login methods. In a blog post, Microsoft executives Joy Chik and Vasu Jakkal emphasized that passkey users are three times more likely to log in successfully than those using passwords. Although existing account holders can still use passwords, Microsoft is nudging them toward using biometrics or PINs by default. Nearly all Windows users already rely on Windows Hello, and the shift is backed by support from industry partners, including Apple and Google, who are also rolling out FIDO-compliant passkey systems across their platforms. The change promises to streamline security and user experience across the board.</p>

<p>FIDO-Based Authentication to Replace SMS-Based Verification, Says UK NCSC</p>



<p>The U.K. government is set to replace SMS-based verification systems for digital services with passkeys this year in a bid to shore up cyber defenses.</p>



<p>The initiative will be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/government-adopt-passkey-technology-digital-services">rolled out</a>&nbsp;by the U.K. National Cybersecurity Center using the open authentication standard Fast IDentity Online, or FIDO, as a more “secure and cost-effective solution.”</p>



<p>“The NCSC considers passkey adoption as vital for transforming cyber resilience at a national scale,” the NCSC said. “In addition to enhanced security and cost savings, passkeys offer users a faster login experience, saving approximately one minute per login when compared to entering a username, password and SMS code,” the agency said.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;FIDO Alliance&nbsp;announced today the launch of a new&nbsp;Payments Working Group&nbsp;(PWG) focused on developing and implementing FIDO authentication solutions specifically for payment use cases. This initiative marks a significant expansion of the organization’s efforts to eliminate password dependencies in critical digital transactions.</p>



<p>The new working group emerges at a time of growing momentum for&nbsp;passwordless authentication&nbsp;in the payments sector. Last year,&nbsp;<a href="https://idtechwire.com/visa-brings-passkeys-to-online-payments-in-major-fido-victory/">Visa implemented passkeys for online payments</a>, allowing customers to authorize transactions using&nbsp;biometric authentication&nbsp;rather than traditional passwords.</p>



<p>The Alliance, which now comprises over 250 members, has been steadily expanding its influence across various sectors of digital authentication.</p>

<p>Anyone setting up a new Microsoft account will soon find they’re encouraged to use a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/passwordless-authentication-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it-asap">passkey</a>&nbsp;during the sign-up process.</p>



<p>Microsoft introduced passkey support across most of its consumer apps last year, allowing users to sign into their accounts without the need for 2FA methods or remembering long passwords. A year later, it’s removing passwords as the default and encouraging all new signups to use passkeys.</p>



<p>PCMag attempted to sign up for a new Microsoft account on May 2, but it still asked for a password at the time of publication. Microsoft hasn’t shared an exact timeframe for when the change will take place, but you should expect it to happen in the coming days.</p>



<p>This is the first time a new account can be entirely passwordless. Previously, it had to have one alongside your passkey.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/05/01/pushing-passkeys-forward-microsofts-latest-updates-for-simpler-safer-sign-ins/">blog post</a>, Microsoft says 98% of passkey attempts to log in are successful, while passwords are only at 32%. Microsoft is also&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/new-user-experience-for-consumer-authentication/3822035">introducing</a>&nbsp;what it calls a “streamlined” sign-in experience for all accounts that “prioritizes passwordless methods for sign-in and sign-up.” It means some UX design changes to highlight passkey functionality.</p>

<p>WAO is currently working on a project with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/responsible-innovation-centre?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Responsible Innovation Centre for Public Media Futures</a> (RIC), hosted by the BBC. Our focus is on AI Literacy for 14–19 year olds and you can read more context in our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-does-ai-literacy-look-like-for-young-people-aged-14-19-8b4d798eb369">project kick-off blog post</a>.</p><p>One of the deliverables for this project is to review AI Literacy frameworks, with a view to either making a recommendation, or coming up with a new one. It’s not just a case of choosing one with a pretty diagram!</p><p>Frameworks are a way in which an individual or organisation can indicate what is worth paying attention to in a given situation. Just as the definition of ‘AI Literacy’ varies by context, the usefulness of a framework depends on the situation. In this post, we share the judgements we made using criteria we developed and share our process in case it is useful for your own work.</p> Narrowing down the list <p>While there can be some commonality and overlaps between frameworks for different contexts, the diversity of possible situations is huge. There can never be a single ‘perfect’ framework suitable for every situation. For example, just imagine what ‘AI Literacy’ might look like for (adult) engineers and developers compared with children of primary school age. As with <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/tag/web-literacy-map/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">our work at Mozilla</a> you can define what a ‘map’ of new literacies might look like, but it can only ever be one of many that describe the overall ‘territory’.</p><p>With our work on this project, we had to bear in mind our audience (14–19 year olds) and the mission of the BBC. There is a long history of Critical Media Literacy which is particularly relevant to our research here, and which was one of the factors when reviewing frameworks.</p><p>With a relatively short project timeline of three months, we needed a way to quickly classify approximately forty frameworks and related documents we have collected. We shared relevant details with <a href="https://perplexity.ai/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Perplexity AI</a> (using the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model) over multiple conversations. This helped us reduce our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQJ39Y1ic6DDDpyv9JzHGqQgdBnVeleCoXRXlI-J2uP8HO7YGy8SV9V5M7nDb9cYiAErK8jgx0DPneh/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;ref=blog.weareopen.coop">initial list of around 40 frameworks</a> to a more manageable 25.</p> Coming up with criteria <p>Next, we came up with some criteria by which to judge them. These criteria were informed by our own work in the area for 15+ years, along with either interviews or surveys with over 35 experts in the field. While these criteria are meant as a heuristic for this project, they are also a useful starting point for asking questions about any project relating to new literacies.</p>  Definition of AI — ensures everyone has the same starting point  Development process — adds transparency and credibility  Target audience — helps match the framework to its users  Real-world relevance — shows how ideas work in practice  AI safety and ethics — addresses both risks and responsible use  Skills and competencies listed — clarifies what learners should be able to do  Reputable source — increases trust in the framework  <p>We included both safety and ethics because both are needed for using AI in a responsible and trustworthy way.</p> Categorising the most relevant frameworks <p>We used a traffic light (red/yellow/green) categorisation system to score each framework on the above criteria. Only one of the frameworks we reviewed, the <a href="https://oecd.ai/en/classification?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">OECD Framework for Classifying AI Systems</a>, meets all criteria with a ‘green’ rating.</p><p>There are several other frameworks which we judge as meeting the criteria as ‘green’ except for one criterion (‘yellow’). Listed alphabetically by organisation, these are:</p>  <a href="https://digitalpromise.org/initiative/artificial-intelligence-in-education/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Artificial Intelligence in Education</a> (Digital Promise)  <a href="https://www.educause.edu/content/2024/ai-literacy-in-teaching-and-learning/executive-summary?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">AI Literacy in Teaching and Learning: A Durable Framework for Higher Education</a> (EDUCAUSE)  <a href="https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/projects-and-activities/education-and-training/digital-transformation-education/digital-competence-framework-citizens-digcomp_en?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Digital Competence Framework for Citizens</a> (European Commission)  <a href="https://www.goodthingsfoundation.org/policy-and-research/research-and-evidence/research-2024/ai-literacy?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Developing AI Literacy With People Who Have Low Or No Digital Skills</a> (Good Things Foundation)  <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000391105?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">AI competency framework for students</a> (UNESCO)  <p>There are other frameworks which we have decided to include which included two or more criterion as ‘yellow’. For example, the Open University’s <a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/learning-design/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OU-Critical-AI-Literacy-framework-2025-external-sharing.pdf?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Critical AI Literacy Framework</a>, Ng, et al’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X21000357?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">article</a>, and Prof. Maha Bali’s <a href="https://blog.mahabali.me/educational-technology-2/what-i-mean-when-i-say-critical-ai-literacy/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">blog post</a> linked from her <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/highereducation/2024/02/26/where-are-the-crescents-in-ai/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">framework</a> all do a good job of defining Critical AI Literacies. We would also note that the <a href="https://www.digitaleducationcouncil.com/form/ai-literacy-framework?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Digital Education Council</a>’s list of skills and competencies relating to AI Literacy is useful to pair with those from EDUCAUSE, UNESCO, and the European Commission.</p> Next steps <p>As mentioned earlier, our brief for this project involves either making an informed recommendation of a framework, or to come up with our own. We’re currently leaning toward the latter, but either choice will be the subject of a future blog post.</p><p>If you have questions, concerns, comments, or indeed a particularly useful resource which you think would be useful for this project, please do get in touch.

<p>After supporting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20690359/microsoft-windows-10-passwordless-password-option-update">passwordless Windows logins</a>&nbsp;for years and even allowing users to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675175/microsoft-account-passwordless-no-password-security-feature">delete passwords from their accounts</a>, Microsoft is making its biggest move yet toward a future with no passwords. Now it will ask people signing up for new accounts to only use more secure methods like passkeys, push notifications, and security keys instead, by default.</p>



<p>The new no-password initiative by Microsoft is accompanied by its recently launched,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636622/microsoft-account-sign-in-new-design-dark-mode">optimized sign-in window</a>&nbsp;design with reordered steps that flow better for a passwordless and passkey-first experience.</p>



<p>Although current accounts won’t have to shed their passwords, new ones will try and leave them behind by not prompting you to create a password at all:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As part of this simplified UX, we’re changing the default behavior for new accounts. Brand new Microsoft accounts will now be “passwordless by default.” New users will have several passwordless options for signing into their account and they’ll never need to enroll a password. Existing users can visit their account settings to delete their password.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With today’s changes, Microsoft is renaming “World Password Day” to “World Passkey Day” instead and pledges to continue its work implementing passkeys over the coming year. This time last year, the company implemented&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147124/microsoft-passkeys-support-consumer-msa">passkeys into consumer accounts</a>. Microsoft says it’s seeing “nearly a million passkeys registered every day,” and that passkey users have a 98 percent success rate of signing in versus 32 percent for password-based accounts.</p>

<p>As you’ll already know, today is&nbsp;<a href="https://betanews.com/2025/05/01/move-over-passwords-every-verification-method-has-its-day/">World Passkey Day</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a>&nbsp;has released an independent study of over 1,300 consumers across the US, UK, China, South Korea, and Japan to understand how passkey usage and consumer attitudes towards authentication have evolved.</p>



<p>The results are encouraging, they find 74 percent of consumers are aware of passkeys and 69 percent have enabled passkeys on at least one of their accounts.</p>



<p>Among those who have used passkeys, 38 percent report enabling them whenever possible. More than half of consumers now believe passkeys are both more secure (53 percent) and more convenient (54 percent) than passwords.</p>



<p>This increase in passkey adoption is likely driven by the shortcomings of passwords. Last year, over 35 percent of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities. In addition, 47 percent of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account.</p>



<p>To further encourage organizations to embrace the shift to passkeys, the FIDO Alliance has also launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">Passkey Pledge</a>, a voluntary pledge for online service providers and authentication product and service vendors committed to embracing passkeys.</p>



<p>“The establishment and growth of World Passkey Day reflects the fact that organizations of all shapes and sizes are taking action upon the imperative to move away from relying on passwords and other legacy authentication methods that have led to decades of data breaches, account takeovers and user frustration, which imperil the very foundations of our connected society,” says Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance. “We’re thrilled by the fact that over 100 organizations around the world signed our Passkey Pledge, and we are pleased to support the market in their march towards passkeys through a variety of freely available assets, including our market-leading Passkey Central resource center.”</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wpd-report-2025-consumer-password-passkey-trends/">full report</a>&nbsp;is available from the FIDO Alliance site.</p>

<p>Microsoft is on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/04/05/microsoft-confirms-password-deletion-for-windows-users-what-you-do-now/">mission to delete passwords</a>&nbsp;for a billion users, given that “<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/12/12/convincing-a-billion-users-to-love-passkeys-ux-design-insights-from-microsoft-to-boost-adoption-and-security/">the password era is ending</a>.” The Windows-maker warns users that “bad actors know it, which is why they’re desperately accelerating password-related attacks while they still can.” And those attacks are now making headlines weekly.</p>



<p>The answer is passkeys, which link your account security to your physical device security, which means unless an attacker has access to your hardware and unlock method — biometric or PIN, they can’t bypass a password to login.</p>



<p>More than others, Microsoft is not just promoting passkeys but also password deletion: “If a user has both a passkey and a password, and both grant access to an account, the account is still at risk for phishing. Our ultimate goal is to remove passwords completely and have accounts that only support phishing-resistant credentials.”</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a>, the organization charged with promoting passkeys has taken to the internet airwaves this time around to “launch a Passkey Pledge to further accelerate [the] global movement away from passwords.”</p>



<p>Its latest research found that “over 35% of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities, [and] 47% of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account. This is significant for passkey adoption, as 54% of people familiar with passkeys consider them to be more convenient than passwords, and 53% believe they offer greater security.”</p>



<p>FIDO has welcomed Microsoft’s password deletion as industry leading. “This is an exciting and seminal milestone as Microsoft is taking passwords out of play for over a billion user accounts,” its CEO Andrew Shikiar told me, “who can now instead leverage user-friendly, phishing-resistant passkeys. Microsoft’s leadership in doing so today will help encourage more service providers to do the same, which moves us collectively closer to the day when passwords are fully in our rear-view mirror.”</p>

 Moving past passwords is improving brand trust 



<p>The FIDO Alliance has also recently invited companies to participate in the World Passkey Pledge to create a more secure future, and move past the vulnerability and hassle of passwords.</p>



<p>Simon McNally, Cybersecurity Expert at Thales said, “Passwords have long been a weak link in digital security, forcing consumers and businesses into a frustrating cycle of password resets and potential breaches. We welcome the FIDO Alliance’s commitment to World Passkey Day and its push for a passwordless future. Passkeys provide a seamless and secure authentication experience, eliminating the risks and frustrations associated with traditional passwords.</p>



<p>Passkeys are automatically generated and securely stored, removing the burden of creating and managing complex passwords. They also enhance privacy by allowing authentication without sharing sensitive data, reducing the risk of breaches. As trust in digital security becomes more critical, businesses must prioritise passwordless solutions to protect users and build brand confidence.”</p>



 The Passkey Pledge for a Passwordless Future 



<p>To commemorate World Password Day (or at it will henceforth be known, World Passkey Day), the FIDO Alliance has released a<a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/fido-alliance-champions-widespread-passkey-adoption-and-a-passwordless-future-on-world-passkey-day-2025-302443727.html">&nbsp;survey</a>&nbsp;on the usage of passkeys which found that&nbsp;74% of consumers are aware of passkeys, meaning that consumers are aware of the potential value a passkey login experience can bring. To support this, the survey also found that&nbsp;69% of consumers have enabled passkeys on at least one of their accounts.</p>



<p>Furthermore, for those who have used passkeys,&nbsp;38% report enabling them whenever possible&nbsp;suggesting that some consumers already see the added user experience and security benefits passkeys bring. In fact,&nbsp;more than half of consumers believe passkeys are both more secure (53%) and more convenient (54%) than passwords. Many businesses and organizations have already signed the<a href="http://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">&nbsp;Passkey Pledge</a>, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and many more!</p>



 A pivotal moment 



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance, commented on both the recent survey, and the Passkey Pledge:</p>



<p>“This year’s World Passkey Day comes at a pivotal moment for user authentication around the world – with a rapidly growing number of service providers (including nearly half of the world’s top 100 websites) offering billions of user accounts the option to sign in with passkeys instead of passwords. Well&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">over 100 organizations</a>&nbsp;have taken the&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-launches-the-passkey-pledge-to-further-accelerate-global-movement-away-from-passwords/">Passkey Pledge</a>, indicating their commitment towards a future free from the risk and burdens of passwords.</p>



<p>Consumers are not only increasingly aware of passkeys, they’re using them more frequently: 69% of respondents to our recent survey are enabling them on at least one account, and 38% are now enabling them whenever possible.</p>



<p>Passkeys are so intuitive to use that once users integrate passkeys, they rarely go back. This is good for consumers who are frustrated by password reliant sign-in processes — 35% of whom said they experienced account compromises as a result of password vulnerabilities last year — and e-commerce retailers alike.</p>



<p>This shift isn’t just about innovation or bottom lines; it’s about rebuilding digital trust and creating a safer, more efficient internet for everyone.”</p>

<p>May 1, 2025</p>



<p>In recognition of World Passkey Day (formerly World Password Day), the FIDO Alliance is putting the spotlight on real-world passkey deployments from leading organizations around the globe. Read on for highlights of the successes companies in various industries are seeing from delivering faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins with passkeys—showcasing the global commitment to move away from passwords.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance also released today an independent study of consumers to understand how passkey usage and consumer attitudes towards authentication have evolved. The research found that in the last year, over 35% of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities. In addition, 47% of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account. This is significant for passkey adoption, as 54% of people familiar with passkeys consider them to be more convenient than passwords, and 53% believe they offer greater security.&nbsp;The full report is available <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/World-Password-Day-2025-Final.pdf">here</a>.</p>



<p>ABANCA’s mobile app serves over 1,200,000 customers a month, serving as the bank’s largest branch. Today, more than 42% of its mobile customers are using passkeys via the bank’s ABANCA Key product. As a result, more than 11,000,000 high-risk transactions have been protected without technical or service incidents, and due to the prioritization of UX, they have managed a Customer Effort Score (CES) of 4.7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aflac was the first major insurance company to adopt passkeys in the U.S. Aflac partnered with Transmit Security to launch their passkey authentication initiative Today, only the first phase of the project is complete and yet more than 500,000 Aflac customers have enrolled a passkey, resulting in a 32% reduction in password recovery requests. This has yielded 30,000 fewer calls per month to the call center for identity issues. Aflac reports that the highest enrollment rates occur at the point of registration, reinforcing the FIDO Alliance’s Design Guidelines recommendation to prompt customers during account-related tasks. The steady, organic adoption of passkeys by Aflac customers continues to grow daily and directly contributes to measurable improvements in cost reduction and customer experience.</p>



<p>KDDI now has more than 13.6 million au ID customers that use FIDO and has seen a dramatic decrease (down nearly 35%) in calls to their customer support center as a result. KDDI manages FIDO adoption carefully for both subscribers and non-subscribers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LY Corporation property Yahoo! JAPAN ID now has 28 million active passkeys users. Approximately 50% of user authentication on smartphones now uses passkeys. LY Corporation said that passkeys have a higher success rate and are 2.6 times faster than SMS OTP.</p>



<p>Mercari has seen 9 million users enroll with passkeys, and is enforcing passkey login for users who have enrolled with synced passkeys. Notably, there have been zero phishing incidents at Mercari Shop and Mercoin (a Mercari subsidiary) since March 2023.</p>



<p>Microsoft began rolling out passkeys for Microsoft consumer account in 2024. They now see nearly one million passkeys registered every day. Microsoft has found that users signing in with passkeys are three times more successful at getting into their account than password users (about 98% versus 32%), passkey sign-ins are eight times faster than traditional password + MFA flows, and passwordless-preferred UX has reduced password use by over 20%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nikkei rolled out passkeys in February and is already seeing thousands of customers using passkeys. Additionally, they are seeing almost no inquiries about how to use passkeys at the support desk.</p>



<p>NTT DOCOMO has increased its passkey enrollments and now passkeys are used for more than 50% of authentication by d ACCOUNT users. NTT DOCOMO notably reports significant decreases in successful phishing attempts and there have been no unrecognized payments at the docomo Online Shop since September 2022 where NTT DOCOMO continuously improved UX, including increasing the number of other passkey-enabled services.</p>



<p>Samsung Electronics’ Galaxy smartphones support fast and convenient logins through biometric authentication and FIDO protocols. Due to ease of use, speed, compatibility across services, and status as an industry standard made passkeys a compelling choice for Samsung Electronics.</p>



<p>VicRoads is the vehicle registration and driver licensing authority in Victoria, Australia. It registers over six million vehicles annually and licenses more than five million drivers. Within the first weeks of deployment with its passkey vendor Corbado, passkey adoption significantly exceeded VicRoads’ expectations. Users embraced the phishing-resistant authentication method, benefiting from a frictionless login experience optimized for speed and security. The exceptionally high passkey activation rate – peaking at 80% on mobile devices and over 50% across all platforms – led to 30% passkey login rate within the first seven weeks. Uptake continues to rise steadily, translating into measurable operational benefits, including reduced authentication-related support tickets, lower SMS OTP costs and improved user experience and security.</p>



<p>Zoho Corporation has rolled out passkeys to its 100+ million zoho.com customers and has seen a resulting 30% increase month over month in passkey adoption and a 10% drop in password reset queries. As a next step, the company will begin its rollout to Zoho Vault customers in May.</p>

<p>New global survey: More than two thirds of users familiar with passkeys turn to them for simpler, safer sign-ins as password pain persists</p>



<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., May 1, 2025 – With digital security more critical than ever, the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> is commemorating World Passkey Day 2025 with the release of an independent study of consumers across the U.S., U.K., China, South Korea, and Japan to understand how passkey usage and consumer attitudes towards authentication have evolved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research found that in the last year, over 35% of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities. In addition, 47% of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account. This is significant for passkey adoption, as 54% of people familiar with passkeys consider them to be more convenient than passwords, and 53% believe they offer greater security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>World Passkey Day serves as the FIDO Alliance’s annual call to action for individuals and organizations to adopt passkey sign-ins, making the web safer and more accessible.</p>



<p>Highlights from the research show consumer passkey awareness is on the rise and outlines several key trends in adoption among those who are aware of passkeys, including:</p>



 
 74% of consumers are aware of passkeys. 



 69% of consumers have enabled passkeys on at least one of their accounts. 



 Among those who have used passkeys, 38% report enabling them whenever possible. 



 More than half of consumers believe passkeys are both more secure (53%) and more convenient (54%) than passwords.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>The survey report is available at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wpd-report-2025-consumer-password-passkey-trends/">https://fidoalliance.org/wpd-report-2025-consumer-password-passkey-trends/</a>, which includes additional insights on how passkey adoption is trending with consumers and organizations to improve global digital access, authentication, and security.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The establishment and growth of World Passkey Day reflects the fact that organizations of all shapes and sizes are taking action upon the imperative to move away from relying on passwords and other legacy authentication methods that have led to decades of data breaches, account takeovers and user frustration, which imperil the very foundations of our connected society,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewshikiar/">Andrew Shikiar</a>, Executive Director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance. “We’re thrilled by the fact that over 100 organizations around the world signed our Passkey Pledge, and we are pleased to support the market in their march towards passkeys through a variety of freely available assets, including our market-leading Passkey Central resource center.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To further encourage organizations to embrace the shift away toward passkeys, the FIDO Alliance also launched the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge">Passkey Pledge</a>, a voluntary pledge for online service providers and authentication product and service vendors committed to embracing passkeys. The passkey pledge has received commitments from over 100 organizations in just over 20 days. A full list of companies that have taken the passkey pledge can be <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/#fill-out-the-form">found here</a>.</p>



<p>The availability of passkeys has steadily increased with implementation reaching 48% of the world’s top 100 websites as enterprises and service providers collectively seek to embrace a new era of faster sign-ins, higher success rates, fewer account takeovers, lower support costs, and reduced cart abandonment.</p>

 Notes to editors: 



 
 This SurveyMonkey online poll was conducted from April 13-14, 2025, among a global sample of 1,389 adults ages 18 and up. Respondents for this survey were selected from the nearly 3 million people who take surveys on the SurveyMonkey platform each day. Data for this survey has been weighted for age, race, sex, education, and geography to adequately reflect the demographic composition of the United States, United Kingdom, China, South Korea and Japan. The modeled error estimate for this survey is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. 



 To calculate the proportion of the world’s top websites and services that support passkeys, the FIDO Alliance combined publicly available information with its own data on passkey deployments.&nbsp; 
 



 About the FIDO Alliance 



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.

<p>Passkeys are no longer just a concept: The future of sign-in is here and consumers are ready. Built on the open authentication standards developed by theFIDO Alliance, passkeys are quickly gaining momentum among global service providers. Why? Because they offer africtionless, phishing-resistant, passwordless sign-in experience that is redefining digital security and user convenience. </p>



<p>Ahead of World Passkey Day 2025, the FIDO Alliance commissioned an independent survey of1,389 peopleacross theU.S., U.K., China, South Korea, and Japan to provide additional insights into how authentication preferences are evolving in real time. </p>



<p>The research shows people continue to struggle with traditional passwords: </p>



 
 36%of respondents said they’ve had at least one account compromised due to weak or stolen passwords.  



 48%admitted they’ve abandoned an online purchase simply because they forgot their password.

<p>Cisco, Dell Technologies, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Red Hat, and Others Support New Guidance to Effectively Manage Product Lifecycles Across the Software Supply Chain</p> 


<p>Boston, MA USA; 29 April 2025 — As organizations grapple with increasing cybersecurity risks linked to unsupported software and hardware, the need for timely, standardized End-of-Life (EoL) and End-of-Support (EoS) information is more critical than ever. In response, OASIS Open, the global open source and standards consortium, announced the publication of the <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/openeox/standardization-framework/openeox-standardization-framework-technical-report.pdf">OpenEoX White Paper</a>. Developed by the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/tc-openeox/">OpenEoX Technical Committee</a> (TC), the paper identifies major use cases for EoL security data, outlines current industry pain points, and introduces a roadmap for a standardized, machine-readable format for EoL disclosures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Knowing when software and hardware support ends shouldn’t be a guessing game. Managing product lifecycles effectively requires collaboration across the entire ecosystem, from commercial vendors to open-source maintainers,” said Omar Santos, OpenEoX co-chair and Cisco Distinguished Engineer. “OpenEoX introduces a much-needed, unified framework designed to streamline the exchange of End-of-Life (EoL) and End-of-Security-Support (EoSSec) data that enables transparency and efficiency.”</p>



<p>Developed by a global coalition of cybersecurity leaders from organizations including Cisco, Dell Technologies, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Red Hat, and others, the white paper defines the scope and architecture for an OpenEoX data model and lays the foundation for future technical specifications. These will support integration with the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF), Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), and other widely adopted cybersecurity standards.<br><br>“Standardizing how end of life, end of security support, and end of sales is handled for hardware and software makes the software supply chain more secure and efficient. This is especially important for developing and deploying AI systems securely,” said Brendan Burns, Microsoft Corporate Vice President and General Manager, Azure Cloud Native and Management Platform. “We’re pleased to contribute to this effort, increasing transparency, efficiency, and trust through better-informed consumers.”<br><br>The OpenEoX TC aims to standardize and promote OpenEoX, a unified, machine-readable approach to managing and sharing EoL/EoS information for both commercial and open source software and hardware. This approach helps vendors, consumers, and the broader security ecosystem reduce risks and improve operational resilience.</p>



<p>The TC encourages participation from product vendors, open source communities, security researchers, government agencies, and any organization managing EoL products. New members are welcome and participation in the TC is open to all through <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OASIS-OPEN-MEMBERSHIP-AGREEMENT_2024_TC.pdf">membership in OASIS</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Christopher Allen recently talked with Tereza Bízková in an interview that was published to the front page of Hackernoon. It was headlined <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-co-writer-of-tls-says-weve-lost-the-privacy-plot">“The Co-Writer of TLS Says We’ve Lost the Privacy Plot”</a>. In it, Christopher talks about what privacy means to him, what he thinks about recent privacy efforts, how centralization has become a problem, and how all of this connects to work done by the cypherpunks in the ’90s.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, Christopher answers the question: what would be non-negotiable for a new privacy-first system today? His answer unsurprisingly reflects our vision here at Blockchain Commons, built on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">data minimization</a>, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-progressive-trust/">progressive trust</a>, and limited scale.</p>

<p>Privacy is one of the fundamental <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">Gordian Principles</a>, but probably the one we talk about the least, as so much of our focus is on resilience (such as <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">#SmartCustody</a>) or on independence and openness (as reflected in our attention to <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-interop/">interoperability</a>). Read <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-co-writer-of-tls-says-weve-lost-the-privacy-plot">“The Co-Writer of TLS Says We’ve Lost the Privacy Plot”</a> for much more on why privacy is important and what exactly it is!</p>

 
 The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity Links 

<p>Christopher Allen is a long-term advocate for self-sovereign identity. He popularized the term and laid out an initial set of principles in his foundational article, <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">“The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>, coauthored the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.1/">DID spec for W3c</a>, and founded the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops</a> that advanced the technology for a decade.

<p>Describe your service/platform/product and how it’s using FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>Microsoft Account (MSA) powers consumer-facing experiences across services like Xbox, Microsoft 365, Copilot, and more. In 2023, Microsoft began rolling out passkey support across these services, allowing users to sign in with a face, fingerprint, or device PIN instead of a password. By integrating FIDO credentials, we made it easier, faster, and significantly more secure for over a billion users accessing their Microsoft accounts, by removing the need for passwords.</p>



<p>What were the challenges you were trying to overcome?</p>



<p>We set out to solve three major challenges:</p>



<p>Security: Passwords are inherently insecure and highly vulnerable to phishing and brute force attacks. In 2024, we observed more than 7,000 password attacks per second.</p>



<p>User experience: Passwords are frustrating—users forget them, reuse them, or mistype them. We wanted a sign-in experience that users could succeed at the first time, every time.</p>



<p>Adoption at scale: We needed a solution that could work across devices and platforms while meeting high usability expectations for a global user base.</p>



<p>Why did you choose FIDO authentication over other options? What did you identify as advantages of implementing FIDO?</p>



<p>FIDO credentials offer the ideal combination of security, usability, and interoperability. They are resistant to phishing and credential theft, and they eliminate the need for shared secrets like passwords. FIDO credentials also enable seamless cross-device and cross-platform experiences—critical for consumer use cases. In testing, we found that passkeys delivered both improved security and a dramatically better user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Describe your roll out of FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>Microsoft took a phased approach. We started by enabling passkeys for MSA sign-ins across consumer services like Xbox and Copilot. From there, we made UX changes to prioritize passwordless options. New Microsoft Accounts are now passwordless by default, and existing users are guided to enroll a passkey during or after sign-in. Throughout this process, we have worked closely with platform partners like Apple and Google, and continued our long-standing collaboration with the FIDO Alliance to ensure our approach aligns with industry standards. For a more detailed look at our approach, refer to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/12/12/convincing-a-billion-users-to-love-passkeys-ux-design-insights-from-microsoft-to-boost-adoption-and-security/">Convincing a billion users to love passkeys: UX design insights from Microsoft to boost adoption and security</a>.</p>



<p>What data points can you share that show the impact FIDO authentication has had?</p>



<p>The impact has been significant:</p>



 
 We now see over one million passkeys registered every day. 



 Users signing in with passkeys are three times more successful (95% success rate vs. 30% for passwords). 



 Passkey sign-ins are eight times faster than traditional password + MFA flows. 



 Our passwordless-preferred UX has already reduced password use by over 20%. 
 



<p>These results confirm that FIDO authentication improves security, boosts user satisfaction, and reduces operational burdens like password resets and support calls.</p>

<p>Describe your service/platform/product and how it’s using FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>Nikkei Inc. and the Nikkei Group pursues its mission “to be the most trusted, independent provider of quality journalism to a global community, helping our customers make better decisions.” We offer various media services, including the Nikkei, which serves as the cornerstone of our role as a news organization. The integrated ID platform supporting the Nikkei Group’s digital services, including our core service, the Nikkei Online Edition, is “Nikkei ID.”</p>



<p><br>Nikkei ID, which offers a wide range of services, has long faced the challenge of balancing security and usability. While we have implemented measures such as improving the login experience with OpenID Connect and introducing two-factor authentication and CAPTCHA (*1) to reduce the risk of unauthorized access, addressing security risks associated with password leaks and reuse, as well as countering increasingly sophisticated attacks, has been difficult.</p>



<p>(*1)A security authentication method to verify that a user is human.</p>



<p>In this context, as FIDO authentication has evolved and the threshold for introducing passkeys to services has lowered, Nikkei ID has proceeded with consideration and implementation with high expectations. Currently, we are expanding functionality to support not only web services but also mobile apps, and aiming to promote the adoption of passkeys through increased user awareness via internal and external blog posts, presentations, and guidance at the Nikkei ID Lounge Help Center.<br><br>What were the challenges you were trying to overcome?</p>



<p>The primary goal is to balance security and user experience. Many Nikkei ID users are not accustomed to digital services, so simply enhancing security is not enough. For example, while the introduction of CAPTCHA can prevent brute-force password attacks, it can also become a barrier for users who cannot pass the Turing test (*2), leading to increased support inquiries and added burden on customer service.</p>



<p>(*2) A test to determine whether something is ‘human-like’.</p>



<p>However, FIDO authentication (passkeys) achieves high security and user experience through integration with OS and platforms as a standard. This allows us to replace security measures that reduce risks associated with password authentication but negatively impact UX with passkeys.<br><br>Why did you choose FIDO authentication over other options? What did you identify as advantages of implementing FIDO?</p>



<p>The following two options were considered as alternatives to FIDO authentication (passkeys):</p>



 
 Mandatory implementation of two-factor authentication such as TOTP or email verification 



 Social login using other ID platforms 
 



<p>As a result of comparing these options, we believe FIDO authentication (passkeys) offers the following advantages:</p>



 
 It allows for gradual transition by adding authentication on top of existing password authentication&nbsp; 



 It enables the use of higher UX authentication methods such as biometric authentication&nbsp; 



 It fundamentally resolves the risks associated with passwords 
 



<p>When it came to actual implementation, the aspect of “additional authentication” was particularly significant. In other words, it allows for implementation in a loosely coupled and highly cohesive manner without disrupting the existing ID model. The WebAuthn specification provides simple interface libraries and APIs for both backend and frontend on each platform, making secure implementation easy. Additionally, since existing authentication methods can be retained, the advantage of not significantly increasing support workload was also substantial.</p>



<p>Describe your roll out of FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>We implemented our own solution using the open-source backend library WebAuthn4J for FIDO authentication. We chose WebAuthn4J not only for its clear data model but also because it passed the FIDO2 Test Tools provided by the FIDO Alliance. For the frontend, we developed our own implementation that directly interacts with the WebAuthn API. Additionally, we created a test library to emulate FIDO authentication, enabling 24-hour automated testing as a comprehensive test of these implementations.</p>



<p>The rollout of FIDO authentication (passkeys) was carried out in the following steps:</p>



 
 Internal beta testing to gather feedback and monitor usage 



 White-box and black-box testing by external security companies 



 Public release to all users 
 



<p>What data points can you share that show the impact FIDO authentication has had?</p>



<p>Since it was just released in February this year, we cannot provide detailed numbers yet, but thousands of users are already using passkeys. Additionally, we have heard that there have been almost no inquiries about how to use passkeys at the support desk, and we recognize that passkeys are being used smoothly.</p>



<p>Resources</p>



<p>The test library that emulates FIDO authentication, mentioned in the implementation section, is publicly available as Nikkei’s open-source software. You can obtain it from the following <a href="https://github.com/Nikkei/nid-webauthn-emulator">https://github.com/Nikkei/nid-webauthn-emulator</a></p>



<p>For authorization after completing FIDO authentication (passkeys), we use Authlete, an OpenID Connect platform. In this case study, we express our enthusiasm for the introduction of FIDO authentication (passkeys). (At the time of this presentation in 2023, passkeys were still under consideration)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authlete.com/ja/resources/videos/20231212/02/">https://www.authlete.com/ja/resources/videos/20231212/02/</a></p>

 VicRoads achieves up to 80% industry-leading passkey activation rate for nearly 5 million users with Corbado 



<p>Background: VicRoads</p>



<p>VicRoads is the vehicle registration and driver licensing authority in Victoria, Australia. It registers over six million vehicles annually and licenses more than five million drivers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operating as a joint venture between the Victorian State Government, Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust, and Macquarie Asset Management, VicRoads is a critical provider of public services in the state.</p>



<p>Challenge: seamless and cost-effective authentication for government services&nbsp;</p>



<p>VicRoads aims to become Australia’s most trusted digital government service providers by delivering secure, frictionless services to millions of people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the importance of the data that VicRoads holds on behalf of its customers, security has always been a primary consideration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the past, to support protection of customer data, VicRoads mandated multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts via SMS one-time passwords (OTPs) and authenticator apps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys leverage biometrics, facial recognition, a PIN or a swipe pattern in the sign-in process. Unlike traditional MFA, passkeys require both the device storing the private key and local authentication, meaning they are both phishing-resistant and cost-effective.</p>



<p>Solution: Corbado provides a no-risk, passkey-first solution with minimal integration effort</p>



<p>&nbsp;VicRoads worked with passkey vendor Corbado, prioritizing a proven approach rather than building a solution from scratch.</p>



<p>Corbado’s deep understanding of both customer experience and the latest authentication technology gave VicRoads confidence that customers would find using passkeys easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corbado also provided in-depth technical guidance on passkey-specific challenges, including browser compatibility, recovery flows and user experience optimizations – further solidifying VicRoads’ confidence.</p>



 



<blockquote>
<p>“We selected Corbado because it could integrate passkey functionality into our existing infrastructure without disruption to our customers and operations”, said Crispin Blackall, Chief Technology Officer, VicRoads.</p>
</blockquote>



 



<p>Implementation: pre-built, passkey-optimized components &amp; SDKs enable quick integration</p>



<p>Corbado Connect seamlessly integrated with VicRoads’ existing infrastructure and CIAM, which is deeply embedded within the organization’s enterprise stack. This passkey enablement was achieved without requiring a migration of user data or authentication methods, ensuring a smooth and efficient transition for millions of users.</p>



<p>By layering passkey functionality on top of VicRoads’ current authentication system, Corbado enabled a frictionless deployment while preserving all existing user credentials. This approach eliminated the disruption and risks often associated with introducing new technology.</p>



<p>To ensure a smooth transition, VicRoads implemented passkeys in a phased rollout, beginning with personal customers. This gradual deployment, supported by Corbado Connect’s rollout controls, enabled VicRoads to monitor performance, address potential issues and optimize the user experience before seamlessly extending passkey authentication to partner and business customers.</p>



<p>Results: customers love passkeys, with up to 80% passkey activation rate in the first weeks</p>



<p>Within the first weeks of deployment, passkey adoption significantly exceeded VicRoads’ expectations. Users embraced the phishing-resistant authentication method, benefiting from a frictionless login experience optimized for speed and security.</p>



<p>The exceptionally high passkey activation rate – peaking at 80% on mobile devices and over 50% across all platforms – led to 30% passkey login rate within the first seven weeks. Uptake continues to rise steadily, translating into measurable operational benefits, including:</p>



 
 Reduced authentication-related support tickets 



 Lower SMS OTP costs 



 Improved user experience and security. 
 



<p>So far, VicRoads has successfully rolled out passkeys on its web portal. The next step is to integrate passkeys into its native apps – myVicRoads and myLearners – allowing users to leverage their existing passkeys without additional setup. Ultimately, once passkeys are fully implemented across all digital platforms, VicRoads aims to eliminate passwords entirely, maximizing security and fully embracing a passwordless future.</p>



 



<blockquote>
<p>“Passkeys are easy to use, without compromising on security. We’re excited to give our customers a simpler, more secure way to handle their registration and licensing services,” said Crispin Blackall, Chief Technology Officer, VicRoads.</p>
</blockquote>



 



<p>Opportunity: setting a new standard for government authentication&nbsp;</p>



<p>With one of the largest public sector passkey deployments globally, VicRoads has established itself as a digital leader in authentication modernization for government applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Achieving high adoption rates without disruption, VicRoads has proven that large-scale organisations can enhance security and improve user experience simultaneously. This success positions VicRoads as a benchmark for other government agencies looking to modernize their authentication strategies.</p>



 



<blockquote>
<p>“Passkeys represent a paradigm shift in how we authenticate users to digital identity services,” said Andrew Shikiar, Chief Executive Officer of the FIDO Alliance. “VicRoads’ adoption of passkeys showcases how government agencies can leverage this industry-wide innovation to protect people’s data while simplifying access to critical services. This is a significant step towards a more secure and efficient digital future for Victoria and beyond.”</p>
</blockquote>



 



<p>Next Steps: developing next generation authentication</p>



<p>VicRoads’ ongoing partnership with Corbado ensures it remains at the forefront of authentication innovation while maintaining a seamless user experience for its expanding digital service base. A key advantage of Corbado’s managed passkey service is its built-in adoption-enhancing optimisations, ensuring continuous improvements and seamless WebAuthn conformity with all future WebAuthn updates.</p>



<p>With this initiative, VicRoads has paved the way for broader adoption of passkeys in the government and public sector, proving that secure, frictionless authentication at scale is achievable.</p>

<p>Describe your service/platform/product and how it’s using FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>Our mobile banking app is our bank’s largest branch, serving over 1,200,000 customers each month. These customers require the best protection against identity theft attacks, and we provide the most robust and innovative solutions, always prioritizing the best user experience. ABANCA Key is a new identity verification service based on FIDO standards. It was launched after years of research by leading players to prevent identity theft attacks. Using passkeys, ABANCA Key provides the highest level of protection. It is impossible to guess or reuse them, so they protect our customers’ private information from attackers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What were the challenges you were trying to overcome?</p>



<p>On one hand, there’s the security challenge. The rise of phishing through calls and SMS messages in Spain has become a plague and a real problem for administrations, mobile operators, and financial institutions but on the other hand, there was the need to maintain the best user experience with the least friction. Passkeys give us a framework for interoperability and standardization, which provides us with ease of implementation and deployment. However, above all, and for the first time in the security industry, it provides a framework of homogeneity to achieve a frictionless user experience.</p>



<p>Why did you choose FIDO authentication over other options? What did you identify as advantages of implementing FIDO?</p>



<p>We chose FIDO for many reasons: for its future strategy, as it allows us to follow many ways, including MFA and passwordless, for trust, as the FIDO Alliance includes leading players in security, operating systems, infrastructure, and mobile ecosystem; and for the standardization and homogenization what it give us, which reduces implementation, deployment and roll out times.</p>



<p>Describe your roll out of FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>To deliver the best user experience, we’re committed to having the deepest possible understanding of the technology. This enables us to effectively identify and resolve issues, and to better understand user behavior. We became our own partner by developing our own platform based on the FIDO standard and certifying it as if it were a provider.</p>



<p>We rolled out the deployment in phases. In under five months, we had the development of both server and&nbsp; front-end (iOS and Android) ready, and we began the rollout in an initial phase with our employees, and subsequently to end customers in batches. In just seven months, we were already in a general roll out to all customers.</p>



<p>What data points can you share that show the impact FIDO authentication has had?</p>



 
 More than 42% of our customers are already using ABANCA Key 



 More than 11,000,000 high-risk transactions has been protected with ABANCA Key without technical or service incidents&nbsp; 



 Customer roll out ran without technical or service incidents, and most importantly, with our customer journey UX to sign in ABANCA Key and to use it, we’ve managed a Customer Effort Score (CES) of 4.7.&nbsp;

<p>Somewhere, in his daily online journey, he was prompted by a website or application — a “relying party” in authentication lingo — to create a passkey. But the benefit wasn’t clear to him. Nor did there seem to be any urgency. He figured I’d know&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-are-passkeys-how-going-passwordless-can-simplify-your-life-in-2025/">what passkeys are</a>&nbsp;and what to do the next time he gets a nudge to set one up.

<p>Your phone, computer and tablet is now at risk, as the nightmare of AI-powered attacks comes true. There are now multiple warnings into the use of mainstream AI platforms to design, develop and even execute attacks that are almost impossible to detect.</p>



<p>To add to recent reports from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/ai-agent-attacks">Symantec</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://cofense.com/blog/microsoft-copilot-spoofing-a-new-phishing-vector">Cofense</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://labs.guard.io/vibescamming-from-prompt-to-phish-benchmarking-popular-ai-agents-resistance-to-the-dark-side-1ec2fbdf0a35">Guardio</a>&nbsp;also now warns that “with the rise of Generative AI, even total beginners can now launch sophisticated phishing scams — no coding skills needed. Just a few prompts and a few minutes.”</p>



<p>And&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/04/16/cyber-signals-issue-9-ai-powered-deception-emerging-fraud-threats-and-countermeasures/">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;has just told users the same. “AI has started to lower the technical bar for fraud and cybercrime actors looking for their own productivity tools, making it easier and cheaper to generate believable content for cyberattacks at an increasingly rapid rate… AI-powered fraud attacks are happening globally.”</p>

<p>ABANCA has achieved international FIDO certification for the Llave ABANCA service, the digital identity verification technology solution developed by the bank that allows customers to validate mobile banking transactions securely and quickly by unlocking their phone.</p>



<p>The FIDO (&nbsp;Fast IDentity Online&nbsp;) certification has been granted by the FIDO Alliance, the leading international association promoting digital authentication standards that are more robust and simpler than passwords or one-time codes. This consortium is made up of the world’s leading technology companies—Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Visa, among others—who have joined forces to promote more robust and user-friendly digital identity methods. With the FIDO certification of Llave ABANCA, this global alliance accredits that the solution implemented by the bank meets the highest standards of online identity verification.</p>

 Ecosystem-Orchestrator für die Deutsche EUDI-Wallet 



<p>Die Einführung der EUDI-Wallet in Deutschland, basierend auf der novellierten eIDAS-Verordnung, stellt eine zentrale Herausforderung dar, um bis 2026 eine sichere, digitale Identitätslösung für Bürger bereitzustellen. Ziel ist es, ein umfassendes Ökosystem zu schaffen, das öffentliche Institutionen, privatwirtschaftliche Akteure und Regulierungsbehörden integriert. Dieses Ökosystem soll nicht nur technische Standards und Prozesse etablieren, sondern auch die Akzeptanz der Bürger fördern und die rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen gewährleisten.</p>



<p>Die Autoren dieses Whitepapers schlagen eine Public-Private-Partnerschaft in Form einer Genossenschaft als neutralen Ecosystem-Orchestrator vor. Diese Genossenschaft soll:</p>



 
 Demokratische Governance&nbsp;bieten, mit transparenter Kontrolle und Einflussmöglichkeiten für alle Mitglieder. 



 Kostendeckendes Finanzierungsmodell&nbsp;durch Mitgliedsbeiträge und Sonderzuwendungen implementieren. 



 Zentrale Aufgaben&nbsp;wie Zertifizierung von Wallets, Registrierung von Verifizierungsstellen und Förderung der Kommunikation zwischen Akteuren übernehmen. 
 



 Herausforderungen für die neue Bundesregierung 



<p>Die Bundesregierung ist durch die Verordnung [(EU) 2024/1183] dazu verpflichtet, bis Ende 2026 eine EUDI-Wallet für alle Bürger bereitzustellen, in der Ausweisdaten in elektronischer Form sicher gespeichert werden können. Die vollständige Umsetzung des EUDI-Wallet Ökosystem hat bis 2027 zu erfolgen. Das Bundesinnenministerium bereitet seit Mai 2023 die Konzeptionierung und Umsetzung der deutschen Wallet-Lösung federführend vor. Um die Akzeptanz bei den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern zu fördern, ist es nicht nur erforderlich, die technische Infrastruktur bereitzustellen, sondern auch ein umfassendes Ökosystem aufzubauen. In diesem Ökosystem interagieren privatwirtschaftliche Akzeptanzstellen, zertifizierte Vertrauensdienste, öffentliche Einrichtungen aus Bund und Ländern sowie Regulierungsbehörden und Zertifizierungsstellen miteinander. Der Aufbau eines solchen Ökosystems stellt eine hochkomplexe Aufgabe dar. Sie erfordert die Etablierung von Standards und Prozessen, die von allen beteiligten Privatunternehmen und öffentlichen Institutionen geteilt und umgesetzt werden können. Dabei steht die Berücksichtigung der Interessen der Bürgerinnen und Bürger im Vordergrund. Zudem müssen alle rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen eingehalten, die missbräuchliche Nutzung persönlicher Daten verhindert und ein attraktives Investitionsumfeld für die Unternehmen der Privatwirtschaft geschaffen werden.</p>



 Aufbau des EUDI-Wallet Ökosystems als Public-Private Partnership mit neutraler Governance 



<p>Die Autoren dieses Whitepapers plädieren für eine Public-Private-Partnerschaft als Ecosystem Orchestrator, die sich in einer Genossenschaft organisiert. Die Genossenschaft hat den Zweck, die Interessen aller Genossenschaftsmitglieder – also aller Akteure im EUDI-Wallet Ökosystem – gleichermaßen zu fördern. Die Genossenschaft benötigt eine demokratische Governance, die Einfluss, Kontrolle und Transparenz ggü. den Mitgliedern ermöglicht. Sofern die Genossenschaft selbst keine Investitionen tätigt, sollte ihre Satzung eine not-for-profit Klausel beinhalten, sodass lediglich die Kosten gedeckt werden müssen, die sich am Bedarf der Mitglieder orientieren.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Genossenschaft sollte durch die nachstehenden Organe gesteuert werden.</p>



 
 Generalversammlung: Bildet das höchste Entscheidungsgremium der Genossenschaft. Jedes Mitglied erhält ein Stimmrecht. Die Summe der Stimmen von Nicht-Europäischen bzw. investierenden Mitgliedern darf 25% nicht überschreiten. 



 Vorstand: Führt das Tagesgeschäft und übernimmt die Verantwortung für die Umsetzung der Governance und der Strategie. 



 Aufsichtsrat: Bildet das Kontrollorgan des Vorstands. 



 Ecosystem Coach: Stabstelle als Mediator zwischen den Akteuren zur Offenlegung und Management von Interessenskonflikten. 
 



<p>Öffentliche Institutionen sollten die Genossenschaft gründen, ein Regelwerk in Form einer Satzung definieren und den Beitritt von Akteuren der Privatwirtschaft ermöglichen. Es sind dabei sämtliche Akteure der Rollen aus der eIDAS-Novelle wie bspw. PID-Provider, Pub-EAA-Provider, (Qualified) Trust Service Provider, Wallet Provider und Trust List Provider einzubinden.</p>



<p>Finanzierungskonzept: DieFinanzierung der Betriebskosten erfolgt durch Mitgliedsbeiträge. Werden temporärMittel für bestimmte Zwecke benötigt, kann eine Finanzierung in Form von Sonderzuwendungen der Mitglieder erfolgen.</p>



<p>Aufgaben: Interessen der Mitglieder fördern, Kommunikation zwischen den Mitgliedern erleichtern, Wallets zertifizieren, Verifizierungsstellen registrieren, rechtliche Fragestellungen klären, öffentliche Kommunikation bündeln, Durchdringung der EUDI-Wallet messbar machen, Schnittstellen bereitstellen, etc.</p>



<p>Opt-Out: Die Mitgliedschaft kann ordentlich gekündigt werden. Erkenntnisse aus einer Risikoanalyse zu Opt-Out Szenarien sollten bei der Erstellung der Satzung berücksichtigt werden.</p>



 Fazit 



<p>Um das Ökosystem für die deutsche EUDI-Wallet aufzubauen ist ein neutraler Ecosystem-Orchestrator erforderlich, der gemeinsam mit öffentlichen und privatwirtschaftlichen Organisationen ein Ökosystem für die deutsche EUDI-Wallet aufbaut. Dies kann, wie vorliegend aufgezeigt, durch eine Genossenschaft abgebildet werden, in der alle Akteure des Ökosystems kartellrechtskonform und strukturiert kooperieren.</p>

<p>Over the past three years, a dedicated research team from IDunion has been working intensively on the Digital Product Passport (DPP). &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the last two years, our focus shifted from theory ( a joint publication with key partners [→ read the paper <a href="https://idunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2023-03-27_IDunion-AP-10.5_Whitepaper_V1.01_final.pdf">here</a>]) to hands-on implementation resulting in a Demo – &nbsp;DPP solution that is:</p>



 
 Data Carrier Agnostic: The product link can be embedded into any data carrier listet in <a href="https://standict.eu/landscape-analysis-report/landscape-digital-product-passport-standards">Landscape of Digital Product Passport Standards | StandICT.eu 2026</a>. 



 Product Agnostic: Our DPP works with any type of product, whether batch-based, lot-based or individual instances. 



 Automatic Identification of the Requester: The solution aligns with #eIDAS2.0 by supporting decentralized identification of individuals and organizations. 



 Technology Stack Independent: The DPP can be accessed without downloading a additional app and lowers the threshold for adoption and enhances usability. 



 Lightweight &amp; Semantically Rich: Information is delivered &nbsp;through Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and semantic data schemas, ensuring seamless interoperability. Additionally, we use W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to guarantee unique, globally resolvable product IDs. 



 Cryptographically Verifiable: All data within the DPP is cryptographically signed, enabling validation of authenticity and trust without central intermediaries. 



 Trust Infrastructure Support: Establishing trust over the data and integration with Digital Identity Trust Anchors is possible, ex by using the eIDAS 2.0 mechanism and the EU Trust infrastructure proposed for natural and legal entities. 
 



 Demonstration: Digital Product Passport System for Battery 



<p>Our final demo phase featured a live demonstration of a DPP tied to a battery cell used in an electric scooter.</p>



<p>The goal was to simulate how a real-world DPP can accompany a product through its entire lifecycle — from raw material extraction to end-of-life recycling.</p>



<p>We explored the perspectives and requirements of key stakeholders, including: Miners, Battery pack manufacturers, Economic operators, Consumer, Recyclers and Government and public interest organizations</p>



<p>Through interactive demonstrations, we answered key questions in real time, illustrating how a decentralized, interoperable, and trustworthy DPP can benefit every actor along the value chain.</p>

  <p>In early 2025, Blockchain Commons architected and engineered a major project for the Zcash blockchain: the ZeWIF specification that allows all of its wallets to interoperate.</p>

  <p>Interoperability is something that I consider vitally important for a technological ecosystem, so I was thrilled that Blockchain Commons could improve interoperability for Zcash. Here’s a bit more on why, what Blockchain Commons did for Zcash, and what I’d like to do for other technological communities.</p>
</blockquote>

 The Limits of Interop 

<p>Obviously, some level of interop is necessary for any ecosystem, or it just wouldn’t work. There was a white paper and there are BIPs for Bitcoin; without them, no one could agree on how the blockchain works. We similarly have specifications, RFCs, and standards for everything from email to graphics file formats.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are limits to interop. Standards tend to cover the things that are required for the broadest level of intercommunication within an ecosystem. But when companies begin to work on their own apps, their work often turns proprietary—sometimes aggressively so—and that limits a technological ecosystem’s ability to continue to grow.</p>

<p>As an example, email has standards such as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322">RFC 5322</a> for how mail servers communicate with each other. When mailers begin storing their mail, things become somewhat more balkanized: you might use a classic <code>mbox</code> format or a single-message <code>eml</code> format or a proprietary format such as Microsoft Outlook’s <code>msg</code>. Finally, there’s no consistency at all for how mailers might algorithmically filter messages: it’s hard to control whether a message ends up in the “Important”, “Everything Else”, or even “Spam” category of Gmail, even if a mailer adopts newer standards such as DKIM, DMARC, and SPF.</p>

<p>Yet, all of these types of interactions are important. If a mail ends up in a Spam folder, that’s almost as bad as it not being delivered at all; if mail can’t be restored from a proprietary mailbox, it’s lost as well. That’s why interop is important.</p>

 The Power of Interop 

<p>I developed four core architectural fundamentals for Blockchain Commons that I call the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">Gordian Principles</a>. Of them, Privacy is only peripherally related to the question of interoperability, but the other three highlight why interop is important for the health of any technological ecosystem.</p>

 
   Independence is a user-focused principle. It says that users should be free from external control. This is the heart of my ideas of <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a>, and it’s the heart of interoperability too. With the ability to export or exchange data in an interoperable way, users don’t get locked into a single platform. Instead, they can choose among a variety of options to find an application, service, or pricing structure that meets their precise needs. 
   Resilience is a data-focused principle. It says that data should be protected from loss. When data output and exchange formats are standardized for interoperability, they become widely used and widely understood. That ensures that they can be recovered far into the future. If you’ve ever tried to recover an old ClarisWorks or WordStar file, you’ve seen how much a non-interoperated file format can damage resilience. In comparison, <code>.rtf</code> files will never be lost and even <code>.docx</code> is pretty good—both because Microsoft Word has an enormous install base and because it’s an XML-based output format. 
   Openness is a creator-focused principle. It says that infrastructure should be open so that new creators can join the ecosystem. When communication is standardized, anyone can develop in accordance with the standards, including newcomers. But, this isn’t just beneficial to creators, it’s also beneficial to users. Without new entrants, an ecosystem can become staid and stagnant. With new entrants, an ecosystem is constantly innovating and expanding. It creates an atmosphere of coopetition: members of the ecosystem cooperate to interoperate, but then compete to offer the best products within those standards. 
 

<p>In other words, interoperability is beneficial for the vast majority of members of the ecosystem: users get more options, more innovations, and freedom of choice; creators get the ability to fairly participate and compete; and data gets strong protections far into the future.</p>

 What We Did for Zcash 

<p>I was thrilled when members of the Zcash community started talking with me about their needs, because it showed a strong, ecosystem-wide understanding of the need for inteoperability.</p>

<p>But there was also a strong inciting incident that led to the Zcash work: the older <a href="https://z.cash/support/zcashd-deprecation/">zcashd server was being deprecated</a> and so there was a need to migrate digital-asset data from its wallet to others. This also reflected a longer-term issue. Digital assets had sometimes been <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/shifting-from-zeclite-to-zashi/47756">lost during previous migrations</a> due to differences or even bugs in different wallets.</p>

<p>Obviously, a one-off migrator could have been created, likely linking zcashd with its replacement wallet, <a href="https://github.com/zcash/wallet">zallet</a>. But I approached things from an architectural point of view: I wanted to create an extensible Wallet Interchange Format (that’s the “eWIF” in “ZeWIF”) that would not just enable the zcashd migration, but also allow any migration from one wallet to another within the Zcash ecosystem. I wanted to take the immediate needs and political will and turn it into something that could benefit the community for years to come.</p>

<p>That was the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashCommunityGrants/zcashcommunitygrants/issues/3">ZeWIF proposal</a> that we put forth. It called for one month of studying Zcash wallet data as it currently exists, then another two months of developing the spec and writing libraries to convert among different wallets using that spec. (That timeline turned out to be a bit ambitious, but we’re closing out the initial design with a fourth month of work.)</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the above diagram shows, the <code>zewif</code> Rust crate lies at the center of the ZeWIF system. It creates in-memory representations of data from a variety of inputs and can output that abstracted data in a numbers of forms. Obviously, it can accept input from ZeWIF files and it can output to ZeWIF files. However, that’s just part of the process. Individual developers can also choose to use create front ends that import data from their wallets to <code>zewif</code> and back ends that export the data from <code>zewif</code> to their wallets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we release ZeWIF into the ecosystem, we should see advancements in accordance with the Gordian principles:</p>

 
   Independence. Users will be able to move their funds easily among Zcash wallets. 
   Resilience. Translation of keys and seeds should be more reliable, and if conversion is done using our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zmigrate/blob/master/docs/bestpractices.md">best practices</a>, there should be clear warnings if anything wansn’t converted. 
   Openness. New wallets can join the ecosystem. If they have innovative features, they can easily pick up new users if they support ZeWIF as an import format. 
 

<p>I’ve been thrilled to have strong support from wallet makers in the Zcash community. That type of buy-in is required to make interoperability work. <a href="https://zingolabs.org/">Zingo Labs</a>, the makers of the Zingo wallet, introduced us to the opportunity and have worked closely with us to fulfill our vision. Meanwhile, <a href="https://z.cash/ecosystem/electric-coin-company/">ECC</a> has been our next testbed, since they’re using ZeWIF to manage conversions between zcashd and zallet. Other principals have been involved as well, and just as importantly we didn’t receive any pushback from anyone who refused to use the format. (Not everyone has adopted it yet, but we’re just finalizing the complete ZeWIF draft at this point.)</p>

<p>We were fortunate, because that’s not always the case.</p>

 What We Did for Bitcoin 

<p>This isn’t Blockchain Commons’ first rodeo. Creating interoperability has been Blockchain Commons’ goal since the start, and we’ve done most of our interop work to date with Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Our two biggest successes for Bitcoin have been <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/animated-qrs/">Animated QRs</a> and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">SSKR</a>. Animated QRs are a standardized way to move large files across airgaps. That’s the exact sort of intercommunication that has always required interoperability. SSKR is a standardized way to shard a secret, currently focused on Shamir’s Secret Sharing. Because it isn’t just about intercommunication, getting a variety of companies to use it was a bigger victory, because it ensures those secrets will remain accessible and resilient into the far future. Both technologies are integrated with our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/">Uniform Resources</a>, which have been implemented by <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/implementations/">more than a dozen companies</a>, offering true interoperability.</p>

<p>But these successes have unfortunately been piecemeal. There’s just one company that I’m aware of that’s adopted a pretty wide swath of Blockchain Commons’ Gordian specifications, and that’s our long-time sponsor, <a href="https://foundation.xyz/">Foundation</a>. We  most recently worked with them to support <a href="https://community.foundation.xyz/t/quantumlink/291">QuantumLink</a>, a Post-Quantum-Cryptopgraphy (PQC) method of Bluetooth communication that’s in their new <a href="https://foundation.xyz/buy-passport-prime/">Passport Prime device</a>, but they’ve also implemented URs, Animated QRs, SSKR, and other Blockchain Commons interop specs. As a result, they’ve got well-studied, mature specifications that they didn’t roll themselves and that should be resilient and reliable far into the future. I think that adding in a variety of linked interop specs like this has a multiplicative effect.</p>

<p>I’d love to see more of this in the Bitcoin community, but a lot of people are resistant.</p>

 Why People Fight Interoperability 

<p>The primary reason that we see people fight interoperability is market dominance. The Bitcoin ecosystem has grown large enough that some of the bigger players have stepped back from inteoperability</p>

<p>I was sad to see ColdCard go this way, after they themselves built on Trezor and other open-source libraries. At least they’ve remained source-verifiable (meaning you can view their code in their repo), at least until you get now to the proprietary chip, but they were once one of maybe three hardware wallets that were fully open-source,and so fully interoperable.</p>

<p>But I think the recent release of Ledger Recover was even more of a tragedy. Here they were offering a big innovation: a way to recover seeds by splitting them up and distributing them off device, similar to Blockchain Commons’ own <a href="https://z.cash/ecosystem/electric-coin-company/">Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR)</a>. But by keeping their protocol for distributing and recovering seed shares non-interoperable, they kept anyone else from offering seed vaults of their own, instead locking their users into their choices—which were very unpopular due to  privacy-busting requirements for KYC information.</p>

<p>The exact opposite approach is taken by another of Blockchain Commons’ long-time developer partners, Craig Raw of the <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow wallet</a>. He’s working hard to make Sparrow compatible with everything out there, but the difficulty he faces underlines the issues with the semi-interoperable state of most blockchains. He has to make <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">NASCAR-like lists</a> of otherwise incompatible products and introduce secret sauce to interoperate with each of them. We’re very luck to have the Sparrow wallet working with all of these different devices, but it’s something that would never happen if there weren’t someone as dedicated as Craig working on the project.</p>

<p>For smaller companies, interoperability is a way in. Obviously, you should do it!</p>

<p>For bigger companies, interoperability means both trusting your engineers to provide the best experience and trusting your customers to recognize it. That’s a leap of faith, but one that I’d hope to see most companies make in our industry. After all the idea of personal control is likely one of the reasons that your customers are working with digital assets in the first place!</p>

 The Potential for Other Blockchains 

<p>I hope that our work with Zcash (and before that with Bitcoin) is just a first step. I’d like to take that experience to other blockchains and offer new interoperability to grow those ecosystems as well.</p>

<p>Even after the work we’ve already done, Bitcoin may still need this sort of work the most, because it’s gotten so big. How could we make migration between wallets easier? Or just the migration of seeds or keys? How could we more widely standardize the backup of seeds with a methodology like Ledger Recover or our own CSR? How could we inteoperate third-party services such as pricing and fee lookups? Every one of these elements of interoperability would improve the ecosystem, but they require a dedication to inteoperability itself.</p>

<p>The same is true for other ecosystems that have gotten large enough to see multiple companies working on projects. Big changes could be the incentive for this, such as Monero’s move to Seraphis. But even without big changes on the horizon, big ecosystems grow to the point where interoperability becomes a requirement: Ethereum has a huge infrastructure built around WalletConnect, but we’ve talked with people in the ecosystem who think there’s real room for improvement. I hope that many chains (and other ecosystems) beyond Monero and Ethereum will see the advantages of improving interoperability for all the reasons I’ve laid out here, particular independence for users, resilience for data, and openness for developers.</p>

<p>Are you a leader working in a digital-asset ecosystem? Would you like to work with me to take lessons learned from the Zcash project to create interoperable wallet formats, data-exchange formats, service formats, or something else? Drop me a line at <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">team@blockchaincommons.com</a>. I’d love to talk about how we can expand your ecosystem as well.</p>

Panel 4 on Law and Policy for the Attention Crisis, featuring Alex Roberts (moderator), Dick Daynard, Leah Plunkett, Woody Hartzog and Zephyr Teachout.<p>Last Friday, April 11, three of us, <a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/faculty/bietti/">Elettra Bietti</a>, <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/aileen-nielsen/">Aileen Nielsen</a>, <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/laura-aade/">Laura Aade</a>, co-organized a workshop titled “The Battle for Our Attention: Empirical, Philosophical and Legal Questions” which took place at Northeastern University School of Law, and benefited from the support of CLIC, Northeastern’s <a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/academics/centers/clic/">Center for Law, Information and Creativity</a>, and the involvement of Harvard’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center</a> community of fellows and faculty. The event brought together leading legal scholars, policymakers, economists, medical scientists, computer scientists, media scholars, and technologists to address the pressing issue of how today’s digital technologies are transforming the understanding, use, and allocation of human attention, including implications for how we spend our time and what information we&nbsp;consume.</p><p>The discussion was wide-ranging, interdisciplinary, and deeply enlightening. We discussed whether attention <a href="https://as.tufts.edu/anthropology/people/faculty/nick-seaver">“actually exists”</a>, <a href="https://heartbrain.hms.harvard.edu/people/michael-esterman-phd">how it works</a>, the <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/yochai-benkler/">history</a> and <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profiles/marshall-van-alstyne/">business models</a> of attention capture, the challenges and <a href="https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/david-lazer/">findings</a> that arise from <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/person/elena-glassman">empirical</a> <a href="https://cbw.sh/">studies</a> of attention and attention markets, the relation between attention, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/bridget-todd">intimacy</a>, <a href="https://www.umass.edu/communication/about/directory/emily-e-west">convenience</a> and<a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/rebecca-tushnet/"> the law of trademarks</a>, possible analogies with <a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/faculty/daynard/">tobacco and gambling litigation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-law/faculty/directory/full-time/zephyr-teachout/">policymaking</a> associated with <a href="https://www.bu.edu/law/profile/woodrow-hartzog/">regulating engagement</a> and <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/leah-a-plunkett/">children’s use of social&nbsp;media</a>.</p><p>The event began with a panel on the political economy of attention. <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/yochai-benkler/">Yochai Benkler</a> kicked off the discussion with an overview of the capitalist drive to capture and instrumentalize attention over time, beginning with the 19th century press and culminating in today’s digital technologies. He argued that markets won’t solve attention problems and could exacerbate attention harms, in contrast with <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profiles/marshall-van-alstyne/">Marshall Van Alstyne</a>’s suggestion that a Coasean model of attention rights could help platform owners manage misinformation and reduce incentives to share inaccurate or false information. Where Benkler advocated for the decommodification of attentional experiences, Van Alstyne advocated for a market regime of incentives and individual rights to speak and listen. <a href="https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/david-lazer/">David Lazer</a>, for his part, adopted a middle ground position, presenting several findings on the slow but steady decoupling of content from its sources. He showed that information has become less traceable to sources, and discussed chatbots’ role in producing knowledge that is increasingly divorced from reliable reference to authors and media&nbsp;sources.</p><p>The second morning panel addressed the empirics of attention. <a href="https://heartbrain.hms.harvard.edu/people/michael-esterman-phd">Michael Esterman</a> discussed some of his clinical work, showing that attention is a fluctuating, fragile process deeply shaped by cognitive and environmental factors. Sustaining attention for long periods of time and across contexts remains a phenomenon that is not well understood, and Esterman presented results showing that blocking a population’s mobile phone access for two weeks could improve participants’ attention, as well as their mental health and well-being. Esterman also pointed to the need for increasing measurements outside of laboratory settings to better understand the external validity of fundamental psychological results related to attention. <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/person/elena-glassman">Elena Glassmann</a> then approached attention from the perspective of an interface designer, emphasizing that platforms actively shape how users direct their attention — often without users realizing it. Glassmann highlighted the danger of decontextualisation, where AI-driven tools summarize content by stripping away critical context and leaving users unaware of biases or omissions, and suggested ways to help people build reality-grounded mental models that provide access to contextual information, rather than hiding complexity. <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/christo-wilson/">Christo Wilson</a> concluded the panel with an overview of empirical approaches to studying attention platform business models, highlighting his role with David Lazer in creating and hosting the <a href="https://nationalinternetobservatory.org/index.html">National Internet Observatory</a> at Northeastern, a center that offers tools for researchers to study how people behave online in response to particular design features and platform strategies over long periods of&nbsp;time.</p><p>During the lunch keynote, FTC Commissioner and Law Professor <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/alvaro-bedoya">Alvaro Bedoya</a> spoke of his effort building a team of doctors and psychologists at the FTC whose focus and expertise includes children’s mental health and well-being. He also spoke of his work advocating for <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/BedoyaStatementonCOPPARuleNPRMFINAL12.20.23.pdf">children’s privacy</a> under <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/statement-commissioner-alvaro-m-bedoya-issuance-notice-proposed-rulemaking-update-childrens-online">COPPA</a> and of the analogies and differences between tobacco, sports gambling and addiction to technological devices and products. Commissioner Bedoya suggested that more research needs to be done to better understand which products, platforms and specific technological features cause addiction and other mental health disorders.</p><p>The afternoon began with a third panel on media and communication systems for attention capture. <a href="https://as.tufts.edu/anthropology/people/faculty/nick-seaver">Nick Seaver</a> presented a spirited argument that attention may, in fact, not exist at all. While holding and waving a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_jiggler">mouse jiggler</a>, Seaver showed that attention is primarily defined or constructed by the way it is measured. Measurement, in turn, serves primarily as a managerial tool of control. While they might appear to be measuring participation, platform designers are in reality disciplining, tracking and controlling populations. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/bridget-todd">Bridget Todd</a> spoke of her work in the podcasting world, emphasizing the relation between intimacy and attention: audiences pay attention based on proximity to particular types of content and the emotions that content generates for them. Her view is that the current digital economy prioritizes profitable outrage over thoughtful storytelling, but that we should always push for the latter. <a href="https://www.umass.edu/communication/about/directory/emily-e-west">Emily West </a>presented some of her research on Amazon through the lens of convenience. Attention and addiction to digital products are promoted by appealing to convenience: platforms engineer frictionless experiences to generate user dependencies, producing a culture of learned passivity and inattention that quietly erodes agency. <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/rebecca-tushnet/">Rebecca Tushnet </a>spoke of the law of advertising and the doctrines of dilution and confusion under trademarks law, explaining that the law simultaneously invokes but misunderstands the science of, or empirical realities of, human attention, protecting only those parts of attention that can be owned under intellectual property regimes. Similar to Seaver’s argument that attention is effectively what we can measure, Tushnet’s presentation highlighted that we live in an economy of signals and containers of attention.</p><p>The day ended with a panel discussion on legal and policymaking efforts in the attention space. <a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/faculty/daynard/">Richard Daynard</a> shared key takeaways from his litigation experience fighting tobacco and gambling companies. He explained that these industries intentionally engineer their products to addict users while funding research that shows the exact opposite, namely that their products are not addictive and individuals who engage in excessive use are the ones to blame. He added that these companies often lose in product liability litigation, where strict liability regardless of intention is the standard. <a href="https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-law/faculty/directory/full-time/zephyr-teachout/">Zephyr Teachout</a> then offered an overview of the evolving Supreme Court jurisprudence on the First Amendment, arguing that current shifts in the court’s composition and caselaw are opening the door to possible legislation and reform in the attention space, something that until recently seemed largely implausible. <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/leah-a-plunkett/">Leah Plunkett</a> discussed state social media laws and described them as providing financial compensation, privacy safeguards for children and workplace protections. She focused on a recent <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/03/11/utah-bill-aimed-protecting-child/">Utah law</a> that allows children to sue their parents for compensation when their image is used in their parents’ social media feed for profit and described her involvement in drafting a model law on this theme for the Uniform Law Commission. <a href="https://www.bu.edu/law/profile/woodrow-hartzog/">Woody Hartzog</a> concluded the panel presentations, discussing his work with Neil Richards on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4845648">wrongful engagement</a>, a tort which would allow individuals to sue digital companies for profiting from their addiction and engagement while neglecting users’ well&nbsp;being.</p><p>The event ended with participants discussing potential research overlaps, future collaborations and potential for advocacy across US regions. In the words of CLIC Director <a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/faculty/roberts/">Alex Roberts</a>, who moderated the last panel, “[i]f an interdisciplinary field of “attention studies” wasn’t already a thing, it is&nbsp;now.”</p><p>This event would not have been possible without support and assistance from Northeastern’s CLIC, Alexandra Roberts, Jennifer Huer, Walaa Al Awad, Natalia Pifferer, Brad Whitmarsh, and Jacob Bouvier. We also thank Harvard Law’s Laura Zeng, and BKC’s Bey Woodward and Jonathan Zittrain for additional enthusiasm and assistance.</p><p>We hope to continue this important conversation in the months and years to come with all of you. If you would like to join future conversations, we have created a regional mailing list which you can sign up to&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/boston-area-human-attention-scholars/?pli=1">here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/reporting-from-the-battle-for-our-attention-workshop-northeastern-april-11-2025-7ca7976c546d">Reporting from “The Battle for Our Attention” Workshop @ Northeastern, April 11, 2025</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today, we’re sharing important news about the future of Ceramic.</p><p>With the rapid rise of agents as the new critical user and interface to the web, it’s increasingly clear that supporting a healthy, trustless, decentralized model for AI is essential. Our team, part of <a href="https://linktr.ee/recalllabs?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Recall Labs</a> after our merge with Textile, is shifting our primary focus to <a href="https://recall.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Recall</a>: a platform where AI agents prove themselves, improve themselves, and earn for their intelligence.</p><p>As part of this, we’ll be repurposing parts of Ceramic, deprecating others, and introducing a standalone open source version for the community. We want to openly communicate what this means for you and your applications built on Ceramic, as well as outline the path forward.</p> From Ceramic to Recall <p>Over the years, Ceramic has been pivotal in helping us understand decentralized data, composability, and robust synchronization. It’s been the leading technology for dozens of applications and networks in need of scalable, edge-centric, verifiable data storage and replication. We spent more than five years developing and iterating on Ceramic and are immensely proud of the advancements and technology we’ve shipped.</p><p>Even more than that, we are so thankful for your partnership. Our customers and community have relentlessly innovated on brand new tech, helped us move from prototypes to stable networks, and been the driving force for our continued commitment to open, decentralized data. Thank you for all of your support, and all you’ve helped us learn.</p><p>One of the persistent challenges we’ve faced with Ceramic has been the UX of decentralized data systems: managing keys and signing data, novel access control flows, and counterintuitive patterns for data flow have been challenges for many users and developers. Interestingly, all these properties are native and intuitive for the internet’s new class of users: agents.</p><p>Recall is a cryptoeconomic platform for AI agents to prove, improve, and earn based on their intelligence. It builds heavily on the technology we’ve built previously, but is a new platform and demands our full commitment.</p> What This Means for Ceramic Users <p>We deeply appreciate the trust and investment you’ve made in Ceramic. While our priority is Recall, we remain committed to setting Ceramic users up for success as we sunset certain parts of Ceramic.Here’s exactly what you need to know:</p> Introducing ceramic-one <p>Ceramic-one is the most performant, stable, and decentralized implementation of Ceramic. There is a new client SDK for reading/writing to ceramic-one: <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/tree/main/sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/tree/main/sdk</a></p><p>Ceramic-one introduces <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/new-ceramic-release-ceramic-one-with-new-ceramic-recon-protocol/">Recon</a>, enabling reliable synchronization and historical data syncing across nodes. All existing data from ComposeDB remains fully accessible and readable through ceramic-one.</p><p>Ceramic-one will continue to function independently, with no dependency on our infrastructure or any other centralized authority. Further, Ceramic-one is under an MIT license, so anyone who wants to fork it and continue developing it on their own is welcome to do so.</p> Anchoring and Conflict Resolution on Ceramic-one <p>We’re committed to completing one final critical feature for ceramic-one: self-anchoring to Recall. This allows fully decentralized timestamping without relying on our centralized CAS or Ethereum L1, making ceramic-one truly self-sufficient. This will be implemented sometime after the mainnet release of Recall.</p><p>Manual conflict resolution is currently possible through ceramic-one by exposing all stream HEADs, allowing applications to apply their own business logic to select which branch(s) of the stream's history they wish to use. We’re also considering building automated conflict resolution (based on anchor timestamps)—the only remaining functionality from js-ceramic not yet implemented in ceramic-one. If this feature is important to your use case, please reach out, as your feedback will influence our decision.</p><p>After these improvements, ceramic-one will reach a feature-complete MVP. At that point, we will only prioritize critical bug fixes. ceramic-one will continue to exist as stable software under an open MIT license—fully available for anyone who wishes to fork, improve, or independently evolve it.</p> Deprecation of js-ceramic and ComposeDB <p>Effective immediately, we’re deprecating js-ceramic and ComposeDB. We recommend migration to ceramic-one, the streamlined, performant successor, as soon as possible.</p><p>Migration Steps:</p>  A new client SDK for ceramic-one is now available here: <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/tree/main/sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ceramic-one SDK</a>  Step-by-step migration guidance is provided in our upgrade guides:  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/new-ceramic-release-ceramic-one-with-new-ceramic-recon-protocol/">Migration Guide on Ceramic Blog</a>  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/blob/main/UPGRADE.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Detailed Upgrade Instructions on GitHub</a>    <p>Timeline and Support</p><p>ComposeDB and the Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) will be completely shut down at least one month after Recall’s Mainnet launch. (Exact date TBD, but expected in mid-2025.). After that date, ComposeDB-dependent apps will break if not migrated to ceramic-one.</p> Recall: The Future of Decentralized Intelligence <p>Ceramic’s legacy and your contributions have directly influenced our development of Recall. Many of Ceramic’s strengths—openness, transparency, and decentralization—live on and evolve within Recall’s cryptoeconomic framework.</p><p>Recall aims to become a vibrant ecosystem for AI builders and developers. We warmly invite Ceramic users to explore the opportunities Recall offers: building intelligent agents, participating in verifiable competitions, and earning from proven performance.</p> <p>We’re grateful for your support of Ceramic and excited about this next chapter with Recall. Our team remains available to assist your migration and ensure your continued success. If you have questions related to Ceramic, please reach out to us <a href="mailto:ceramic@set.gl">here</a>. If you’re interested in learning more about Recall, find us <a href="https://x.com/recallnet?ref=blog.ceramic.network">on Twitter</a>!</p><p>Warm regards,<br>The Recall Labs Team</p>

 ZeWIF Specification 

<p></p>

<p>The Zcash extensible Wallet Interchange Format (ZeWIF) has been Blockchain Commons’ main priority since the Zcash Community Grants program approved our proposal at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Why It’s Important. Blockchain Commons talks a lot about interoperability, and that’s what ZeWIF is: it’s a way to freely exchange data between Zcash wallets in a standardized form. What we don’t talk about as often is why interoperability is important.</p>

<p>It goes back to our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">Gordian principles</a>. Interoperability supports at least three of them.</p>

 
   It supports independence because any user can freely move their data among the interoperable software systems. 
   It supports openness because any developer can easily join the ecosystem by adopting a mature, well-understood specification. This creates an environment of coopetition (cooperative competition) that leads to advances in technology and usability. 
   It supports resilience because the interoperable format makes data less likely to be lost: it’ll be in a form that will be understood and therefore accessible, well in the future. 
 

<p>For a wallet ecosystem, interoperability means that users will have the freedom to move their digital assets among Zcash wallets. That’s the precise independence we want users to have, which is why it’s been worth spending a few months of time on this project.</p>

<p>The ZeWIF Meetings. To support the ZeWIF project, Blockchain Commons held <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/#meetings">three meetings</a> in the first quarter: on the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/meeting1/">initial wallet survey</a>, on the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/meeting2/">first demo of the zmigrate tool</a>, and on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/meeting3/">ZeWIF data abstractions</a>. Meeting with developers to ensure that specifications serve everyone’s needs has always been a bedrock policy for Blockchain Commons, so we’ve of course extended it here. (At least one more meeting is planned, for April 16th, to demo the data file format.)</p>


  
    
      #1: Wallet Survey:










   
    
   



    
    
      #2: Zmigrate demo:










   
    
   



    
    
      #3: Abstraction Discussion:










   
    
   



    
  


<p>What We’ve Released So Far. The ZeWIF project is built around the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zewif">zewif library</a>, which stores Zcash wallet data in an in-memory format. We’ve also written <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zewif-zcashd">zewif-zcashd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zewif-zingo">zewif-zingo</a> to demonstrate the import of data from those wallets to ZeWIF, while our partners at <a href="https://zingolabs.org/">Zingo Labs</a> have produced “zewif-zecwallet” for importing zecwallet data (though that PR hasn’t been merged yet). Finally, we authored <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zmigrate">zmigrate</a>, which is a demo CLI for importing zcashd content. With these demos and libraries in hand, other wallet developers can start working to interchange their own data via the ZeWIF format.</p>

<p>What’s Still to Come. With our releases so far, data can be interchanged between different Zcash wallets as long as it’s all done on the same machine: you just import into the in-memory ZeWIF format from one wallet, then export to another. But we expect most use cases will instead involve at least two different machines. That’s where the ZeWIF file format comes into play. Building on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a>, it translates the ZeWIF in-memory storage into a fixed file that can then be moved to a different machine. We expect to demo the Envelope ZeWIF format at that upcoming April 16th meeeting.</p>

 Post-Quantum Commons 

<p></p>

<p>Is Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) the next big thing? We were able to support our friends at Foundation with some PQC work just as we got the ZeWIF project going at the start of the year.</p>

<p>Why It’s Important. Quantum Computers are starting to appear, and though they’re far, far from what would be needed to break cryptography at the moment, there’s no telling when there’s going to be a sudden “quantum” leap. Though today’s cryptography might not need PQC, if you’re working on something that might be around for 5 or 10 years, you should be thinking about it!</p>

<p>PQC Meeting. Our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/meetings/2025-03-pqc/">March Gordian meeting</a> contained all the details of our PQC work, including what Quantum Computing is.</p>



 
    
   

<p>QuantumLink. The highlight of the meeting was a discussion of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/assets/pdfs/202503-quantumlink.pdf">QuantumLink</a> from our friends at <a href="https://foundation.xyz/">Foundation</a>. This is a  quantum-resistant protocol for Bluetooth communication that is a critical component of their new <a href="https://foundation.xyz/buy-passport-prime/">Passport Prime</a> wallet. It allows them to use Bluetooth with high security and for that security to remain strong 5 or 10 years in the future, in case Quantum Computing does make those big strides forward.</p>

<p>What We’ve Released So Far. The QuantumLink technology was enabled by new PQC support that Blockchain Commons incorporated into its libraries. You can now use the PQC algorithms <a href="https://hackmd.io/@bc-community/rJ8DOmCd1e">ML-DSA and ML-KEM</a> in our Rust stack, from <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-components-rust">bc-componenents</a> on up.</p>

 Open Integrity 

<p></p>

<p>We had one other big release in Q1: <a href="https://github.com/openintegrityproject">Open Integrity</a>, a system for increasing the trust of software being developed in Git. Well, technically it was released on April 7th, the 20th anniversary of Git’s release, but this is something that Blockchain Commons Architect Christopher Allen has been working on for about a year, so we’re thrilled to get the word out.</p>

<p>Why It’s Important. We wrote <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/open-integrity/">a whole article</a> discussing why Open Integrity is important. But, in short: Git repos are growing increasingly important for the deployment of critical software, and Git doesn’t actually provide a high-level of trust for those repos, despite the ability to sign commits. Open Integrity bridges the gap betwen what Git offers and what online software distribution needs.</p>

<p>What We’ve Released So Far. The Open Integrity project is now available in an early form at <a href="https://github.com/openintegrityproject">GitHub</a>. A <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity_Problem_Statement.md">Problem Statement</a> offers  details on the issues we’re trying to solve and our solutions. We’ve also got a number of tools and scripts, the most import of which creates an <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/src/setup_git_inception_repo.sh">inception commit on a repo</a>. This inception commit is the root of trust that lays the foundation for ensuring that you always know who’s in control of a repo.</p>

<p>If you want to try out Open Integrity, see the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity_Script_Snippets.md">Open Integrity Snippets file</a>, which has complete instructions on how to get that inception-commit script running, plus many examples that will allow you to experiment with Open Integrity.</p>

  <p>That’s it for our big Q1 projects, but we had a number of smaller releases over the course of the quarter as well.</p>

 New Articles 

<p>The Right to Transact. We think the right to transact should be an international freedom. Read more in Christopher’s recent article, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/RightToTransact/">“The Case for an International Right to Freedom to Transact”</a>, which builds on his 2024 musing, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/ValuesDesign/">“How My Values Inform Design”</a>.</p>

<p>SSI Orbit Podcast. Christopher also was interviewed for the <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/videos/SSI-Podcast/">SSI Orbit Podcast</a>. It’s been nine years since he wrote the foundational <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">“Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>. Where do things stand today?</p>

 New Dev Docs 

<p>SSKR Pages. We updated our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">SSKR dev pages</a> with the big focus being differentiating <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/#what-are-sskr-urs">SSKR URs</a> (where you split up a key) and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/#what-are-sskr-envelopes">SSKR Envelopes</a> (where you protect the entire contents of an Envelope by creating and splitting up a key). The <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/vectors/">test vectors</a> also now demonstrate both cases.</p>

<p>UR Pages. We similarly did some big updates to our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/">UR dev pages</a>. Here the issue was that URs had seen some changes over the years, especially as we locked down CBOR tag registration, and our examples were no longer up-to-date. Now, every page and every test vector should be correct. There’s also a new page on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/envelope/">URs for Gordian Envelope</a>.</p>

<p>Meetings Pages. All of Blockchain Commons’ meetings are now documented on a new <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/meetings/">meetings page</a>, which also includes subpages with videos and slides (and usually transcripts) of everything from the last few years!</p>

<p>Improved Crate Docs. Finally, we’ve used some lessons learned from the documentation of ZeWIF to improve the documentation of our Rust stack. As a result, docs.rs now has improved docs for <a href="https://docs.rs/dcbor/0.16.5/dcbor/">bc-dcbor</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/bc-components/0.18.2/bc_components/">bc-components</a>, and <a href="https://docs.rs/bc-envelope/latest/bc_envelope/">bc-envelope</a></p>

Lifehash is a critical element of the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/oib/">object identity block</a>, which can help users to recognize seeds and keys. We hope this will allow for more deployment.</p>

 New Research 

<p></p>

<p>Provenance Marks. One of our newest innovations, courtesy of Blockchain Commons Lead Researcher Wolf McNally, is the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2025-001-provenance-mark.md">provenance mark</a>. The provenance mark is a cryptographically secure chain of marks that facilitates the easy verification of authenticity. We’ll have more on them in the months ahead, but in the meantime, you can read Wolf’s <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2025-001-provenance-mark.md">research paper</a> on the topic!</p>

<p>Provenance References. If you want to start playing with provenance marks right now, 
we’ve already released a series of reference apps and libraries. They include our original <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Provenance">Swift implementation</a>, our newer <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/provenance-mark-rust">Rust implementation</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/provenance-mark-cli-rust">CLI</a> that can be used to create and manage marks!</p>

 

<p>That’s it for the moment. For the next quarter, we’ll be closing out our initial work on ZeWIF in April, and we’ll be offering more looks at Provenance Marks in the months ahead.</p>

<p>We Are Open Co-op (WAO) is a collective of individuals who share a commitment to ethical, inclusive, and sustainable practices in all aspects of our work, including AI literacy. Our approach to this area is grounded in the belief that AI is an extension of digital literacies, not a separate field. We aim to demystify AI, helping people recognise that the digital literacy skills they already possess are directly applicable to AI.</p><p>AI’s societal impacts are significant and well-documented, but the public often struggles to grasp its opportunities and risks. A trusted guide is needed to balance optimism with caution, particularly given AI’s potential effects on jobs, culture, and other critical areas.</p> The project <p>We are delighted to have started work on a new project with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/responsible-innovation-centre?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Responsible Innovation Centre for Public Media Futures</a>, hosted by the BBC. As an institution with a long and valued history in delivering high quality educational initiatives that help audiences understand and navigate new technologies, we believe the BBC is well placed to help public understanding and engagement with emerging technologies such as AI.</p><p>Our focus is research and analysis which aims to find gaps in provision for younger audiences. Over the next few months we’ll be interviewing experts, reviewing resources, and scrutinising frameworks. We will be using this research to create a report along with a framework and guide which will ultimately help the BBC create policies and content for young people. We’ll be sharing an open version of what we create, so look for those in the summer.</p> Our approach <p>Starting with desk research, and building on the work we’ve already curated, we’re creating a library of interesting definitions, frameworks, and resources that can help us understand what other people are exploring when it comes to AI Literacy in combination with public media.</p><p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/activists-campaigners-and-advocates-versus-ai-cabfd87c0f46">As with our work</a> with Friends of the Earth where we researched <a href="https://policy.friendsoftheearth.uk/reports/harnessing-ai-environmental-justice?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">AI and environmental justice</a>, we will bring together a variety of experts to give feedback and sense check what falls out of some of the research.</p><p>Along the way, we’ll share updates based on our findings, so if you know of a person, organisation, initiative, framework, or resource that we should take a look at, please let us know!

<p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) has officially launched its <a href="https://htwg.identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Hospitality &amp; Travel Working Group</a>, evolving from the ongoing H&amp;T Special Interest Group (SIG). This new working group will focus on developing standards, schemas, processes, and documentation to support the self-sovereign exchange of data between travelers, services, intermediaries in the hospitality and travel industry, and their AI agents.</p> Mission and Focus <p>The primary goal of the working group is to enable travelers to maintain ownership and control over their personal data while allowing for seamless interactions with travel service providers. The group will address critical aspects of traveler profiles, focusing on data portability, privacy, and interoperability across the travel ecosystem.</p> Meeting Schedule <p>The working group will convene twice weekly:</p>  Tuesdays at 14:00:00 UTC  Fridays at 14:00:00 UTC  <p>These regular meetings will facilitate ongoing collaboration among industry stakeholders, technology providers, and standards bodies.</p> Leadership Perspectives <p>"We are enormously proud that the hard work of our dedicated Hospitality &amp; Travel SIG has led to a Working Group that will develop key specifications. From sharing boarding passes and hotel preferences to loyalty programs and dietary requirements, travelers constantly provide the same information to different companies throughout their journey.</p><p>"Travelers need to share, and overshare, the broadest range of personal data on their voyage, ranging from seat or dietary preferences, to government identities or passports, across multiple service providers who may not have the best data handling practices. This working group will develop standards that allow travelers to control exactly what data they share, with whom, and for how long - eliminating both unnecessary data exposure and the frustration of repeatedly entering the same information," said Kim Hamilton Duffy, Executive Director of the DIF.</p><p>Douglas Rice, industry veteran and Hospitality &amp; Travel Working Group chair added: "The travel ecosystem has long struggled with fragmented approaches to customer data and identity management. This working group will help establish the technical foundations needed for travelers to maintain control of their data while enabling the personalized experiences they expect. We're building toward a future where your travel preferences, loyalty information, and credentials can move with you seamlessly across your journey—all while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security, and enabling AI agents to act on verified information about the traveler.”</p> Next Steps <p>The working group will initially focus on defining standardized schemas for travelers or their digital agents to present profiles, establishing protocols for secure data exchange, and developing guidelines for implementation across various travel touch points. Industry participants are encouraged to join the working group to contribute their expertise and perspectives.</p><p>For more information about participating, visit the <a href="https://htwg.identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF Hospitality &amp; Travel Working Group web site</a>.</p>

<a href="https://keyless.io/"></a>



<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Keyless?</p>



<p>Our vision is for a safer, more private world. Keyless is on a mission to redefine how the world authenticates – enabling people to securely access services with a simple look, without compromising their biometric data.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>We can answer this with a simple example: mule accounts. Fraudsters will pay people to open bank or crypto accounts using their real ID, then take over and use those accounts to launder money. On paper, the account looks legitimate – but the person using it isn’t who the bank thinks it is.</p>



<p>This kind of fraud is only possible when identity assurance is weak. With trustworthy digital identity, this can be stopped by verifying who is really behind the screen not just at sign-up, but every time they log in, send a payment, or change account details.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digital identity is the foundation for secure online interactions. It drives inclusion, cuts costs, and reduces fraud. When companies can trust their users, they grow faster and more confidently.</p>



<p>Keyless sits within consumer apps – often in banking and fintech, but also in government and university portals. Whenever a user performs a sensitive action, like logging in or approving a payment, Keyless triggers an authentication selfie using the device’s camera. Unlike text messages, call centers, or even FaceID, this process actually proves who the user is – not just that they have access to a device or mobile number. </p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada is already taking significant steps toward becoming a global leader in digital identity. The government is actively developing a nationwide digital ID program designed to make accessing both public and private services faster and more secure.</p>



<p>By continuing to invest in public-private collaboration, Canada can lead the way in building trusted, inclusive digital ecosystems that other countries look to for guidance.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>We joined DIACC to help shape the future of digital identity in a way that’s secure, user-friendly, and preserves citizen privacy. We believe in collaboration and are excited to contribute our expertise in biometric authentication and privacy-preserving technologies.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Within the biometric authentication space, Keyless is known for its privacy-preserving approach. Uniquely, we authenticate users without storing their facial biometric data anywhere – keeping their biometric information completely private.</p>

<p>Organizations are encouraged to take the Passkey Pledge ahead of World Passkey Day on May 1&nbsp;</p>



<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., April 9, 2025 – The FIDO Alliance is inviting organizations around the world to take the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">Passkey Pledge</a>, a voluntary commitment to increase awareness and adoption of passkey sign-ins to make the web safer and more accessible.</p>



<p>Since passkeys were introduced to the world in 2022, hundreds of service providers have embraced the greater security and usability that passkeys bring to users. Over 15 billion user accounts are now equipped with the option to use a passkey instead of relying on passwords, which are easy to steal and reuse for account takeovers and fraud. Organizations that deploy passkeys are consistently finding that a greater percentage of their users are able to sign into services in far less time – which helps generate added revenue and/or employee productivity while also reducing fraud and account takeovers.</p>



<p>To further advance and promote the use of passkeys, the first Thursday in May each year is now recognized as World Passkey Day (previously World Password Day). Companies can take the Passkey Pledge in advance of World Passkey Day and commit to making a good-faith effort to achieve the following goals throughout the year:</p>



 
 For service providers that have an active implementation of passkeys for sign-in – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions taken to measurably increase the use of passkeys by users when signing into the company’s services. 



 For service providers that are in the process of implementing passkeys for sign-in – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate measurable actions taken to enable passkeys for signing into the company’s services. 



 For vendors with a FIDO-based products and/or service – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions taken to measurably increase the use of passkeys through adoption of the company’s products and/or services. 



 For vendors developing FIDO-based products and/or services – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate measurable actions to FIDO certify its products and launch a product or service with passkey sign-in support. 



 For industry associations and standards organizations&nbsp;– Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions to increase the visibility and benefits of passkey sign-ins. 
 



<p>Organizations that take the pledge will receive assets to support their involvement and will have the opportunity to take part in activities and announcements planned for World Passkey Day on May 1, 2025.</p>



<p>More details on the pledge, including the sign-up form, can be found at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Taking Action: Resources to Help Organizations to Fulfill the Pledge 



<p>The FIDO Alliance has resources and best practices for Passkey Pledge organizations to take action, including:</p>



 
 Sharing their commitment to the Passkey Pledge via external communications channels 



 Leveraging the guidance on <a href="http://passkeycentral.org">passkeycentral.org</a> to plan, implement and expand their passkey rollouts 



 Implementing the <a href="https://www.passkeycentral.org/design-guidelines/">FIDO Design Guidelines</a>, data-driven UX best practices for passkey rollouts 



 Getting their products <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">FIDO Certified</a> to demonstrate that their products are compliant, interoperable and secure 



 Releasing case studies on their or their customers behalf to share implementation journeys and business outcomes. Organizations can reach out to <a href="mailto:info@fidoalliance.org">info@fidoalliance.org</a> to submit case studies directly to the FIDO Alliance 



 Taking part in the FIDO Alliance <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/become-a-member/">member activities</a> and working groups to further drive passkey optimization and adoption&nbsp; 



 Planning and/or taking steps to <a href="https://www.passkeycentral.org/passkey-roll-out-guides/prevent-phishing/">remove passwords as a sign-in option</a>. 
 



 About the FIDO Alliance 



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.

 Current Landscape 



<p>Governments worldwide are accelerating their digital transformation efforts to meet the growing expectations of citizens and businesses. Canada is no exception, with public sector services increasingly moving online to improve efficiency, accessibility, and security. However, this shift brings significant challenges, including data privacy concerns, cybersecurity threats, and the need for seamless, interoperable services across jurisdictions.</p>



<p>When DIACC was established in 2012, its mission was to create a secure digital ecosystem. Today, this goal is even more critical for modernizing government services while ensuring security, privacy, and usability. DIACC has evolved from research to certifying real-world digital trust solutions, setting audit standards, shaping policies, and connecting businesses and government to strengthen Canada’s digital economy.</p>



<p>Digital trust—which empowers individuals, businesses, and government agencies to engage online securely and transparently—is essential for delivering reliable public services. Without it, citizens may lack confidence in digital government initiatives, limiting their adoption and effectiveness.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust, Canada can strengthen its public service infrastructure, enhance citizen confidence, and improve service delivery. Interoperable frameworks such as the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™ (PCTF) ensure that digital services remain secure, adaptable, and trusted while protecting personal electronic information between government agencies and service providers.</p>



 Advancing Digital Trust to Modernize Government Services 



 1. Driving Efficiencies, Cost Savings, and Economic Growth 



<p>Governments can leverage DIACC, the PCTF, and PCTF certification along with technical standards to help streamline processes, reduce costs, and create economic opportunities through:</p>

 A New Era for Sustainable Computing <p>Demand for computing power is exploding as AI models, cloud services, and decentralized applications consume ever-greater amounts of energy. But not all energy is created equal. In some regions, a data center might be drawing power from a coal-heavy grid, while elsewhere excess wind or solar power goes unused. For the past decade, tech giants addressed this by buying renewable energy or improving efficiency. But what if we could take a more dynamic approach — shifting computational workloads across location and time to maximize use of clean&nbsp;energy?</p><p>Enter Carbon-Aware Nomination, a groundbreaking mechanism from Energy Web that does exactly that. It ensures computational tasks run where and when they have the lowest carbon intensity. This isn’t a standard cloud feature or a typical blockchain project, but a fusion of both: it connects decentralized computing networks with real-time carbon intensity data from <a href="https://watttime.org/">WattTime</a> and the Green Software Foundation’s <a href="https://carbon-aware-sdk.greensoftware.foundation/">Carbon-Aware SDK</a>. And the best part — it’s going open-source, inviting the entire industry to build a greener digital future together.</p> The Carbon Cost of Computing: Why It&nbsp;Matters <p>Computing today has a massive carbon cost. Data centers account for around 1–2% of global electricity use (on par with the airline industry), and that share is rising fast. Some forecasts warn that with the AI boom, data center energy demand could hit double-digit percentages of global consumption by 2030. In short, if we don’t make computing more sustainable, it will hinder global climate goals. Today’s solutions to decarbonize workloads rarely have real-time “carbon awareness.” This means a lot of flexible computing — like batch processing or AI training jobs — might be running at the worst possible times for the planet. Carbon-Aware Nomination changes that paradigm by intelligently routing workloads to times and places where electricity is greenest.</p> Why Carbon-Aware Nomination Is a Game-Changer <p>Carbon-aware computing isn’t an entirely new idea, but no one has implemented it the way we have. Existing approaches have serious limitations:</p>  Blind Spots in Conventional Cloud Sustainability: Major cloud platforms have introduced sustainability dashboards and efficiency tools to help customers estimate carbon footprints. However, these proprietary solutions require you to trust their reporting. There’s no independent way to verify if a given workload actually ran on low-carbon energy. In other words, you might see carbon-saving claims, but you can’t prove them. While Carbon-Aware Nomination is built for decentralized compute networks, its methodology could be adapted for cloud orchestration. However, the current implementation is blockchain-native, ensuring verifiable, tamper-proof sustainability claims.  Decentralized Compute Lacks Climate Intelligence: Emerging networks like iExec, Golem, and Akash distribute workloads across many nodes, leveraging blockchain for compute marketplaces. Yet, they schedule jobs without considering the carbon intensity of those nodes. A task might just as easily run on a coal-powered node as on a solar-powered one. Until now, no decentralized computing platform has integrated real-time carbon optimization into its scheduling logic.  <p>This is where Carbon-Aware Nomination stands apart. It combines decentralized computing with live carbon-intensity data for the first time. By doing so, it delivers several unique benefits that neither traditional clouds nor existing blockchain compute projects&nbsp;offer:</p>  Decentralized &amp; Trustless Architecture: Built on the Energy Web X blockchain, every decision and claim is transparent. There’s no single company controlling the process, and sustainability claims are tamper-proof and verifiable by anyone. This brings a new level of trust to green computing — auditors or stakeholders can confirm, via the public ledger, that a workload ran at a time of low grid emissions.  Real-Time Carbon Intelligence: The system taps into WattTime’s API and the GSF Carbon-Aware SDK to get live and forecasted grid emissions data. Workloads are continuously matched to the cleanest energy times in real time. If wind picks up in Region A or solar output surges in Region B, the scheduler knows and can route tasks accordingly. We’re not offsetting carbon with credits or averaging it annually; we’re actively avoiding emissions as they&nbsp;happen.  Hybrid Public/Enterprise Nodes: Flexibility is built in. Organizations can nominate workloads to run on public decentralized nodes or their own infrastructure — whichever meets the carbon criteria. For example, an enterprise could use its private servers when they’re running on green power, or tap into a public pool of nodes in another region when local power is dirty. Carbon-Aware Nomination isn’t “all or nothing” — it’s a smart overlay that finds the greenest option across a mix of resources.  Verifiable ESG Reporting: Every workload handled through this system generates a digital proof of its execution with associated carbon data. Think of it like an eco-receipt. This proof can feed directly into ESG reports or sustainability audits, backed by blockchain records. Instead of saying “we think our computations were low-carbon,” organizations can cryptographically demonstrate it. This level of accountability is increasingly crucial as investors and regulators demand hard evidence of climate&nbsp;action.  Open-Source Collaboration: Unlike proprietary cloud solutions, Carbon-Aware Nomination is being released as open-source software. This invites an entire community — from researchers to startups — to use it, audit it, and improve it. By sharing the code, Energy Web ensures transparency of the algorithm and accelerates innovation. Anyone will be able to plug into the system or even contribute new features (for example, supporting new types of workloads or integrating additional data sources). We believe an open approach is the fastest way to standardize carbon-aware computing across the&nbsp;world.   How It Works (In Simple&nbsp;Terms):   Checks Carbon Data: A group of computers (nominators) analyze real-time electricity grid data to find where energy is greenest.  Finds the Best Spot: The nominators select and agree on the cleanest available computing resources to execute the workload and qualify for&nbsp;rewards.  Runs &amp; Verifies: The selected computers can accept and execute the workload, and the blockchain records proof of completion, ensuring eligibility for&nbsp;rewards.   How It Works (In detail): The Carbon-Aware Nomination Pool <p>So, how does the system actually orchestrate a “greener” workload? Rather than a central scheduler deciding where tasks run, Carbon-Aware Nomination uses a decentralized pool of worker nodes and nominators that collectively determine the optimal execution plan. Here’s a high-level look at the&nbsp;process:</p>  Live Carbon Data Feeds: Using the Carbon Aware SDK, the system continuously pulls real-time and forecasted carbon intensity data from WattTime’s service. This data covers different regions and grids, updating as conditions change (like when a big solar farm comes online in the afternoon or when a coal plant ramps up at&nbsp;night).  Normalized Comparison: Because “100 gCO₂/kWh” means different things on different grids, the scheduler normalizes carbon intensity across regions. This prevents it from always favoring the same region and ensures a fair comparison. In essence, the algorithm knows what “clean” means for each location and time — a form of smart&nbsp;context.  Energy Web X Worker Registry: All participating compute nodes (whether run by individuals, companies, or data centers) register on the Energy Web X blockchain registry. They publish metadata about their location, hardware, and efficiency. This on-chain registry is like a directory of available computing resources, with info crucial for carbon-aware decisions. It’s also transparent — anyone can see which nodes are available and where they&nbsp;are.  Green Nomination Process: When a workload needs scheduling, a separate group of decentralized nominators, independent from the compute nodes themselves, evaluates the available options. These nominators analyze live carbon intensity data (from step 1), assess each node’s performance and capacity, and rank them based on sustainability. Essentially, the nodes compete, but not on price or speed alone, on verifiable carbon performance. The system then nominates the best-suited, lowest-carbon node to execute the task, ensuring a trustless and tamper-proof selection process.  Workload Execution &amp; Proof: The chosen node runs the computation. During and after execution, it logs the energy used and the carbon intensity at that time. This information is reported back and recorded (for example, as an attestation on Energy Web X). The result is a verifiable proof that “Task X was executed at Time Y in Region Z with carbon intensity Q gCO₂/kWh.” If someone doubts the claim, the proof is on the blockchain for anyone to&nbsp;verify.  <p>Continuous Optimization: Over time, the system can employ incentives to improve efficiency. For instance, node operators who consistently provide low-carbon compute (by perhaps adding their own renewable energy or load-shifting) could be rewarded. Likewise, if the network notices certain regions becoming cleaner (say a new wind farm installed), it will naturally start shifting more workloads there. The feedback loop encourages the whole ecosystem to move towards cleaner operations, as sustainable nodes get more business.</p><p>In practice, this means a company using Carbon-Aware Nomination could submit a batch job and know that the job will run at the best possible time (perhaps an hour later when a green energy surge comes) and in the best location (maybe on a server one country over where it’s a windy night), all without manual intervention. The heavy lifting of “when and where to compute” is handled by the decentralized logic in a transparent way.</p> How Carbon-Aware Nomination Fits into Energy Web&nbsp;X <p>Carbon-Aware Nomination is a component of the broader Energy Web X (EWX) ecosystem. EWX is Energy Web’s new architecture for decentralized solutions, and it supports multiple “nomination” methods (i.e., scheduling and matching mechanisms) for every single compute workload of their solutions. Carbon awareness is one powerful approach, but not the only one — some applications might optimize purely on cost or latency, for example. Within&nbsp;EWX:</p>  Solutions can opt-in to Carbon-Aware Nomination if minimizing emissions is a priority, or choose other nomination modules better suited to their needs. This flexible architecture means EWX can cater to different preferences (greenest vs. fastest vs. cheapest, etc.), and Carbon-Aware Nomination is available for any solution that cares about sustainability.  Even for applications that prioritize performance, Carbon-Aware Nomination can run in the background or as a secondary filter. For instance, if two nodes are equally capable, why not pick the one on cleaner energy? In this way, the carbon-aware mechanism can enhance other scheduling strategies by adding a sustainability lens.  All of this happens while leveraging the security and transparency of Energy Web’s blockchain. The nominations (scheduling decisions) and the resulting proofs are recorded on-chain, which aligns with Energy Web’s mission to use open digital infrastructure for the clean energy transition. EWX provides the trust layer that makes Carbon-Aware Nomination’s claims audit-proof.   Decentralized Nomination: Trustless, Transparent, and Resilient <p>Unlike a traditional cloud scheduler (where one company’s software decides where your job runs), Carbon-Aware Nomination operates without a single controlling entity. The decision process is distributed among many participants and governed by open algorithms. This decentralized approach brings several advantages:</p>  Trustless operations: You don’t have to trust Energy Web or any cloud provider’s claims — you can verify the outcomes yourself on-chain. If a workload was supposed to run on green power, anyone can check the records and confirm it did. This is crucial for companies that need to report emissions reductions to regulators or want to avoid greenwashing.  Transparency: Every step, from the carbon data used to the final selection of a node, can be made transparent. Community members could even watch a dashboard of live nominations happening, seeing in real time how the system is chasing the lowest-carbon resources. This level of openness is unheard of in proprietary cloud scheduling.  Resilience: Decentralization also means there’s no single point of failure. The nomination process can continue even if one node or one data feed goes down. Multiple nodes participate in making decisions, and the blockchain ensures a canonical record. It’s much harder to corrupt or game the system — doing so would require attacking a broad, global network of participants.  <p>For users, this simply translates to peace of mind. You get a robust service that not only optimizes for sustainability but is also inherently reliable and tamper-proof.</p> Why Open Source&nbsp;Matters <p>Energy Web is committed to open-sourcing the entire Carbon-Aware Nomination system. By making it freely available to developers, enterprises, and even competitors, we aim to set a new industry standard for carbon-aware computing. Transparency is a core value here — anyone can inspect the code to understand how decisions are made and suggest improvements. Open source also accelerates innovation: a global community can adapt the tool for new use cases (imagine carbon-aware scheduling for edge devices or for other batch processes like rendering and scientific computing). We’re releasing this under an open license so that this carbon-aware logic can proliferate everywhere, not just within Energy Web’s ecosystem.</p><p>Ultimately, climate change is a shared challenge. We believe that by open-sourcing this solution, we enable network effects — more contributions, more adoption, and more emissions saved. No single company can decarbonize IT on its own, but together, we can make carbon-aware computing the “new normal” for all data centers and&nbsp;devices.</p> Join the&nbsp;Movement <p>Carbon-aware computing is the future. Whether you’re an enterprise managing thousands of servers, a blockchain enthusiast, or a developer hacking on weekends, you can start integrating Carbon-Aware Nomination into your workflows to make a tangible impact. This isn’t just an Energy Web project — it’s a call to all cloud providers, decentralized network operators, and software platforms: join us in running workloads on clean energy. Imagine a world where every AI training, every render job, every transaction validation automatically seeks out the greenest energy available. That’s what we’re building, and we invite you to build it with&nbsp;us.</p><p>The code will be open-sourced on Energy Web’s GitHub (and accessible through our developer portal). We’ll be hosting community calls and tutorials for those who want to implement it or contribute. By working together, we can ensure that the digital infrastructure of the future not only powers our economies — but also heals our planet. It’s time to decarbonize the cloud, one workload at a&nbsp;time.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/carbon-aware-nomination-system-for-decentralized-computing-is-now-live-604996982c0f">Carbon-Aware Nomination System for Decentralized Computing is now live</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

By embracing this approach, organisations can ensure microcredentials acknowledge diverse achievements and highlight contributions that might otherwise be overlooked.</p><p>For instance microcredentials can help:</p>  Charities — Recognise the skills gained through volunteering, advocacy, and community projects, offering participants portable evidence of their contributions.  NGOs — Validate the efforts of community workers, promoting inclusion and recognising the expertise developed in challenging environments.  Co-ops — Highlight collaborative and informal learning within member-driven structures, supporting collective progress and innovation.  Businesses — Align microcredentials with organisational priorities, such as sustainability or diversity, to strengthen employee development and retention.  Higher Education — Create stackable credentials that integrate with degree programmes and reflect industry partnerships, enabling more flexible and relevant learning pathways.   The Responsible Use of Technology <p>Technology plays a critical role in delivering effective microcredentialing systems. Tools like <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/What_Are_Open_Badges%3F?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Open Badges</a> and Verifiable Credentials ensure transparency, portability, and security. Digital wallets give learners control over their achievements, while AI can assist in mapping skills and recommending pathways.</p><p>However, implementing these tools requires careful consideration. Equity, accessibility, and data privacy must be central to their design to avoid excluding certain groups or compromising trust. By prioritising interoperability and avoiding proprietary systems, organisations can ensure credentials remain functional across platforms and contexts.</p> Encouraging Cross-Sector Collaboration <p>The development of impactful microcredentialing systems relies on partnerships across education providers, employers, policymakers, and technology developers. Collaboration can:</p>  Align microcredentials with societal goals and workforce needs.  Establish shared quality assurance frameworks to build trust.  Pool resources and expertise to address challenges like accessibility and cost.  <p>Such partnerships help ensure that microcredentials are not only useful but also widely recognised and respected.</p> Embedding Inclusivity and Equity <p>For microcredentialing systems to achieve their full potential, inclusivity must be at their core. This means designing platforms that are accessible to people with diverse needs, reducing financial barriers, and proactively engaging marginalised communities. Embedding these values ensures microcredentials contribute meaningfully to social equity and support lifelong learning opportunities.</p> Taking the Next Step <p>Microcredentials have the potential to celebrate diverse learning experiences, allowing individuals to present their skills and achievements in ways that matter. Whether your organisation is considering a pilot project or a larger-scale initiative, We Are Open Co-op can provide the expertise you need. From strategic planning to technological implementation, we ensure your microcredentialing projects are impactful and learner-focused.</p> <p>👋 <a href="https://weareopen.coop/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop#four">Get in touch</a> with us today to explore how we can support your journey toward a more inclusive and forward-thinking approach to credentialing.</p>

<p>When can you trust a software release? How do you know that a software repo is safe, that it represents the intent of its creators? On the 20th anniversary of Git, these questions are more important than ever.</p>

<p>Obviously, Git lays the foundation for trust in software releases with its ability to sign commits, but the trust of the system is unfortunately shallow. Untrusted content can be merged into a trusted repo, commit histories can be rewritten, and trust can’t be reliably extended into the future. These are crucial issues to solve if we are trusting software that originates in Git … and some pretty crucial software originates with Git, from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">Microsoft’s vscode</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl">OpenSSL project</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/core">vue.js framework</a>. Which is what led me to the design of the Open Integrity system. Though Git may look like to the average user like it offers a strong level of trust, it’s a dangerous mirage. Open Integrity makes repo trust a reality.</p>


  


<p>Open Integrity is still built with Git, meaning that it can be used on GitHub, GitLab, or whatever other Git tool that you prefer. There are no additions required other than the Open Integrity scripts themselves. However, Open Integrity makes trust the default rather than an add-on, establishing a root of trust when a repo is created, defending it against inappropriate additions, and extending that trust to new users and new keys as a project evolves.</p>

<p>Beyond that, Open Integrity’s root of trust can also be used as a DID (decentralized identifier) identity, supporting <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> for a user or a project. But taking advantage of that might be the next step. For the moment, let me dive a bit further into the problems of Git’s current trust framework and how I designed the architecture of Open Integrity to resolve them.</p>

 A Problem of Trust 

<p>The foundation of trust in Git is signing commits with a signing key that is registered with a Git account, but that turns out to be a fragile level of trust because it leaves a number of loopholes.</p>

 
   
    <p>Signing isn’t required. Even if an account has a legitimate signing key, use of that key isn’t required. Even if a Git hosting service enforces commit signing, unsigned commits can typically still be merged from branches.</p>
   
   
    <p>Merging doesn’t guarantee signatures. Generally, merging offers one of the biggest gaps in signing security. It’s not just that merged commits can be unsigned, but that a branch can be deleted after merging, leaving no trace as to whether its commits were signed or not.</p>
   
 

<p>Things don’t necessarily get better when signing actually occurs.</p>

 
   
    <p>Repo origin can’t be verified. Though you can verify signed commits belong to the person who currently controls a repo, there’s no way to verify that they haven’t illegitimately taken over the repo since its inception.</p>
   
   
    <p>Chain of trust functionality is non-existant. On the flipside, there’s no way to show a legitimate transfer of authority between a repo’s originator and its current controller.</p>
   
   
    <p>Key revocation is weak. Though keys can be manually revoked, there’s no way to automatically do so, and there are no warnings if a revoked key was used for signing.</p>
   
   
    <p>History can be rewritten. Finally, Git includes a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">purposeful tool</a> to allow you to rewrite commit history: editing commit messages, rebasing at a large scale, and even removing or changing files! This will change SHA-1 checksums, but as with other dangers here, there’s inadequate messaging to warn of this issue.</p>
   
 

 Solving the Problems 

<p>Solving Git’s trust issues are relatively easy in theory:</p>

 
   Repo ownership needs to be cryptographically provable back to a repo’s origin. 
   Signing needs to be required for commits and merges alike. 
   Commit history needs to be irrevocable. 
   Strong warnings are needed when these conditions aren’t met. 
 

<p>However, nothing is ever that simple in practice. To practically solve the problems required designing an Open Integrity architecture that resolved each of the highlighted problems:</p>


  
    
      Problem
      Solution
    
  
  
    
      Unverified Origin
      Inception Commit
    
    
      Unverified Transfer
      Trust Transition Commit
    
    
      Key Revocation
      Trust Transition Commit<br>Improved Logging
    
    
      Signing Not Required
      Scripted Functions<br>Defined Settings
    
    
      Merging Issues
      Scripted Functions<br>Data Preservation<br>Defined Settings
    
    
      History Issues
      Improved Logging<br>Defined Settings
    
  


<p>Here’s how each of these architectural elements work:</p>

<p>Inception Commit. An inception commit is the first commit made to a repo. It locks the repo’s inception (initial) key with an empty commit, and so secures the repo with both the SSH signature and a SHA-1 hash that’s hard to purposefully collide because of the minimalism of the commit.</p>

<p>Trust Transition Commit. Any authorized key can be used to generate a trust transition commit, which is another zero-sized commit. Additional, trusted keys can be added, and keys can also be revoked. This allows both keys and team members to change over the course of a project, which is crucial for an open-source or large-scale project. The first trust transition commit is done with the inception key; after that any authorized key can be used.</p>

<p>Improved Logging. Many of the protections of Open Integrity arise from scripts that incorporate extensive logging, ensuring that users can see that all security measures are being met. This is done with Git commit messages and with <code>git note</code>.</p>

<p>As an example, here is what the commit logging looks like for an inception commit, a trust transition commit, and a key revocation:</p>

<p>Inception Commit:</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #a3306ef [🏁 Inception Commit] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Initialize repository and establish a SHA-1 root of trust"
    ├─ Signed by: @a61TkTtL... (🏁 Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Empty: true (no files added)
    ├─ SHA-1 Protection: Constrained content + SSH signature
└─ Verification: Platform-independent
</code>   

<p>Trust Transition Commit:</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #b24d9c1 [🔑 New Allowed Commit Signers File] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Added second device key for Alice"
    ├─ Signed by: @a61TkTtL... (🏁 Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
    └─ New Authorized Commit Signers:  
        - 🏁 Inception Key explicitly not included for future commits
        - + @a61TkTtL... (Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)  
        - + @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 2 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
</code>   
<p>Key Revocation:</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #c3d7f12 [🔄 Key Rotation: Removed Alice's Second Device] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Revoked second device key"
    ├─ Signed by: @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 2 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Authorized Commit Signers changed:
        - 🗑️ @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;) is no longer authorized.
        - @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 2 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
        - @b73RkKpQ... (Bob using Work Laptop &lt;bob@example.com&gt;)  
        - @c58XmWpL... (Charlie using Home PC &lt;charlie@example.com&gt;) 
</code>   
<p>The commits also clearly show when something is done that violates the basic precepts of Open Integrity. For example:</p>
   <code>    ├─ 🚨 ERROR: Commit was signed using a previously revoked key!
</code>   

<p>Scripted Functions. Logging and the other protections of Open Integrity are available through scripts and one-line “snippet” scripts that can run from aliases. They replace the bare <code>git</code> functions with ones that ensure that each commit or merge meets all the Open Integrity requirements. For example, here’s a <code>git merge</code> alias:</p>
   <code>git merge feature-branch --verify-signatures \
    --require-author-signature \
    --require-committer-authorization
</code>   

<p>Defined Settings. Git allows settings for repos and workflows; securing these settings can improve the security of repos. <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Enforcing_Signed_Commits_And_PRs_GitHub.md">“Enforcing Signed Commits and Pull Request Requirements in GitHub”</a> describes how GitHub makes use of these settings; similar functionality is available elsewhere in the Git ecosystem.</p>

<p>Data Preservation. Logging, aliases, and settings together ensure the preservation of some data related to a merge. As the following commit shows, information such as an author’s key is preserved when a merge occurs, along with information that the committer verified the original signature.</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #fa34d76 [🔀 Merge Commit with Verified Author] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Merge feature-branch: Added authentication layer"
    ├─ Committer: @c58XmWpL... (Charlie using Home PC &lt;charlie@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Author: @e83TkLqM... (Eve using Dev Machine &lt;eve@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Author Signature: Verified ✓ (signed 2024-02-10T15:30:00Z)
    ├─ Committer Authorization: Verified ✓ (in allowed_signers since 2024-01-15)
    └─ Signatures stored: ./config/verification/signatures
</code>   
<p>The original author’s signature is not currently preserved due to the complexity of doing so. Working to preserve the signature without having to keep the branch around forever remains on the TODO list for Open Integrity.</p>

 Using Open Integrity Now 

<p>Open Integrity is available at the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject">OpenIntegrityProject repo</a>. Though it’s still in development, you can get started with it right now.</p>

<p>You should do so if you have a use case for Open Integrity such as:</p>

 
   You’re developing or releasing software through Git that holds sensitive information (such as a digital-asset wallet, a healthcare app, or even a web browser). 
   You’re developing or releasing software through Git that might be used by people or companies that also hold sensitive data (such as financial or medical companies), even if your app does not. 
   You’re developing or releasing software that requires any level of trust from its users. 
   You have a team of developers that changes over time. 
 

<p>The docs at the Open Integrity repo include a more extensive <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity_Problem_Statement.md">Problem Statement</a> that goes beyond what’s in this article, but the most important file might be the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/src/setup_git_inception_repo.sh">setup_git_inception_repo.sh</a> script, which will create a new Open Integrity repository for you. If you want to better understand how it works under the hood, see <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity-CLI_One_Liners.md">One Liners</a>, which also documents step-by-step how to setup and use an Open Integrity repo. Future plans can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/ROADMAP.md">Project Roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>Give it <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity-CLI_One_Liners.md">a try</a>, and if you have questions, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/issues">open an issue</a> or <a href="https://github.com/orgs/OpenIntegrityProject/discussions">start a conversation</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on Open Integrity for about a year now. I started this work because I thought the promise of trust implicit in Git was extremely important for software design and release, but that it needed improvement. I hope you’ll agree and find the improvements worthwhile!</p>

<p>But that should not stop us from developing for it. Because what it specifies is laid out plainly in its PAR (Project Authorization Request):</p>
<blockquote><p>This draft standard covers contractual interactions and agreements between individuals and the service providers they engage on a network, including websites.</p>
<p>It describes how individuals, acting as first parties, can proffer their privacy requirements as contractual terms and arrive at agreements recorded and kept by both sides.</p>
<p>These terms shall be chosen from a collection of standard-form agreements in a roster kept by an independent and neutral non-business entity.</p>
<p>Computing devices and software performing as agents for both first and second parties shall engage using any protocol that serves the purpose.</p>
<p>The first party shall point to a preferred agreement, or a set of agreements, from which the second party shall accept one.</p>
<p>Party-to-party negotiations over terms in any of these contracts or other agreements are outside the scope of this standard. If both parties agree, the chosen contract or agreement shall be signed electronically by both parties or their agents.</p>
<p>A matching record shall be kept by both sides in a form that can be retrieved, audited, or disputed, if necessary, at some later time–and which is available to do so easily.*</p></blockquote>
<p>MyTerms does not specify what tech to use. It just says what needs to happen. This is to leave development as open as possible.</p>
<p>The main thing is that MyTerms obsolesces cookie notices by putting individuals in charge of their privacy requirements—and putting those requirements in the form of contracts, which individuals proffer as first parties.</p>
<p>Never mind that this hardly seems thinkable to the status quo. The same was once said of the Internet, the Web, email, and other free and open graces we take for granted today.</p>
<p>Putting each of us in charge of our privacy online is what makes MyTerms <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">the most important standard in development today</a>. But only if we make it so.</p>

<p>Just days after Google confirmed it is bringing its next AI upgrade to Gmail,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/03/24/google-confirms-gmail-upgrade-3-billion-users-must-now-decide/">with major privacy implications</a>, there’s more good and bad news for the 3 billion users relying on Google to deliver secure, spam-free email to their phones and computers. It turns out that a dangerous email attack has operated under the radar for years — until now.</p>



<p>First to the good news. Google’s tightening restrictions on the mass delivery of spam emails to your inbox is working and it’s having a devastating impact on the industry spawned to plague you with marketing messages. “Over the last year,” website&nbsp;<a href="https://martech.org/apple-and-gmail-make-it-harder-for-email-campaigns-to-get-to-the-inbox/">MarTech</a>&nbsp;says the industry has seen “engagement rates (open and click rates, especially) drop considerably. Their emails only show up in the inboxes of people already engaging with the brand. For most subscribers, the emails are getting flagged as spam.”</p>

<p>This is the sixth in a series of blog posts drawing on insights from a <a href="https://www.ndln.ie/new-learning-and-teaching-models?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">report authored by We Are Open Co-op</a> (WAO) for the Irish National Digital Leadership Network (NDLN). The report explores the historical roots of credentialing, the emergence of microcredentials, and the opportunities they present for reshaping education and professional development.</p><p>While microcredentials present exciting opportunities, their implementation comes with challenges that require careful consideration. Issues such as equity, quality assurance, and unintended consequences must be addressed to ensure these systems benefit learners, organisations, and society as a whole. WAO uses the lens of <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Open Recognition</a> to help address some of these challenges.</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-1-50b0fc77cd05">Part 1 — Introduction and Context</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-2-985ab20a1176">Part 2 — The Evolution of Credentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-3-c3c956c09574">Part 3 — Demystifying Microcredentials</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-4-4a0811255a00">Part 4 — Trends Shaping the Future of Microcredentials</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-5-fde07efdcbd2">Part 5 — The Role of Technology in Microcredentialing</a>  Part 6 — Challenges and Risks in Microcredentialing (this post)  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-7-4ce87debec12">Part 7 — A Vision for the Future of Microcredentials</a>   Equity and Accessibility <p>Microcredentials have the potential to widen participation in education, but they must be designed to include all learners. Organisations need to ensure their systems are accessible to users with diverse needs, including those with disabilities, limited digital literacies, or restricted access to technology.</p><p>Financial barriers also pose a challenge. For learners in marginalised communities, the cost of earning and using microcredentials could limit their accessibility. Subsidised or open-access credentialing models can help bridge this gap and make microcredentials a tool for inclusion rather than exclusivity. As can credentialing existing knowledge, skills, and behaviours, in accordance with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_of_prior_learning?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Recognition of Prior Learning</a>.</p> Quality Assurance and Trust <p>One of the most pressing challenges is ensuring that microcredentials maintain credibility and rigour. Open Badges provide a robust digital framework that ensures credentials can be verified and trusted, embedding metadata that describes the skills achieved, the criteria met, and the issuing organisation. This transparency builds trust among stakeholders, enabling credentials to be portable and interoperable across different platforms and contexts.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>However, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/building-credibility-into-digital-credentials-59945d07ace0">quality assurance</a> ultimately rests with the issuing organisation. It is their responsibility to ensure that criteria for earning the credential are clear, the evidence supporting the achievement is credible, and the learning experience is both meaningful and relevant. Aligning credentials with recognised national or international standards further enhances their credibility and utility, ensuring they meet the expectations of both learners and employers.</p> Avoiding Vendor Lock-In <p>The reliance on proprietary platforms for issuing and managing microcredentials can create significant risks. As mentioned in a prior post, vendor lock-in limits portability and learner control, undermining the principles of openness and inclusivity.</p><p>Adopting open standards, such as Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials, ensures that microcredentials are interoperable across systems. This not only protects learners but also encourages innovation by encouraging collaboration between organisations and technology providers.</p> Data Privacy and Security <p>Microcredentialing systems rely on digital platforms to issue, store, and share credentials, making data privacy and security critical concerns. Protecting the personal information of learners is both a legal and ethical responsibility.</p><p>Open Badges v3 offers solutions by enabling credentials to be controlled directly by learners. Features such as selective sharing ensure that individuals can decide what information to share and with whom. However, care must be taken to avoid systems that lock learners into proprietary platforms, restricting the portability of their achievements.</p> Unintended Consequences <p>Microcredentials can create new opportunities for recognition, but poorly designed systems may have unintended effects:</p>  Overloading learners with excessive or narrowly focused credentials can lead to “credential fatigue,” where the value of individual achievements is diminished.  Issuing credentials for specific skills or behaviours might inadvertently disadvantage those without them, regardless of their actual capabilities.  Systems that favour those with more resources, digital literacy, or prior access to credentialing risk perpetuating inequalities rather than addressing them.  <p>To avoid these pitfalls, microcredentialing systems should adopt <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Open Recognition</a> principles, which aim to value diverse experiences and learning pathways. Recognising informal, community-based, and lived experiences alongside formal achievements can help ensure inclusivity.</p> Sector-Specific Challenges <p>Different sectors face unique challenges when adopting microcredentials:</p>  Charities — Struggle with limited resources to implement digital credentialing systems that are both accessible and effective.  NGOs — Face difficulties in ensuring that microcredentials are inclusive for the communities they serve, particularly in low-resource environments.  Co-ops — Need to balance member-driven governance models with the technical requirements of interoperable credentialing systems.  Businesses — Risk prioritising microcredentials that align only with short-term goals, neglecting broader workforce development needs.  Higher Education — Must address resistance from academic departments that may view microcredentials as a threat to traditional degree programmes.  <p>Each of these sectors brings its own priorities and constraints to the table, but many of the challenges share common threads. Limited resources, resistance to change, and technical hurdles can all undermine the successful implementation of microcredentials if not carefully managed. Recognising these shared difficulties can help inform more effective, cross-sector strategies.</p> Practical Steps for Addressing Challenges <p>To overcome these challenges, organisations need to adopt thoughtful and inclusive approaches that address both technical and systemic barriers.</p>  Collaborate on shared frameworks that not only ensure technical validity but also assess the clarity of criteria, credibility of evidence, and relevance of learning experiences. These frameworks build trust across institutions and sectors, making microcredentials more valuable and credible.  Use open standards like Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials to ensure that microcredentials are portable, secure, and learner-centred. These standards allow credentials to be recognised across platforms and contexts, giving learners more control over their achievements.  Focus on recognising diverse forms of learning, including informal, community-based, and experiential achievements. This approach ensures inclusivity and acknowledges the broad spectrum of skills and contributions individuals bring.  Continuously evaluate systems for equity and accessibility, addressing barriers such as financial constraints, digital literacy gaps, and platform design issues. By identifying and mitigating these challenges, organisations can expand participation and make microcredentials more inclusive.   Looking Ahead <p>Addressing these challenges requires thoughtful design, collaboration, and a commitment to inclusivity. By developing systems that prioritise accessibility, quality, and openness, organisations can harness the potential of microcredentials to empower learners and drive meaningful change.</p><p>In the final post of this series, we will explore a vision for the future of microcredentials, outlining actionable steps for organisations to integrate them into their strategies effectively.</p>

 Energy Web, WattTime, and Green Software Foundation Unveil Open-Source Carbon-Aware Nomination to Green Decentralized Computing <p>Zug, Switzerland &amp; Oakland, CA — April 3, 2025 — Energy Web, a global nonprofit building open-source Web3 technologies for the energy transition, WattTime, an environmental tech nonprofit providing real-time grid emissions data, and the Green Software Foundation (GSF) today announced the launch of Carbon-Aware Nomination, an open-source system for scheduling computing workloads based on electricity carbon-intensity. This first-of-its-kind solution leverages GSF’s Carbon-Aware SDK, blockchain technology, and live emissions data from WattTime to ensure that applications run when and where power is cleanest, drastically reducing the carbon intensity of computing workloads.</p><p>A New Standard for Carbon-Aware Compute</p><p>Carbon-Aware Nomination combines Energy Web’s decentralized computing platform with WattTime’s Automated Emissions Reduction (AER) data feeds and GSF’s Carbon-Aware SDK, allowing any batch job or flexible workload to automatically “chase” the lowest-carbon energy available. Instead of running immediately or in a fixed location, a task can be delayed or relocated — for example, executing at night in a region with abundant wind energy — with the entire decision process orchestrated and verified on the Energy Web X blockchain. Unlike traditional cloud computing tools, this system provides cryptographic proof of the carbon emissions caused, giving enterprises and developers unprecedented transparency into the sustainability of their IT operations.</p><blockquote>“Our community has been looking for ways to cut IT emissions without sacrificing performance or trust,” said Mani Hagh Sefat, CTO of Energy Web. “Carbon-Aware Nomination delivers that by leveraging decentralization. By partnering with WattTime and integrating GSF’s Carbon-Aware SDK, we’re injecting the best real-time data into an open, trustless network of computing resources. The result is a game-changer — any organization can now ensure its workloads run with the lowest possible carbon impact, and they can prove it. We’re excited to open-source this tool and work with others to scale it up; this is about creating a new norm for green computing across the industry.”</blockquote><p>Collaboration Across Climate-Tech Innovators</p><p>WattTime’s leadership echoed the significance of this collaboration.</p><blockquote>“This partnership demonstrates how data and technology can come together to fight climate change in new domains,” said Gavin McCormick, WattTime co-founder and Executive Director. “Energy Web’s innovative use of our emissions intelligence, coupled with the Green Software Foundation’s Carbon-Aware SDK, ensures that even computing workloads can automatically prioritize clean energy. We’re thrilled to see Automated Emissions Reduction principles expanding into cloud and blockchain infrastructure. By giving organizations the power to run tasks when renewables are abundant, Carbon-Aware Nomination turns climate intention into&nbsp;action.”</blockquote><blockquote>The Green Software Foundation (GSF), which has been advancing sustainability in software development, also sees this as an important milestone. “GSF’s mission is to reduce the environmental impact of software, and integrating our Carbon-Aware SDK into decentralized compute systems represents a major step toward that goal,” said Asim Hussain, Executive Director of Green Software Foundation. “By working with Energy Web and WattTime, we’re proving that sustainability can be a core part of modern computing — measurable, verifiable, and open-source.”</blockquote><p>An Open-Source Future for Climate-Smart Computing</p><p>The Carbon-Aware Nomination system is fully open-source, with documentation and developer tools provided by Energy Web. Companies and developers can integrate it into cloud workflows, decentralized applications, or scheduling software to begin reducing the carbon emissions of their operations. Because the solution runs on a public blockchain, any sustainability claims are transparent and auditable by third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>This initiative also aligns with broader efforts by the tech sector to cut emissions: recent studies estimate that data centers and networks account for over 1% of global electricity use, and industry leaders are keen to mitigate this&nbsp;impact.</p><p>By launching Carbon-Aware Nomination in collaboration with WattTime and the Green Software Foundation, Energy Web aims to foster an ecosystem of climate-smart computing. The three organizations plan to engage cloud providers, enterprises, and researchers in adopting the approach. This joint effort showcases the power of cross-sector partnerships, bringing together blockchain-based decentralization, real-time environmental intelligence, and software-driven carbon-aware scheduling.</p><p>Energy Web, WattTime, and GSF invite interested partners to join the initiative, contribute to the open-source codebase, and collectively drive a new era of sustainable digital infrastructure.</p><p>About Energy&nbsp;Web</p><p>Energy Web is a software company developing open-source technologies to accelerate the energy transition. Its decentralized solutions leverage blockchain to create innovative market mechanisms, empowering energy companies, grid operators, and businesses worldwide. (<a href="http://www.energyweb.org">www.energyweb.org</a>)</p><p>About WattTime</p><p>WattTime is an environmental tech nonprofit that empowers all people, companies, policymakers, and countries to slash emissions and choose cleaner energy.

<p>This is the fifth in a series of blog posts drawing on insights from <a href="https://www.ndln.ie/new-learning-and-teaching-models?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">a report authored by We Are Open Co-op</a> (WAO) for the Irish National Digital Leadership Network (NDLN). The report explores the historical roots of credentialing, the emergence of microcredentials, and the opportunities they present for reshaping education and professional development in line with the concept of <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Open Recognition</a>.</p><p>Technology plays a key role in the development and delivery of microcredentials, enabling their portability, transparency, and scalability. By making use of digital tools built on open standards, organisations can ensure that microcredentials are secure, meaningful, and accessible to learners across sectors.</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-1-50b0fc77cd05">Part 1 — Introduction and Context</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-2-985ab20a1176">Part 2 — The Evolution of Credentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-3-c3c956c09574">Part 3 — Demystifying Microcredentials</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-4-4a0811255a00">Part 4 — Trends Shaping the Future of Microcredentials</a>  Part 5 — The Role of Technology in Microcredentialing (this post)  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-6-fe96ea9be396">Part 6 — Challenges and Risks in Microcredentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-7-4ce87debec12">Part 7 — A Vision for the Future of Microcredentials</a>   Open Standards: Making Credentials Portable and Trusted <p>One of the key technological foundations for microcredentials is the use of open standards. Open standards ensure that credentials can be shared and recognised across different systems, making them more portable and trustworthy.</p><p><a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/What_Are_Open_Badges%3F?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Open Badges</a>, first introduced in 2011, set the stage for this revolution. These digital credentials provide important information, such as what the learner achieved, who issued the badge, and the criteria they met. The latest version, Open Badges v3, goes even further by aligning with a global framework called Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>This update brings several improvements:</p>  Learner Control — Credentials can now be managed by the individual rather than being tied to a single institution or platform.  No Mandatory Image — While the badge image remains a useful visual, the most important feature is the detailed information embedded in the credential, which helps employers and others verify it easily.  Rich Information — Microcredentials can now include deeper context about what was achieved, such as specific skills, the learning process, and connections to recognised frameworks or standards.  <p>These advancements make microcredentials more meaningful and usable, not just in local settings but internationally as well.</p> Digital Wallets: Empowering Learners <p>Digital wallets, sometimes referred to as ‘credential management’ apps, are a transformative tool for managing microcredentials. By storing credentials in a secure, user-controlled environment on their mobile device, learners gain full ownership of their achievements. This flexibility allows individuals to share only the information needed for specific opportunities, such as job applications or further study, while maintaining privacy.</p><p>For example, a learner could use their digital wallet to share a single credential with a potential employer, without needing to reveal unrelated personal details such as their age or gender. This approach protects privacy and gives learners greater control over how their achievements are presented.</p><p>Digital wallets also facilitate the portability of microcredentials, ensuring that they can be recognised across different contexts. For organisations, adopting digital wallet-compatible credentials demonstrates a commitment to learner-centric practices and enhances the usability of their offerings.</p> Sector-Specific Applications <p>Technology enables microcredentials to meet the unique needs of different sectors, enhancing their impact and relevance:</p>  Charities — Use digital badges to recognise volunteer contributions, fundraising efforts, and advocacy skills, providing participants with evidence of their impact.  NGOs — Leverage open standards to validate community workers’ skills and promote inclusivity in recognition practices.  Co-ops — Employ interoperable credentials to highlight informal learning and collaborative problem-solving within member-driven environments.  Businesses — Integrate microcredentials with existing professional development platforms to enhance employee upskilling and retention, focusing on sustainability or diversity goals.  Higher Education — Adopt technologies like digital wallets to make credentials earned through co-curricular activities or industry collaborations more accessible and portable for students.   Balancing Innovation with Responsibility <p>Technology offers new possibilities for recognising and showcasing skills, but its use must be carefully planned to avoid potential pitfalls. Challenges such as over-reliance on specific vendors, risks to data security, and barriers to access can undermine the effectiveness and fairness of microcredentialing systems.</p><p>To address these concerns:</p>  Adopt open-source and interoperable solutions — These reduce the risk of being locked into a single provider’s platform, ensuring flexibility and long-term sustainability.  Focus on accessibility — Systems should be designed to include users with a wide range of needs, enabling participation from all, regardless of ability or circumstance.  Prioritise data security and privacy — Organisations must implement robust measures to protect sensitive user information, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and building trust among learners and stakeholders.  <p>By taking a responsible approach, organisations can ensure that their microcredentialing efforts are not only innovative but also equitable, secure, and adaptable for the future.</p> Looking Ahead <p>Technology is more than just a way to expand microcredentials — it is reshaping how learning is recognised and valued. By using approaches built on open standards, organisations can create microcredentialing systems that are secure, accessible to everyone, and focused on the needs of learners.</p><p>In the next post, we will explore the challenges and risks associated with microcredentialing, including how to address equity, quality assurance, and unintended consequences.</p>

<p>Specialists from different fields in the digital identity ecosystem have shed light on what it takes to be accredited for New Zealand’s Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF). They shared their thoughts during a webinar on March 26 moderated by the Executive Director of Digital Identity New Zealand, Colin Wallis, during which they also explained details about the process and the benefits that come with the accreditation.</p>



<p>The DISTF in New Zealand is a legal framework designed to regulate digital identity services as the country looks to expand its digital ID services. New rules and accreditation system of the DISTF&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/new-zealand-finalizes-digital-identity-services-trust-framework">took effect</a>&nbsp;last November.</p>



<p>The objective of the webinar dubbed “DISTF Evaluators Showcase” was to provide an opportunity for those considering a DISTF accreditation to have an understanding of its advantages for small and large scale entities, organizational roles, costs and time frames, and the preparation process for the evaluation of compliance with standards which precedes the accreditation application.</p>



<p>Discussants included security consultant at Middleware Group,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-norcliffe-2646061/">Tom Norcliffe</a>; Director of Cyber, Privacy and Resilience at Deloitte which is an accredited evaluator,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-bossert-02186b11/">Marcus Bossert</a>; and Founder of Cianaa Technologies,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cianaatech/">Rizwan Ahmad</a>, who are all&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">Digital Identity New Zealand</a>&nbsp;members. There was also the Regulatory Practice Manager of New Zealand’s Department of Internal Affairs,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deanne-myers-746628a7/">Deanne Myers</a>.</p>



<p>The first three speakers took time off to make an introduction of their companies, highlighting their services and key projects across the domains of digital identity and cybersecurity. They also mentioned some of their projects in New Zealand and the institutions they work with.</p>



<p>Bossert, for a start, explained the work Deloitte as a consultancy services firm is doing in the digital security assessment space. He mentioned that the firm offers services in cyber strategy, transformation, digital privacy, trust, and enterprise security, application cloud security, emerging technology solutions, threat detection and response, as well as operational security services. He also said that they have worked extensively on digital identity projects.</p>



<p>He said evaluation for the DISTF accreditation process looks at several factors including enterprise security, cloud security, security and resilience mechanisms, and threat detection and response, among others. The official also explained that the firm plays a significant role in guiding organizations through the accreditation process, helping them to align their cybersecurity and privacy expertise in order to ensure successful transactions.</p>



 Accreditation not a mere compliance formality 



<p>The accreditation, he insisted, is not just for the purposes of compliances but is something that enables entities demonstrate robust security practices which are vital for building confidence and trust among stakeholders such as boards, customers, and even regulators.</p>



<p>“If you think about why you want to get accredited, you’ve got to think about the stakeholders that are involved in this. But fundamentally, you have to think about it from a more practical and operational perspective as well,” Bossert said.</p>



<p>“Security, privacy, development and operations teams are really interested in knowing that you have solid security practices built in. It is quite valuable for them to understand and have clarity on what the control measures are. So, I see the accreditation process as a mechanism to build confidence that your stakeholders need,” he stated.</p>



<p>“[Thanks to] the work that we do, our knowledge and global network, we can help you accelerate readiness and navigate the shortest path to success, so that we help you focus on those things that really matter, get your accreditation and accelerate operational readiness.”</p>



<p>For his part, Norcliffe from Middleware Group emphasized the importance of the digital ID trust framework, saying it is crucial for most of the work they are doing with government entities and the private sector in New Zealand.</p>



<p>Taking the floor, Ahmad said Cianaa Technologies has a framework on which their team of independent security evaluators offer services which include penetration testing, privacy, and GDPR compliance.</p>



<p>“We assess organizations based on this [framework]. We see whether you’re keeping the information confidential, whether you have the integrity intact, whether your services are available, whether it has non-repetition, and if it has the proper authentication authorization,” he said.</p>



<p>“Now, when we assess your organization based on that, it actually automatically gives up to the right assessment, because if something is missing, then there’s something missing in security.”</p>



 Overview of accreditation application process 



<p>Myers said the team she manages is responsible for basically all aspects of the accreditation process. She gave an overview of components of the application process required by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dia.govt.nz/Trust-Framework-Authority">Trust Framework Authority</a>&nbsp;(TFA), noting that the entire process is transparent.</p>



<p>“We receive and assess applications for accreditation as a trust framework provider. We monitor ongoing compliance with the requirements of accreditation, assess applications for renewal, and obviously deal with any issues that arise in the course of these processes.”</p>



<p>She explained that a part of the application process requires results of an independent evaluation undertaken by independent evaluators, including a conformance assessment against the New Zealand identification standards. “Those outputs or deliverables will be submitted as part of an application,” she stated.</p>



<p>“There are currently 15 independent security evaluators who have been appointed and three privacy independent evaluators. However, we are currently undertaking an expression of interest process, calling for interest from other agencies who are able and who meet the criteria to be appointed as either a privacy or security evaluator, or both.”</p>



<p>Myers also shared important links and resources which can help those seeking accreditation to better understand what is required of them and how they can go through the process successfully. She also said the application would need to be submitted within 12 months of the standards compliance evaluation.</p>



 Understand what you need 



<p>The speakers also noted the place of AI in the trust framework evaluation process. Ahmad said while the technology can make a positive contribution to the process, it can also bring about challenges that effect these assessments.</p>



<p>Bossert added that those applying for accreditation must clearly understand what they need, and often, they expect the process to be as quick, painless and cost-effective as possible.</p>



<p>“If you’ve ever done something like an ISO accreditation, you would understand or know that it is very useful to be clear on the scope of accreditation that you’re looking for. So don’t apply for accreditation for areas that you don’t need. For example, if you’re not going to be providing personal information, then don’t sign up for accreditation for that,” he advised.</p>



<p>He also said for evaluators to have their work made easy, those seeking to provide trust services must take certain key factors into consideration, including having the right control and risk management mechanisms in place.</p>



<p>“I would suggest that you have a look at your solution and do a proper risk assessment early on so that you’ve got visibility of those risks and that you can start building in the necessary controls. In terms of risks, if you can demonstrate that you’re actively managing them and you have visibility and control, then that certainly helps to give the confidence needed.”</p>



<p>The aspect of pricing for the evaluation process was also addressed, with the speakers saying the process can range, approximately, from between $10,000 and $50,000, depending on the scope and the level of preparedness of the entity to be evaluated.</p>

<p></p>      First Web3 Global Battery Passport Implementation for Current and Future Regulatory Compliance           <p>Phase I of the Global Battery Passport System Demonstrated Product Traceability with Privacy-Preserving Capabilities and Selective Data Disclosure</p>
          <p>Los Angeles—31 March 2025: MOBI, a nonprofit Web3 consortium of global industry leaders, announces the successful completion of the first year in its three-year initiative to build the Global Battery Passport System (GBPS). This milestone marks a significant step in creating a secure, Self-Sovereign Identity and Data framework for seamless data spaces interoperability and digital product passports. MOBI is actively <a href="https://dlt.mobi/interoperability-pilot/">demonstrating data spaces interoperability</a> with other global consortia such as Gaia-X. While the GBPS initiative focuses on battery data exchange as its use case, the underlying technology is agnostic and can be leveraged to enhance trust, compliance, and operational efficiency for all digital transactions and traceability.</p>
<p>MOBI GBPS initiative is being spearheaded by members of the Circular Economy and the Global Battery Passport (CE-GBP) Working Group, including Anritsu, DENSO, HIOKI, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Orico, Suzuki, and TradeLog.</p>
<p>During Phase I, which took place from January to December 2024, working group members concentrated on evaluating global battery regulatory requirements and developing use cases aligned with Web3 technology for secure data exchange and management. Critically, implementers successfully launched and ran nodes on the federated<a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/"> Integrated Trust Network </a>(ITN), a member-built and operated registry for World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). The ITN provides the core trust services of governance, authority, identity, and assurance to enable verifiable transactions between <a href="https://dlt.mobi/ssdi/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twins</a> (user agents) whose DIDs are anchored in the ITN.</p>
<p>Building on the success of Phase I, MOBI and its partners are now advancing to Phase II. In Phase II, implementers will leverage ITN core services to test transactions within the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/citopia/">Citopia Decentralized Marketplace</a> (DM). Anticipated technical achievements in Phase II include Web3 ecosystem onboarding, asset ownership traceability, secure data exchange, and Apps building with Citopia DM.</p>
<p>The GBPS shall operate as a specialized user-controlled application within Citopia DM, which supports secure communication, transactions, and data sharing across industries with zero-knowledge proofs. Citopia DM provides the interoperability and data sovereignty that Web3 ecosystems and value chains require. Through this setup, the GBPS shall offer a privacy-focused solution that protects proprietary information and promotes circularity in line with current and future regulations, while serving as a robust foundation for use-case-specific applications rooted in trusted and verifiable battery data, such as:</p>
 
 management of battery passports, 
 used electric vehicle (EV) pricing, 
 green financing and carbon credits, 
 charging management, and more. 
 
<p>While most battery passport solutions focus on public data disclosure, Citopia GBPS emphasizes secure sharing of proprietary data. The GBPS leverages zero trust architecture and selective data disclosure, where only relevant information is shared with intended recipients. This privacy-centric design facilitates regulatory compliance while safeguarding sensitive data, reducing the need for intermediaries and enhancing trust across value chains, creating a Web3 system for data spaces interoperability across borders and stakeholders.</p>
<p>“As current and future regulations develop, solutions like the ITN and Citopia DM are essential for addressing industry and regulatory needs. MOBI is proud to work with our members in developing a solution that is agnostic to existing data spaces along with Web2&lt;&gt;Web3 interoperability to support business objectives in creating a more secure digital future and meeting circular economy goals,” said Tram Vo, CEO and Co-founder of MOBI.</p>
<p>“A global battery passport system has the potential to unlock new levels of traceability, transparency and security in battery-related applications, supporting our efforts to contribute to greener and safer mobility,” said Roger Berg, vice president of North America Research and Development at DENSO. “While that’s an important goal for our team, this solution also represents more than that. It’s a great example of how MOBI and our fellow members are working together to support a more circular economy and sustainable world.”</p>
<p>“The second stage of Phase I has provided further valuable insights to CE-GBP WG partners. In Stage 1, the basic data sharing environment was established. In Stage 2, the first business-related technical capabilities were explored, such as the ownership management of a DID-based asset and the selective disclosure of data between two organizations,” said Christian Köbel of Honda. “These successful learnings have encouraged us to further explore the potential of a self-sovereign data ecosystem to address future challenges of the circular economy.”</p>
<p>“The functionality of DIDs and Verifiable Credentials for reliable data federation among implementing companies has been successfully verified, utilizing the Integrated Trust Network. This endeavor not only demonstrates the potential of these technologies to enhance data federation but also emphasizes the constructive and agile collaboration achieved among implementers within the cooperative framework.” said Yusuke Zushi, Senior Manager at Nissan.</p>
<p>“In Phase 1 of the Global Battery Passport (GBP) system demonstration, we learned that the MOBI GBP can be used to exchange highly confidential information. We want to thank everyone involved in Phase 1,” said implementers at Mazda Motor Corporation.</p>
<p>Said Hisashi Matsumoto of Anritsu, “MOBI’s activities have led to the successful completion of Phase I, moving towards building an ecosystem that enables reliable and secure information exchange. We are grateful to have participated in the verification of use cases with practical operations. We hope that MOBI’s efforts will continue to contribute to a more sustainable circular economy.”</p>
<p>“We are very proud of the great results of Phase I which we have achieved based on our strong relationships with major OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, and more. It has been an exciting and interesting experience to work with such talented people. We will continue to take on challenges in Phase II in the name of collaboration,” said Alvin Ishiguro, Project Coordination at TradeLog, Inc.</p>
<p>MOBI and its members are committed to driving a future where collaborative, decentralized technologies foster innovation and transparency across industries.</p>
          <p>About MOBI</p>

<p>This is the fourth in a series of blog posts drawing on insights from <a href="https://www.ndln.ie/new-learning-and-teaching-models?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">a report authored by We Are Open Co-op</a> for the Irish <a href="https://www.ndln.ie/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">National Digital Leadership Network</a> (NDLN). The report explores the historical roots of credentialing, the emergence of microcredentials, and the opportunities they present for reshaping education and professional development.</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-1-50b0fc77cd05">Part 1 — Introduction and Context</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-2-985ab20a1176">Part 2 — The Evolution of Credentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-3-c3c956c09574">Part 3 — Demystifying Microcredentials</a>  Part 4 — Trends Shaping the Future of Microcredentials (this post)  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-5-fde07efdcbd2">Part 5 — The Role of Technology in Microcredentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-6-fe96ea9be396">Part 6 — Challenges and Risks in Microcredentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-7-4ce87debec12">Part 7 — A Vision for the Future of Microcredentials</a>  <p>Microcredentials are emerging as a significant development in education and professional development, reflecting broader shifts in how learning and skills are recognised. This post examines key trends shaping their future and explores how these developments are driving change across sectors. Our guiding concept in this is <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Open Recognition</a> which encourages organisations to think more holistically about the knowledge, skills, and behaviours they seek to promote.</p> Skills-Based Hiring <p>One of the most influential trends is the growing emphasis on hiring based on specific skills rather than traditional qualifications. Employers are increasingly seeking candidates with demonstrable competencies that align with their organisational needs. Microcredentials provide a structured way to validate these skills in a way that is transparent and verifiable.</p><p>For organisations, skills-based hiring supported by microcredentials allows for more inclusive recruitment practices, reducing reliance on traditional proxies like degrees. However, to succeed, microcredentials must be recognised as credible and portable, ensuring they meet the expectations of both employers and job seekers. This means they should be built on open standards such as <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/What_Are_Open_Badges%3F?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Open Badges</a>.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO Stackable Learning Pathways <p>The modular nature of microcredentials enables learners to build their qualifications incrementally, creating personalised pathways. This approach is particularly valuable for individuals balancing education with work or other commitments. Stackable credentials also align with the concept of lifelong learning, allowing learners to upskill or reskill as needed throughout their careers.</p><p>Aligning microcredentials with national or international qualification frameworks can enhance their value and portability, ensuring that learners can seamlessly combine credentials from different institutions or sectors. This alignment also supports employers and other organisations in recognising and valuing these credentials across diverse contexts. By working in collaboration, stakeholders can create systems that not only validate individual achievements but also enable progression and opportunity, therefore creating a connected and inclusive learning ecosystem.</p> The Role of Open Standards <p>The adoption of open standards, such as Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials, is critical to the future of microcredentials. These standards ensure that credentials are portable, secure, and interoperable across systems. By making use of metadata, they provide detailed information such as the knowledge, skills, and/or behaviours validated, the criteria met, and the issuing organisation. It may also include any endorsements made by individuals and organistions, further enhancing the value of the microcredential.</p><p>Open standards also facilitate the integration of microcredentials into digital wallets, meaning individuals can store and share their achievements easily. This approach empowers learners to take ownership of their credentials while ensuring transparency and trust.</p> Technology and Innovation <p>Emerging technologies are transforming how microcredentials are issued, managed, and verified. For example, Artificial intelligence (AI) is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmLP5c8jng&amp;ref=blog.weareopen.coop">being used to map skills</a> and recommend personalised learning pathways.</p><p>However, these technologies must be implemented responsibly. Issues such as data privacy, ethical AI use, and accessibility must be addressed to ensure that technological advancements benefit all learners and do not exacerbate existing inequalities.</p> Collaboration Across Sectors <p>The success of microcredentials depends on collaboration between education providers, employers, policymakers, and technology developers. These partnerships can ensure that microcredentials remain relevant and aligned with industry needs while encouraging innovation in how learning is recognised.</p><p>For example, microcredentials can be used to::</p>  Charities — Recognise skills gained through volunteer work, fundraising activities, and advocacy campaigns, enabling participants to showcase their contributions effectively.  NGOs — Validate the skills of community workers and volunteers, making their contributions visible and valued.  Co-ops — Highlight informal learning and collaboration, supporting shared growth and innovation among members.  Businesses — Align microcredentials with organisational values, such as sustainability or diversity, to enhance staff development and retention.  Higher Education — Partner with businesses to design credentials for emerging fields like green technology or AI ethics, and create opportunities for targeted, stackable learning pathways.   Looking Ahead <p>The trends shaping microcredentials reflect a shift towards more flexible, inclusive, and skills-focused education systems. By embracing open standards, leveraging technology, and fostering collaboration, organisations can unlock the full potential of microcredentials to meet the needs of learners and society.</p><p>In the next post, we’ll explore the role of technology in greater depth, examining the digital tools and frameworks that underpin modern microcredentialing systems.</p>

<p>60 Day Public Review - ends May 27th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) TC [1] are pleased to announce that TOSCA Version 2.0 CS01 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>TOSCA provides a language for describing application components and their relationships by means of a service topology, and for specifying the lifecycle management procedures for creation or modification of services using orchestration processes. The combination of topology and orchestration enables not only the automation of deployment but also the automation of the complete service lifecycle management. The TOSCA specification promotes a model-driven approach, whereby information embedded in the model structure (the dependencies, connections, compositions) drives the automated processes.</p>



<p>The TC received three Statements of Use from Ericsson, Tal Liron, and Chris Lauwers [3].</p>



<p>The candidate specification and related files are available here:</p>



<p>TOSCA Version 2.0&nbsp;</p>



<p>Committee Specification 01&nbsp;</p>



<p>5 December 2024&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA/v2.0/cs01/TOSCA-v2.0-cs01.md">https://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA/v2.0/cs01/TOSCA-v2.0-cs01.md</a> (Authoritative) </p>

<p>Members of the TOSCA TC approved this specification by Special Majority Vote [2]. The specification had been released for public review as required by the TC Process.</p>



<p>Public Review Period</p>



<p>The 60-day public review is now open and ends 27 May 2025 at 23:59 UTC.</p>



<p>This is an open invitation to comment. OASIS solicits feedback from potential users, developers and others, whether OASIS members or not, for the sake of improving the interoperability and quality of its technical work.</p>



<p>Comments may be submitted to the project by any person through the use of the project’s Comment Facility. Members of the TC should submit feedback directly to the TC’s members-only mailing list. All others should follow the <a href="https://groups.oasis-open.org/communities/community-home?CommunityKey=d5b0779f-32be-436c-8302-018dce261d48">instructions listed here.</a></p>



<p>All comments submitted to OASIS are subject to the OASIS Feedback License, which ensures that the feedback you provide carries the same obligations at least as the obligations of the TC members. In connection with this public review&nbsp; we call your attention to the OASIS IPR Policy [4] applicable especially [5] to the work of this technical committee. All members of the TC should be familiar with this document, which may create obligations regarding the disclosure and availability of a member’s patent, copyright, trademark and license rights that read on an approved OASIS specification.</p>



<p>OASIS invites any persons who know of any such claims to disclose these if they may be essential to the implementation of the above specification, so that notice of them may be posted to the notice page for this TC’s work.</p>

<p>This white paper is part of a three-part series on preventing phishing attacks through passkey deployment:</p>



 
 Part 1: Overview – Introduces the concepts of a passkey journey toward phishing prevention. 



 Part 2: Partial prevention – Details strategies for enforcing passkeys in specific scenarios. 



 Part 3: Full prevention – Explains how to achieve comprehensive phishing resistance. 
 



<p>Making your services phishing-resistant takes more than one day because you are not just adopting a new phishing-resistant authentication method. It is a journey with multiple stages where you improve security by strengthening account login and recovery processes. This paper outlines the passkey journey and defines the authentication and recovery requirements for each stage.</p>



 Audience 



<p>Relying parties and developers who want to protect their applications from phishing attacks by adopting passkeys.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>A Farewell Message<br><br>This is the final DINZ newsletter under my watch, but if the writing style seems familiar in April’s newsletter you’ll know that AI has been deployed or my successor hasn’t been fully onboarded&nbsp;.<br><br>It’s been a blast, it really has! I’m satisfied with DINZ’s development under my tenure. No regrets. DINZ has punched way above its weight with minimal resources – only made possible by larger organisations whose support enabled volunteer members and supporters from organisations of all sizes to dedicate time and expertise to deliver our mahi on its&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/about/">mission</a>. You know who you are, so thank you!&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks also to the DINZ Executive Councils I have served over the years. It’s a largely unheralded gig, but governance in emerging ecosystems is crucial.<br><br>DINZ Updates</p>



 
 The&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/biometrics-special-interest-group-sig/">DINZ Biometrics Special Interest Group</a>&nbsp;submitted again on the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2025/03/DINZ_Submission_on_Biometrics_Code_of_Practice_March_2025-CW-signed.pdf">Biometrics Code of Practice</a>&nbsp;this month. Neither DINZ or NZTech are supportive of the code at this time, instead advocating for expert prepared Guidance to improve biometrics implementation best practice for all stakeholders, including privacy specialists who may not necessarily be biometric experts. 



 By the time you read this, our webinar&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/distf-evaluators-showcase/">‘Meet the DISTF Evaluators’&nbsp;</a>will be underway with over 100 registrations – the first educational session on this aspect of the regime as DINZ members enter the final week of&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/educational-resources/">free access to InformDI’s 7 Chapters DISTF online education suite.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; 



 DINZ members&nbsp;please complete the DISTF survey emailed to you by 14 April. 



 The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/our-work/next-generation-payments/">Next Gen Payments Consultation</a>&nbsp;from DINZ member PaymentsNZ is due this Friday, so get yours in today!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 



<p><br>Industry Insights<br><br>There are some ‘green shoots’ appearing in Aotearoa New Zealand’s digital identity space, but we have years of catch-up ahead to regain our global leadership. We have to be more nimble, smart and collegial in all dimensions (detailed examples too much for the newsletter’s word count), but suffice to say that it’s Kiwi companies like MATTR, Authsignal, JNCTN, APLYiD, MyMahi and others that keep us on the map globally.<br><br>While taking more leisure time, I’m open to some advisory work leveraging my decades of knowledge, experience and contact networks in both local and international settings not often possible in this role.&nbsp;<br><br>What’s Happening Around the Globe<br><br>As always, I’m sharing links to global news that resonated with me.</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202503/passkeys-for-enterprise-report-from-fido-says-adoption-is-growing">Passkey adoption is growing globally</a>&nbsp;– no surprise to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authsignal.com/">Authsignal</a>&nbsp;who have secured business on nearly all continents in the past few weeks. 



 <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202503/tailored-biometric-systems-tests-lay-the-foundation-for-trust-biometrics-labs">This article</a>&nbsp;argues the case for local biometrics software testing and resonates exactly with DINZ’s Kiwi faces dataset project that requires stakeholder support before it can proceed. 



 DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/nec-facial-recognition-takes-top-score-in-half-of-latest-nist-1n-test-categories">NEC takes top score in the offshore tests that are available</a>. 



 I found recent pundit Jamie Smith’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/biggest-identity-market-one-youve-never-heard-jamie-smith--ksz9e?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;utm_campaign=share_via">post on the fraud market&nbsp;</a>quite thought provoking, although I don’t fully agree with him that Organisational Identity has been under a shadow. In NZ it’s not helped by agency responsibilities being split between MBIE and DIA. 



 OI forms a major plank of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.getverified.co.nz/">Get Verified</a>&nbsp;in the payments world but there are other worlds of course. 



 That brings me to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jamiedsmith_customerfutures-empowermenttech-activity-7308046049841930241-AH5F/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;rcm=ACoAAAC64Z4BsBpUlqet58BkfzAhb574r2zYOTA">another Jamie Smith post</a>&nbsp;on Edeleman’s Trust Barometer (in the comments) where Aotearoa’s own Āhau gets a mention.&nbsp; 



 &nbsp;And for those technical and following mDL&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chrisgoh_mdl-vc-mdoc-activity-7305214876644216834-joK9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAC64Z4BsBpUlqet58BkfzAhb574r2zYOTA">this link</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chrisgoh_github-isowg10iso-18013-activity-7305201788515729409-ymML?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAC64Z4BsBpUlqet58BkfzAhb574r2zYOTA">this link</a>&nbsp;show just how quickly this space is evolving and maturing. 
 



<p>Final Thoughts<br><br>That’s it! Make sure you do something ‘identiful’ in April or attend the regional virtual catch ups on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/event/identity-management-day-2025">Identity Management Day</a>&nbsp;and I’ll see you all soon out there in cyber.</p>

<p>This is the third in a series of blog posts drawing on the insights from <a href="https://www.ndln.ie/new-learning-and-teaching-models?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">a report authored by WAO</a> for the Irish <a href="https://www.ndln.ie/?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">National Digital Leadership Network</a> (NDLN). The report explores the historical roots of credentialing, the emergence of microcredentials, and the opportunities they present for reshaping education and professional development.</p><p>Microcredentials are increasingly discussed as a solution to the gaps in traditional education and workforce development systems. However, their purpose and value can be misunderstood, leading to confusion among educators, employers, and learners. In this post, with <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Open Recognition</a> as a guiding concept, we clarify what microcredentials are, address common misconceptions, and explore how they can meet diverse needs.</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-1-50b0fc77cd05">Part 1 — Introduction and Context</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-2-985ab20a1176">Part 2 — The Evolution of Credentialing</a>  Part 3 — Demystifying Microcredentials (this post)  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-4-4a0811255a00">Part 4 — Trends Shaping the Future of Microcredentials</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-5-fde07efdcbd2">Part 5 — The Role of Technology in Microcredentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-6-fe96ea9be396">Part 6 — Challenges and Risks in Microcredentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-7-4ce87debec12">Part 7 — A Vision for the Future of Microcredentials</a>   What Are Microcredentials? <p>At their core, microcredentials are forms of recognition that help to validate specific skills, knowledge, or behaviours. Unlike traditional degrees or diplomas, which often encompass years of study, microcredentials tend to be smaller, more modular and flexible. They can stand alone as markers of achievement or be combined to create larger qualifications, making them well-suited to today’s fast-changing education and employment landscapes.</p><p>Microcredentials are underpinned by principles of transparency and portability. Standards such as <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/What_Are_Open_Badges%3F?ref=blog.weareopen.coop">Open Badges</a> ensure that each credential contains verifiable information about the skill achieved, the criteria for earning it, and the issuing organisation. This approach builds trust and enables learners to showcase their achievements across different platforms and contexts.</p> Addressing Common Misconceptions <p>One of the biggest misconceptions about microcredentials is that they are simply short courses. While some microcredentials are tied to short learning experiences, their true value lies in their ability to represent specific knowledge, skills, and behaviours in a way that is transparent and meaningful to employers and other stakeholders. Unlike traditional short courses, microcredentials include detailed evidence of achievement, such as project work or assessments, supported by standards like Open Badges, which ensure interoperability and trust.</p><p>Another misconception is the risk of ‘credential fatigue’ where learners are overwhelmed by the need to collect numerous credentials to prove their skills. Thoughtfully designed systems mitigate this risk by ensuring that microcredentials are stackable and aligned with broader qualification frameworks. This allows learners to build towards larger goals rather than accumulating isolated credentials.</p> Meeting Sector-Specific Needs <p>Microcredentials are well-positioned to tackle diverse challenges across various sectors. To maximise their effectiveness, they must adhere to certain key principles. They should be standards-based, utilising frameworks such as Open Badges or Verifiable Credentials (to be explored in a future post), which ensures their portability and interoperability.</p><p>The metadata included in a microcredential should clearly outline the skills achieved, the criteria met, and the issuing organisation. In addition, they must focus on specific, demonstrable knowledge, skills, and/or behaviours in a way that allows them to be ‘stacked’ towards larger qualifications. These features collectively ensure that microcredentials remain meaningful, portable, and impactful for both learners and organisations.</p><p>The principle of Open Recognition broadens the scope of microcredentials, valuing learning in all its forms — formal, informal, and experiential. By adopting Open Recognition, organisations can ensure that microcredentials are inclusive and accessible, celebrating a wide range of achievements. This approach enables credentials to reflect not only technical skills but also personal growth, community contributions, and soft skills.</p><p>To illustrate their versatility, here are examples of how microcredentials can address sector-specific needs. Microcredentials can:</p>  Charities — Recognise skills gained through volunteer work, fundraising activities, and advocacy campaigns, helping participants showcase their contributions to broader causes.  NGOs — Validate the skills of community workers and volunteers, making their contributions visible and valued.  Co-ops — Highlight informal learning and collaboration, supporting shared growth and innovation.  Businesses — Align organisational values, such as sustainability or diversity, enhancing staff development and retention.  Higher Education — Offer targeted learning opportunities that complement traditional degree programmes, such as industry-specific certifications or co-curricular achievements.  <p>Microcredentials are not simply a way of breaking up an existing course into more granular chunks. Instead, they allow organisations to think deeper and wider about the kind of knowledge, skills, and behaviours they wish to promote. This can be in collaboration with other providers, for example when Higher Education institutions work with businesses to ensure a talent pipeline.</p> Looking Ahead <p>In the next post, we’ll examine the trends shaping the future of microcredentials. From skills-based hiring to stackable learning pathways, we’ll explore how these developments are driving change and creating new opportunities in a range of sectors.</p>

In Ancient Egypt, training systems validated authority and expertise, while over a thousand years ago, China’s imperial examination system was testing candidates. These systems laid the foundation for linking recognised skills to societal roles.</p><p>During the Middle Ages, guilds established structured systems to train and certify artisans. Apprenticeships emphasised hands-on learning and formal recognition, ensuring tradespeople demonstrated their competence before advancing. This model prioritised practical application, reflecting the needs of a skills-driven society.</p><p>The 19th century brought significant changes as industrialisation created demand for standardised education and professional qualifications. Universities and professional bodies formalised credentials, with degrees and certifications becoming essential markers of expertise in fields such as medicine, law, and engineering. These qualifications were designed to meet the need for consistent standards in rapidly expanding industries.</p> Lifelong Learning and the Emergence of Microcredentials <p>The 20th century saw a shift towards ongoing professional development, driven by rapid technological advances and changing workforce demands. Short courses and certifications became more prominent, offering flexible ways for individuals to update their skills. However, these credentials often lacked portability and alignment with broader qualifications, which limited their value.</p><p>Microcredentials build on this history, addressing gaps left by traditional systems. They are designed to be modular, stackable, and skills-focused, making them well-suited to today’s fast-changing educational and employment landscapes. Unlike short courses, microcredentials are typically standards-based, ensuring that they are both portable and meaningful across different contexts.</p> Aligning Microcredentials with Open Recognition <p>The principle of Open Recognition underpins the design of microcredentials, moving beyond formal qualifications to value diverse forms of learning.</p><blockquote>“Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.” (<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">What is Open Recognition, anyway?</a>)</blockquote><p>This approach acknowledges informal, experiential, and community-based achievements, creating opportunities for broader inclusion.</p><p>For example:</p>  Universities — Recognising learning outside the classroom, such as internships or co-curricular activities.  NGOs — Validating the skills of volunteers and community workers through accessible, evidence-based credentials.  Co-ops — Highlighting the informal knowledge gained by members, promoting collaboration and shared expertise.  Charities — Celebrating the contributions of volunteers and staff, offering evidence-based recognition for their skills and efforts.  Businesses — Demonstrating workforce adaptability by using microcredentials to validate and showcase employee skills, supporting professional growth and development.  <p>The evolution of credentialing reflects an ongoing effort to address societal needs. Microcredentials represent the next stage, offering a flexible and inclusive way to recognise skills in diverse contexts. By integrating principles of Open Recognition, they have the potential to transform how learning is valued and applied across all sectors.</p> Looking Ahead <p>In the next post, we’ll help demystify microcredentials by addressing common misconceptions and exploring their potential to meet diverse needs. We’ll provide practical examples of how microcredentials can be implemented effectively in a variety of sectors.</p>

<p>At ISL we pride ourselves on being dispassionate truth-seekers when it comes to assessing risky behaviors in technology. But this moment in history requires expressing our passion for truth and our core values more openly.</p>
<p>What’s currently happening in the US is, by design, disruptive, disorienting, and discouraging for many. The calculated dehumanizing of trans people and immigrants coupled with the TESCREAL eugenics AI agenda elucidated by Timnit Gebru<a>1</a>  foretells a worrying, broader dehumanization campaign ahead. As does the ongoing systematic removal and censorship of any kind of diversity, trans rights or related language on government sites. These actions inexorably lead to the detention and removal of targeted people, which, sadly, has begun.</p>
<p>This moment calls for pausing, ignoring the external chaos and looking within, to our own guiding north stars and speaking out for the values within us that reflect deep truths. Deep truths such as: love and celebration of diversity being vital for both humankind’s and the planet’s survival; it’s certainly vital for the work that we do every day at ISL.</p>
<p>Diversity, equity, and inclusivity are the way. Any other exclusionary, reductive, oppressive, dehumanizing way is antithetical to the truths of human kinship and interdependence and denies the reality that healthy ecosystems need diversity to sustain and thrive.</p>
<p>ISL exposes safety risks inherent in tech when used as intended. In other words, we’ve been establishing reasonable safety standards for the behavior of software-driven products and services. But how can we contemplate “safety” without the necessary question: “for whom?”</p>
<p>Many people think that ISL is solely focused on the safety of tech used by children. It may surprise you to know that that’s not our mission. It’s the brunt of our currently funded work, but our corporate vision is:</p>
<p>“A world where all digital products are safe for humans and humankind.”</p>
<p>In other words, safety for all. </p>
<p>I take this moment to reaffirm ISL’s commitment to prioritizing and fostering conditions to create a truly diverse, inclusive, and equitable organization.</p>

 <p>Recent developments in the UK have once again highlighted the importance of user-controlled encryption for protecting personal data. Due to government demands in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617273/apple-removes-encryption-advanced-data-protection-adp-uk-spying-backdoor?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Apple has recently announced</a> that they have stopped offering end-to-end encrypted iCloud storage, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), to new users, and will disable the feature to all users in the country at an unknown point in the future.</p><p>What does this mean for you?&nbsp;</p><p>In the short term it means that UK user data is less protected, and potentially vulnerable to misuse or breaches. Without end-to-end encryption (E2EE), data stored in iCloud is accessible to Apple and, by extension, potentially to government agencies and bad actors. In the long term it sets a dangerous precedent that Apple can turn off this crucial security feature for any group of users at any time, raising concerns about digital privacy worldwide.</p><p>What can we do about it?</p><p>The answer is relatively simple, we need to encrypt our own data.&nbsp;</p><p>Relying on a third party to keep our personal data safe — even big names like Apple, Amazon, or Microsoft — will always carry risk. Policies change, and external governmental pressures can force providers to weaken security measures, leaving the user exposed.</p><p>By layering End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) on cloud storage services ourselves, we can ensure that our data is protected from unwanted access, even from the storage services themselves (in case they want to mine the content of our data).</p><p>And the best part? We can do it for free by using DIDComm!</p><p>What is DIDComm?</p><p>One powerful and open-source solution for encrypting data before cloud storage is the <a href="https://didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm</a> protocol. Hosted by the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), DIDComm provides a secure, private communication methodology built on Decentralized Identifiers (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDs</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>When used to establish an end-to-end encrypted channel, DIDComm ensures that only essential delivery metadata remains in plaintext, while everything else — including the body, attachments, etc — is encrypted for intended recipients only. In practice, this means that we can use the DIDComm message format to encrypt files as they are prepared to be synchronized from a local folder to the cloud storage service and ensures that only the intended recipient (you) can access them.</p><p>How to use DIDComm for cloud encryption</p><p>Steve McCown, Chief Architect at Anonyome Labs, was the first to create a practical method for encrypting files with DIDComm before storing them into the cloud. His recent <a href="https://github.com/mccown/protecting-cloud-storage?tab=readme-ov-file&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">GitHub release</a> provides a thorough breakdown of how it all works and offers a step-by-step guide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For those looking to dive deeper,&nbsp;</p>  Join one of our upcoming DIDComm <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-usergroup/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">user group calls</a>   Join the discussion on <a href="https://discord.gg/eNN4Wns6Jb?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF’s Discord</a> in the #didcomm-user-group channel

<p>87% of companies have, or are in the midst of, rolling out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/08/15/david-cottingham-rf-ideas-implementing-passkeys/">passkeys</a>&nbsp;with goals tied to improved user experience, enhanced security, and compliance, according to the FIDO Alliance.</p>



 Key findings 



<p>Enterprises understand the value of passkeys for workforce sign-ins. Most decision makers (87%) report deploying passkeys at their companies. Of these, 47% report rolling out a mix of device-bound passkeys (on physical security keys and/or cards) and synced passkeys (synced securely across the user’s devices).</p>



<p>Organizations are prioritizing passkey rollouts to users with access to sensitive data and applications, including the three most commonly cited priority groups: Those requiring access to IP (39%), users with admin accounts (39%), and users at the executive level (34%). Organizations leverage communication, training, and documentation within these deployments to increase adoption.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/06/20/julianna-lamb-stytch-passwordless-authentication-methods/">Passkey deployments</a>&nbsp;are linked to significant security and business benefits. Respondents report moderate to strong positive impacts on user experience (82%), security (90%), help center call reduction (77%), productivity (73%), and digital transformation goals (83%).</p>



<p>Groups that do not have active passkey projects cite complexity (43%), costs (33%), and lack of clarity (29%) about implementation as reasons. This signals a need for increased education for enterprises on rollout strategies to reduce concerns, as there is a correlation between these perceived challenges and the proven benefits of passkeys.</p>

<p>List of recommendations</p>



<p>Recommendation 1: That the government prioritize digital trust in four areas critical to Canada’s leadership and the privacy, security and protection of our people and industries, including:</p>



 
 Digital Trust in Small and Medium Sized Businesses (SMBs) and E-Commerce; 



 Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory; 



 Digital Trust in Public Sector Modernization and Citizen Services; and 



 Digital Trust in Public Safety. 
 



<p>Recommendation 2: That the government recognize the necessity of embracing and prioritizing verification and authentication tools as part of its AI strategy.</p>



<p>Recommendation 3: That the government allocate the funding needed to support the adoption of digital trust tools to the benefit of government, businesses, and citizens alike.</p>



<p>Introduction</p>



<p>In today’s geopolitical and economic climate, Canada needs to urgently act to maximize economic security, growth and productivity — all of which depend on a foundation of trust. In an era where digital transactions drive commerce, investment, and public services, ensuring the authenticity of identities, data, and financial interactions is essential for stability and long-term success.</p>



<p>Without secure and privacy-respecting verification, businesses face higher fraud risks, increased compliance costs, and reduced consumer confidence. Investors and trading partners demand transparent, verifiable transactions and economic resilience, which depend on our ability to safeguard financial systems, facilitate secure trade, and unlock the full potential of AI-driven innovation. Strong verification systems are also key to removing barriers to interprovincial and international trade, ensuring Canadian businesses can compete in global markets with trusted credentials.</p>



<p>Yet, new threats to economic stability are emerging at an unprecedented pace. The spread of misinformation, AI-generated fraud, and identity theft undermines business operations, weakens consumer confidence, and creates vulnerabilities in financial markets. AI enables the rapid manipulation of information and identities, making it more difficult for organizations to verify legitimacy and protect against fraud.</p>



<p>Without urgent action, these challenges will erode trust, slow economic growth, disrupt financial systems, and weaken Canada’s competitive position. Labour mobility is also at risk—without trusted digital credentials, skilled professionals such as doctors, engineers, and tradespeople face delays in moving where needed most, affecting both businesses and public services.</p>



<p>Canada can drive economic security, labour mobility and digital trust by strengthening identity verification, authentication, and fraud prevention measures. By prioritizing trust as a national asset, we can enhance economic competitiveness, attract investment, and build a future where innovation thrives in a secure and resilient digital environment.</p>



<p>About DIACC</p>



<p>The Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) was created following the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review, with a goal to bring together public and private sector partners in developing a safe and secure digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>DIACC is committed to accelerating digital trust adoption and reducing information authenticity uncertainty by certifying services against its Pan-Canadian Trust Framework — a risk mitigation and assurance framework developed collaboratively by public and private sector experts that signals trustworthy design rooted in security, privacy, inclusivity, accessibility, and accountability.</p>



<p>Recommendations</p>



<p>Against this backdrop, DIACC offers three recommendations for the federal government:</p>



<p>Recommendation 1: That the government prioritize digital trust in four areas critical to Canada’s leadership and the privacy, security and protection of our people and industries, including:</p>



 
 Digital Trust in Small and Medium Sized Businesses (SMBs) and E-Commerce; 



 Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory; 



 Digital Trust in Public Sector Modernization and Citizen Services; and 



 Digital Trust in Public Safety.  
 



<p>Digital Trust in Small and Medium Sized Businesses (SMBs) and E-Commerce</p>



<p>Canada’s e-commerce sector is growing faster than ever due to emerging technology and changing customer habits. While this creates significant opportunities, it also presents challenges for small and medium businesses (SMBs), their partners, and customers. With a significant amount of business happening online, SMBs must navigate a growing competitive landscape of online security risks and earn customer trust to help unlock interprovincial and international growth opportunities. By prioritizing digital trust, Canada can foster a robust e-commerce environment that empowers SMBs, enhances consumer confidence, and boosts economic growth. Interoperable frameworks such as the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) foster digital trust by protecting personal electronic information as it travels across an organization, ensuring that e-commerce systems remain secure, adaptable, and trusted.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust and implementing authentication and verification tools, the government can help drive the following benefits:</p>



 
 enhanced customer trust and loyalty; 



 streamlined business processes by automating identity verification and reducing the need for manual checks; 



 faster, more efficient operations and reduced administrative costs, allowing businesses to allocate resources more effectively; 



 data minimization and the secure handling of personal information, increasing customer confidence; 



 a competitive advantage for Canada’s SMBs by helping them innovate and offer their customers new, secure digital services; and 



 a reduction in incidents of fraud, resulting in significant cost savings for businesses. These savings can be reinvested into other business areas, driving growth and innovation and improving overall business performance.  
 



<p>Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory</p>



<p>The finance and regulatory sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation. While the industry pioneers new technology and moves away from conventional platforms, it faces rising fraud, privacy breaches, and growing consumer skepticism fueled by misinformation, disinformation, and challenges verifying information in an AI-driven world. As a result, the government is encouraged to build on the existing regulatory framework and develop new regulations to facilitate secure digital transactions, including compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.</p>



<p>Further, digital trust and verification services will be critical as the government moves forward with its commitments to open-banking, with interoperability also being paramount as the federal framework and existing provincial frameworks work together. Similarly, the government has committed to reducing incidents of mortgage fraud and strengthening proof of borrower and title insurance, and digital trust and verification services can and should play a critical role in making that commitment a reality.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust, Canada can secure its financial systems and enhance competitiveness in the global economy. Interoperable frameworks like the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) ensure systems remain resilient, adaptable, and trusted.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Public Sector Modernization and Citizen Services</p>



<p>Public services are undergoing rapid digital transformation, adopting new technologies to improve efficiency and accessibility. At the same time, they face significant challenges and barriers including data security risks, privacy concerns, and public skepticism fueled by misinformation.</p>



<p>As public services continue to move online, digital trust and verification services will be critical for ensuring that services are secure and accessible. From online healthcare consultations to digital government services, these technologies provide the necessary security infrastructure to protect public interactions and data.</p>



<p>By implementing digital trust solutions, the federal government will be able to provide secure, user-friendly online access to services; streamline identity verification for faster service delivery; facilitate seamless data sharing between agencies; reduce administrative burdens and operational costs; and improve service delivery times and citizen satisfaction.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Public Safety</p>



<p>The public safety sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation, embracing new technologies to enhance emergency response, law enforcement, and disaster management. However, this shift also brings challenges such as data security risks, privacy concerns, and the need for reliable information verification in critical situations.</p>



<p>Implementing robust digital trust solutions can significantly improve emergency response by enabling secure, real-time data sharing between agencies; verifying the authenticity of emergency communications; and facilitating rapid and accurate identification of individuals in crisis situations.</p>



<p>Public safety agencies are encouraged to leverage technologies such as AI and blockchain to enhance their digital trust capabilities and improve emergency response. AI can be used for real-time data analysis and decision-making, while blockchain can ensure the integrity and immutability of critical information.</p>



<p>DIACC encourages collaboration between public safety agencies, technology providers, and other stakeholders to develop standardized digital trust practices, and interoperable frameworks like the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) ensure that public safety systems remain secure, adaptable, and trusted.</p>



<p>Together we can create a public safety ecosystem that leverages digital trust to protect citizens, respects privacy, and solidifies Canada’s position as a secure and effective emergency management leader.</p>



<p>Recommendation 2: That the government recognize the necessity of embracing and prioritizing verification and authentication tools as part of its AI strategy.</p>



<p>In today’s world, where AI is becoming smarter every day, and information can be generated and manipulated at unprecedented speed and scale, ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of information is critical. It is vital to maximize the benefits of an AI and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)-fueled data ecosystem for Canada while also fostering citizen trust and protecting their safety.</p>



<p>To effectively address the challenges we’re facing while realizing the benefits of AI, the federal government should prioritize verification and authentication tools as part of its broader AI strategy. Prioritization must include funding, collaboration, and urgent action to support the development, adoption and certification of tools that verify information authenticity while protecting privacy and empowering Canadians. Governments, banks, telcos, tech companies, media organizations, and civil society must work together to deploy open, standards-based solutions and services to verify the authenticity of information.</p>



<p>The economic imperative of investing in these capabilities is clear. According to a <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/services/consulting/perspectives/generative-ai-in-finance.html">study</a> by Deloitte, the Canadian economy could unlock an additional 7 per cent (CAD $7 trillion) in economic value through AI and AGI technologies. People and organizations can only realize this potential for the good of society by investing in tools, processes, and policies that support verifying the authenticity of the information generated and processed by AI and AGI technologies.</p>



<p>Recommendation 3: That the government allocate the funding needed to support the adoption of digital trust tools to the benefit of government, businesses, and citizens alike.</p>



<p>Today, solutions can signal verified trust by getting certified against a technology-neutral risk and assurance framework like DIACC’s Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, developed collaboratively by public and private sector experts.</p>



<p>Verifiable information authenticity relies on critical principles, including provenance and traceability: provenance establishes the origin and history of information, ensuring it comes from a reliable source, while traceability allows for audibility of the flow of information, enabling people, businesses, and governments to verify its accuracy and authenticity. These principles are essential in combating the spread of misinformation and disinformation, which can have far-reaching consequences in an AI-fueled world.</p>



<p>Provenance and traceability are potent information authenticity tools that can help:</p>



 
 businesses and professionals reduce liabilities and meet obligations to verify information about their clients and their operations; 



 citizens and residents interact securely and efficiently with governments; 



 customers and clients transact with privacy and security anywhere, anytime; 



 industries manage decision-making and securely supply chains using trusted data; 



 producers verify essential data related to environmental, safety, and operational goals and 



 creators track intellectual property to ensure fair payment and cultural protection. 
 



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>A proactive approach—rooted in collaboration between government, industry, and technology leaders—will ensure that Canada remains a trusted hub for global trade, seamless labour mobility, and secure financial transactions. We can unlock new economic opportunities, strengthen international partnerships, and fuel long-term prosperity by enabling frictionless and verifiable trade, business, and employment interactions.</p>



<p>Thank you once again for the opportunity to provide our input in advance of Budget 2025 and as we collectively move forward on the path to a digitally and economically prosperous Canada.</p>

 Current Landscape 



<p>Canada’s e-commerce sector is growing faster than ever due to emerging technology and changing customer habits. While this creates significant opportunities, it also presents challenges for small and medium businesses (SMBs), their partners, and customers. With significant business happening online, SMBs must navigate a growing competitive landscape of online security risks and earn customer trust to help unlock interprovincial and international growth opportunities.</p>



<p>When DIACC was established in 2012, its mission was to create a secure digital ecosystem. Today, this goal has become even more critical for the e-commerce sector, particularly for SMBs striving to scale up and remain competitive in a global market.</p>



<p>Digital trust, which empowers individuals, governments, and businesses with secure and transparent ways to engage online confidently, has become critical for businesses that want to assure customers that their interactions and personal data are secure.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust, Canada can foster a robust e-commerce environment that empowers SMBs, enhances consumer confidence, and boosts economic growth. Interoperable frameworks such as the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™ (PCTF) foster digital trust by protecting personal electronic information as it travels across an organization, ensuring that e-commerce systems remain secure, adaptable, and trusted.</p>



 <a></a>Advancing Digital Trust to Fuel E-Commerce Growth and Empower SMBs 



 1. Strengthening SMB Competitiveness and Growth 



<p>Implementing robust digital trust solutions is crucial for SMBs to compete in e-commerce. By adopting these technologies, SMBs can:</p>



 
 Enhance customer trust and loyalty 



 Reduce fraud-related losses 



 Streamline operations and reduce costs 



 Expand into new markets more confidently 
 



 <a></a>2. Enhancing Trust Through the DIACC PCTF 



<p>DIACC encourages e-commerce businesses to adopt the PCTF as a tool to:</p>



 
 Implement secure and efficient customer onboarding processes 



 Authenticate identities to reduce fraud in online transactions 



 Improve supply chain management through verified digital credentials 
 



 <a></a>3. Fostering Consumer Confidence 



<p>To address consumer skepticism and promote trust in e-commerce platforms, we recommend:</p>



 
 Implementing clear, user-friendly privacy policies 



 Adopting visible trust signals, such as PCTF certification badges 



 Providing transparent data handling practices 
 



 <a></a>4. Enabling Seamless Cross-Border Transactions 



<p>Digital trust frameworks can help SMBs expand into other Canadian provinces and internationally by:</p>



 
 Facilitating secure cross-border identity verification 



 Ensuring compliance with various regional regulations 



 Building trust with customers and partners across Canada and internationally 
 



 <a></a>5. Leveraging Digital Trust for Innovation 



<p>SMBs can use digital trust solutions to:</p>



 
 Implement personalized shopping experiences that are secure and privacy-respecting 



 Develop trusted AI-powered customer service tools 



 Create innovative loyalty programs based on verified identity information 
 



 <a></a>Best Practices and the Way Forward 



 <a></a>1. Adopt Existing and Emerging Technologies 



<p>SMBs should leverage existing and emerging digital trust solutions that align with the PCTF. PCTF certification fosters verified trust across smart devices, digital credentials, wallets, and information-sharing networks. It will enhance their capabilities and ensure their competitiveness.</p>



 <a></a>2. Collaborate for Standardization 



<p>DIACC encourages collaboration between SMBs, larger enterprises, and regulators to establish standardized digital trust practices in e-commerce.</p>



 <a></a>3. Educate and Empower 



<p>DIACC is committed to educating SMBs and consumers about digital trust through:</p>



 
 Hosting sector-specific workshops and certifications to promote best practices in digital trust 



 Real-world case studies demonstrating the benefits of digital trust in e-commerce 



 Advocacy for regulations that support SMBs in implementing digital trust solutions 
 



 <a></a>Conclusion 



<p>The e-commerce sector, particularly SMBs, urgently needs robust digital trust solutions to thrive in the digital economy. By adopting frameworks like the PCTF, SMBs can enhance their competitiveness, build consumer trust, and drive innovation.</p>



<p>Together, we can create an e-commerce ecosystem that empowers SMBs, protects consumers, and solidifies Canada’s position as a leader in the global digital marketplace.</p>

<p>Major technology companies Microsoft, Google, and Apple are driving widespread adoption of passkeys as an alternative to traditional passwords, leveraging biometric authentication methods like facial recognition and fingerprint scanning for enhanced security and user convenience. The initiative builds on the&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/microsoft-announces-shift-from-passwords-to-passkeys-for-enhanced-security/">FIDO Alliance standards</a>&nbsp;that these companies have been developing since 2019.</p>



<p>The initiative, which began with a joint announcement by the three tech giants in 2022, has now reached full implementation across all major platforms. Users can access passkey functionality through their devices’ built-in biometric systems, enabling seamless authentication across various services and applications. Microsoft has recently announced plans to&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/microsoft-to-replace-passwords-with-passkeys-for-1-billion-users-amid-200-surge-in-cyberattacks/">implement passkeys for over one billion users</a>&nbsp;in response to a 200 percent increase in cyberattacks.</p>

 &nbsp;FIDO as the Future of Authentication:&nbsp;Traditional password-based systems are vulnerable to phishing, credential stuffing, and other cyberattacks. FIDO (Fast Identity Online) uses public key cryptography to deliver phishing-resistant, passwordless authentication. 



 Implementation Roadmap:&nbsp;Organizations should assess current authentication methods, educate stakeholders, select FIDO-compatible solutions, and roll out the technology gradually to maximize security and user adoption. 



 Security Meets Usability:&nbsp;FIDO enhances security and simplifies the user experience with biometrics, hardware tokens, and multi-device passkeys, offering both protection and convenience.

<p>Do you think your trusty 8-character password is safe? In the age of AI, that might be wishful thinking. Recent advances in artificial intelligence are giving hackers superpowers to crack and steal account credentials. Researchers have demonstrated that AI can accurately&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/08/ai-could-identify-passwords-by-sound-of-keys-being-pressed-study-suggests">guess passwords just by listening to your keystrokes</a>. By analyzing the sound of typing over Zoom, the system achieved over 90% accuracy in some cases.</p>



<p>And AI-driven password cracking tools can run millions of guess attempts lightning-fast, often defeating weak passwords in minutes. It is no surprise, then, that stolen or weak passwords contribute to about 80% of breaches​.</p>



<p>The old password model has outlived its usefulness. As cyber threats get smarter, it is time for consumers to do the same.</p>
