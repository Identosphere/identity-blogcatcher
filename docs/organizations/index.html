 The DIDAS statement on E-ID technology, submitted to the multi-departemental and cro-functional eID team under the leadership of the Federal Office of Justice, specifically the Federal Police (fedpol), with support from the Federal Office of Information Technology Systems and Telecommunication, outlines the association’s feedback on the proposed E-ID technology stack in Switzerland. The document emphasizes DIDAS’s support for a principle-based, collaborative approach to developing a trust infrastructure for electronic identities. It highlights concerns about the proposed scenarios for E-ID implementation, suggesting that neither fully meets the requirements and advocating for a combined or enhanced approach. The statement also stresses the importance of acting now to lead in establishing basis for a continuously evolving, secure, privacy-preserving E-ID ecosystem, aligning with EU interoperability while considering Swiss-specific needs and capabilities.

<p>At the heart of Elastos’s mission is the belief that true digital freedom comes from the ability to control one’s digital footprint. The current internet landscape, fraught with privacy concerns and centralised control, calls for a disruptive shift towards decentralisation. Elastos envisions a SmartWeb where users control their digital identities and creations, free from intermediaries. This vision is the driving force behind our innovative partnerships and technological advancements, aimed at delivering a more equitable and secure digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>To realise this ambitious vision, Elastos has recently formed strategic partnerships with <a href="https://portalbunny.com">PortalBunny</a> and <a href="https://bookvolts.com/">BookVolt</a>, platforms at the forefront of content creation and publishing. These collaborations are pivotal in deploying decentralised Digital ID (DID) verification and Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems.</p>
 
 PortalBunny serves as a beacon for creators, offering a platform where content can be shared and monetised securely, underpinned by Elastos’s decentralised identity verification. This ensures creators can uphold their rights and control, aligning with the mantra: “Your content, your rules.” 
 BookVolt represents the future of digital publishing, connecting authors and readers through a blockchain framework that rewards engagement and protects intellectual property. By working with <a href="https://docs.ela.city/">Elacity dDRM</a> solutions, BookVolt is setting a new standard for how creative works are shared and compensated. 
 
<p>These partnerships are complemented by Elastos’s commitment to provide ongoing support, from technical expertise to marketing and strategic introductions, ensuring our partners and their users thrive in the SmartWeb.</p>
 A New Paradigm for Digital Interaction 
<p>The tangible outcomes of our mission are evident in the products and services we’re bringing to the forefront of digital innovation. The Web3 <a href="https://kyc-me.io/">KYC-me</a> identity product and <a href="http://ela.city">Elacity</a> dDRM solutions are just the beginning. These technologies are not merely tools; they represent a shift towards a digital realm where ownership, privacy, and control are not just ideals but realities.</p>
<p>Elastos’s vision for a SmartWeb is manifesting through:</p>
 
 Decentralised Identity Verification: Ensuring that users can prove who they are without sacrificing privacy or control. 
 Web3 DRM: Protecting creators’ rights while enabling fair compensation and distribution of digital content. 
 
<p>By redefining how we interact with the digital world, Elastos is setting the stage for a future where the internet truly serves its users, fostering an environment of trust, autonomy, and innovation.</p>
 Join Us on the Journey 
<p>As we continue to build this new digital frontier, we invite you to learn more about Elastos and join us in shaping a future where digital sovereignty is not just a possibility but a reality. Discover how we’re making this vision come to life at <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos.info</a> and connect with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/ElastosInfo">X</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/elastosinfo/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>CSAF Aggregator schema updated</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) TC [1] are pleased to announce the approval and publication of Common Security Advisory Framework Version 2.0 Errata 01.</p>



<p>This document lists the approved errata for the OASIS Standard “Common Security Advisory Framework Version 2.0.” The specific changes are listed in section 1.1, at&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/errata01/os/csaf-v2.0-errata01-os.html#11-description-of-changes">https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/errata01/os/csaf-v2.0-errata01-os.html#11-description-of-changes</a>.</p>



<p>The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) Version 2.0 is the definitive reference for the CSAF language which supports creation, update, and interoperable exchange of security advisories as structured information on products, vulnerabilities and the status of impact and remediation among interested parties.</p>



<p>The OASIS CSAF Technical Committee is chartered to make a major revision to the widely-adopted Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF) specification, originally developed by the Industry Consortium for Advancement of Security on the Internet (ICASI). ICASI has contributed CVRF to the CSAF TC. The revision is being developed under the name Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF). TC deliverables are designed to standardize existing practice in structured machine-readable vulnerability-related advisories and further refine those standards over time.</p>

<p>There has been considerable press, a number of papers, and several formal initiatives concerned with quantum computing’s impact on cryptographic algorithms and protocols. Most standards development organizations are addressing concerns about the impact on the security of the currently deployed cryptographic algorithms and protocols. This paper presents FIDO Alliance initiatives that address the impact of quantum computing on the Alliance’s specifications and how the FIDO Alliance is working to retain the long-term value provided by products and services based on the FIDO Alliance specifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This paper is directed to those who have or are considering FIDO-enabled products and solutions but have concerns about the impact of Quantum Computing on their business. This paper will focus, from a high-level approach, on the FIDO Alliance’s acknowledgment of issues related to Quantum Computing and explain how the FIDO Alliance is taking appropriate steps to provide a seamless transition from the current cryptographic algorithms and protocols to new PQC (or quantum-safe) algorithms in a timely manner.</p>

<p>In history, technological transformations have been pivotal in reshaping human society. An early transformation brought us the power of steam and mechanised production, fundamentally altering our relationship with work and geography. Then, electricity and the assembly line ushered in a new transformation, followed by the digital age, driven by computing and the internet, which redefined global communication and information access. Today, we stand at the threshold of a new technological transformation, characterised by the fusion of technologies blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
 Harnessing New Technology 
<p>This transformation can create a more sustainable, healthy, and fair world by harnessing cutting-edge technologies such as AI, blockchain, and IoT to create systems that are not only smarter and more efficient but also more responsive to human needs. The tangible outcomes include energy systems that optimise consumption and reduce waste, personalised healthcare treatments tailored to individual genetics and lifestyle, and economic models that offer equitable access to resources, where everyone is rewarded fairly. This phase is not just about technological advancement; it’s about leveraging these advancements to fundamentally improve how we interact with our world and each other, leading to a future where progress is measured not just in economic terms, but in the well-being of all humanity.</p>
<p>However, this transformation can only occur fairly if it is powered by new digital tools that offer improved security and online ownership, from user-owned finance to data control, without third-party manipulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
 The Impact of Central Bank Monetary Policies 
<p>Central bank monetary policies traditionally, particularly the expansion of the money supply, have far-reaching environmental implications. Increasing the money supply typically leads to inflation, devaluing the currency and driving investment in physical assets. This trend exacerbates the overuse of finite natural resources and contributes to environmental degradation. To add, easy monetary policies often result in malinvestments – inefficient and unsustainable investments sustained by distorted financial conditions. Such policies can prolong reliance on environmentally detrimental technologies and industries. In contrast, a free market devoid of central bank interference would likely see investments that better reflect true costs and benefits, including environmental impacts. Hence, central bank actions can indirectly foster environmental issues by maintaining outdated, harmful systems longer than a market-driven approach would allow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
 Bitcoin: A Paradigm Shift in Finance 
<p><a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin’s</a> 2009 debut marked a paradigm shift in finance, introducing a decentralised digital currency that enabled secure, direct transactions without central oversight, challenging traditional banking systems and empowering individuals with financial autonomy. Bitcoin, in stark contrast to traditional central banking systems, offers a simplified yet effective monetary model. Its decentralised nature and fixed supply circumvent the common pitfalls of inflation and manipulation associated with central banks. This straightforward approach results in a more stable and predictable financial system.</p>
<p>Grounding Bitcoin’s secure and decentralised framework as the core of the next technological transformation unlocks unparalleled opportunities. It paves the way for innovative financial services and smart applications that are not only grounded in Bitcoin’s robust security but also benefit from its global accessibility and resistance to censorship. Critiques of Bitcoin’s energy use miss its broader impact; it’s not merely consumption but an investment in network security and an incentive for renewable energy innovation.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining’s adaptability allows it to utilise renewable and untapped energy sources, converting what might be waste into valuable resources, supporting this phase’s focus on energy efficiency and sustainability. By its design, Bitcoin not only redefines financial transactions but also promotes a more efficient and innovative approach to energy use, exemplifying a straightforward yet impactful solution within the context of global energy challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
 Bitcoin Inscriptions: A New Digital Paradigm 
<p>The emergence of Bitcoin inscriptions adds another layer to this evolving landscape. Bitcoin inscriptions are like adding notes or images to Bitcoin transactions, turning Bitcoin into a secure digital notebook that does more than just handle money. These inscriptions can’t be changed or erased, making them a reliable way to keep records. This feature can change how we manage digital identities, protect creative works, and share data securely. For instance, artists can mark their digital art as their own, and businesses can track products in a way that can’t be tampered with. This adds to Bitcoin’s safety and openness, paving the way for a future where digital dealings are safer, clearer, and more efficient, playing a big part in the advancements of the modern digital world.</p>
<p>However, Bitcoin’s limitations, particularly in terms of scalability and programmability, have been evident, with its network capable of processing only about seven transactions per second. This bottleneck presented a significant obstacle for Bitcoin to truly power the new economy envisioned in this Technological Transformation. At the heart of this new era is the transformative potential of blockchain technology, epitomised by the <a href="https://elastos.info/blog-and-news/">Bitcoin Elastos Layer 2 (BeL2).</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
 Elastos and it’s Innovation using Bitcoin 
<p>Elastos aims to create a secure new internet by building a decentralised blockchain platform. Elastos extends the functionality of blockchain technology beyond mere financial transactions, enabling the development of decentralised applications (DApps) and fostering a digital ecosystem where users have control over their data and digital assets.</p>
<p>The evolution of Elastos is tied directly to Bitcoin, having been <a href="https://ela.elastos.io/">secured by its miners</a> since 2018. The birthing of the <a href="https://cyberrepublic.org/">Cyber Republic DAO</a> introduced a new decentralised governance framework using Elastos’ Bitcoin-secured currency, ELA, which powers dedicated identity and smart chains, ultimately connecting into BeL2 to deliver us to the concept of Smart Finance, Smart Entertainment, and Smart Assets.</p>
<p><a href="http://bel2.org">Bitcoin Elastos Layer 2 (BeL2)</a>, is a groundbreaking innovation that combines the security and trust of Bitcoin with the flexibility and scalability of the Elastos SmartWeb. BeL2 is a special tool that connects Bitcoin with a new system to make it more useful. Just like how a smartphone can do more than just make calls, BeL2 allows Bitcoin to do more than just store money. It lets people create digital agreements and applications directly with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Elastos can revolutionise how we evolve Bitcoin’s fundamental benefits to engage in more complex and secure financial transactions and agreements, content creation, distribution, access management, and monetisation in all sectors from finance to buildings, robotics, and a vast range of digital assets and intellectual property.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for Part 2 as we dive into these technologies and explore the overarching blockchain architecture of Elastos, and how this system of delivering trust will technologically transform the world around us today.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks we have been immersed in interviews to identify how different groups are strengthening, thinking and re-thinking the information ecosystem in Latin America (read more about the project <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-working-towards-a-healthier-and-more-robust-information-ecosystem-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we talk to journalists, civil society organisations and academics from 13 countries in the region, it has become clear to us that the information ecosystem is complex and composed of several interconnected biomes with internal dynamics, in both analog and digital spaces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many people have told us that not only are these biomes composed of information, content and narratives produced and shared by different actors – at the same time, they are also the places where people are trying to build a sense of meaning, legitimacy and identity. In our conversations, practitioners have often pointed to information disorder as a symptom of a bigger issue. This echoes the notion shared by journalist Jeff Jarvis that the “<a href="https://medium.com/whither-news/journalism-belief-belonging-07a8dabe35e4" title="">crisis in democracy is not just about information</a>“, but rather about a crisis in belonging.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Practitioners we have talked to have suggested that the way out of the current state might lie then, in enraizar (working from the roots); in other words, localising information, and linking it to community contexts – a point also made by journalists Nina Weingrill and Izabela Moi who, since the pandemic, have been looking into the <a href="https://ninaweingrill.medium.com/a-urg%C3%AAncia-de-investir-nos-ecossistemas-locais-de-informa%C3%A7%C3%A3o-41c56341203" title="">urgency of investing in local information ecosystems</a>. </p>



<p>Along these lines, the Nieman Lab, a centre specialised in analysing the role of journalism in society, <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/12/the-rise-of-civic-dialogue-in-newsrooms/">predicts that in 2024</a> newsrooms will start working more closely with grassroots organisations and activists, because beyond the “news industry” the priority will be to rebuild something broader: civic dialogue.</p>



<p>In our mapping we have already found some pioneering examples and we see that this trend has already started to build in Latin America.&nbsp;</p>



 Alternatives to “news fatigue” 



<p>Creating community at uncertain junctures is starting to become a priority for both media and civil society groups. To give an example, LatFem, an Argentine feminist media outlet, helped women come together to develop grassroots communication campaigns in their neighbourhoods during the recent election. They used a mix of “<a href="https://latfem.org/no-digamos-mas-que-los-sectores-populares-se-volvieron-de-derecha/">postering, stencilling, street painting</a>“, along with the creation of moderated conversation groups on Whatsapp, which they used to address doubts about the elections and where they worked to rebuild confidence in the electoral system and encourage women to vote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is also <a href="https://vita-activa.org/">VitaActiva</a>, a support line for journalists, activists and defenders who, as part of their work, have faced digital violence. As its director Nicole Martin told us, if these types of situations are not addressed in time, they end up impacting the overall health, motivation, routines and work of people who are key for the information ecosystem in the region. This is a problem that continues to grow in the region; according to a recent report, <a href="https://latamjournalismreview.org/articles/study-shows-83-percent-of-gender-editors-in-argentina-targeted-by-online-violence/">83% of women editors who write about gender issues are affected</a> by this type of violence.</p>



<p>Some initiatives have made progress in generating a sense of belonging and connecting this to community and place. For example, <a href="https://infoamazonia.org/project/redecidada/">Rede Cidadã InfoAmazônia</a> has been strengthening the connection between community communicators and independent media to amplify and make visible stories of climate resilience.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“The relationship between these organisations and their territories is extremely important for information to circulate. They are the ones who know best the appropriate formats to organise, produce and distribute content,” <a href="https://ninaweingrill.medium.com/a-urg%C3%AAncia-de-investir-nos-ecossistemas-locais-de-informa%C3%A7%C3%A3o-41c56341203">explains Débora Menezes</a>, who was the network’s coordinator.</p>



<p>Another thing that we have identified in our mapping is that in the same country, spaces of information saturation can coexist with so-called “information deserts”. </p>



<p>In the Caribbean, as well as in parts of Latin America, we found that partisan political coverage is everywhere. We were also told that, while “people eat breakfast, lunch and dinner [hearing about] what the president does [in news sources]”, there are very few reporters working on climate change issues. Stories about the climate are also only present in 2% of the news published at the regional level, according to a study by <a href="https://libelula.com.pe/publicaciones/cobertura-del-cambio-climatico-biodiversidad-y-economia-circular-retos-y-soluciones-para-periodistas-y-otros-actores-de-america-latina-y-el-caribe/">Libélula</a> and others. </p>



<p>One interviewee described how there is not enough coverage about&nbsp; coastal erosion in their country, Puerto Rico, including how people are being affected and how the government is working to modulate its impact. It is in many of these contexts that hyperlocal journalism is coming up with answers – for example, <a href="https://laislaoeste.com/">La Isla Oeste</a> in Puerto Rico, <a href="https://mala-yerba.com/">Malayerba</a> in El Salvador and <a href="https://www.laregion.bo/">La Región</a> in Bolivia.</p>



<p>Other projects are betting on listening more attentively and trying new strategies to “get to where the people are”. With this motivation, several <a href="https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/es/reportaje-producido-en-curso-de-periodismo-de-soluciones-contribuye-a-esfuerzos-de-conservacion-en-colombia/">solutions or participatory journalism projects</a> have emerged in the region. Their idea is to overcome “one-way communication” and reach people with stories and information without assuming that “we already know what they need”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://elotropais.org/quienes-somos/#:~:text=El%20Otro%20Pa%C3%ADs%20es%20un,la%20l%C3%ADnea%20del%20periodismo%20de">El Otro País</a> in Paraguay is dedicated to generating community around citizen concerns in the interior of the country, which are very different from those in the capital Asunción. Desirée Esquivel, its founder, convenes Cultural Meriendas, where people sit down, debate and look for collective solutions to local problems, which are then covered by the editorial office. This was the case in the context of the <a href="https://elotropais.org/2023/07/19/pobladores-se-unen-para-exigir-soluciones-ante-el-cierre-de-la-ruta-caacupe-atyra/">abrupt closure of the Caacupé – Candia – Atyrá road</a>, which led thousands of residents to protest because they had to detour two kilometres to cross half a block.</p>



<p>We’ve been seeing efforts to strengthen the “citizen dialogue” by promoting discussion spaces to bring “strangers with strangers”. The idea is to build “common meaning” from the local level. </p>



<p>In Guatemala, <a href="https://i25a.gt/">Instituto 25a</a> does this in the context of the capital with its project <a href="https://i25a.gt/aprendizaje-y-comunidad/">Avenida Comunidad</a>, while <a href="https://www.ojoconmipisto.com/quienes-somos/">Ojo con mi Pisto</a> does it in rural areas. This journalistic medium builds dialogues around how municipal budgets are being invested in rural areas and trains community communicators in how to investigate corruption. </p>



<p>Finally, in Colombia there is Mutante and its project Opuestos Dispuestos, which has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-2z3W6H6CE">generated conversations</a> between the Venezuelan migrant population and their neighbours about the forms of discrimination they are experiencing in accessing housing.</p>



 Dreams of a collective infrastructure&nbsp; 



<p>At the same time, we’ve been hearing a lot about how these new initiatives need more than will, vision and ‘good vibes’ to work. Practitioners from all over the region have been pointing out that it is also necessary to think about how to strengthen infrastructures. There is a long-standing material reality: lack of public investment, appropriation limitations and Internet outages in the region.</p>



<p>On top of that, many have described digital spaces as increasingly fragmented and privatised. As we have heard in recent weeks from several expert voices, platforms are increasingly less transparent and there is less open data for civil society and researchers to investigate disinformation or content recommendation systems that generate polarisation or strengthen stereotypes.</p>



<p>In addition, interviewees have highlighted&nbsp; the structural and long-standing forms of racial, gender and socioeconomic discrimination that affect access to technology and communication channels in the region. </p>



<p>In Bolivia, for instance, there are three official languages in addition to Spanish, but there is limited availability of media or information sources in indigenous languages, even though <a href="https://www.iwgia.org/es/bolivia/5076-mi-2023-bolivia.html">about 40% of the country’s population is of indigenous origin</a>. </p>



<p>In Colombia, the <a href="https://ilexaccionjuridica.org/">organisation Ilex</a> told us that in the case of the Colombian Pacific, legal information, including that related to the consolidation of women’s sexual and reproductive rights, does not reach black populations because the State does not contextualise or distribute it through the channels that these communities consult.</p>



 Join our third community call 



<p>Identifying these gaps, we would like to open a space in our third community call to talk about: What kinds of infrastructures do we need to collectively create a better flow of creation, distribution and reception of information in Latin America?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We especially invite organisations that are working to improve the information ecosystem from the point of view of indigenous and Afro-descendant communities to join the call! We’d love to hear about:&nbsp;</p>



 
 How are you or the communities you’re working with facing these material, funding, connectivity and accessibility limitations in their territories?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 What kind of support do you or the communities you’re working with need in terms of public policies, partnerships, data and technology?&nbsp; (The Engine Room is <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-to-strengthen-the-information-ecosystem-in-latin-america-get-free-tech-and-data-support/">offering tech and data support to organisations</a>). 



 And finally, how can we think about these problems not as ‘individual challenges’, but as collective ones?&nbsp; 
 



<p>We are sure that this conversation will help us to further root the questions we have about information ecosystems in Latin America and to see other ways of building health and re-appropriation in these spaces.</p>



<p>Our community call will take place on March 5, 2024. Interested organisations, journalists and activists are welcome and can register here to join. Note: This event will be held in Spanish.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/roots-and-infrastructure-two-key-ingredients/" title="Read in English">Read in English</a></p>



<p>En las últimas semanas hemos estado sumergidas en entrevistas para identificar cómo diferentes grupos están fortaleciendo, pensando y re-pensando el ecosistema de información en América Latina (<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/nuevo-proyecto-ecosistema-informativo-america-latina-y-caribe/">ver más</a> sobre este proyecto).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Al hablar con periodistas, organizaciones de la sociedad civil y académicos de 13 países de la región, nos ha quedado claro que el ecosistema de la información es complejo y está compuesto por varios biomas interconectados con dinámicas internas, tanto en espacios analógicos como digitales.</p>



<p>Muchas personas nos han dicho que estos biomas no sólo se componen de información, contenidos y narrativas producidos y compartidos por diferentes actores, sino que también son los lugares donde la gente intenta construir un sentido de significado, legitimidad e identidad. En nuestras conversaciones, especialistas han señalado a menudo el desorden informativo como síntoma de un problema mayor. Esto se hace eco de la noción compartida por el periodista Jeff Jarvis de que la “<a href="https://medium.com/whither-news/journalism-belief-belonging-07a8dabe35e4">crisis de la democracia no es sólo información</a>“, sino más bien una crisis de pertenencia”.</p>



<p>Especialistas con quienes hemos hablado han sugerido que la salida a la situación actual podría estar, entonces, en enraizar (trabajar desde la raíz); es decir, localizar y territorializar la información, y vincularla a contextos más comunitarios -algo que también han señalado las periodistas Nina Weingrill e Izabela Moi, quienes, desde la pandemia, han estado analizando “<a href="https://ninaweingrill.medium.com/a-urg%C3%AAncia-de-investir-nos-ecossistemas-locais-de-informa%C3%A7%C3%A3o-41c56341203">la urgencia de invertir en ecosistemas informativos locales</a>”. En esta línea, el Nieman Lab, un centro especializado en analizar el rol del periodismo en la sociedad, <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/12/the-rise-of-civic-dialogue-in-newsrooms/">predice que en el 2024</a> las redacciones periodísticas empezarán a trabajar más estrechamente con organizaciones de base y activistas, pues más allá de la “industria de las noticias” la prioridad estará reconstruir algo más amplio: el diálogo cívico.</p>



<p>En nuestro mapeo ya hemos encontrado algunos ejemplos pioneros y vemos que esta tendencia ha empezado a moverse en América Latina.&nbsp;</p>



 Alternativas frente a la “fatiga noticiosa”&nbsp; 



<p>Crear comunidad en coyunturas de incertidumbre empieza a ser una prioridad tanto para medios como para grupos de la sociedad civil. Para dar un ejemplo, LatFem, un medio feminista argentino acompañó a mujeres a juntarse para desarrollar campañas de comunicación popular en sus barrios en la reciente elección. A través de una mezcla de “<a href="https://latfem.org/no-digamos-mas-que-los-sectores-populares-se-volvieron-de-derecha/">afichadas, stencileadas, pintadas callejeras</a>”, con grupos de conversación, moderados por ellas mismas en Whatsapp, se fueron resolviendo dudas y trabajaron para reconstruir la confianza en el sistema electoral y animar a las mujeres a votar.</p>



<p>También está <a href="https://vita-activa.org/">VitaActiva</a>, una línea de apoyo para periodistas, activistas y defensoras que, como parte de su trabajo, han enfrentado violencia digital. Como nos contó su directora Nicole Martin, si este tipo de situaciones no se abordan a tiempo terminan impactando en la salud integral, la motivación, las rutinas y el trabajo de personas claves para el ecosistema de información en la región. Siendo este una problemática que sigue creciendo en la región, según un informe reciente, <a href="https://latamjournalismreview.org/articles/study-shows-83-percent-of-gender-editors-in-argentina-targeted-by-online-violence/">el 83%</a> de las editoras que escriben sobre temas de género están siendo afectadas por este tipo de violencias.</p>



<p>Algunas iniciativas han avanzado en generar sentidos de pertenencia y conectarlo con la comunidad y el lugar. Por ejemplo, la organización <a href="https://infoamazonia.org/project/redecidada/">Rede Cidadã InfoAmazônia </a>está fortaleciendo la conexión entre comunicadores comunitarios y medios independientes para amplificar y visibilizar historias de resiliencia climática. “La relación entre estas organizaciones y sus territorios es sumamente importante para que la información circule. Ellos son quienes mejor conocen los formatos adecuados para organizar, producir y distribuir contenido”, <a href="https://ninaweingrill.medium.com/a-urg%C3%AAncia-de-investir-nos-ecossistemas-locais-de-informa%C3%A7%C3%A3o-41c56341203">explica Débora Menezes</a>, que fue coordinadora de la red.</p>



<p>Otra cosa que hemos identificado en nuestro mapeo es que en un mismo país conviven espacios de saturación informativa con desiertos de información. En regiones como el Caribe, pero también en otras partes de la región, encontramos que el cubrimiento de política partidista está por todas partes. Nos contaron que allí mientras “se desayuna, se come y se cena, con lo que hace el presidente”, hay muy pocos reporteros trabajando en temas de cambio climático.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Historias acerca del clima sólo están presentes en 2% de las noticias publicadas a nivel regional, según un estudio de <a href="https://libelula.com.pe/publicaciones/cobertura-del-cambio-climatico-biodiversidad-y-economia-circular-retos-y-soluciones-para-periodistas-y-otros-actores-de-america-latina-y-el-caribe/">la Libélula</a> con otros aliados. Por ejemplo, una persona entrevistada describió cómo en su país, Puerto Rico, no hay suficiente cobertura sobre la erosión costera, incluyendo cómo se está viendo afectada la gente y cómo está trabajando el gobierno para modular su impacto. En este tipo de contextos es donde el periodismo hiperlocal está llegando a dar respuestas – como es el caso de<a href="https://laislaoeste.com/"> La Isla Oeste</a> en Puerto Rico, <a href="https://mala-yerba.com/">Malayerba</a> en El Salvador y <a href="https://www.laregion.bo/">La Región</a> en Bolivia.</p>



<p>Otros proyectos les están apostando a escuchar más atentamente y a probar nuevas estrategias para “llegar donde están las personas”. Con esta motivación han surgido varios proyectos de <a href="https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/es/reportaje-producido-en-curso-de-periodismo-de-soluciones-contribuye-a-esfuerzos-de-conservacion-en-colombia/">periodismo de soluciones o de participación </a>&nbsp;en la región. Su idea es superar la “comunicación unidireccional” y llegar con historias e información a la gente sin asumir que “ya sabemos lo que necesitan””.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Por ejemplo, el medio digital <a href="https://elotropais.org/quienes-somos/#:~:text=El%20Otro%20Pa%C3%ADs%20es%20un,la%20l%C3%ADnea%20del%20periodismo%20de">El Otro País</a> en Paraguay se dedica a generar comunidad alrededor de preocupaciones ciudadanas del interior del país, las cuales son muy distintas a las de la capital Asunción. Desirée Esquivel, su fundadora, convoca a Meriendas Culturales. Allí las personas se sientan, debaten y buscan soluciones colectivas a problemáticas locales, que después son cubiertas por esta redacción. Así fue en el contexto del <a href="https://elotropais.org/2023/07/19/pobladores-se-unen-para-exigir-soluciones-ante-el-cierre-de-la-ruta-caacupe-atyra/">cierre abrupto de ruta Caacupé – Candia – Atyrá</a>, que llevó a miles de pobladores a protestar pues tenían que desviarse dos kilómetros para cruzar media cuadra.</p>



<p>Hemos visto esfuerzos para fortalecer el “diálogo ciudadano” con la promoción de espacios de discusión para acercar a “extraños con extraños”. La idea es construir “sentido común” desde lo local. En Guatemala, el <a href="https://i25a.gt/">Instituto 25a</a> lo hace en el contexto de la capital con su <a href="https://i25a.gt/aprendizaje-y-comunidad/">proyecto Avenida Comunidad</a>, mientras <a href="https://www.ojoconmipisto.com/quienes-somos/">Ojo con mi Pisto </a>lo hace en zonas rurales. Este medio periodístico construye diálogos alrededor de cómo se están invirtiendo los presupuestos municipales en zonas rurales y forma comunicadores comunitarios en cómo investigar corrupción. Por último, en Colombia está Mutante y su proyecto Opuestos Dispuestos, que <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-2z3W6H6CE">ha generado conversaciones</a> entre población migrante venezolana y sus vecinos sobre las formas de discriminación que están viviendo para acceder a vivienda.&nbsp;</p>



 El sueño de una infraestructura colectiva&nbsp; 



<p>Al mismo tiempo, hemos oído hablar mucho de cómo todas estas nuevas iniciativas necesitan algo más que voluntad, visión y buena onda para funcionar. Personas expertas de toda la región han señalado que es necesario pensar en cómo fortalecer las infraestructuras. Existe una realidad material que viene de tiempo atrás: falta de inversión pública, limitaciones de apropiación y cortes de Internet en la región.</p>



<p>Encima de eso, muchos han descrito que los espacios digitales están cada vez más fragmentados y privatizados. Como lo oímos estas últimas semanas de varias voces expertas, las plataformas cada vez son menos transparentes y abren menos datos para que sociedad civil e investigadores puedan investigar desinformación o sistemas de recomendación de contenidos que generen polarización o fortalezcan estereotipos.</p>



<p>Además, las personas que hemos entrevistado han destacado las formas estructurales y de vieja data de discriminación racial, de género y socioeconómica que afectan el acceso a la tecnología y los canales de comunicación en la región. En Bolivia, por ejemplo, hay tres idiomas oficiales además del castellano, pero la disponibilidad de medios de comunicación o fuentes de información en lenguas indígenas es limitada, a pesar de que <a href="https://www.iwgia.org/es/bolivia/5076-mi-2023-bolivia.html">cerca del 40% </a>de la población del país es de origen indígena. En Colombia, la organización <a href="https://ilexaccionjuridica.org/">Ilex</a> nos contó que en el caso del pacífico colombiano, la información legal, incluso la vinculada a la consolidación de los derechos sexuales y reproductivos de las mujeres, no llega a poblaciones negras pues el Estado no la contextualiza ni la distribuye por los canales que estas comunidades consultan.</p>



 Únase a nuestra tercera llamada comunitaria: ¿Qué tipo de infraestructuras necesitamos? 



<p>Identificando estos vacíos, nos gustaría abrir un espacio en nuestra tercera llamada comunitaria para hablar sobre: ¿Qué tipo de infraestructura necesitamos para crear colectivamente un mejor flujo de creación, distribución y recepción de información en América Latina?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Para responder a esto, vamos a invitar a organizaciones que están trabajando para mejorar el ecosistema de información desde el punto de vista de comunidades indígenas y afrodescendientes:</p>



 
 Cómo están enfrentando estas limitaciones materiales, de fondos, de conectividad y de accesibilidad en sus territorios&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Qué tipo de apoyo a nivel de políticas públicas, alianzas, datos y tecnología están necesitando (lo que va en línea con la <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/trabajas-para-fortalecer-el-ecosistema-de-la-informacion-en-america-latina-recibe-apoyo-gratuito-en-las-areas-de-tecnologia-y-datos/">oferta de acompañamiento </a>que lanzamos hace unos días desde The Engine Room)? 



 Y, por último, ¿cómo creen que podemos pensar en estos problemas no como ‘desafíos individuales’, sino colectivos? 
 



<p>Estamos seguras que esta conversación nos ayudará a enraizar aún más las preguntas que tenemos sobre ecosistemas de información en América Latina y a ver otras formas de construir dinámicas positivas y re-apropiación en estos espacios.</p>



<p>Nuestra llamada comunitaria tendrá lugar el 5 de marzo de 2024. Organizaciones,&nbsp; periodistas y activistas interesados los esperamos y aquí pueden registrarse para unirse. Nota: Este evento se llevará a cabo en español.</p>

<p>DocBook continues its evolution - over 25 years since origin</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the publication of its newest OASIS Standard, approved by the members on 06 February 2024:</p>



<p>The DocBook Schema Version 5.2<br>OASIS Standard<br>06 February 2024</p>



<p>Overview:</p>



<p>Almost all computer hardware and software developed around the world needs some documentation. For the most part, this documentation has a similar structure and a large core of common idioms. The community benefits from having a standard, open, interchangeable vocabulary in which to write this documentation. DocBook has been, and will continue to be, designed to satisfy this requirement. For more than 25 years, DocBook has provided a structured markup vocabulary for just this purpose. DocBook Version 5.2 continues the evolution of the DocBook XML schema.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

					 Improving the Student Experience by Integrating Student Data and Voice
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Presentation Room: Crawford Hall</p>
<p>The challenge of declining enrollment, along with the coming demographic cliff of 2025-2037, is not news to higher education leaders; and much work has been done across the field to improve student retention and success through programs, engagement strategies, and the use of technology. However, as any CIO or Student Success leader will attest, these systems and strategies can be labor-intensive for the staff supporting them. While it’s important to connect and analyze existing data within your institution’s system, there is a largely untapped opportunity that is waiting to be leveraged – the voice of our students. This engaging discussion will highlight a data-enabled, listening-driven approach to addressing current challenges in higher education and supporting students into the future.</p>

					 Deep Dish Threat Hunting Insights with Palo Alto
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Presentation Room: The Space</p>
<p>Since ransomware attacks are opportunistic in nature, one of the reasons we see particular industries being more heavily impacted is that they often run on systems with out-of-date software that isn’t easily or regularly updated/patched. This is the type of gold mine ransomware operators are looking for – in these cases, they can take advantage of old vulnerabilities to initiate their exploits. This gives the threat actors a rapidly expanding attack surface through which they can deploy their ransomware. The bigger the scale, the bigger the payout.</p>
<p>Ransomware operators often also seek targets in industries where it’s critical for business operations to be able to provide certain products or services in a timely manner. The groups aim to take advantage of the pressure these organizations are under to meet deadlines and produce deliverables, hoping this will lead them to pay quickly and in full.</p>

					 Scaling Student Success Outreach with AI Texting and Data
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Presentation Room: The Space</p>
<p>This interactive presentation will focus on the strategy and structure needed to scale and tailor student support using AI-informed texting based on retention theory. Over the last six years, Ramapo College has developed texting campaigns from enrollment reminders to student success conversations by adding AI texting. In doing so, we further automated student outreach for scale, impact, and efficiency. Ramapo has used three different platforms to send its text messages and works with EdSights for its current retention-based AI-informed texting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During its work with EdSights, Ramapo has seen persistence rates increase across student populations. By using the behavioral science in EdSights framework, Ramapo’s text messages now show students how we care about them, want to help them succeed, and look forward to supporting them until graduation and beyond. As an example, Ramapo’s text messages to first-generation students now ask them to share advice that will help future students. Text messages to all students of payment reminders now inform staff of students who may have housing and food insecurity, allowing for more diligent outreach.</p>
<p>In addition to sharing strategy and examples, Ramapo’s presenters will incorporate participant participation and a worksheet for participants to take ideas back to their own campuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>By Francis Beland, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>I have been writing a lot lately on the power of open standards but never has it been better displayed than in protecting democracy. Let me know what you think…</p>



<p>Open standards can play a critical role in protecting democracy by promoting transparency, interoperability, and accessibility in the digital sphere. Here are a few ways in which open standards can help safeguard democratic values:<br><br>Promoting transparency: Open standards ensure that data and information are openly available and can be accessed and verified by anyone. This helps to prevent the spread of disinformation, propaganda, and fake news, which can undermine democratic processes.</p>



<p>Encouraging interoperability: Open standards ensure that different systems can work together seamlessly, which is crucial for democratic institutions that need to share data and collaborate with each other. Interoperability also promotes competition and innovation, which can help to prevent monopolies and maintain a level playing field for all.</p>



<p>Enhancing accessibility: Open standards can help to ensure that everyone has access to digital tools and services, regardless of their socioeconomic status or location. This can help to empower marginalized communities and ensure that everyone has a voice in the democratic process.</p>



<p>Providing security: Open standards can help to ensure that digital systems and data are secure and resistant to hacking, data breaches, and other forms of cyber attacks. This is crucial for protecting democratic institutions and preventing outside interference in the democratic process.</p>



<p>Overall, open standards can help to promote democratic values by ensuring that digital systems are transparent, interoperable, accessible, and secure. By adopting open standards, democratic institutions can help to build trust with citizens and promote a more inclusive and equitable society.</p>

<p>Two XACML specifications ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the approval and publication of two new Committee Specifications by the members of the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) TC [1]:<br>– XACML v3.0 Related and Nested Entities Profile Version 1.0 Committee Specification 03<br>– XACML v3.0 Separation of Duties Version 1.0 Committee Specification 01</p>



<p>These two Committee Specifications are OASIS deliverables, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>XACML v3.0 Related and Nested Entities Profile Version 1.0<br>Committee Specification 03<br>30 January 2024</p>



<p>Overview:</p>



<p>It is not unusual for access control policy to be dependent on attributes that are not naturally properties of the access subject or resource, but rather are properties of entities that are related to the access subject or resource. This profile defines the means to reference such attributes from within XACML policies for processing by a policy decision point.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

<p>XACML v3.0 Separation of Duties Version 1.0<br>Committee Specification 01<br>30 January 2024</p>



<p>Overview:</p>



<p>This specification defines a method for supporting separation of duties within XACML policies using obligations and allowing the full generality of attribute-based access control. In particular, duties are not required to be associated with subject roles.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

<p>Members of the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) TC [1] approved these two specifications by Special Majority Vote. The specifications had been released for public review as required by the TC Process [2]. The vote to approve as Committee Specifications passed [3], and the documents are now available online in the OASIS Library as referenced above.</p>

 How to run an impactful workshop using our free&nbsp;template <p>Recently, we ran a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Change">Theory of Change</a> workshop for the team at the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">Digital Credentials Consortium</a>, which is hosted by <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>. We’ve found that organisations and projects that are looking to create big impact can benefit from this way of seeing into the&nbsp;future.</p><blockquote>Theory of Change (ToC) is a methodology or a criterion for planning, participation, adaptive management, and evaluation that is used in companies, philanthropy, not-for-profit, international development, research, and government sectors to promote social change. (Wikipedia)</blockquote><p>In this post we’ll outline what this kind of session aims to achieve, share a template which you can re-use, and explain how to make best use of&nbsp;it.</p><p>We’ve become pretty good at running these kinds of workshops for all kinds of clients, large and small, and find them particularly useful in charting a course for collaborative working. Thanks goes to <a href="https://outlandish.com/">Outlandish</a> for introducing this approach to&nbsp;us!</p><a href="https://whimsical.com/theory-of-change-VLrJHYoPmdJF17Xyb4H5ox@7YNFXnKbYzgCBz2QRZSh2">ToC workshop template</a> by <a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license</a><p>Note: around seven people is ideal for this kind of workshop. We run this workshop remotely, but there’s no reason why it couldn’t be done in&nbsp;person.</p> 🥝 At the&nbsp;Core <p>The template has several sections to it, but at the core is the triangle of Final goal, Outcomes, and Activities. You work through these in turn, first defining the goal, moving onto outcomes to support that goal, and then activities which lead to the outcomes.</p>The core of the ToC&nbsp;approach<p>One of the first things to figure out as a team is the timeframe for the work you are doing together. In terms of the final goal, is that to be achieved in six months? a year? 18 months? three&nbsp;years?</p><p>Write that down on the sticky note at the top left-hand corner just to remind everyone.</p> ⛏️ Breaking down the&nbsp;goal <p>The final goal can be difficult to write, so we’ve broken it down into three sections to make it easier for participants:</p><p>Before asking people to contribute ideas, we run through some examples from our own experience. The first row relates to work over around six months, the second over about 18 months, and the third over about three&nbsp;years.</p><p>Next, we use the section to the right hand side where each individual participant can take some time to write down what they think the organisation does (or should) do, to influence their stakeholders, to have the desired impact in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>They can approach these boxes in any order — for example, some people find it easier to go straight to the impact and then work backwards.</p><p>Once everyone has written something in all of the boxes, we go around and ask everyone in turn to explain what they’ve written. This adds some&nbsp;context.</p><p>Then, we go around again, and ask everyone to point to things that other people have written that they definitely agree with. This sets the scene for combining ideas into a collaborative final&nbsp;goal.</p> ✅ Good enough for now, safe enough to&nbsp;try <p>After a quick break, participants are ready to collaborate on a combined final goal. We ask if anyone would like to have a go at filling in one of the boxes. They can do this directly themselves, or we can screenshare and fill it in for&nbsp;them.</p><p>After some discussion and iteration of what’s been written, we move onto the other boxes. It’s worth mentioning that the most important thing here is facilitated discussion, which means timeboxing in a way that doesn’t feel&nbsp;rushed.</p><p>The phrase to bear in mind is “good enough for now, safe enough to try” which is a slightly different way of “perfect is the enemy of&nbsp;good”.</p> 🔍 Identifying the&nbsp;Outcomes <p>Getting the goal agreed on by the team is 80% of the work in this session. In our experience, it’s entirely normal for this to take an entire 90-minute session, or even&nbsp;longer.</p><p>Moving onto the outcomes, these are statements which support the goal. They are change or achievements that need to happen to help it be achieved; they should be written in a way that it’s possible to say “yes that has happened” or “no it has&nbsp;not”.</p><p>For example, “the world is a better place” is not an example of a well-written outcome, but “more people agree that the city is a safer place to live” would&nbsp;work.</p><p>Other examples of decent outcomes from different kinds of work might&nbsp;be:</p>  Local biodiversity is enhanced and pollution is&nbsp;reduced.  Parents demonstrate improved understanding of internet safety and digital citizenship.  Economic diversity within neighbourhoods is increased.  <p>There are several ways we’ve run this part of the workshop, from full-anarchism mode where people just ‘have at it’ through to taking it in turns in an orderly way to add (and then discuss) an&nbsp;outcome.</p> 🚣 Getting to the Activities <p>People new to ToC workshops often conflate Outcomes and Activities. The easiest way to tell the difference is to ask whether it’s something we’re working towards, or whether it’s something we’re&nbsp;doing.</p><p>So, for example, if we take the outcome “Local biodiversity is enhanced and pollution is reduced” some supporting activities might&nbsp;be:</p>  Introduce incentives for creating wildlife-friendly spaces, such as green roofs and community gardens.  Run regular river and park clean-up operations to remove pollutants and&nbsp;litter.  Enforce stricter regulations on industrial emissions and waste management.  Offer subsidies for businesses that implement green practices that reduce pollution and enhance biodiversity.  Promote the use of environmentally friendly pesticides and fertilisers in local farming and gardening.  <p>Again, we’ve run workshops where we’ve just had a free-for-all, others where it’s been more orderly, and then others where teams have gone away and come up with the activities outside the&nbsp;session.</p><p>Some, in fact, have taken the existing activities they’re engaged with and tried mapping those onto the outcomes. It’s an interesting conversation when those activities don’t&nbsp;map!</p> 💡 Final&nbsp;thoughts <p>A ToC workshop is a powerful way to chart a course together. It’s a collaborative endeavour for a small group to spend time on. What’s important is strong facilitation, as without it, participants can spend too much time (or not enough!) sharing their thoughts.</p><p>If you would like to explore WAO running a ToC workshop for your organisation, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">get in touch</a>!

Let us know if we missed anyone. Enjoy! :)</p>  Ceramic's Data Feed API opens for alpha testing<br>The Data Feed API is a set of new Ceramic APIs that enable developers to subscribe to the node's data change feed, allowing them to build Ceramic-powered databases and indexing solutions. A number of ecosystem partners are already in testing as we gear up for an early release before EthDenver!    ComposeDB now supports interfaces<br>Interfaces enable standardized data models for interoperability. By defining essential fields that must be shared across models, interfaces facilitate data integration and querying across different models. This is vital for ensuring data consistency, especially in decentralized systems like verifiable credentials. For a detailed overview, see <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/interfaces-in-ceramic-protocol-an-intro-guide/">Intro to Interfaces</a>.    Get started quickly with <code>create-ceramic-app</code><br>The&nbsp;create-ceramic-app&nbsp;CLI tool simplifies the process of starting with the Ceramic network by allowing you to quickly set up a ComposeDB example app. If you're familiar with create-react-app or create-next-app, you should be right at home. If you want to quickly test a Ceramic app locally on your system, simply run <code>npx @ceramicnetwork/create-ceramic-app</code>. This command will guide you through creating a new Ceramic-powered social app in under a minute.    Collect attendance badges at ETHDenver 2024!<br>Ceramic is partnering with <a href="https://fluence.dev/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Fluence</a>, a decentralized computing marketplace, to put forward a demo that will be in play at each of the events above. You will be able to find us at each event and tap a disc to participate! With each attendance you will claim badges represented as documents on Ceramic. Fluence will be consuming the new Ceramic Data Feed API to enable compute over incoming badges.    Deprecation of IDX, Self.ID, Glaze, DID DataStore, 3ID, TileDocuments, Caip10Link<br>3Box Labs announced the deprecation of a suite of outdated Ceramic development tools including Self.ID, Glaze, DID DataStore, 3ID, 3id-datastore, TileDocuments, and Caip10Link. Due to the improvements in ComposeDB an other Ceramic databases over the last 2 years, these tools saw waning demand, creating significant maintenance overhead while failing to meet our strict UX and security standards.

<p>Real-time data monitoring is revolutionizing maintenance and efficiency in industries such as aviation and automotive through digital twin technology.</p> <p>Richard Donaldson, host of the Supply Chain Next podcast, is a visionary in supply chain management and circular economy advocate. His&nbsp; insights on moving from linear to circular supply chains highlight the potential for substantial environmental benefits and the importance of embracing reuse, especially in the context of his work with startups promoting circularity.</p> <p>The dialogue extends beyond the digital twin to the broader digital transformation of global supply chains, drawing comparisons to the quick adoption of airplane wifi as an example of rapid technological progress. It explores the role of artificial intelligence in supply chain automation and predictive maintenance, touching upon the divide between machine learning and self-actualized thought. The conversation resonates with historical references and Richard's personal entrepreneurial experiences, including his tenure at eBay, his podcast Supply Chain Next, and his perspective on learning from failure. This episode offers a thought-provoking reflection on the future of supply chains and the role of technology in sustainable business practices.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Key takeaways:&nbsp;</p>     <p>The early days of the Internet continue to influence current work in digitizing supply chains.</p>     <p>The global supply chain still lacks full digitization and transparency, particularly in older, established processes.</p>     <p>There is a strong advocacy for shifting towards circular supply chains that are environmentally mindful and focused on sustainability.</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p>Our website - <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with guest:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richarddonaldson/">Richard Donaldson on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by Hany Farid, UC Berkeley Professor, CAI Advisor</p><p>A monthly take on news and trends shaping our understanding of generative AI technology and its applications.</p><p>Advances in generative AI continue to stun and amaze. It seems like every month we see rapid progression in the power and realism of AI-generated images, audio, and video. At the same time, it also seems like we are also seeing rapid advances in how the resulting content is being weaponized against individuals, societies, and democracies. In this post, I will discuss trends that have emerged in the new year.</p><p>First it was Instagram ads of Tom Hanks promoting dental plans. Then it was TV personality Gayle King hawking a sketchy weight-loss plan. Next, Elon Musk was shilling for the latest crypto scam, and, most recently, Taylor Swift was announcing a giveaway of Le Creuset cookware. All ads, of course, were fake.&nbsp;</p><p>How it works</p><p>Each of these financial scams was powered by a so-called lip-sync deepfake, itself powered by two separate technologies. First, a celebrity's voice is cloned from authentic recordings. Where it used to take hours of audio to convincingly clone a person's voice, today it takes only 60 to 90 seconds of authentic recording. Once the voice is cloned, an audio file is generated from a simple text prompt in a process called text-to-speech.&nbsp;</p><p>In a variant of this voice cloning, a scammer creates a fake audio file by modifying an existing audio file to sound like someone else. This process is called speech-to-speech. This latter fake is a bit more convincing because with a human voice driving the fake, intonation and cadence tend to be more realistic.</p><p>Once the voice has been created, an original video is modified to make the celebrity’s mouth region move consistently with the new audio. Tools for both the voice cloning and video generation are now readily available online for free or for a nominal cost.</p><p>Although the resulting fakes are not (yet) perfect, they are reasonably convincing, particularly when being viewed on a small mobile screen. The genius — if you can call it that — of these types of fakes is that they can fail 99% of the time and still be highly lucrative for scam artists. More than any other nefarious use of generative AI, it is these types of frauds and scams that seem to have gained the most traction over the past few months.&nbsp;</p><p>Protecting consumers from AI-powered scams</p><p>These scams have not escaped the attention of the US government. In March of last year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2023/03/scammers-use-ai-enhance-their-family-emergency-schemes">warned</a> citizens about AI-enhanced scams. And more recently, the FTC announced a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/contests/ftc-voice-cloning-challenge">voice cloning challenge</a> designed to encourage "the development of multidisciplinary approaches — from products to policies to procedures — aimed at protecting consumers from AI-enabled voice cloning harms, such as fraud and the broader misuse of biometric data and creative content. The goal of the challenge is to foster breakthrough ideas on preventing, monitoring, and evaluating malicious voice cloning."</p><p>The US Congress is paying attention, too. A bipartisan bill, <a href="https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-coons-blackburn-klobuchar-tillis-announce-draft-of-bill-to-protect-voice-and-likeness-of-actors-singers-performers-and-individuals-from-ai-generated-replicas">the NO FAKES Act</a>, would "prevent a person from producing or distributing an unauthorized AI-generated replica of an individual to perform in an audiovisual or sound recording without the consent of the individual being replicated."&nbsp;</p><p>Acknowledging that there may be legitimate uses of AI-powered impersonations, the Act has carve-outs for protected speech: "Exclusions are provided for the representation of an individual in works that are protected by the First Amendment, such as sports broadcasts, documentaries, biographical works, or for purposes of comment, criticism, or parody, among others." While the NO FAKES Act focuses on consent, Adobe’s proposed Federal Anti-Impersonation Right (the FAIR Act) provides a new mechanism for artists to <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/09/12/fair-act-to-protect-artists-in-age-of-ai">protect their livelihoods</a> while also protecting the evolution of creative style.</p><p>Looking ahead</p><p>Voice scams will come in many forms, from celebrity-powered scams on social media to highly personalized scams on your phone. The conventional wisdom of "If it seems too good to be true, it probably is" will go a long way toward protecting you online. In addition, for now at least, the videos often have telltale signs of AI-generation because there are typically several places where the audio and video appear de-synchronized, like a badly dubbed movie. Recognizing these flaws just requires slowing down and being a little more thoughtful before clicking, sharing, and liking.</p><p>Efforts are underway to add digital provenance or verifiable Content Credentials to audio. Respeecher, a voice-cloning marketplace gaining traction among creators and Hollywood studios, <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/community-story-respeecher">is adding Content Credentials</a> to files generated with its tool.</p><p>For the more personalized attacks that will reach you on your phone in the form of a loved one saying they are in trouble and in need of cash, you and your family should agree on an easy-to-remember secret code word that can easily distinguish an authentic call from a scam.</p>

<p><a href="https://charmverse.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">CharmVerse</a>, a pioneering web3 community engagement and onboarding platform, recently integrated ComposeDB on Ceramic to store user attestations for grants and rewards. CharmVerse’s decision to build on Ceramic was driven by the need to store credentials in a user-owned, decentralized manner, without relying on traditional databases.</p><p>A who’s who of well-known web3 projects leverage CharmVerse to help manage their community and grants programs. Optimism, Game7, Mantle, Safe, Green Pill, Purple DAO, Orange DAO, Taiko (and the list goes on) have all experienced the need for a unique, web3-centric platform to interact with and empower their ecosystems.</p> What Objectives Does the Integration Address? <p>The work of vetting developer teams and distributing grants demands a significant investment of time and focus to ensure responsible treasury deployment. This need-driven use case is a wonderful fit for Ceramic’s capabilities.</p><p>CharmVerse identified an opportunity to enhance grants/community managers’ capabilities by implementing a credentialing and rewards system that supports user-sovereign data. This system allows grants managers to better understand their applicants, scale the number of teams they can work with, and issue attestations representing skills and participation in grants and other community programs, creating a verifiable record of participation. However, this solution came with technical challenges in maintaining user data privacy and ownership while ensuring decentralization as this data represents significant insight into the historical activity and capabilities of individuals and teams.</p> Why did CharmVerse Choose Ceramic? <p>CharmVerse considered various options but ultimately chose Ceramic due to its unique capability to support decentralized credentials and store attestations in a way that aligned with CharmVerse's vision. Alex Poon, CEO &amp; co-founder of CharmVerse, shared:</p><p>“Ceramic's unique approach to data decentralization has been a game changer for us, allowing us to truly empower our users while respecting their privacy, allowing users the choice to keep their data private or publish it on-chain. This integration aligns perfectly with CharmVerse's success metrics, centering on community empowerment and data sovereignty.”</p> How did CharmVerse Integrate Ceramic? <p>CharmVerse's integration utilizes Ceramic's ability to store user attestations and leverages Ceramic’s work with the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) as the underlying model for supporting decentralized credentials. The integration was not only a technical milestone for CharmVerse but also achieved the strategic goal of appealing to an audience concerned with data privacy and ownership.</p><p>More specifically, CharmVerse issues off-chain signed attestations in recognition of important grant program milestones (designed to award these credentials both when users create proposals, and when their grants are accepted). Given Ceramic’s open-access design, we expect to see other teams utilize these credentials issued by CharmVerse as a strong indication of applicant reputation, track record, and ability to deliver.</p> How to See CharmVerse in Action <p>This collaboration illustrates the power of innovative solutions in advancing blockchain usability, value, and adoption while maintaining the values of the early cypherpunk vision of decentralization.

<p>What’s the state of identity and authentication in 2024?</p>



<p>That was the primary topic addressed in a day full of insightful speaker sessions and panels at the annual <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/event/identity-authentication-the-road-ahead/">Identity, Authentication and the Road Ahead Policy Forum</a> held on January 25 in Washington D.C. The event was sponsored by the <a href="https://www.betteridentity.org/">Better Identity Coalition</a>, the FIDO Alliance, and the<a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/"> ID Theft Resource Center</a> (ITRC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Topics covered included the latest data on identity theft, financial crimes involving compromised identities and the overall ongoing challenges of identity and authentication. The opportunities for phishing-resistant authentication standards and passkeys resonated throughout the event as well. In his opening remarks, Jeremy Grant of the Better Identity Coalition framed identity as both a cause and potential solution to security problems.&nbsp;</p>







 White House advances strong authentication agenda 



<p>In the opening keynote, Caitlin Clarke,&nbsp; Senior Director, White House National Security Council, detailed some of the steps the Biden-Harris administration is taking to improve digital identity and combat rising cybercrime.</p>







<p>“Money is fuelling the ecosystem of crime, but we often see that identity is either the target or the culprit of the cyber incidents that we are seeing every day,” Clarke said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a bid to help improve the state of identity and authentication, the administration is implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all federal government systems. Clarke also highlighted that the administration strongly believes in implementing phishing-resistant MFA.</p>



<p>“We need to make it harder for threat actors to gain access into systems by requiring and ensuring that a person is who they say they are beyond the username and password,” she said. “That is why authentication is also at the heart of the work we are doing to improve the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, upon which we all rely.”</p>



 The role of biometrics 



<p>Biometrics have a role to play in the authentication and identity landscape according to a panel of experts. </p>







<p>The panel included Arun Vemury, Biometrics Expert and ITRC Advisory Board Member; James Lee, COO of the Identity Theft Resource Center; Dr. Stephanie Schuckers, Director, Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR), Clarkson University; and John Breyault VP, Public Policy, Telecom and Fraud, at National Consumers League.</p>



<p>Panelists generally agreed that properly implemented biometrics combined with other security practices could help devalue stolen identity data and strengthen security overall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Biometrics has the potential to affect fraud numbers,” Breyault said. “It’s not a silver bullet, it’s not going to stop everyone and, it may not be useful in every context, but it is something different than what we’re doing now.”</p>



 Better Identity at 5 years 



<p>Five years ago, the Better Identity Coalition published Better Identity in America: A Blueprint for Policymakers in response to significant questions from both government and industry about the future of how the United States should address challenges in remote identity proofing and other key issues impacting identity and authentication.</p>







<p>Jeremy Grant, Coordinator at the Better Identity Coalition, detailed the progress made in the past five years and also<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a7b7a8490bade8a77c07789/t/65b00995dd1af8633cbce40c/1706035608068/Better_Identity_Coalition24.pdf"> detailed new guidance</a> for 2024.</p>



<p>The report assessed that while some progress has been made in certain areas like promoting strong authentication, overall the government receives poor grades for failing to prioritize the development of modern remote identity proofing systems or establish a national digital identity strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The revised blueprint outlines 21 new recommendations and action items for policymakers to help close gaps in America’s digital identity infrastructure and get ahead of growing security and privacy challenges posed by issues like synthetic identity fraud and deep fakes.</p>



<p>“Our message today is the same as it was back in 2018, which is that if you take this as a package, if this policy blueprint is enacted and funded by government, it’s going to address some very critical challenges in digital identity and as the name of our coalition would suggest, make things better,” Grant said.</p>



 The year of passkeys 



<p>While there is much to lament about the state of identity and authentication, there is also cause for optimism too.</p>



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance detailed the progress that has been made in the past year with the rollout and adoption of passkey deployments.</p>







<p>“Passkeys are simpler, stronger authentication, they are a password replacement,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar noted that there are now hundreds of companies enabling consumers to use passkeys, which is helping to dramatically improve the overall authentication landscape. Not only is a passkey more secure, he also emphasized that it’s easier for organizations to use, than traditional passwords and MFA approaches.</p>



<p>“If you’re in the business of selling things, or providing content, or anything like that you want people to get on your site as quickly as possible –&nbsp; passkeys are doing that,” he said.</p>



<p>Shikiar noted that the FIDO Alliance understands that user authentication is just one piece of the identity value chain. To that end the FIDO Alliance has multiple efforts beyond passkeys, including certification programs for biometrics and document authenticity certification programs among other efforts.</p>



 Don’t want to get breached? Use strong, phishing-resistant authentication 



<p>The primary importance of strong authentication was highlighted by Chris DeRusha, Federal Chief Information Security Officer in the&nbsp; Office of Management and Budget (OMB), who detailed a recent report on a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapsus$"> Lapsus cybersecurity gang</a> that was released by the Cyber Safety Review Board.&nbsp;</p>







<p>DeRusha noted that Lapsus hackers were able to beat MFA prompts using a variety of techniques, including social engineering and even just mass spamming employees with prompts to get someone to act.</p>



<p>A key recommendation from the report is to move away from phishable forms of MFA, including SMS and instead embrace FIDO based authentication with passkeys.</p>



 The view from FinCEN 



<p>The U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, more commonly known by the acronym FinCEN, is a critical element of the U.S financial system.</p>



<p>FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki spoke at the event about the agency’s recent progress on beneficial ownership reporting and the FinCEN Identity Project. The FinCEN Identity Project refers to FinCEN’s ongoing work related to analyzing how criminals exploit identity-related processes to perpetuate financial crimes. As part of this, FinCEN published a financial trends analysis earlier this month that looked at 2021 Bank Secrecy Act data to quantify how bad actors take advantage of identity processes during account openings, access, and transactions.</p>







<p>“Robust customer identity processes are the foundation of a secure and trusted U.S. financial system and are fundamental to the effectiveness of every financial institution,” Gacki said.</p>



<p>Sean Evans, lead cyber analyst at FinCEN noted that the recent report examined over 3.8 million suspicious activity reports filed in 2021 and found that approximately 1.6 million reports, representing $212 billion in activity, involved some form of identity exploitation.. Evans explained that cybercriminals are finding ways to circumvent or exploit weaknesses in identity validation, verification, and authentication processes to conduct illicit activities like fraud.</p>



<p>Kay Turner, chief digital identity adviser at FinCEN, emphasized that strengthening identity verification is critical for security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have to get identity right, it is vital to building trust in the system,” Turner stated.</p>



 CISA praises the push towards passkeys 



<p>Closing out the event was a keynote from Eric Goldstein, Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, (CISA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p>







<p>Goldstein emphasized that it’s important to note that while there are challenges, there has also been progress. Passkeys are now used by consumers everyday and increasing numbers of enterprises are moving toward passwordless deployments.</p>



<p>“It’s worth starting out just with some reflection on how far we have come in moving towards a passwordless future,” Goldstein said.”We are seeing more and more enterprises moving to passwordless for their enterprise privileges, their admin, their their employee authentication solutions and that’s a remarkable shift.”</p>

<p><a href="https://walletconnect.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect</a> offers Web3 developers powerful tools to make building secure, interactive, and delightful decentralized applications easier. This tooling incorporates best-in-class UX and UI with a modular approach to a suite of SDKs and APIs. For many teams looking to accelerate their development cadence without sacrificing security or quality, WalletConnect's various SDKs are an obvious choice.</p><p>One of our favorites is <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/web3modal/about?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web3Modal</a> - a toolset that provides an intuitive interface for dApps to authenticate users and request actions such as signing transactions. Web3Modal supports multiple browser wallets (such as MetaMask and Trust Wallet) and offers thorough instruction in their documentation to help developers get up and running across multiple frameworks (React, Next, Vue, etc). For this tutorial, we will show how to use WalletConnect's Web3Modal for user authentication and the creation of user sessions.</p><p>Ready? Awesome! Let's get started</p> What Will We Build? <p>For this tutorial, we will build an application to track event attendance. The use case here is somewhat basic - imagine a conference that wants to keep track of which participants went to which event. They might allow participants to scan a QR code that takes them to this application where they can sign in (with their wallet), optionally opt into sharing their location, and generate a badge showing that they attended.</p><p>Here's a simple visual of the user flow:</p><p>Based on the summary above, it might be obvious where Web3Modal fits in. That's right - we will be using this SDK to authenticate users and keep track of who attended what event based on their wallet address.</p><p>We've made up two imaginary events to align with this use case:</p>  Encryption Event  Wallet Event  <p>Below is a sneak peek at our app's UI:</p> What's Included in Our Technical Stack? <p>To power this simple application, we will need a few things:</p>  A frontend framework that runs in the attendee's browser and a backend to handle any internal API calls we'll need - we will use NextJS   Wallet tooling so we don't have to build authentication logic from scratch - Web3Modal  React hooks that work with our browser wallet so we don't have to build these either - we'll use <a href="https://wagmi.sh/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Wagmi</a>  Decentralized data storage - we'll use <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB</a> (graph database built on <a href="https://ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>)   Why ComposeDB? <p>If dealing with potentially thousands (or more) attendees to these imaginary events (as is often the case with large conferences), storing these records on-chain would be both costly and inefficient. Each record would incur gas fees, and querying the blockchain across tens of thousands of records would be arduous.</p><p>Nonetheless, we want our application to give data control to the users who attend the events. And, in our imaginary use case, other conferences must have access to this data (not just our application) so they can determine who should receive admission priority. We will therefore require some sort of decentralized data network. </p><p>In Ceramic (which is what ComposeDB is built on), user data is organized into verifiable <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/streams/event-log?ref=blog.ceramic.network">event streams</a> that are controlled exclusively by the user account that created each stream. Since Ceramic is a permissionless open data network, any application can easily join and access preexisting user data (which meets one of the requirements listed above). </p><p>Applications that build on Ceramic/ComposeDB <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-client/user-sessions?ref=blog.ceramic.network">authenticate users</a> (using sign-in with Ethereum), creating tightly-scoped permission for the application to write data to the network on the user's behalf. This is important for us because our application's server will need to cryptographically sign the badge (to prove the badge was indeed generated through our application) before saving the output in Ceramic on the user's behalf.</p><p>Finally, ComposeDB adds a graph database interface on top of Ceramic, making it easy to query, filter, order, and more (using GraphQL) across high document volumes - an ideal fit for any teams who want to consume these badges and perform computation over them in an efficient manner.</p><p>We will go into more detail throughout this tutorial.</p> Getting Started <p>We have set up a special repository for you to help guide you through - keep in mind that we will need to add to it using the below steps for it to work.</p><p>Start by cloning the demo application repository and install your dependencies:</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/walletconnect-tutorial
cd walletconnect-tutorial
npm install</code> <p>Go ahead and open the directory in your code editor of choice. If you take a look at your package.json file, you'll see our<code>@web3modal/wagmi</code> and <code>wagmi</code> packages mentioned above, as well as several <code>@ceramicnetwork</code> and <code>@composedb</code> packages to meet our storage needs.</p> Obtain a WalletConnect Project ID <p>While your dependencies are downloading, you can create a WalletConnect project ID (which we'll need to configure our Web3Modal - more information on <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/web3modal/nextjs/about?ref=blog.ceramic.network">their docs</a>). You can do so for free by visiting their <a href="https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect Cloud</a> site, creating a new project (with the "App" type selected), and a name of your choosing:</p><p>After you click "Create" you will be directed to the settings page for the project you just set up. Go ahead and copy the alphanumeric value you see next to "Project ID."</p><p>Back in your text editor, navigate to your <code>/src/pages/_app.tsx</code> file and enter the ID you just copied into the blank field next to the <code>projectId</code> constant. Notice how we use this ID and a mainnet chain setting when defining our <code>wagmiConfig</code> (later used to create our Web3Modal). Just as the <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/web3modal/nextjs/about?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web3Modal docs</a> instructed, we are setting up these functions outside our React components, and wrapping all child components with our <code>WagmiConfig</code> wrapper:</p> <code>const projectId = '&lt;your project ID&gt;'

const chains = [mainnet]
const wagmiConfig = defaultWagmiConfig({ chains, projectId })

createWeb3Modal({ wagmiConfig, projectId, chains })


const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;WagmiConfig config={wagmiConfig}&gt;
    &lt;ComposeDB&gt;
      &lt;Component {...pageProps} ceramic /&gt;
      &lt;/ComposeDB&gt;
    &lt;/WagmiConfig&gt;
  );
}

export default MyApp</code> <p>We can now make our Web3Modal button accessible to child components of our application to allow our users to sign in. If you take a look at <code>/src/components/nav.tsx</code>, you'll see that we placed our <code>&lt;w3m-button /&gt;</code> component directly into our navigation to allow users to sign in/out on any page of our application (at the moment our application only has 1 page). </p><p>Notice how we make use of the <code>size</code> and <code>balance</code> properties - these are two of several settings developers can use to further customize the modal's appearance. These two in particular are fairly simple to understand - one alters the size of the button, while the other hides the user's balance when the user is authenticated.</p><p>Finally, you probably noticed in your <code>/src/pages/_app.tsx</code> file that we're also utilizing a <code>&lt;ComposeDB&gt;</code> context wrapper. This is what we will explain next.</p> Create a ComposeDB Configuration <p>Now that we've created our Wagmi configuration, we will need to set up our ComposeDB data storage. There are several steps involved (all of which have been taken care of for you). These include:</p>  Designing the data models our application will need  Creating a local node/server configuration for this demo (in production)  Deploying our data models onto our node  Defining the logic our application will use to read from + write to our ComposeDB node  <p>Data Models</p><p>If you take a look at your <code>/composites</code> folder, you'll see an <code>/attendance.graphql</code> file where we've already defined the models our application will use. In ComposeDB, <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling?ref=blog.ceramic.network">data models</a> are GraphQL schema that contain the requirements for a single piece of data (a social post, for example), in addition to its relations to other models and accounts. Since Ceramic is an open data network, developers can build on preexisting data models (you can explore tools like <a href="https://scan.s3.xyz/models?network=MAINNET&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">S3</a> to observe existing schema), or define brand new ones for your app.</p><p>In our case, our application will leverage a general event interface that our two event types will implement:</p> <code>interface GeneralAttendance
  @createModel(description: "An interface to query general attendance") {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: String! @string(minLength: 42, maxLength: 42)
  latitude: Float
  longitude: Float
  timestamp: DateTime!
  jwt: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
}

type EncryptionEvent implements GeneralAttendance
  @createModel(accountRelation: SINGLE, description: "An encryption event attendance") {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: String! @string(minLength: 42, maxLength: 42)
  latitude: Float
  longitude: Float
  timestamp: DateTime!
  jwt: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
}

type WalletEvent implements GeneralAttendance
  @createModel(accountRelation: SINGLE, description: "A wallet event attendance") {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: String! @string(minLength: 42, maxLength: 42)
  latitude: Float
  longitude: Float
  timestamp: DateTime!
  jwt: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
}</code> <p>Notice how we've set the <code>accountRelation</code> field for both types to "SINGLE" - what this means is that 1 user can only ever have 1 model instance of that type, thus creating a 1:1 account relationship. This is contrasted with "LIST" <code>accountRelation</code> which would indicate a 1:many relationship.</p><p>You'll also notice that our <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> fields do not use a <code>!</code> next to their scalar definition - what this means is that they are optional, so a model instance can be created with or without these fields defined.</p><p>Finally, we will use our <code>jwt</code> field to record the signed badge payload our server will create for the user. Since the user will ultimately be in control of their data, a potentially deceptive could try to change the values of their model instance outside the confines of our application. Seeing as our architecture requires a way for both our application and other conferences to read and verify this data, the <code>jwt</code> field will create tamper-evident proof against the values by tying the cryptographic signature of our application's DID together with the data.</p><p>Create a Local Server Configuration</p><p>Seeing as this is just a demo application and we don't have a cloud-hosted node endpoint to access, we will define a <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-server?ref=blog.ceramic.network">server configuration</a> to run locally on our computer. While there are multiple <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-server/server-configurations?ref=blog.ceramic.network">server settings</a> an application can leverage, the key items to know for this demo are the following:</p>  Our app will run <code>inmemory</code> whereas a production application will use <code>mainnet</code> for their network setting  Our server will define <code>sqlite</code> as our SQL index, whereas a production application would use <code>PostgreSQL</code>  Our IPFS will run in <code>bundled</code> mode (ideal for early prototyping), whereas a production application will run in <code>remote</code>  <p>Finally, each Ceramic node is configured with an admin DID used to authenticate with the node and perform tasks like deploying models. This is different from the DIDs end users will use when authenticating themselves using their wallet and writing data to the network.</p><p>Fortunately for you, we've taken care of this for you by creating a command. Simply run the following in your terminal once your dependencies are installed:</p> <code>npm run generate</code> <p>If you take a look at your <code>admin_seed.txt</code> file you will see the admin seed your Ceramic node will use. Your <code>composedb.config.json</code> file is where you'll find the server configuration you just created.</p><p>Deploying the Models onto Our Node</p><p>Seeing as we're not using a preexisting node endpoint that's already set up to index the data models we care about, we'll need a way to deploy our definitions onto our node. If you look at <code>/scripts/composites.mjs</code> you'll find a <code>writeComposite</code> method we've created for you that reads from our GraphQL file, creates an encoded runtime definition and deploys the composite onto our local node running on port 7007.</p><p>The important thing to take note of here is how the <code>writeEncodedCompositeRuntime</code> method generates a definition in our definition.js file. We will explain in the next step how this is used by our client-side library to allow our application to interact with these data models and our Ceramic node.</p><p>Don't take any action yet - we will explain how to use this script in the coming steps.</p><p>Integrating ComposeDB with Our Application</p><p>Finally, as mentioned above, we will need a way for our application to read from and write to our ComposeDB node. We will also need a way to combine our Web3Modal authentication logic with the need to authenticate users onto our node.</p><p>If you take a look at <code>/src/fragments/index.tsx</code> you'll find a <code>ComposeDB</code> component that allows us to utilize React's <code>createContext</code> hook and create a wrapper of our own. Since we know Web3Modal will make use of our wallet client, we can leverage the wallet client to request a Ceramic user session authentication from our user.</p><p>Observe the following:</p> <code>const CERAMIC_URL = process.env.URL ?? "http://localhost:7007";

/**
 * Configure ceramic Client &amp; create context.
 */
const ceramic = new CeramicClient(CERAMIC_URL);

const compose = new ComposeClient({
  ceramic,
  definition: definition as RuntimeCompositeDefinition,
});

let isAuthenticated = false;

const Context = createContext({ compose, isAuthenticated });

export const ComposeDB = ({ children }: ComposeDBProps) =&gt; {
  function StartAuth() {
    const { data: walletClient } = useWalletClient();
    const [isAuth, setAuth] = useState(false);

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
      async function authenticate(
        walletClient: GetWalletClientResult | undefined,
      ) {
        if (walletClient) {
          const accountId = await getAccountId(
            walletClient,
            walletClient.account.address,
          );
          const authMethod = await EthereumWebAuth.getAuthMethod(
            walletClient,
            accountId,
          );
          const session = await DIDSession.get(accountId, authMethod, {
            resources: compose.resources,
          });

          await ceramic.setDID(session.did as unknown as DID);
          console.log("Auth'd:", session.did.parent);
          localStorage.setItem("did", session.did.parent);
          setAuth(true);
        }
      }
      void authenticate(walletClient);
    }, [walletClient]);

    return isAuth;
  }

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    isAuthenticated = StartAuth();
  }

  return (
    &lt;Context.Provider value={{ compose, isAuthenticated }}&gt;
      {children}
    &lt;/Context.Provider&gt;
  );
};</code> <p>Notice how we're using the wallet client's account address to initiate a DID session that asks for specific resources from <code>compose</code>. If you track deeper, you'll see that <code>compose</code> was instantiated using the <code>definition</code> imported from the file our deployment script wrote into. This allows us to access a limited scope to write data on the user's behalf specifically for the data models our application uses (these sessions auto-expire after 24 hours).</p><p>Finally, to bring this full circle, back to our <code>/src/pages/_app.tsx</code> file, you should now understand how we're able to use <code>ComposeDB</code> as a contextual wrapper, enabling us to access both the ComposeDB client libraries and our model definitions from within any child component. For example, if you take a look at <code>/src/components/index.tsx</code> you'll see how we're now able to utilize our <code>useComposeDB</code> hook that allows us to run queries against our node's client. </p> Create a Seed for our Application's Server DID <p>We mentioned above that we'll want our application to sign each badge payload before handing document control back to the end user. While this flow will not always be the case (read this blog on common <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/data-control-patterns-in-decentralized-storage/">data control patterns</a> in Ceramic for more), we'll want to implement this to ensure the verifiability of the data.</p><p>In <code>/src/pages/api/create.ts</code> we've created an API our application's server will expose that does exactly this - it intakes the data relevant to the event, uses a <code>SECRET_KEY</code> environment variable to instantiate a static DID, and returns a Base64 string-encoded JSON web signature containing the signed data.</p><p>We will therefore need to create a separate static seed to store in a .env file that we'll create:</p> <code>touch .env</code> <p>For this tutorial, enter the following key-value pair into your new file:</p><p><code>SECRET_KEY="11b574d316903ced6cc3f4787bbcc3047d9c72d1da4d83e36fe714ef785d10c1"</code></p><p>When you use the above seed to instantiate a DID, this will yield the following predictable did:</p><p><code>did:key:z6MkqusKQfvJm7CPiSRkPsGkdrVhTy8EVcQ65uB5H2wWzMMQ</code></p><p>If you look back into <code>/src/components/index.tsx</code> you'll see how our lengthy <code>getParams</code> the method performs a quick check against any existing <code>EncryptionEvent</code> or <code>WalletEvent</code> badges the user already holds to test whether the <code>jwt</code> value was indeed signed by our application (a more thorough version of this could include verifying that the signed data matches the same values from the other fields, but we'll leave that up to you to add).</p><p>That's it! We are finally ready to run our application!</p> Running the Application <p>Now that we've set up everything we need for our app to run locally, we can start it up in developer mode. Be sure to select the correct node version first:</p> <code>nvm use 20
npm run dev</code> <p>Once you see the following in your terminal, your application is ready to view in your browser:</p><p>In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000 - you should see the following:</p> Signing in with Web3Modal <p>As mentioned above, we've made our Web3Modal accessible from our navigation which is where our "Connect Wallet" button is coming from. Go ahead and give this button a click and select your wallet of choice.</p><p>During the sign-in cadence, you will notice an additional authorization message appear in your wallet that looks something like this:</p><p>If you recall what we covered in the "Integrating ComposeDB with Our Application" section above, you'll remember that we discussed how we created a <code>DIDSession</code> by requesting authorization over the specific resources (data models) our application will be using. These are the 3 items listed under the "Resources" section of the sign-in request you should see. </p><p>Finally, after you've signed in, your Web3Modal will now show a truncated version of your address:</p> Creating Badges <p>As you can see, our application does not allow the user to input which event they have attended - this will be determined based on the URL the QR code sends the user with the following format:</p><p><a href="http://localhost:3000/?event=%7Bevent+id%7D&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">http://localhost:3000/?event={event id}</a></p><p>Take a look at your browser console - you should see logs that look similar to this:</p><p>We've preset these logs for you by reading from our runtime composite definition that we've imported into the <code>/src/components/index.tsx</code> component. Go ahead and copy one of those fields and construct your URL to look something like this:</p><p><a href="http://localhost:3000/?event=kjzl6hvfrbw6c8njv24a3g4e3w2jsm5dojwpayf4pobuasbpvskv21vwztal9l2&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">http://localhost:3000/?event=kjzl6hvfrbw6c8njv24a3g4e3w2jsm5dojwpayf4pobuasbpvskv21vwztal9l2</a></p><p>If you've copied the stream ID corresponding to the <code>EncryptionEvent</code> model, your UI should now look something like this:</p><p>You can optionally select to share your coordinates. Finally, go ahead and create a badge for whichever event you entered into your URL:</p><p>If you navigate back to your <code>/src/components/index.tsx</code> file you can observe what's happening in <code>createBadge</code>. After calling our <code>/api/create</code> route (which uses our application server's static DID to sign the event data), we're performing a mutation query that creates an instance of whichever event aligns with the identifier you used in your URL parameter. Since our user is the account currently authenticated on our node (from the creation of our DID session), the resulting document is placed into the control of the end user (with our tamper-evident signed data entered into the <code>jwt</code> field). </p><p>If you take a look at our <code>getParams</code> method in our <code>/src/components/index.tsx</code> file, you'll notice that we've created a query against our ComposeDB node that runs both within our <code>useEffect</code> React hook as well as after every badge creation event. Notice how we're querying based on the user's did:pkh: <code>did:pkh:eip155:${chainId}:${address?.toLowerCase()}</code></p><p>If you take a look at our <code>chainId</code> and <code>address</code> assignments, you'll realize these are coming from our Wagmi hooks we mentioned we'd need (specifically <code>useAccount</code> and <code>useChainId</code>). </p> What's Next? <p>We hope you've enjoyed this fairly straightforward walk-through of how to use WalletConnect's Web3Modal toolkit for authenticating users, creating user sessions in Ceramic, and querying ComposeDB based on the authenticated user! While that's all for this tutorial, we encourage you to explore the other possibilities and journies Ceramic has to offer.

<p>As we look back on 2023, we wanted to share another update from our Light Touch Support (LiTS) program: in the second semester, we engaged with 31 organisations and individuals seeking our support –&nbsp; bringing us to a total of 85 partners in the year! From human rights to health rights, LGBTQI rights, access to education and environmental justice, working in countries like Brazil, Congo (DRC), Ghana, India, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, the UK, the US and more. (If you want to learn how the first half of the year went in our LiTS Programme, we wrote a couple of blog posts <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/starting-data-journeys-staying-safe-on-comms-tools-support-trends-from-2023-so-far/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-do-we-document-and-communicate-our-work-when-theres-so-much-other-work-to-do/">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>



 Responsible data, resilience and safety 



<p>Throughout the past 6 months, navigating emerging technologies and adopting responsible data practices continued to be key themes. We spoke with partners in a variety of contexts who are looking to bring a justice-based, ethical approach to their tech and data practices, including organisations from Ghana, India and Brazil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout the past six months, organisations have also continued to express a need for learning how to handle data responsibly and leverage it for advocacy.</p>



<p>If you’re curious about how to start thinking about this, take a look at our <a href="http://responsibledata.io/resources/handbook/">Responsible Data handbook</a> and join the <a href="https://lists.theengineroom.org/lists/info/responsible_data">The Responsible Data mailing list</a> (managed by The Engine Room) where you can ask questions and seek advice from a community of 1000+ people thinking about these issues, including many from the humanitarian sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another big focus for our partners was on becoming more digitally resilient and being more equipped to handle potential threats and vulnerabilities. From a human rights organisation based in eastern DRC facing threats and surveillance from government authorities, to an organisation defending the rights of LGBTQIA+ people in the Dominican Republic: we connected many activists and organisers to digital security resources as well as to digital security experts that they could consult for ongoing support beyond our brief partnership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/building-digital-resilience-is-an-ongoing-effort/">the work we are doing around supporting digital resilience for organisations</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Fostering connections 



<p>Bridge-building and helping to forge impactful partnerships remains one of the cornerstones of our support.&nbsp; We connected a youth-led organisation in Uganda with peers addressing similar challenges, and connected academics in Germany who were investigating disinformation to a group researching information disorder in Brazil.&nbsp; We connected someone working to create an open data portal in Haiti with the NYU Global Justice Clinic Team, who are working with communities in Haiti to collect and monitor data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We participated in various community spaces facilitated by peers, including <a href="https://www.promisingtrouble.net/">Promising Trouble</a>, where we discussed questions related to knowing when and how to choose the right technology, and how to plan for long term sustainability when incorporating technology into projects.</p>



<p>We also got the chance to engage with a lot of young social impact leaders from the <a href="https://mcnpartners.org/">MCN partner network</a>! Many of them were creating new and exciting projects and were keen to learn how to use data and technology to empower their communities and advocate for social justice in their countries.&nbsp;<br>As we start up a new year, we continue committed to providing impactful support to our global partners. <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">Sign up here</a> if you’re interested and stay tuned to our blog for more insights, stories, and updates!</p>

<p>In today’s fast-moving business world, it’s important for different systems to work well together, and having standard data formats helps a lot with this. This article investigates how the EmployeeID is used, which is a key part of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). The adoption group from DIDAS has worked on making sure this EmployeeID follows a set standard. Thanks to their work, we can now see how the EmployeeID can be used in real situations and think about how it can be used more in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demonstrating Real-World Applications&nbsp;</p>
<p>The practicality of the EmployeeID VC was tested in real-world scenarios by organizations SBB, AXA, Orell Füssli, and Swisscom. Together they showed the power of an interoperable eco system based on the credential “EmployeeID”. These demos showcased varied applications:&nbsp;</p>
 
 SBB: Used the VC for external partners to access internal IT systems, replacing traditional username/password methods.&nbsp; 
 AXA: Employed the VC to verify employment status for online insurance offerings.&nbsp; 
 Orell Füssli &amp; Swisscom: Utilized the VC to offer employee discounts in online shopping.&nbsp; 
 
<p>More information here: <a href="https://digitaltrust.swisscom.ch/en/das-potenzial-von-digitalen-nachweisen-aus-dem-privatsektor-erfolgreich-getestet/">Successfully testing the potential of digital evidence from the private sector</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Collaboration: The Key to Adoption&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the primary goals was to ensure that the EmployeeID could seamlessly integrate into various ecosystems. This required a standardized approach that would allow different systems and organizations to interact without compatibility issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process was not an isolated endeavor. It involved a collaborative effort from experts and stakeholders across different industries. By pooling their knowledge and insights, the group could identify and agree on the most relevant and sustainable attributes. This collaborative approach was instrumental in developing a schema that was not only effective for the present but also robust enough to stand the test of time and technological evolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The outcome of these pre-implementation discussions was a well-thought-out, standardized EmployeeID schema. This schema serves as a testament to the importance of foresight and collaboration in the digital age. By addressing the need for standardization and futureproofing at the initial stages, the EmployeeID schema was positioned to be an enduring and versatile tool, capable of adapting to the ever-changing business and technological landscapes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EmployeeID Schema&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EmployeeID schema incorporates various attributes, such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Employee Core: A blend of personal and employer data.&nbsp; 
 Employment Contract: Key contractual information like contract type and working hours.&nbsp; 
 Role: The employee’s role and organizational unit.&nbsp; 
 Office Address: The physical office location.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Authorization: Specific access rights issued as separate VCs.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While many attributes are initially represented as free text in the logical schema, they should ideally be derived from predefined lists or tables for specific implementations. This becomes especially critical when exchanging information with other organizations, necessitating mutually agreed-upon value sets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detailed Schema: <a href="https://didasswiss.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/DIDASMembers/EcxwlWwuKbFCqu09DvSGd2QBK8cscFfDHJA3zP9WUzMxeQ?e=e3Ltup">Detailed Schema of EmployeID</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion&nbsp;</p>
<p>For organizations exploring use cases with SSI or sandbox environments, it’s crucial to engage with the DIDAS adoption group. This collaboration will help define a standard for your verifiable credentials, ensuring a unified approach and compatibility across different ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, the adoption of a standardized EmployeeID schema, as illustrated by DIDAS adoption group, is not just a technical necessity but a strategic move towards interoperability and efficiency in the digital age.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Yet to date, there is no known scheme considered truly interoperable across borders. SIDI Hub was was conceived as a community to accelerate the path to cross-border interoperability.</p><p>SIDI Hub held its first summit at TRUSTECH 2023. DIF was one of the event organizers, alongside our liaison partners including the Open ID Foundation, Open Identity Exchange, FIDO and Open Wallet Foundation. </p><p>120+ digital identity experts from governments, multilaterals, standards organizations, and non-profits representing 22 countries attended. Over 90% of participants agreed that the work started at the summit must continue in 2024. In response, the SIDI Hub community has defined the following work plan:</p>  Identifying champion use cases for cross-border interoperability that serve as baseline for all workstreams  Defining minimum interoperability requirements for priority use cases  Mapping trust frameworks across jurisdictions  Defining metrics of success  <p>The group is organizing a series of virtual and in-person meetings this year to progress the roadmap, and invites all organizations involved in the development, adoption and implementation of digital identity solutions to add their voice to this important work.

The project was established in 2018 at the International Institute for Information Technology in Bangalore. Today, over 100 million citizens in 11 countries are registered on MOSIP-based systems. </p><p>The&nbsp;inaugural MOSIP Connect promises to bring together technologists, policy makers and civil society groups for in-depth discussions and collaboration on inclusive digital identity systems. Participants will learn how digital identity empowers citizens and promotes inclusion, explore how MOSIP addresses concerns around data protection, privacy, and consent, and benefit from networking opportunities.</p> 🗓️ ️Community Events <p>Digital Switzerland</p><p>DIF’s Executive Director, Kim Hamilton Duffy, participated in a panel discussion on the importance of digital identity wallets alongside Beat Jans, the new Head of Switzerland’s Federal Ministry of Justice, who is responsible for the country’s digital identity policy, Stephan Wolf, the outgoing CEO of GLEIF and Daniel Goldscheider, founder of DIF's liaison partner, the Open Wallet Foundation.</p><p>The panel was convened after Mr Jans decided to visit the host event, Digital Switzerland, which took place in Davos recently, at short notice.</p><p>A Swiss E-ID was proposed to voters but rejected in 2021 due to fears that citizens could be tracked during verification, and that private companies would collect and store their data in centralized databases. Subsequent revisions focused on addressing these issues, with Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles taking center stage.&nbsp;</p><p>During the panel discussion, Kim pointed out that much of the unnecessary personal data sharing that typically accompanies customer onboarding is due to the lack of a strong digital identity. Conversely, digital identity based on open standards and SSI principles avoids data oversharing by design. It also offers powerful new economic opportunities, by providing the means to share a wide range of identity data in a privacy-preserving way.&nbsp;</p><p>Kim highlighted the opportunity for “reusable identity”, tying it to improved onboarding enabled by decentralized identity standards, and described how Verifiable Credentials (VCs) provide an ‘envelope’ that can store messages ranging from government-backed Identity data to competencies or skills certifications.&nbsp;</p><p>“Once relying parties trust that the envelope securely wraps and conveys one type of message, it opens the door for others, which offer some of the most exciting, potentially transformative signifiers of trust," she said after the event.</p><p>“Risks of AI were also an urgent topic of discussion. Indeed the waves of disinformation are getting bigger and coming faster as it becomes easier and cheaper to exploit the possibilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and deepfakes. Decentralized identity architectures enable harnessing the benefits of AI but with a stronger, more trustworthy foundation. The standards were designed to apply to Non Person Entities (NPEs) as well as natural persons. So for example, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VC) can establish a chain of trust demonstrating an AI agent is acting on behalf of a natural person.” </p><p>DIF Hackathon Winners share their insights and experiences </p><p>DIF caught up with Ken Watanbe, whose team's submission for the DIF Hackathon scooped first place in the TBD (Block) and Trinsic sponsor challenges, as well as winning second place in the main DIF prize pool.  </p><p>You can read about the team's innovative use of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs) to enable a real-world use case within their university premises <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/guest-blog-ken-watanabe-anonymous-door-unlocking-project/">here</a>. </p><p>We also spoke to Harsh Tyagi, whose team developed HealthX Protocol, winning third place in the DIF Hackathon main prize pool, as well as third place in the TBD (Block) sponsored challenge.</p><p>Read the interview with Harsh <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/heatlhx-protocol/">here</a>. </p><p>Finally, Edward Curran told us about his path to the Hackathon, how he found developing TrustBox using Veramo and his experience of participating in the DIF community.

 Innovating Energy: Digital Identities at the Core of Transformation <p>ZUG, Switzerland — January 31, 2024, The German Energy Agency Deutsche Energy Agentur (DENA), has announced a partnership with Energy Web, Forschungsstelle für Energiewirtschaft e.V. Oli Systems, KILT Protocol, Fieldfisher, and Fraunhofer FIT to launch DIVE — “Digital Identities as Trust Anchors in the Energy System.” DIVE is set to redefine the energy sector in Germany, leveraging the potential of digital identities to integrate and manage renewable energies in a decentralized landscape.</p><p>The Energy System Transformation<br>As part of the urgent effort to achieve climate neutrality, Germany is embracing a massive expansion of renewable energies. This shift is leading to a decentralized energy system with an increasing number of small scale renewable energy facilities prolifterating including wind turbines, solar parks, batteries, electric vehicles, and distributed rooftop solar installations. In this new landscape, consumer choice and seamless integration to various use cases like tracing renewable energy, using customer-owned assets for grid services or selecting a different supplier is vital for efficient energy management.</p><p>Introducing Digital Identities for Trust and Efficiency<br>At the heart of the DIVE project lies a critical objective — establishing secure and reliable digital identities for devices and systems within the energy sector. These digital identities act as trust anchors, verifying the existence and capabilities of each system in real time. By automating verification processes, DIVE allows device owners to choose and change the electricity use cases that their devices are participating in almost no time and little effort, ensuring grid stability and cost savings for energy consumers.</p><p>Energy Web plays a central role in the DIVE project, contributing expertise and technology to two working packages:</p><p>Digital Applications in Proof Management Energy Web is taking the lead in developing and implementing use cases related to electricity labeling and verification. This includes the use of digital identities in conjunction with the registry and exploring energy industry use cases and their links to the identity register. Additionally, Energy Web’s contribution involves extending its existing open-source Green Proofs solution to connect to the digital trust anchors of DIVE and leveraging the substrate-based Energy Web X chain&nbsp;(EWX).</p><p>Energy Web’s Green Proofs solution enables trustworthy device identities to connect with different registers for guarantees of origin. This empowers devices to freely choose and switch between standards and marketplaces without encountering compliance issues like double spending. Energy Web aims to support existing standards and platforms, such as EnergyTag, Energy Track&amp;Trace (an Elia Group platform in collaboration with energinet and Elering), GO, REC, I-REC, and the German guarantees of origin register (Herkunftsnachweisregister — HKNR).</p><p>Furthermore, Energy Web continues to advance the development of its “Fast Change of Supplier for EV Charging Stations” solution (<a href="https://innovation.eliagroup.eu/en/projects/rebeam">ReBeam</a>). Initially tested with Elia Group &amp; 50Hertz Transmission in Berlin during the summer of 2022, the project now integrates with DIVE to enhance security and confidence in the entire process. This integration ultimately allows the consumption of self-generated PV power at public charging stations.</p><p>Smart Contract Library In addition, Energy Web will develop standardized representation and description forms for smart contracts under DIVE. This includes classification within the energy industry context, ensuring implementation-independent descriptions of inputs, outputs, conditions, and logic of smart contracts. The establishment of a “Smart Contract Register” as an “App Store” for decentralized applications and logic devices, along with the provision of smart contracts under free licenses, will set the groundwork for an independent technology library.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers.

<p>What led you to start working with Decentralized Identity?&nbsp;</p><p>I studied computer science at university and wrote my dissertation on Bitcoin, as well as developing using Hyperledger Fabric, so I’ve been in the Web3 world for a while.</p><p>After uni I got involved in a research project looking into how the mortgage application process could be improved, as part of a knowledge transfer partnership between a university and a bank.</p><p>Applying for a mortgage is slow and painful, so streamlining it should make it better for customers and cheaper for the bank. The number of parties — including buyer and seller, lenders, conveyancers, estate agents, credit reference agencies and the Land Registry — made us think “This seems like a problem blockchain can help to solve”.&nbsp;</p><p>However when we spoke to the parties involved, it became clear the core challenge is a data problem. There’s a need to securely exchange data about the property and the participants. That’s not easy, as a lot of the information is private.</p><p>All the guidance was, “Don’t put personal information on the blockchain”. So we searched around and learned about SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). We visited the Rebuilding the Web of Trust (RWOT) conference and got excited. We thought, “This seems like the right way to do it”.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point I realised I wanted to work in decentralized identity, so I moved to Berlin and worked at Jolocom.&nbsp;</p><p>Tell us about TrustBox, please &nbsp;</p><p>I’m not the only one who’s seen these problems with the property buying process. After I returned to the UK I got involved with the Property Data Trust Framework, which is a group of financial institutions, conveyancers and other industry participants working together to standardise data schemas.&nbsp;</p><p>I came in to try to find a way to standardise the data exchange using VCs. To do that, you need to know who’s allowed to issue and verify certain things, so I started looking into the DIF Trust Establishment specification, which is when I saw the publicity for the DIF Hackathon.&nbsp;</p><p>I thought “I can build something using Trust Establishment”. Initially I was looking at the organizational side. If each organization has a DID, they can recognize each other. I was less clear how it would work for buyers and sellers. DIDs are quite an abstract concept for people to get their heads around.&nbsp;</p><p>People do most of their research on the web, and I liked the idea of mimicking the SSL padlock (the icon displayed by browsers when visiting a secure website) so it verifies a site is part of the Property Data Trust Framework. So we developed a browser extension called TrustSight, building on existing work around DID configurations (used to cryptographically link a DID to a domain).</p><p>We also built a tool for deploying trust frameworks, and a tool to visualize trust relationships.</p><p>Why did you choose to develop using Veramo?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s tricky maintaining all these DIDs and DID configurations. There's a package by Sphereon around DID configurations, but it doesn’t provide any tooling around issuing or verifying credentials.</p><p>I was struggling to get the browser extension to work with JSON LD libraries, so I decided to use Veramo for DID and VC related operations and connect to the Sphereon resolver.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s made my life much easier, particularly if I want to use a new DID method or different VC formats.</p><p>What user benefits are you targeting?&nbsp;</p><p>As a buyer, ideally you’d apply to a hundred different lenders in order to get the best deal. However, it’s currently too expensive for lenders to do the checks. As a result, each buyer can really only apply for one mortgage, so people are very conservative about what they are looking for, to ensure they secure a mortgage. </p><p>We’re aiming to make the mortgage application process quicker and easier, and to ensure people get the right product for them.&nbsp;</p><p>How was your experience of participating in the Hackathon?&nbsp;</p><p>It was very well-organised. The criteria and timelines were all clear. I really enjoyed the Discord server. Some people were very active there, which made it feel like a community. I also liked the talks that were put on.</p><p>It was great to get to the end and see everyone’s submissions, and to feel connected and part of the community.&nbsp;</p><p>What next for TrustBox?&nbsp;</p><p>There is some tooling on the Trust Framework side that doesn’t yet exist, so I’d like to work with DIF on that.&nbsp;</p><p>Downloading a browser extension is still quite a big piece of user friction, ultimately you want to get into the browser itself. That’s one to discuss with the browser companies! </p>

 Part 2: Stemmatic Traceability  Further Explorations <p>Building on the foundational exploration of semantic interoperability in Part 1, we delve deeper into the innovative fusion of traditional methodologies with modern computational models. Previously, we discussed the pivotal roles of decentralized semantics and Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) in enabling semantic interoperability between data models and data representation formats across varied environments. We also explored how morphological and epistemological semantics enhance our understanding of data, setting the stage for preserving meaning and context across digital platforms.</p><p>In this installment, we introduce&nbsp;"stemmatic traceability,"&nbsp;marrying the ancient discipline of Stemmatics, focusing on tracing textual variations and origins, to contemporary event provenance models like Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). This synergy enhances data integrity mechanisms and seamlessly integrates classical textual analysis with cutting-edge event provenance practices. Through this exploration, we aim to demonstrate how the principles of Stemmatics, previously confined to textual criticism, enhance semantic interoperability by offering innovative ways to track the evolution of digital objects.</p> The Convergence of Stemmatics and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for Enhanced Data Integrity <p>In the dynamic landscape of digital content and data object evolution,&nbsp;'Stemma'&nbsp;[1] emerges as a versatile umbrella term, encompassing diverse tree structures representing the evolution of digital objects. Traditionally linked to textual criticism,&nbsp;'Stemma'&nbsp;transcends its origins, mirroring the characteristics of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), a robust model for version control systems, and more. It is a unifying genealogical tree encompassing trackable events in depicting the evolution of digital content.</p><p>Converging advanced data structures and traditional textual analysis methodologies in data management is profound and strategic. One of the exemplary intersections is the alignment between DAGs and the time-honored principles of Stemmatics. This synergy unveils a dynamic landscape where event provenance models enable tracing the evolution of systemic objects, enhancing data integrity and reliability across diverse computational ecosystems.</p><p>"Stemmatics"&nbsp;is a discipline within textual criticism that involves studying and analyzing the relationships among various copies of a text to reconstruct the original or an earlier form of that text.

  <p>A more precise understanding of data lineage and text variation between the ordered, hierarchical structuring of texts in Stemmatics and the nodal representation of data within DAGs demonstrate how these causal models encapsulate complex, multifaceted data.</p><p>Mirroring&nbsp;'Stemmatics,'&nbsp;which focuses on tracing texts back to their original form or archetype by unraveling their complex, layered evolutions, DAGs enable a similar journey for data objects. Every node, representing a distinct event or data state, is a stepping stone that leads back to the root (i.e., the source node) – the initial event. All other nodes (events) are causally or sequentially linked, directly or indirectly, to the source node without cycles. Each edge in the DAG signifies a direct influence or connection between events, tracing back to the initial event as the origin. Traceable tree-like structures bring transparency to the fields of data evolution and data integrity. In a digital world where data is as fluid as it is expansive, such a structured approach is instrumental in mitigating data corruption, loss, or misinterpretation.</p> Integrating Kinematical Mechanics and Data Stemmatics <p>Marking the convergence of classical and modern computational paradigms, the role of structures like DAGs, imbued with the essence of principles like Stemmatics, serve as pillars of data integrity, ensuring that as data traverses the complex pathways of digital systems, its essence, authenticity, and assurance remain intact and enriched, offering a foundation for causal representation.</p><p>Introducing "kinematical mechanics" [3] into our discussion, we delve into how this discipline optimizes event pathways and interactions within digital environments.&nbsp;Kinematical mechanics&nbsp;contributes to authentic data provenance and system performance by employing motion and event sequencing concepts, enhancing workflow optimization and data processing. Integrating morphological semantics and&nbsp;kinematical mechanics&nbsp;lays the groundwork for data stemmatics, offering a comprehensive framework for representing and understanding the sequence and patterns in data evolution.</p>  <p>Kinematical Mechanics: In data-centric design,&nbsp;kinematical mechanics&nbsp;analyzes and optimizes event pathways and interactions within digital environments. This discipline employs the study of motion sequences and patterns to enhance the understanding and organization of event sequences, crucially contributing to authentic data provenance and improved system performance. Its importance in workflow optimization enables computational task scheduling and data processing pipelines. Understanding the sequences of events and their causality is fundamental to achieving system efficiency and optimal performance.</p>  <p>Example:&nbsp;In data analysis, 'Kinematical Mechanics' investigates the sequence and patterns of specific events, such as data updates or user interactions, and their impact on the system's behavior within a defined framework.</p><p>Morphological semantics and kinematical mechanics form the basis for data stemmatics, offering traceable genealogical structures to represent causal relationships between tangible&nbsp;'objects'&nbsp;and recorded&nbsp;'events,'&nbsp;providing a comprehensive understanding of data evolution.</p>

    <p>Data Stemmatics: Data stemmatics explores the causal relationships behind data evolution, utilizing traceable graph structures with root archetypes to depict genealogical hypotheses about data relationships driven by content and historical context. It identifies the causes of data changes and offers insights into data evolution across domains. Data stemmatics is concerned with objects and events, delving into the cause of data modifications.</p>  <p>Data stemmatics clarifies the lineage of data changes and provides deeper insights into data evolution across various domains, thus enhancing our ability to achieve genuine semantic interoperability.</p> OCA and DAGs: A Synergetic Combination for Stemmatic Traceability <p>Stemmatic traceability, rooted in textual criticism and historical data analysis, is crucial in tracing data origins, transformations, and evolutionary paths. This method goes beyond mere nodal relationships to offer a nuanced understanding of data's evolutionary journey, thereby significantly improving our capacity for semantic interoperability.</p><p>Enhancements offered by the integration of OCA and DAGs include:</p>  <p>Precision in Data Lineage: The structural organization provided by OCA, coupled with the causal pathways rendered by DAGs, ensures the integrity of data structures and facilitates a transparent, unambiguous tracing of their historical evolution and transformations.</p>    <p>Enhanced Data Interpretability: Leveraging DAGs within the OCA framework transforms each data object's trajectory into a narrative that is both coherent and intuitively understandable. This clarity proves invaluable in scenarios where deciphering the evolution and provenance of data is critical.</p>    <p>Robustness Against Data Corruption: DAGs' acyclic nature inherently safeguards against data corruption and cyclic errors. Combined with OCA's structured framework, this resilience constructs a formidable defense mechanism for maintaining data integrity.</p>    <p>Scalability and Flexibility: Engineered with scalability at their core, OCA and DAGs adeptly navigate the complexities of expanding data landscapes. This synergistic blend ensures data integrity and traceability maintenance without compromising performance or adaptability.</p>  <p>Example:&nbsp;Consider a healthcare data ecosystem where patient records evolve. OCA organizes and structures this data while DAGs meticulously track every alteration, from initial diagnosis to treatment outcomes, ensuring a transparent, error-free historical record.</p> Conclusion <p>Data Integrity and Traceability:&nbsp;While using DAG technology to integrate Stemmatics principles, DAGs are a natural outcome of OCA's design, not a standalone feature. They are one of a few tools OCA uses to ensure data integrity, contributing to better data transparency and traceability and highlighting OCA's adaptability and versatility in handling data.</p><p>The integration of OCA with DAGs represents a synergistic relationship in data science, advancing stemmatic traceability by combining OCA's structural framework with the tractual precision of DAGs. This marriage ensures the tractual causality of data lineage and reinforces data integrity, making it a cornerstone of modern data management and the evolution of data records.</p><p>As we navigate the complexities of modern distributed data ecosystems, OCA and DAG technologies underscore a promising horizon for semantic interoperability and data integrity. The exploration into stemmatic traceability and its integration with contemporary technological frameworks marks a significant milestone in the modern digital landscape and the ongoing journey towards a future where data is not only abundant and accessible but also enriched with a clear, traceable lineage.</p>

<p>Please tell us about yourself and how you got involved in the Hackathon</p><p>I’m currently in my final year at university. I’ve been building apps for the past two years and have recently been learning about cryptography, but I hadn’t previously built anything with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).</p><p>I heard about DIF through an email from Devpost with information about the Hackathon. I started reading recent DIF announcements and looking into the specifications.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of the concepts were new to me. It made me rethink how the internet can be delivered!&nbsp;</p><p>What motivated you to build something in the area of personal health data?&nbsp;</p><p>Another team member, who has health problems in her family, came up with the idea for HealthX Protocol. Her family has to take a big bunch of files with them to every medical appointment. There’s no way for healthcare providers to filter or compute on the data. Everything is manual and takes a lot of time and resources to manage.&nbsp;</p><p>Privacy is obviously really important when it comes to personal health data, but it’s not enough. Given the current state of cyber attacks, you have no idea who has your data, whether it’s in the cloud or whatever. So, the ability to own your health data was a critical requirement for us.&nbsp;</p><p>The other part is, you don’t only need to store the data, you also need to be able to share it with those who need it.</p><p>What did you learn during the hackathon, and how did you use it to meet these needs?&nbsp;</p><p>The hackathon introduced me to DWNs and Web5. Before, I was into other stacks and protocols: Ethereum, zero knowledge and DeFi (Decentralized Finance). I wasn’t actively building identity into my applications.&nbsp;</p><p>These past two months, I’ve been fully immersed in decentralized identity.&nbsp;</p><p>With Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs), owning your data is simple. You spin up a basic server, which can be in the cloud, on your smartphone, even in your browser. You can store the data there and send it to another DID, which can see or edit the full data, or a certain portion of it.</p><p>You encrypt your data with your DID. It’s not like Google has the keys. Even if it’s in the cloud, it’s yours.&nbsp;</p><p>Somehow everything fell into place. I thought “this can be a great use case”.&nbsp;</p><p>How have decentralized identity and Web5 changed how you think about app development?&nbsp;</p><p>The most important thing is being able to store, own and share data. You have self-custody with web3, but it’s just the private key. This enables decentralized money, but what if I need to build an application that generates a large amount of data? I can’t put the file on Ethereum. Even with systems like Filecoin and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), ownership is still a big issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Something that connects your identifier to your storage and enables you to give access to other identifiers opens the door to a lot of new applications. Ownership of data is lacking in web3, and web5 fills the gap.&nbsp;</p><p>Another consideration is that in web3, identity is anonymous. To build identity into an app, you need to write a smart contract. Proving your identity becomes really easy when you’re using DIDs and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). You can choose what information to share using Selective Disclosure. It’s all there out of the box.</p><p>VCs can also be used for access control to a DWN. For example, if you have a conference, anyone with a pass can get access to the materials. The old way of access control is using a username and password. The new way is you can give access to anyone with a VC.</p><p>What next for HealthX Protocol?&nbsp;</p><p>The application is currently just a prototype. We want to build something much more polished.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, generating the DIDs is a little difficult. To address that, I’m planning to integrate a digital identity wallet, perhaps even build one. Then we can do a production application.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d also like to build other applications and get more involved in the decentralized identity community.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a lot of ideas and I’m just getting started in this space!</p>

<p><br></p><p>Please introduce yourself and tell us the background to your project, "Anonymous Door Unlocking with Anonymity Revocation" </p><p>My name is Ken Watanabe. I’m studying cryptography at Waseda University under Kazue Sako. My current research focus is on use cases for Verifiable Credentials (VCs), as well as signature schemes such as BBS+.&nbsp;</p><p>The first time I used VCs was during a national project for the Japanese government, where we used VCs to authenticate UAVs (drones) delivering packages from A to B.&nbsp;</p><p>For the hackathon, we were looking for a simple use case we could implement in our day-to-day environment. We work in a lab, so I decided to make a physical door unlocking system using 3D printers, that enables us to unlock the door to the lab using VCs.&nbsp;</p><p>Please can you describe your solution?&nbsp;</p><p>In our solution the university is the issuer, students are the holders and the door unlocking application is the verifier.&nbsp;</p><p>We also introduced a new role in the ecosystem, ‘Opener’. Only the Opener can revoke a holder’s anonymity. The holder and verifier agree who will be the Opener during the setup process.&nbsp;</p><p>The key technical components are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), W3C JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs).&nbsp;</p><p>We chose DWNs as they offer both storage and messaging. We realized we could put our VC into a DWN and deliver it to other entities like doors using the TBD messaging libraries. This met our requirements and made it simpler to develop.&nbsp;</p><p>We made a wallet application that connects to the DWN, shows the list of VCs and presents the needed information to verifiers through a QR code.&nbsp;</p><p>We used Dock network (which supports BBS+ signatures) and Arkworks to implement the crypto libraries, which I developed myself.&nbsp;</p><p>Why was anonymity revocation an important feature?</p><p>We think Selective Disclosure is very important for many use cases, including this one. The holder shouldn’t have to share unnecessary attributes and the verifier shouldn’t need to hold sensitive data.&nbsp;</p><p>But sometimes, data breaches, a theft or a physical accident might occur and the incident needs to be investigated.&nbsp;</p><p>The Verifiable Presentations (VPs) generated by the application are stored on the lab’s Slack channel. This enables the lab manager to see when the door is opened in real time, without seeing who opened it. If something bad happens, you can pick the presentation from Slack and send it to the Opener to open.&nbsp;</p><p>Please can you explain how the system preserves users’ privacy?&nbsp;</p><p>The holder can choose which attributes to share and generate a Verifiable Presentation (VP) with just this information. They don’t need to share their name, only their faculty membership.&nbsp;</p><p>We used BBS+ signatures because of the unlinkability feature, which means you can’t link multiple transactions to a single user, for enhanced privacy. BBS uses Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to hide attributes. In this project we added another ZKP to the BBS signature, that we call “verifiable encryptions”. In our system, the holder encrypts his identifier using the Opener’s public key. The extra ZKP means the verifier can verify this has happened.&nbsp;</p><p>We think it’s our main contribution to these kinds of door unlocking systems.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s next for the application?&nbsp;</p><p>Only four faculty members use the system currently. I want others to be able to use it. To do this we need to issue VCs to more students. I also want to introduce the system to other doors within the university. But I know it will take time to get it into production, as we need to verify it works well.&nbsp;</p><p>Only one credential can be used in the application currently, but in future we want to make VPs from multiple VCs. I also want to introduce the ability for the holder and verifier to negotiate the Opener dynamically.</p><p>What other use cases do you envisage?&nbsp;</p><p>This is a research project but we think the system can apply to other scenarios. One is ride hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft. The customer can order a taxi anonymously but if an accident happens, their anonymity can be revoked. Another is anonymous social networks. Users can chat anonymously, but if there’s a message that’s violent or abusive the author’s anonymity could be revoked.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from VCs, my other interest is I'm a cryptographer, so I also want to make completely different scenarios. I want to keep using it.</p><p>Last week I presented the application at SCIS2024 in Nagasaki, the biggest cryptography conference in Japan. Many people from government, academia and industry were there. I hope it generated a lot of interest.&nbsp;</p><p>How did you find the experience of participating in the hackathon? Do you envisage participating in DIF going forwards?&nbsp;</p><p>I really enjoyed the hackathon and am very honored to receive this prize. It was my first time using Decentralized Web Nodes. I found the DWNs GitHub readme page and API documentation very easy to read. I just followed the intro and found I could implement it easily. It was straightforward to store the VCs using DWNs.&nbsp;</p><p>For me, BBS Signatures is an interesting area to explore further. I’d also like to use DWNs in other projects and, if possible, I would like to add some features to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, we <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/escription-io-esc-20-inscriptions/">announced</a> the launch of <a href="https://escription.io/">Escription</a>, the first-ever smart inscription marketplace on the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC). Escription introduces an innovative platform for creating and trading ESC-20 inscriptions, with plans to further integrate Bitcoin Elastos Layer 2 (BeL2) technology to enable BRC-20 inscriptions to interact with smart contracts for a host of benefits. Today, we will outline key questions and answer prevalent queries about smart inscriptions. Let’s get stuck in!</p>
<p><br>
Why Are Smart Inscriptions a Significant Advancement?</p>
<p>Smart Inscriptions represent a significant advancement because they enhance the functionality of the BRC20 protocol, originally used for issuing assets on the Bitcoin mainnet. While the BRC20 protocol mirrors Bitcoin’s attributes, including high costs and limited programmability, it also requires off-chain verification and calculations for utilisation. Smart Inscriptions aim to address these limitations by leveraging EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) smart contracts. This integration not only reduces costs and enhances efficiency but also allows the use of smart contracts to build a fully decentralised indexer for BRC20 assets. This development facilitates the issuance of BRC20 assets “at the BTC layer,” operating efficiently on Elastos’ second layer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why Is the Parent-Child Model Preferred for Inscriptions?</p>
<p>The parent-child model is preferred for inscriptions due to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. When a BRC20 inscription is cross-chained from the Bitcoin main network to Elastos (ela), a ‘shadow inscription’ is generated on Elastos’ side chain. This shadow inscription maintains a one-to-one correspondence with the original BRC20 assets, which is why they are termed as father-son inscriptions.</p>
<p>Operating on Elastos’ side chain, the Shadow Inscription benefits from the lower cost, increased transaction speed, and enhanced programming capabilities of the Elastos platform. This model provides a more practical and scalable solution for managing inscriptions, making it a preferred choice in the blockchain environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why Might an Organisation Choose to Use Smart Inscriptions?</p>
<p>Organisations may opt to use Smart Inscriptions to reap the benefits mentioned above. This choice is optional and does not impact their previous usage patterns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How Is BeL2 Organically Connected to Smart Inscriptions?</p>
<p>BeL2 can generate zero-knowledge proofs for BTC transactions, allowing EVM contracts to verify transactions on the Bitcoin network. This makes Bitcoin the settlement layer for both parties in a transaction. BeL2 extends this capability to recognise inscription transactions and BRC20 transactions, thereby generating zero-knowledge proofs for BRC20 transfers. This approach enables the creation of a BRC20 ledger via zero-knowledge proofs in the contract, offering a more decentralised and reliable solution than an inscription indexer. BRC20 assets can be traded using BeL2, just like BTC assets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How Will the Decentralised Bridge Work?</p>
<p>The decentralised bridge consists of several validators who manage cross-chain assets through multi-signature. The verifier is divided into three parts:</p>
 
 Validators pledging assets without needing permission. 
 Ela’s CR committee member or DPoS node. 
 Agent entrusted by the development team. Each part accounts for one-third of the quota, and asset management requires multi-signature approval by a two-thirds majority. If abnormal asset transfer operations occur, users can use BeL2 technology to generate cheating certificates to punish malicious nodes. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How Will Smart Inscriptions with BeL2 Extend Bitcoin’s Capabilities?</p>
<p>BeL2 technology can generate credible zero-knowledge proofs for Bitcoin transactions, allowing contracts to monitor Bitcoin chain transactions. This capability can be used to generate transfer certificates for BRC20, thereby establishing a decentralized indexer for BRC20 on the ela side chain and addressing its centralised indexer issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How Will Smart Inscriptions Integrate with Elacity?</p>
<p>Smart Inscriptions can integrate with Elacity through the parent-child inscription model. BRC20 assets on Bitcoin can be mapped to the ela side chain at a 1:1 ratio and cast as inscriptions. Users can exchange ela sidechain inscriptions for BRC20 assets on BTC. This allows for payment and use of BRC-20s on the ela side chain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Will the Costs of Smart Inscriptions Be?</p>
<p>Issuing inscriptions on the ela side chain incurs minimal costs, less than 1 cent in gas fees. However, issuing BTC father and son inscriptions requires payment of dynamic BTC gas fees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Are the Main Benefits of Smart Inscription?</p>
<p>Smart Inscription offers a decentralised, efficient, and cost-effective way to issue and manage assets on the Bitcoin network, expanding the capabilities and applications of BRC20 assets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will Satoshi ID (From Ordinal Theory) Be Used or Have Any Function on ESC?</p>
<p>Ordinals are not used on the ela sidechain as it operates on an account model, unlike the UTXO model for which Ordinals are designed.</p>

<p>Passwords are as old as computers – but are still considered insecure and cumbersome. But now there is hope: “Passkey” is the name of a new procedure in which you don’t have to remember passwords or type in codes – and it’s still more secure. Behind it is FIDO, an alliance of large IT companies. SRF digital editor Peter Buchmann explains what it’s about.</p>

 <p>Prompt: “A public marketplace for digital goods where people pay whatever they please for everything they consume.” Via Microsoft Image Creator</p> 
<p>Now that we’ve hit <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/03/why-subscriptions-are-hard-to-cancel/623885/">peak subscription</a>, and paywalls are showing up in front of formerly free digital goods (requiring, of course, more subscriptions), perhaps the world is ready for <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/EmanciPay">EmanciPay</a>, an idea that has been biding its time on <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/">our wiki</a> since 2009.</p>
<p>So, rather than leave it buried there, we’ll surface it here. Dig:::</p>
 Overview 
<p>Simply put, Emancipay makes it easy for anybody to pay (or offer to pay) —</p>
 
 as much as they like 
 however they like 
 for whatever they like 
 on their own terms 
 
<p>— or at least to start with that full set of options, and to work out differences with sellers easily and with minimal friction.</p>
<p>Emancipay turns consumers (aka users) into customers by giving them a pricing gun (something which in the past only sellers used) and their own means to make offers, to pay outright, and to escrow the intention to pay when price and other requirements are met. And to be able to do this at scale across all sellers, much as cash, browsers, credit cards, and email clients do the same. Payments themselves can also be escrowed.</p>
<p>In slightly more technical terms, EmanciPay is a payment framework for customers operating with full agency in the open marketplace, and at scale. It operates on open protocols and standards, so it can be used by any buyer, seller or intermediary.</p>
<p>It was conceived as a way to pay for music, journalism, or what any artist brings into the world. But it can apply to anything. For example, [<a href="https://customercommons.org/solving-subscriptions/">subscriptions</a>], have become a giant fecosystem in which every seller has separate and non-substitutable scale across all subscribers, while subscribers have zero scale across all sellers, with the highly conditional exceptions of silo’d commercial intermediaries. As [<a href="http://customercommons.org/">Customer Commons</a>] puts it,</p>
<p>There’s also not much help coming from the subscription management services we have on our side: Truebill, Bobby, Money Dashboard, Mint, Subscript Me, BillTracker Pro, Trim, Subby, Card Due, Sift, SubMan, and Subscript Me. Nor from the subscription management systems offered by Paypal, Amazon, Apple or Google (e.g. with Google Sheets and Google Doc templates). All of them are too narrow, too closed and exclusive, too exposed to the surveillance imperatives of corporate giants, and too vested in the status quo.</p>
<p>That status quo sucks (see&nbsp;<a href="https://enewspaper.latimes.com/infinity/article_share.aspx?guid=b8db8d9f-5e61-4da2-b112-e5e1cf71df57">here</a>, or just look up&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=subscription+hell">“subscription hell”</a>), and it’s way past time to unscrew it.) But how?</p>
<p>The better question is&nbsp;where?</p>
<p>The answer to that is&nbsp;on our side: the customer’s side.</p>
<p>While EmanciPay was first conceived by ProjectVRM as a way to make live payments to nonprofits and to provide&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/2009/05/28/emancipay-a-content-monetization-plan-for-newspapers/">a new monetization method for publishers</a>. it also works as a counterpart to sellers’ subscription systems in what&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zuora.com/">Zuora</a>&nbsp;(a supplier of subscription management systems to the publishing industry, including&nbsp;The Guardian&nbsp;and&nbsp;Financial Times) calls the “<a href="http://www.zuora.com/subscription-economy/">subscription economy</a>“, which it says “is built on ever-changing relationships with your customers”. Since relationships are two-way by nature, EmanciPay is one way that customers can manage their end, while publisher-side systems such as Zuora’s manage the other.</p>
 Emancipay economic case 
<p>EmanciPay provides a new form of economic signaling not available to individuals, either on the Net or before the Net became available as a communications medium. EmanciPay will use open standards and be comprised of open-source code. While any commercial&nbsp;<a title="Fourth parties" href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Fourth_parties">fourth parties</a>&nbsp;can use EmanciPay (or its principles, or any parts of it they like), EmanciPay’s open and standard framework will support fourth parties by making them substitutable, much as the open standards of email (SMTP, POP3, IMAP) make email systems substitutable. (Each has what&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.joeandrieu.com/2009/04/26/introducing-user-driven-services/">Joe Andrieu calls</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.joeandrieu.com/2009/05/07/user-driven-services-5-service-endpoint-portability/">service endpoint portability</a>.)</p>
<p>EmanciPay is an instrument of customer independence from all of the billion (or so) commercial entities on the Net, each with its own arcane and siloed systems for engaging and managing customer relations, as well as receipt, acknowledgment, and accounting for payments from customers.</p>
 Use Case Background 
<p>EmanciPay was conceived originally as a way to provide customers with the means to signal interest and the ability to pay for media and creative works (most of which are freely available on the Web, if not always free of charge). Through EmanciPay, demand and supply can relate, converse, and transact business on mutually beneficial terms, rather than only on terms provided by the countless different siloed systems we have today, each serving to hold the customer captive, and causing much inconvenience and friction in the process.</p>
<p>Media goods were chosen for five reasons: 1) because most are available for free, even if they cost money, or are behind paywalls 2) paywalls, which are cookie-based, cannot relate to individuals as anything other than submissive and dependent parties (and each browser a users employs carries a different set of cookies) 3) both media companies and non-profits are constantly looking for new sources of revenue 4) the subscription model, while it creates steady income and other conveniences for sellers, is often a bad deal for customers, and is now so overused (see&nbsp;<a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/07/15/subscriptification/">Subscriptification</a>) that the world is approaching a peak subscription crisis, and&nbsp;<a href="https://reality2.substack.com/p/unscrewing-subscriptions">unscrewing it can only happen from the customer’s side (because the business is incapable of unscrewing the problem itself</a> 5) all methods of intermediating payment choices are either siloed by the seller or siloed by intermediators, discouraging participation by individuals.</p>
<p>What the marketplace requires are new business and social contracts that ease payment and stigmatize non-payment for creative goods. The friction involved in voluntary payment is still high, even on the Web, where one must go through complex ceremonies even to make simple payments. There is no common and easy way either to keep track of what media (free or otherwise) we use (see&nbsp;<a title="Media Logging" href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Media_Logging">Media Logging</a>), to determine what it might be worth, and to pay for it easily and in standard ways &amp;#151; to many different suppliers. (Again, each supplier has its own system for accepting payments.)</p>
<p>EmanciPay differs from other payment models (subscriptions, newsstands, tip jars) by providing customers with the ability to choose what they wish to pay and how they’ll pay it, with minimum friction — and with full choice about what they disclose about themselves.</p>
<p>EmanciPay will also support credit for referrals, requests for service, feedback, and other relationship support mechanisms, all at the control of the user. For example, EmanciPay can provide quick and easy ways for listeners to pay for public radio broadcasts or podcasts, for readers to pay for otherwise “free” papers or blogs, for listeners to pay to hear music and support artists, for users to issue promises of payment for stories or programs — all without requiring the individual to disclose unnecessary private information or to become a “member” — although these options are kept open.</p>
<p>This will scaffold genuine relationships between buyers and sellers in the media marketplace. It will also give deeper meaning to “membership” in non-profits. (Under the current system, “membership” generally means putting one’s name on a pitch list for future contributions, and not much more than that.)</p>
<p>EmanciPay will also connect the sellers’ CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems with customers’ VRM (Vendor Relationship Management) systems, supporting rich and participatory two-way relationships. In fact, EmanciPay will by definition be a VRM system.</p>
 Micro-accounting and Macro-distribution 
<p>The idea of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropayment">“micro-payments”</a> for goods on the Net has been around for a long time and is often brought up as a potential business model for journalism. For example in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1877191,00.html">this article by Walter Isaacson</a>&nbsp;in Time Magazine. It hasn’t happened, at least not globally, because it’s too complicated, and in prototype only works inside private silos.</p>
<p>What ProjectVRM&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2009/02/11/emancipay/">suggests instead</a>&nbsp;is something we don’t yet have, but very much need:</p>
 
 micro-accounting&nbsp;for actual uses. Think of this simply as “keeping track of” the news, podcasts, newsletters, or music we consume. 
 macro-distribution&nbsp;of payments for accumulated use (that’s no longer “micro”). 
 
<p>Much — maybe most — of the digital goods we consume are both free for the taking and worth more than $zero. How much more? We need to be able to say. In economic terms, demand needs to have a much wider range of signals it can give to supply. And give to each other, to better gauge what we should be willing to pay for free stuff that has real value but not a hard price.</p>
<p>As currently planned, EmanciPay would –</p>
 
 Provide a single and easy way for consumers of “content” to become customers of it. In the current system — which isn’t one — every artist, every musical group, and every public radio and TV station has his, her or own way of taking in contributions from those who appreciate the work. This can be arduous and time-consuming for everybody involved. (Imagine trying to pay separately every musical artist you like, for all your enjoyment of each artist’s work.) What EmanciPay proposes, however, is not a replacement for existing systems, but a new system that can supplement existing fund-raising systems — one that can soak up much of today’s MLOTT: Money Left On The Table. 
 Provide ways for individuals to look back through their media usage histories, inform themselves about what they have been enjoying, and determine how much it is worth to them. The Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP), and later the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB), both came up with “rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller.” This almost absurd language first appeared in the 1995 Digital Performance Royalty Act (DPRA) and was tweaked in 1998 by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), under which both the CARP and the CRB operated. The rates they came up with peaked at $.0001 per “performance” (a song or recording), per listener.&nbsp;EmanciPay creates the “willing buyer” that the DPRA thought wouldn’t exist. 
 Stigmatize non-payment for worthwhile media goods. This is where “social” will finally come to be something more than yet another tech buzzmodifier. 
 
<p>All these require micro-accounting, not micro-payments. Micro-accounting can inform ordinary payments that can be made in clever new ways that should satisfy everybody with an interest in seeing artists compensated fairly for their work. An individual listener, for example, can say “I want to pay 1¢ for every song I hear,” and “I’ll send&nbsp;<a href="http://www.soundexchange.com/">SoundExchange</a>&nbsp;a lump sum of all the pennies wish to pay for songs I have heard over a year, along with an accounting of what artists and songs I’ve listened to” — and leave dispersal of those totaled pennies up to the kind of agency that likes, and can be trusted, to do that kind of thing. That’s the macro-distribution part of the system.</p>
<p>Similar systems can also be put in place for readers of newspapers, blogs, and other journals. What’s important is that the control is in the hands of the individual and that the accounting and dispersal systems work the same way for everybody.</p>

    Declaration Of Digital Independence Authored by Larry Sanger, Co-founder of Wikipedia 



<p>We declare that we have unalienable digital rights, rights that define how information that we individually own may or may not be treated by others, and that among these rights are free speech, privacy, and security. Since the proprietary, centralized architecture of the Internet at present has induced most of us to abandon these rights, however reluctantly or cynically, we ought to demand a new system that respects them properly. </p>



<p>The difficulty and divisiveness of wholesale reform means that this task is not to be undertaken lightly. For years we have approved of and even celebrated enterprise as it has profited from our communication and labor without compensation to us. But it has become abundantly clear more recently that a callous, secretive, controlling, and exploitative animus guides the centralized networks of the Internet and the corporations behind them.</p>



<p>The long train of abuses we have suffered makes it our right, even our duty, to replace the old networks. To show what train of abuses we have suffered at the hands of these giant corporations, let these facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>



<p>They have practiced in-house moderation in keeping with their executives’ notions of what will maximize profit, rather than allowing moderation to be performed more democratically and by random members of the community.</p>



<p>They have banned, shadow-banned, throttled, and demonetized both users and content based on political considerations, exercising their enormous corporate power to influence elections globally.</p>



<p>They have adopted algorithms for user feeds that highlight the most controversial content, making civic discussion more emotional and irrational and making it possible for foreign powers to exercise an unmerited influence on elections globally.</p>



<p>They have required agreement to terms of service that are impossible for ordinary users to understand, and which are objectionably vague in ways that permit them to legally defend their exploitative practices.</p>



<p>They have marketed private data to advertisers in ways that no one would specifically assent to.</p>



<p>They have failed to provide clear ways to opt out of such marketing schemes.</p>



<p>They have subjected users to such terms and surveillance even when users pay them for products and services.</p>



<p>They have data-mined user content and behavior in sophisticated and disturbing ways, learning sometimes more about their users than their users know about themselves; they have profited from this hidden but personal information.</p>



<p>They have avoided using strong, end-to-end encryption when users have a right to expect total privacy, in order to retain access to user data.</p>



<p>They have amassed stunning quantities of user data while failing to follow sound information security practices, such as encryption; they have inadvertently or deliberately opened that data to both illegal attacks and government surveillance.</p>



<p>They have unfairly blocked accounts, posts, and means of funding on political or religious grounds, preferring the loyalty of some users over others.</p>



<p>They have sometimes been too ready to cooperate with despotic governments that both control information and surveil their people.</p>



<p>They have failed to provide adequate and desirable options that users may use to guide their own experience of their services, preferring to manipulate users for profit.</p>



<p>They have failed to provide users adequate tools for searching their own content, forcing users rather to employ interfaces insultingly inadequate for the purpose.</p>



<p>They have exploited users and volunteers who freely contribute data to their sites, by making such data available to others only via paid application program interfaces and privacy-violating terms of service, failing to make such freely-contributed data free and open source, and disallowing users to anonymize their data and opt out easily.</p>



<p>They have failed to provide adequate tools, and sometimes any tools, to export user data in a common data standard.</p>



<p>They have created artificial silos for their own profit; they have failed to provide means to incorporate similar content, served from elsewhere, as part of their interface, forcing users to stay within their networks and cutting them off from family, friends, and associates who use other networks.</p>



<p>They have profited from the content and activity of users, often without sharing any of these profits with the users.</p>



<p>They have treated users arrogantly as a fungible resource to be exploited and controlled rather than being treated respectfully, as free, independent, and diverse partners.</p>



<p>We have begged and pleaded, complained, and resorted to the law. The executives of the corporations must be familiar with these common complaints; but they acknowledge them publicly only rarely and grudgingly. The ill treatment continues, showing that most of such executives are not fit stewards of the public trust.</p>



<p>The most reliable guarantee of our privacy, security, and free speech is not in the form of any enterprise, organization, or government, but instead in the free agreement among free individuals to use common standards and protocols. The vast power wielded by social networks of the early 21st century, putting our digital rights in serious jeopardy, demonstrates that we must engineer new—but old-fashioned—decentralized networks that make such clearly dangerous concentrations of power impossible.</p>



<p>Therefore, we declare our support of the following principles.</p>



 Principles of Decentralized Social Networks 



<p>We free individuals should be able to publish our data freely, without having to answer to any corporation.</p>



<p>We declare that we legally own our own data; we possess both legal and moral rights to control our own data.</p>



<p>Posts that appear on social networks should be able to be served, like email and blogs, from many independent services that we individually control, rather than from databases that corporations exclusively control or from any central repository.</p>



<p>Just as no one has the right to eavesdrop on private conversations in homes without extraordinarily good reasons, so also the privacy rights of users must be preserved against criminal, corporate, and governmental monitoring; therefore, for private content, the protocols must support strong, end-to-end encryption and other good privacy practices.</p>



<p>As is the case with the Internet domain name system, lists of available user feeds should be restricted by technical standards and protocols only, never according to user identity or content.</p>



<p>Social media applications should make available data input by the user, at the user’s sole discretion, to be distributed by all other publishers according to common, global standards and protocols, just as are email and blogs, with no publisher being privileged by the network above another. Applications with idiosyncratic standards violate their users’ digital rights.</p>



<p>Accordingly, social media applications should aggregate posts from multiple, independent data sources as determined by the user, and in an order determined by the user’s preferences.</p>



<p>No corporation, or small group of corporations, should control the standards and protocols of decentralized networks, nor should there be a single brand, owner, proprietary software, or Internet location associated with them, as that would constitute centralization.</p>



<p>Users should expect to be able to participate in the new networks, and to enjoy the rights above enumerated, without special technical skills. They should have very easy-to-use control over privacy, both fine- and coarse-grained, with the most private messages encrypted automatically, and using tools for controlling feeds and search results that are easy for non-technical people to use.</p>



<p>We hold that to embrace these principles is to return to the sounder and better practices of the earlier Internet and which were, after all, the foundation for the brilliant rise of the Internet. Anyone who opposes these principles opposes the Internet itself. Thus we pledge to code, design, and participate in newer and better networks that follow these principles, and to eschew the older, controlling, and soon to be outmoded networks.</p>



<p>We, therefore, the undersigned people of the Internet, do solemnly publish and declare that we will do all we can to create decentralized social networks; that as many of us as possible should distribute, discuss, and sign their names to this document; that we endorse the preceding statement of principles of decentralization; that we will judge social media companies by these principles; that we will demonstrate our solidarity to the cause by abandoning abusive networks if necessary; and that we, both users and developers, will advance the cause of a more decentralized Internet.</p>

<p>Author: Marie Jordan from VISA. Additional contributions made by members of DIACC’s Adoption Expert Committee.</p>


 
 
 
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of the digital age, the concept of identity has transcended the physical realm and taken root in the digital world. This shift towards digital identities brings about numerous conveniences and efficiencies, but it also presents challenges: ensuring accessibility and equity for all. From online banking to social media profiles, our digital identity is an intricate tapestry that weaves together various facets of our lives. It’s crucial to note that when discussing inclusion, equity, and accessibility in this context, the focus is primarily on individuals who experience physical or cognitive disabilities that may impair their use of technology from the outset.</p>



<p>The importance of accessibility in creating digital identity solutions cannot be overstated. To achieve true inclusivity for this specific group, both the public and private sectors must prioritize accessibility and consider specific principles to safeguard the rights and privacy of individuals with disabilities. In this article, we’ll delve into the significance of accessibility for digital identity and the protection of marginalized communities, outlining key principles for both public and private sectors to consider.</p>
 



  
  
 
 


<p>Part 1: The Significance of Accessibility in Developing Digital Identity</p>



<p>Digital identity solutions are central to our modern lives, facilitating everything from accessing healthcare records to participating in online communities. However, these advantages are only fully realized when these systems are accessible to everyone, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities, including accounting for aging populations. An initial product release that lacks accessibility and proves difficult to use, even if it functions as intended, can erode trust and create negative perceptions.</p>


 
 
 



 
 
 
 
  



 
 
 Universal design: A foundational principle for digital identity solutions is creating systems usable by all individuals, regardless of disability. A universally designed digital identity solution should accommodate a wide range of abilities, modalities of interaction, and preferences, ensuring that everyone can participate in the digital world on equal terms. 



 Inclusivity in development: Involving individuals with disabilities in the design and testing phases ensures that the final product is genuinely accessible. By including diverse perspectives, developers can identify and rectify accessibility issues early in the development cycle. 



 Adherence to standards: To ensure accessibility, digital identity solutions must adhere to globally recognized accessibility standards, such as W3C’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These provide a clear set of guidelines for making digital content and applications accessible. Compliance with these standards is crucial for ensuring that digital identities are available and usable for all. 
 
 
 
 


 
 User-centric approach: Developers must seek to understand how individuals with disabilities interact with their application or technology, offering customization options that empower users to adapt the system to their unique needs and requirements. This might include adjustable font sizes, alternative input methods, and compatibility with assistive technologies. They should also be adaptive in their design. 



 Privacy and security: Paramount in digital identity solutions, individuals with disabilities may be particularly vulnerable to privacy breaches and identity theft. Implementing robust security measures while maintaining respect for user privacy is essential. This can be achieved through encryption, robust authentication methods, and clear privacy policies. Regular audits and assessments can address the security and privacy practices of digital identity solutions as technology shifts, including vulnerability testing and compliance checks to ensure the highest standards of privacy and security are maintained. 
 



<p>Part 2: Safeguarding the Privacy and Trust of Individuals with Disabilities</p>



<p>To ensure that the privacy and trust of all citizens are safeguarded appropriately, accessible solutions must be designed and delivered with intent. To ensure that accessibility is realized, a high level of understanding and education is necessary for individuals to utilize their identity in digital channels without the apprehension of misuse or fear of being exploited.</p>



 
 Informed consent: Individuals with disabilities should have access to clear and understandable information about how their digital identity data will be used. Obtaining informed consent ensures that users are aware of the risks and benefits of participating in digital identity systems. 



 Minimal data collection: Users should understand that only the data that is absolutely necessary for the functioning of the digital identity system is being collected. Minimizing data collection reduces the risk of privacy breaches and limits the potential for misuse of personal information. 



 Transparency in data practices: Transparency should be maintained in data practices. All users must have access to their data and understand how it is being used and processed. Transparency, particularly to historically marginalized communities, builds trust and empowers individuals to make informed decisions about the use of their digital identities. 



 Accessible privacy settings and controls: Accessible privacy settings and controls that are easy for individuals with disabilities to use must be available. These controls must allow users to manage their data and privacy preferences effectively. 
 



<p>In conclusion, it’s important to recognize that accessibility, inclusion, and equity are multifaceted challenges. While this article focuses on individuals experiencing physical or cognitive disabilities, it’s crucial to acknowledge that there are various barriers to equitable access, including socio-economic factors, digital literacy, and language barriers. By addressing these challenges collectively, we can work towards creating a more inclusive digital world for everyone.</p>

<p>Kenneth Bengtsson and Rich Piazza Named OASIS Distinguished Contributors</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, USA, 25 January 2024 — Winners of the tenth annual <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/open-standards-cup/">Open Cup</a>, recognizing exceptional advancements in open standards and open source, were announced today. The Open Cup for Outstanding New Initiative was awarded to <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openeox">OpenEoX</a>, a unified machine-readable approach to managing and sharing End-of-Life (EOL) and End-of-Support (EOS) information for software and hardware. The Open Cup for Outstanding Approved Standard was awarded to <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=codelist">Code List Representation (genericode) V1.0</a>. “Genericode” defines an XML format for the interchange, documentation and management of code lists. In addition, Kenneth Bengtsson and Rich Piazza were named as <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/members/distinguished-contributors/">Distinguished Contributors</a> for their significant impact on the OASIS community.</p>



<p>Open Cup Recipients</p>



<p>OpenEoX brings together major software and hardware providers from around the world to define a unified and efficient method to programmatically verify the EOL or EOS status of the products that businesses and individuals rely on. A standardized approach to EOL and EOS information will empower open source maintainers and vendors alike to deliver more accurate and reliable support to their users. OpenEoX can help reduce cybersecurity risk and susceptibility to vulnerabilities, enabling companies to quickly identify unsupported products. While frameworks like software bill of materials (SBOMs), the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF), and Vulnerability Exchange (VEX) have made significant strides in improving information sharing and product lifecycle management, OpenEoX represents a critical step forward in unifying these efforts.</p>



<p>OpenEoX was chosen from a group of Open Cup finalists that included:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=ces-tc">Computing Ecosystem Supply-Chain (CES) Technical Committee (TC)</a> 



 <a href="https://github.com/DAD-CDM">Defending Against Disinformation Common Data Model (DAD-CDM) Open Project</a> (OP) 



 <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=lvcsp">Lightweight Verifiable Credential Schema and Process (LVCSP) TC</a> 



 <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=ohdf">OASIS Heimdall Data Format (OHDF) TC</a> 
 



<p>“Genericode,” named the Outstanding Approved Standard, was developed by the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=codelist">Code List Representation TC</a>. The format serves as a unified semantic model for code lists and corresponding XML serialization and is designed to IT-enable and standardize the publication of machine-readable code list information, facilitating interchange between systems. Code lists, ranging from standardized items like country and currency abbreviations to nonstandardized ones exchanged between trading partners, find a standardized representation in genericode.

<p><a href="http://Escription.io">Escription</a>, the first smart inscription marketplace for ESC-20 tokens, is now live on Elastos! Escription enables unique data to be inscribed directly onto the Elastos Smart Chain blockchain. The uniqueness of these inscriptions lies in their immutability and the proof of ownership they provide. Being the first platform to offer such a service on ESC, Escription simplifies the process of creating and trading ESC-20 inscriptions. Today, Escription supports a new launchpad for financial tokens on Elastos, similar to Bitcoin’s BRC-20 tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 History of Inscriptions 
<p>Bitcoin inscriptions began as a means to permanently include unique identifiers or messages within a Bitcoin transaction, serving as a rudimentary precursor to smart contracts. These inscriptions were simply data embedded in a transaction’s output and could be anything from text to complex instructions.</p>
<p>After the Segregated Witness (SegWit) and Taproot updates to Bitcoin’s protocol, which took place in 2017 and 2021 respectively, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals-7486436">Bitcoin Ordinals</a> introduced a system to individually number and track satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. This enabled each satoshi to carry distinct information, making it possible to create digital artefacts akin to NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. This innovation was significant because it allowed for the representation of unique digital assets on a blockchain initially designed primarily for financial transactions.</p>
<p>In March 2023, a programmer known as Domo established the BRC-20 standard to mint fungible tokens on Bitcoin, starting with “ordi.” This spurred wallet support and the launch of many BRC-20 tokens, including memes, leading to soaring values, market caps, and increased network congestion and transaction fees by May 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://ethscriptions.com/">Ethscriptions</a> serve as Ethereum’s innovative response to Bitcoin Ordinals, enabling a vast array of digital entities beyond minimal currency units to be inscribed on the blockchain as unique data URIs. URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) refers to a string of characters used to identify a particular resource or piece of data on the blockchain. By harnessing Ethereum’s smart contract technology, Ethscriptions facilitate not only ownership but also dynamic and programmable interactions with the data, positioning themselves as a versatile tool for digital innovation within the blockchain domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Smart Inscriptions on Elastos and The Bigger Picture 
<p>Escription now enable users to mint, buy, and trade inscriptions on ESC for less than a cent! However, the platform aims to go beyond just generating and trading Elastos inscriptions in the coming months. Its vision is to merge Bitcoin and Ethereum innovations to create a smart inscription economy. Looking ahead, the platform plans to integrate <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/bel2-whitepaper-bitcoin-revolution/">BeL2</a>, the Bitcoin Elastos Layer 2 protocol. This integration will allow Bitcoin inscriptions to be bridged into ESC, creating a ‘daughter’ inscription that mirrors the ‘parent’ inscription on Bitcoin. As a result, the value of Bitcoin inscriptions can be transformed into the programmability of Ethereum’s system, using the Elastos SmartWeb.</p>
<p>Enabling Bitcoin inscriptions to be used in smart contracts on ESC opens avenues for new decentralized finance applications and utility models for Bitcoin down to each Satoshi, such as payments and loans. This enhancement of Bitcoin inscription value aligns with the core principle of BeL2, which is to make Bitcoin Smart in everything by delivering smart contracts using it’s layer2 solution. This is achieved without fundamentally changing Bitcoin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Founded in 2022, Silence Laboratories is a cybersecurity startup enabling adoption of privacy preserving threshold signatures and secure computations through its developer-focused cryptographic stack. The company also organizes Decompute, a conference focused on decentralized security with multiparty computation.&nbsp;</p><p>We spoke to CEO and co-founder Jay Prakash.&nbsp;</p><p>Please introduce yourself, and explain how you developed the idea for Silence Labs&nbsp;</p><p>I did my PhD in Usable Security, that is security an average user is able to handle, hiding all the math and complexity. My PhD Supervisor and I found multiple vulnerabilities in existing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) solutions, which we published and described at various conferences. We thought, “Why not build a company to do this better?”</p><p>During this period I spent time in both Singapore and the US. In the process of talking to prospective customers, we realized there was a bit of a mismatch between our original idea and the market need. However, we saw clear demand for decentralized authentication.&nbsp;</p><p>We began meeting with crypto wallet providers. Many were talking about exposure of private keys, which is a common problem. That’s how we landed on Multiparty Computation (MPC) as an area with a lot of commercial potential.&nbsp;</p><p>What are you building?&nbsp;</p><p>We have developed an interactive protocol which allows a group of parties to do mathematical calculations on private data.</p><p>For example, the data could be keyshares by isolated computing nodes trying to calculate the signature for a transaction. The requirement is to produce a valid signature from a predetermined proportion of the nodes in the network, known as t out of n secret sharing.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a hot problem that we latched onto and started to develop around.&nbsp;</p><p>We expose the protocol in our SDKs and libraries, which customers can use to distribute the signing process and overcome the problem of key exposure.&nbsp;</p><p>How is your solution being used today?&nbsp;</p><p>Our solution provides a good amount of freedom regarding what policies are set and how keyshares take place. We provide the tool, but don't dictate how it should be used.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a couple of ways our partners are using it.</p><p>One is browser plugin wallets that split the private key between the user’s browser and their phone.&nbsp;</p><p>Another design is to create a network which manages the keys on your behalf. You provide your ID, then the network runs a protocol (such as&nbsp; 5 out of 10 nodes) to get a valid signature.&nbsp;</p><p>A third design is to do one keyshare from the phone and one from the wallet provider. If our customer is a custodian holding a large volume of assets, they can also split their key between multiple directors and/or employees.&nbsp;</p><p>Are you targeting other market segments, in addition to crypto wallets?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>MPC is a powerful tool that can be used for many purposes.&nbsp; We’ve been doing a lot of research and development around using it for privacy guarantees. For example, a number of financial institutions hold your financial data. If you now want to take out a loan, the lender needs access to your credit score. Traditionally, credit agencies scrape your data without you knowing and return a score. Your data passes through lots of hands, you have no control over what’s happening to it, it’s aggregated and vulnerable to attack. MPC can radically improve how this is done.&nbsp;</p><p>Another use case is Reg Tech (regulatory technology) including Anti Money Laundering (AML) compliance. To uncover money laundering, you need to collaborate with lots of partners. For example, if I’m a telco and you’re a bank, we can both reduce our risk by computing on the customers’ combined telco and banking history. Reg Tech providers currently can’t share private data with each other, but with privacy guarantees, these protocols can comply fully with GDPR and other applicable regulations.&nbsp;</p><p>We want to position this like Two-Factor Authentication, which is already well understood by consumers. The intention is that the user experience will be exactly the same. To deliver that, it has to work fast. Right now we have the fastest multiparty signing library in production, around 5 to 10x faster than other solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>Can you unpack the concept of Privacy Guarantees a bit please?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a big misunderstanding around consent. Typically a service provider creates a super-long consent form and you tick to say you agree. What we are trying to champion is: One, the user interface should be clearer and Two, consent should not be one-time or one-directional. If I want to pull a piece of private data I previously provided, it should be removed from the entire ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>To make consent programmable, you need something like Multiparty Computation. MPC allows you to build more powerful and user-centric applications by guaranteeing decentralization of the computation.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, wherever multiple institutions have your data and want to collaborate without exposing your data to each other, that’s where our solution can help.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you see as the value of participating in DIF?&nbsp;</p><p>I heard about the hackathon through someone at DIF. I’ve been quite active on DIF’s Slack channel and hope to engage more formally soon.&nbsp;</p><p>I see two opportunities for Silence Labs. One is collaboration with others focused on similar topics, for example through a DIF working group. The other is about driving awareness. There’s little inherent ‘pull’ for privacy from companies, as they believe it’s just about compliance. But multiple surveys show there are business benefits too. For example, one survey showed that banks offering privacy guarantees can provide twenty percent more loans with less overall risk.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year we organized a conference, Decompute, where DIF was one of the partners. The event is happening again this year (in Singapore on 17 September) and we’re also interested in running an event in London. We see this as an opportunity to drive much more engagement from the decentralized identity community, as well as wider awareness beyond it.&nbsp;</p>

 Part 1: Semantic Interoperability  Introduction <p>Imagine you're a data scientist working in a multi-disciplinary team. Your day-to-day involves exchanging complex datasets and intricate models with partners and collaborators globally. However, every exchange feels like a hurdle - inconsistencies, inefficiencies, and a lack of synergy often arise when people need to interpret data. You ask yourself, "Isn't there a more seamless way to ensure that data models carry the same meaning for everyone involved, regardless of the system or platform they're using?"</p><p>"Data semantics"&nbsp;refers to the interpretation and meaning of data, and&nbsp;"semantic interoperability"&nbsp;is the ability of computer systems to exchange data with unambiguous, shared meaning. Semantic interoperability is a common requirement to enable machine computable logic, inferencing, knowledge discovery, and data federation between information systems.</p><p>Achieving genuine semantic interoperability is a central yet challenging goal in the complex data management and exchange landscape. This post explores decentralized semantics, a vital solution aiming to transcend the limitations of traditional methods. As we delve into data semantics, we touch upon Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA), a decentralized metadata framework for defining the semantic composition of digital objects, enabling the creation of interoperable schemas, and facilitating data harmonization. We aim to showcase how decentralized semantic structures enhance data exchange and ensure the transmission of intrinsic meaning and interpretability, paving the way for more robust and meaningful interactions between digital systems and challenging the prevailing notion that semantic alignment between ontologies and knowledge graphs is the solution to semantic interoperability.</p> Data Semantics Demystified <p>Data semantics includes&nbsp;"morphological semantics"&nbsp;[1] and&nbsp;"epistemological semantics"&nbsp;[2]. Imagine morphological semantics as the blueprint of a dataset. It pertains to the textual attributes that outline the concrete structure of data, akin to how architectural plans delineate the formation of physical structures. This branch of semantics deals with the 'objects' - tangible elements like data structures, systemic variables, functions, or methods. Think of it as the compositional elements that give structures shape and functionality.</p><p>In contrast, epistemological semantics focuses on&nbsp;'concepts,'&nbsp;analyzing contextual terms and relationships to build knowledge. It mirrors an abstract idea's cultural or communal interpretation, where traditions and norms provide life and meaning to physical structures.</p><p>Here's a breakdown:</p>  <p>Morphological Semantics: Picture a complex machine. Every gear, lever, and pulley (the&nbsp;"Objects") has a specific role and structure, defined by its physical and functional attributes. Morphological semantics is the study of these tangible elements and their interconnected parts.</p>  <p>Example:&nbsp;In a sentence, words and their arrangements (the&nbsp;'objects') carry specific meanings based on their structure and syntax.</p>  <p>Epistemological Semantics: Imagine the operator's manual explaining how to use the machine effectively or the operational training a worker undergoes.&nbsp;"Concepts"&nbsp;encompass this contextual enhancement, deriving understanding from contextual and subjective knowledge.</p>  <p>Example:&nbsp;In understanding a sentence, the meaning isn't just in the words but in the context, tone, and relationship between those words and the broader conversation or text.<br></p><p>These two intertwining branches constitute data semantics, offering a comprehensive semantic representation of tangible&nbsp;'objects'&nbsp;and intangible&nbsp;'concepts.'</p>

  <p>Data Semantics: Semantics is the branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning, and in the context of data, it encompasses objects and concepts. Data semantics involves creating a systematic plan or arrangement for data and defining how it should be structured and interpreted to achieve specific objectives. It establishes a blueprint for understanding data, ensuring it is used effectively and aligned with the intended goals. Data semantics provides the guiding framework for data, focusing on purposeful representation and how it’s organized.</p> Morphological Semantics Demystified <p>Morphological semantics stands at the forefront of driving semantic interoperability, which is crucial to ensuring seamless and meaningful communication across diverse systems. Unlike its epistemological counterpart, decentralized morphological semantics focuses on&nbsp;'objects,'&nbsp;representing them as layered structures composed of interoperable overlays. This nuanced representation is pivotal, transforming static structures into dynamic schemas that can seamlessly traverse distributed data ecosystems.</p><p>The harmonic interaction between disparate systems in data exchange is not just about transferring data but preserving its innate, objectual meaning. Decentralized semantics facilitates this by encapsulating that meaning within meticulously crafted overlays, each layer adding depth and richness to the semantic structure, ensuring the data's integrity remains unscathed during transfer. Every piece of textual information enhances the interpretability of the object. This process transforms primary data exchange into more profound, more meaningful communication. It aligns with the data's core nature and enables semantic interoperability at scale.</p>

   The Epistemic Shortfall in Achieving Semantic Interoperability <p>In knowledge representation,&nbsp;"epistemic"&nbsp;pertains to knowledge acquisition and understanding. It is derived from the study of epistemology and involves the logic and concepts associated with how knowledge is processed and understood. An&nbsp;"epistemic shortfall"&nbsp;in semantic interoperability indicates a gap where traditional methods fail to represent and share complex knowledge across various computational systems effectively. This shortfall highlights a challenge in preserving the depth and breadth of knowledge when it is exchanged or transferred among diverse platforms.</p><p>Although epistemological semantics does not directly contribute to interoperability in a technical sense, it is essential for ensuring that the data’s meaning is accurately interpreted and utilized. This aspect is crucial in complex domains where data interpretation is as critical as data exchange. Even though uniform nodal relationships enhance clarity for generic comprehension, the inherent nature of knowledge representation does not drive semantic interoperability. While knowledge graphs reveal the connections between related entities, they obscure the data's depth and evolutionary journey.</p><p>While aiding in generic comprehension, pursuing nodal relationships must remain generic within knowledge graphs to ensure uniform comprehension of the subjective concept. OCA enables dynamic semantic interoperability by distinctly separating the relationships of textual elements within a schema. Epistemological semantics enriches context via the intricate relationships delineated in ontologies and knowledge graphs. However, morphological semantics facilitate semantic interoperability through the inherent properties of the objects rather than the abstract concepts that house them.</p> OCA: The Beacon of Interoperability <p>As a scalable architecture, OCA streamlines the creation of each overlay and the sum of their connected parts, ensuring rich and comprehensive object representation. This foundational step enhances object utilization within assigned knowledge graphs. It's not merely about establishing relationships but understanding each nodal entity's genesis, evolution, and contextual relevance. OCA elevates semantic interoperability, making it a stable architecture for those pursuing authentic, meaningful, and robust data integration and interpretation.</p> Conclusion <p>Enhanced Data Interpretation:&nbsp;OCA ensures a richer data interpretation, capturing the detailed nuances often missed by traditional epistemic models.</p><p>OCA, grounded in&nbsp;“Decentralized Semantics,”&nbsp;addresses the limitations of epistemic models that often miss the intricate details of the data they represent. OCA is a robust solution that achieves semantic interoperability by providing a metadata framework for separating structural tasks into task-specific objects that, when combined, provide a digital representation of a complex object while ensuring that those components remain intact during data exchange. </p><p>The integration of OCA at the point of data capture promises a future where data is abundant, meaningful, and context-rich. This enhanced capability is pivotal for the evolution of AI and cross-industry data communication, ensuring that collected data retains its intrinsic value and meaning.</p>





















  
  



 


  <p>That concludes Part 1 of this series. In Part 2, we'll examine the dynamic union of stemmatics and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and their role in bolstering data integrity. We'll see how merging these time-honored methods with cutting-edge technology creates a strong foundation that verifies and preserves the authenticity of data. This innovative approach safeguards the evolutionary aspects of data integrity across digital platforms and enhances true semantic interoperability.</p><p><a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/unraveling-the-path-to-genuine-semantic-interoperability-across-digital-systems-part-2">Link</a> to Genuine Semantic Interoperability across Digital Systems - Part 2: Stemmatic Traceability</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>Ngā mihi o te Tau Hou! And I wish you all a trustful and prosperous one.</p>



<p>Will 2024 move the dial on Digital Trust in Aotearoa? This may seem provocative, but it’s not intended to be. It’s a reasonable question, given our economic and budgetary challenges coupled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cira.ca/uploads/2023/12/2023_A-trust-layer-for-the-internet-is-emerging_-report-%E2%80%93-Continuum_CIRA.pdf">with Canadian evidence of a decrease in internet trust</a>&nbsp;likely reflected globally. This means Aotearoa has to put in a mighty team effort with slim resources to reverse the trend, and in the year that the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2023/0013/latest/LMS459583.html">Digital Identity Trust Framework regulation</a>&nbsp;comes into force and hopefully portable&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WAva_0YUcc">verifiable credentials</a>&nbsp;that form part of it become the norm in our daily digital lives. We will only move the dial if public sector agencies and industry genuinely rally around our shared issues, collectively inform and educate people on why these issues matter. Alongside these efforts, it is important to maintain non-digital channels for those who can’t, don’t feel confident with or choose not to use digital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While I’ve drawn on the above examples, there are other industry sectors with their requisite frameworks, concepts, regulations and codes of practice. They may not be termed ‘Trust Frameworks’ but in most practical senses they are. For instance, consider the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2021/11/Digital-Identity-New-Zealand-AML_CFT-Report_20-October-2020_FINAL.pdf">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a>&nbsp;component of the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations applying to financial institutions and our friends at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/">PaymentsNZ</a>&nbsp;leveraging its API centre to support adoption of open banking. Or consider farm sourced product supply chain provenance promulgated through verifiable credentials issued to a digital farm wallet by our friends at&nbsp;<a href="https://trustalliance.co.nz/">Trust Alliance NZ</a>. These span private and public sectors, industries and across international boundaries. They are ecosystems and networks performing critical purposes that – if the vision for a frictionless, safe, privacy-aware trusted digital future that most want to see – must work seamlessly with each other and be trusted by people, institutions and governments globally.</p>



<p>The fact is our existing centralised and federated digital identity systems with their requisite username/password processes that we started our digital lives with, are increasingly less fit for purpose. They are inconvenient to use, restrict our control over data about us, and provide opportunities for bad actors to steal our data, scam us, take over our accounts and exploit us as ‘products’, causing pain, stress and distrust.</p>



<p>Of the new, portable, reusable, more secure and privacy aware emerging systems, components such as verifiable credentials and&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/#:~:text=Passkeys%20are%20based%20on%20FIDO,in%20or%20account%20recovery%20method.">passkeys</a>&nbsp;that eliminate the use of passwords as DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authsignal.com/">Authsignal</a>&nbsp;has just implemented for DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/cyber-security-account-protection">Air New Zealand</a>, are mature and usable today. DINZ itself has preliminary ideas to introduce its members to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#:~:text=Decentralized%20identifiers%20(DIDs)%20are%20a,the%20controller%20of%20the%20DID.">Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)</a>, a key component of verifiable credentials as explained in&nbsp;<a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE5cxkr?culture=en-us&amp;country=us#:~:text=What%20supports%20the%20Trust%20System's,attested%20information%20about%20a%20subject.">this whitepaper</a>&nbsp;by our&nbsp;member Microsoft. But to use them, digital systems operated by all sectors need to be able to accept and in many cases issue them. Australia’s Steve Wilson, industry commentator and speaker at our 2022 Digital Trust Hui Taumata&nbsp;discusses the digital wallet metaphor and its relationship to the other components&nbsp;<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/holes-in-the-wallet-metaphor/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">here</a>. While humans and enterprises are naturally resistant to change due to fear, uncertainty, doubt, effort, focus and money, Aotearoa has a great record of embracing change. Look how we took to EFTPOS and more recently Apple Pay, Google Pay and our smartphone banking apps. Look how we’ve learned to use<a href="https://www.businessconnect.govt.nz/assets/Business-Connect/pdfs/qr-instructions.pdf">&nbsp;QR codes&nbsp;</a>to access buildings or even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.golf.co.nz/resource-detail/collecting-green-fees-with-qr-codes">collect green fees</a>&nbsp;at golf courses! These ‘new era’ tools can hide technical complexity to deliver the convenient, secure, consented and privacy respecting digital experiences we are entitled to expect when we are asked to confirm that minimal set of ‘identiful’ things needed to know to trust before we transact. It’s not just about you personally and it’s not just one-way trust. It is trusting each others’ devices, organisations and websites as we go about our daily lives.&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/01/18/sponsorship-opportunities-for-a-thriving-future/">Sponsoring aspects of Digital Identity NZ’s mahi</a>&nbsp;will help raise public awareness and knowledge to ultimately deliver tangible products and services in support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, moving the dial on digital trust in 2024 will take more than ‘a coalition of the willing’ while the majority sit back. It will take a concerted, orchestrated effort from the coalition of five million. No person or entity is immune to the potential threats and no-one should be limited in taking the opportunities digitalisation brings.</p>



<p>To make progress, we need to step out of our comfort zone. Organisations should use new tools for their services, and people need to be willing to try them.</p>

<p>Last year we worked with the <a href="https://www.nrc.no/">Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC)</a> and the <a href="https://interoperability.ifrc.org/">DIGID</a> consortium to map risks and threats related to data sharing in humanitarian CVA – part of a broader initiative focused on interoperability and data sharing in the humanitarian sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The results of our research were published near the end of last year – you can download it here:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>This report aims primarily to support decision-makers involved in considering, evaluating or building new technological approaches to data sharing in CVA contexts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is, however, much in there that is relevant (and hopefully useful) to a much wider audience: anyone who handles data in the course of their humanitarian work, in any capacity, should find something in there that widens their understanding of where the data they’re collecting could end up, how it might be shared or used beyond what was originally intended, and how this could affect the recipients of CVA – the data subjects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To this end, the report:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Outlines a broad array of stakeholders, interests, legal considerations and technical and economic factors to take into account when handling data about those receiving assistance.<br> 



 Looks at the types of harms that misuse or leakage of data can lead to for the people receiving humanitarian assistance – sometimes many years down the line.<br> 



 Reports back on insights derived from our conversations with key practitioners in the field, including experts in digital security and responsible data, people with deep knowledge and experience of humanitarian operations, data privacy and legal experts, and others.<br> 
 



 Technical mitigation measures 



<p>Part of this research also involved looking at what potential technological approaches might be able to mitigate the risks involved in collecting, storing and sharing CVA data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this report, we offer an overview and explanation of some of the mitigation technologies that surfaced in the research, and present key questions that should be asked in the context of specific deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are designed to support decision-makers to better understand and determine how much protection that specific technology is likely to be able to provide in a given context – or whether it’s even feasible to deploy in the first place.</p>

<p></p>      State of Web3 in 2024           <p>Insights into the past, present, and future of Web3</p>
          <p>When the term “Web3” was first coined, it symbolized the dawn of a new era: a decentralized, user-owned, privacy-first digital economy. It promised smarter, more seamless communication and business practices, and the unlocking of new revenue streams through trusted data. Now, in 2024, we find that the limitations of the old Web2 paradigm — characterized by data silos, interoperability issues, and escalating trust costs — are more apparent than ever. These challenges underscore the need for a new approach that can cater to our increasingly complex global ecosystem.</p>
 
 <a href="https://ibsintelligence.com/ibsi-news/surge-in-digital-identity-fraud-is-a-major-problem-for-financial-services-research-reveals/">Surge in digital identity fraud is a major problem for financial services, research reveals</a> | IBS Intelligence

   Understanding Web3    
<p>What is Web3? Is it blockchain? Cryptocurrency? The Metaverse? In truth, ‘Web3’ is more or less a blanket term that represents a broad vision, rather than pinpointing a specific technology or application. This vision extends beyond the boundaries of single entities, encompassing entire value chains to foster a unified digital ecosystem. As a result, the use of blockchain or crypto alone is not enough to constitute Web3 in a meaningful sense. At its core, Web3 is about trust and cross-industry interoperability — seamless interconnection and cooperation among diverse systems, organizations, and industries, with trusted identities and verifiable transactions. Web3’s essence lies in the ability to create a decentralized network where data ownership and control are democratized, unlike the centralized structures of traditional blockchain and cryptocurrency systems.</p>
 
       
<p>Central to this evolution is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) standards. These technologies provide the foundation for a standardized method of verifying identities and claims, crucial in establishing digital trust and ensuring seamless interoperability across various enterprise environments. Web3, bolstered by the capabilities of DIDs and VCs, is paving the way for a future where digital interactions are more secure, transparent, and user-driven. Its successful adoption and scaling in the enterprise domain hinge on embracing this shared approach to break down silos and foster a unified digital ecosystem. <a href="https://citopia.global/introduction-to-dids-and-vcs/">Learn more about how DIDs and VCs serve as key enablers for Web3</a></p>

   Solving Challenges in Driving Enterprise Web3 Adoption    
<p>The path to widespread enterprise adoption of Web3 has been slow, with efforts often limited to proofs-of-concept. This hesitance can be attributed to several factors:</p>
 
 Lack of Understanding: For many, the concept of Web3 remains shrouded in confusion, with terms like blockchain, NFT, and cryptocurrency often used, mistakenly, as synonyms for Web3. This conflation not only obscures the true potential of Web3 but also impedes its integration into mainstream applications. 
 Lack of Standardization: Lack of standardization in Web3 leads to a ‘wild west’ scenario, discouraging many companies from attempting implementation. Those who do venture into Web3 face fragmentation, as the use of varied protocols and blockchain platforms essentially results in the same Web2 siloing issues that Web3 aims to address. 
 Scalability Concerns: Challenges with network congestion and transaction throughput have made scalability a critical issue. 
 
 
       MOBI’s Web3 Infrastructure: Trusted Identities and Verifiable Transactions for Cross-Industry Interoperability and Commerce    
<p>MOBI is working alongside our members to build a federated <a href="https://dlt.mobi/web3-infrastructure/">Web3 Infrastructure</a> — <a href="https://citopia.global/">Citopia</a> and the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/">Integrated Trust Network</a> (ITN) — to create a privacy-preserving decentralized marketplace for digital commerce. Leveraging standards from <a href="https://dlt.mobi/standards/">MOBI</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>, <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">ISO</a>, <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a>, <a href="https://www.sae.org/">SAE</a>, and more, Citopia and the ITN together offer standardized communication protocols for cross-industry interoperability. This unified framework serves as a common language, enabling organizations with diverse business processes and legacy systems to efficiently coordinate and communicate without having to build and maintain new infrastructure. Organizations can securely share data and verify claims throughout the entire value chain, overcoming the barriers posed by traditional, centralized Web2 systems.</p>
<p>In our commitment to demonstrating the scalability and effectiveness of this infrastructure, MOBI and its members have conducted several successful pilots, including:</p>
 
 A <a href="https://dlt.mobi/co2tracking/">vehicle emissions monitoring test</a> with the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/index_en">European Commission</a> in 2021. 
 A <a href="https://www.trb.org/IDEAProgram/IDEATransit.aspx">Transit IDEA</a>-funded <a href="https://citopia.global/citopia-maas-final-report-released/">Citopia MaaS pilot</a> in 2022-23. 
 
<p>These pilots have yielded outstanding results, affirming Citopia and the ITN’s capacity to handle large-scale operational demands with robustness and efficiency.</p>
<p>To accelerate Web3 understanding and adoption, MOBI is also providing comprehensive educational courses through MOBI Academy, aimed at demystifying Web3 concepts and their practical applications. <a href="https://dlt.mobi/academy/">Explore MOBI Academy</a></p>
 
       Looking Ahead: 2024 and Beyond    
<p>As we forge ahead into 2024, our focus at MOBI remains steadfast on enhancing Citopia and the ITN for more effective enterprise adoption and scalability. We are actively exploring the transformative potential of this technology across various industry verticals. Collaboration is at the core of our strategy, as we work hand-in-hand with our partners and other consortia — including the <a href="https://www.globalbattery.org/">Global Battery Alliance</a>, <a href="https://catena-x.net/en/">Catena-X</a>, <a href="https://thebatterypass.eu/">Battery Pass</a>, <a href="https://www.nada.org/">NADA</a>, and <a href="https://www.aamva.org/">AAMVA</a> — to address critical pain points and refine our solutions.</p>
<p>In our commitment to fostering a dynamic and collaborative community, next month marks a significant milestone. We are excited to host MoCoTokyo (19 Feb 2024) in partnership with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>. This event will bring together industry leaders and innovators to delve deeper into the initiatives of our Circular Economy and the Global Battery Passport (CE-GBP) Working Group. Additionally, we’re hosting a members-only workshop in Tokyo (20 Feb 2024) in partnership with <a href="https://www.densoautoparts.com/">DENSO</a> to facilitate vital discussions surrounding the Global Battery Passport, including laying out a roadmap for the implementation of a cross-industry Minimum Viable Product. <a href="https://dlt.mobi/moco2024/">Register for MoCoTokyo and our Members-Only Workshop</a></p>

I fell in love with how revolutionary this is, and the possibilities for applications” Harsh Tyagi, HealthXProtocol - Third Place, DIF Main Prize Pool &amp; TBD Prize Pool.</p><p>“This project is inspired by an effort I'm involved in to build a trust framework for the home buying and selling industry in the UK. It aims to make it safe and easy for individuals and organizations to share data during the home buying and selling process”. Edward Curran, TrustBox - Honorable Mention, DIF Main Prize Pool.</p><p>“I’ve been in the automotive space for a while, removing friction for businesses. Otto told me about the hackathon and I deployed my team just a week before submissions closed. I came up with a use case and challenged the team with it, because I wanted them to learn and develop around primitives such as VCs, since we’d like to use them in our own product”. Aaron Wuchner,Titleblox - Third Place, Trinsic Prize Pool.&nbsp;</p><p>“Pop up events at big conferences present a challenging use case. All current solutions are “Prove this at home with your private key, then go”. But if you're at a conference and an event pops up, how do you prove ownership of an NFT? I didn't want our members walking around the conference with the private keys to their NFTs in order to sign a transaction to get in the door. I came to the hackathon specifically to learn Polygon ID and to use its privacy features to disconnect “Am I a member of the DAO?” from “What's my crypto wallet address” and my potential crypto net worth at a public event.

Originally created with Cameo, an app that lets people purchase personalized video messages from celebrities, the clip featured Wood sharing words of encouragement with someone named Vladimir who was struggling with substance abuse. “I hope you get the help that you need,” the actor said.</p><p>Soon after, it emerged that the heavily edited video was part of a Russian<a href="https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/actors-recorded-videos-for-vladimir-it-turned-into-russian-propaganda/efe045b0-79c6-43bd-afb6-cc9a0f497fac"> disinformation campaign</a> that sought to insinuate that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had a drug and alcohol problem. At least six other celebrities, including boxer Mike Tyson and Scrubs actor John McGinley, unwittingly became part of the scheme. Despite clumsy editing, the videos were shared widely on social platforms.</p>

  <p>Now, imagine if the level of effort required to create these videos dropped to zero. Instead of commissioning content on Cameo, one could choose a celebrity or obtain enough video content of an individual and use AI to make them say or do anything.</p><p>This challenge is intensifying with the spread of AI-enabled audio and voice cloning technology that can produce convincing deepfakes. Governments have started taking steps to protect the public; for example, the US Federal Trade Commission issued a<a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2023/03/scammers-use-ai-enhance-their-family-emergency-schemes"> consumer warning</a> about scams enabled by voice cloning and<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/businessguidanceblog/2023/11/FTCannounceschallengetopreventtheharmsofAIenabledvoicecloning"> announced a prize</a> for a solution to address the threat. Both the Biden administration and the European Union have called for clear labeling of AI-generated content.&nbsp;</p><p>These scams and non-consensual imagery, which range from fake product endorsements to geopolitical campaigns, are<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/deepfake-porn-is-out-of-control/"> increasingly targeting people</a> who aren’t famous singers or politicians.</p><p>A commitment to verifiable AI-generated audio</p><p>Dmytro Bielievstov knows that top-down regulation isn’t enough. In 2017, along with Alex Serdiuk and Grant Reaber, the Ukraine-based software engineer co-founded<a href="https://www.respeecher.com?utm_campaign=PR&amp;utm_medium=blogarticle&amp;utm_source=contentauthenticityorg"> Respeecher</a>, a tool that allows anyone to speak in another person's voice using AI. “If someone uses our platform to pretend to be someone they are not, such as a fake news channel with synthetic characters, it might be challenging for the audience to catch that because of how realistic our synthetic voices are,” he said.</p><p>Keenly aware of the potential for misuse, the Respeecher team has embraced the use of<a href="https://contentcredentials.org/"> Content Credentials</a> through the Content Authenticity Initiative’s (CAI)<a href="https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/"> open-source tools</a>. Content Credentials are based on the C2PA open standard to verify the source and history of digital content. With an estimated 4 billion people around the world heading to the polls in over 50 elections this year, there’s an urgent need to ensure clarity about the origins and history of the visual stories and media we experience online. And there’s<a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/cai-symposium-2023"> momentum for C2PA adoption</a> across industries and disciplines.</p><p>We recently spoke with Dmytro about how Respeecher implemented Content Credentials, his tips for getting started, and why provenance is critical for building trust into the digital ecosystem.</p><p>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>How would you describe Respeecher?</p><p>Respeecher lets one person perform in the voice of another. At the heart of our product is a collection of high-quality voice conversion algorithms. We don't use text as input; instead, we utilize speech. This enables individuals to not just speak but also perform with various vocal styles, including nonverbal and emotional expressions. For example, we enable actors to embody different vocal masks, similar to how they can put on makeup.&nbsp;</p><p>Who are you looking to reach with the Voice Marketplace?</p><p>Initially, our focus was on the film and TV industry. We’ve applied our technology in big studio projects, such as Lucasfilm’s limited series “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” where we synthesized James Earl Jones’ voice for Darth Vader.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, we’re launching our Voice Marketplace, which democratizes the technology we’ve used in Hollywood for everyone. The platform allows individuals to speak using any voice from our library. This will enable small creators to develop games, streams, and other content, including amateur productions. While we’ll maintain oversight of content moderation and voice ownership, we’ll now have less control over the content’s destination and usage.&nbsp;</p><p>What motivated you to join the Content Authenticity Initiative?</p><p>First, the CAI aids in preventing misinformation. We do not allow user-defined voices (say President Biden’s), as controlling that would be quite difficult. Still, users should know that the content they’re consuming involves synthetic speech. As a leader in this space, we want to ensure that all generated content from our marketplace has Content Credentials. In the future, as all browsers and content distribution platforms support data provenance, it will be easy for consumers to verify how the audio in a video was produced. If something lacks cryptographic Content Credentials, it will automatically raise suspicion about authenticity.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, the initiative addresses the needs of content creators. By embedding credentials in the audio they produce, they can make it clear that the work is their own artistic creation.&nbsp;</p><p>How do Content Credentials work in Respeecher?</p><p>We have integrated CAI's open-source C2PA tool into our marketplace. Whenever synthetic audio is rendered on our servers, it is automatically cryptographically signed as being a product of the Respeecher marketplace. When clients download the audio, it contains metadata with Content Credentials stating that it was converted into a different voice by Respeecher. GlobalSign, our third-party certificate authority, signs our credentials with its cryptographic key so that anyone who receives our content can automatically verify that it was signed by us and not an impersonator.</p><p>The metadata isn't a watermark but rather a side component of the file. If the metadata is removed, consumers are alerted that the file's source is uncertain. If the file is modified after it’s downloaded (say someone changes the name of the target voice), the cryptographic signature won't match the file's contents. So it’s impossible to manipulate the metadata without invalidating Respeecher’s signature.&nbsp;</p>





















  
  



<p>All voice cloned audio files downloaded from Respeecher Marketplace includes Content Credentials for AI transparency. </p>


  <p>What challenges did you encounter while implementing Content Credentials technology?</p><p>Surprisingly, the biggest challenge was obtaining keys from our certificate authority. We had to prove that we were a legitimate organization, which took several weeks and some back and forth with GlobalSign.</p><p>Another challenge was that cryptography, particularly public key infrastructure (PKI), can be challenging to grasp for someone who isn’t an expert. Our team had to understand the specifics of C2PA, figure out appropriate configurations, and determine whether we needed a third-party certificate authority. These nuances required time and effort, especially since we don’t have a cryptographic expert on our team. However, the CAI team and community were incredibly helpful in assisting us with these challenges.</p><p>What advice do you have for other developers getting started with Content Credentials and the CAI’s open-source tools?</p><p>Start with <a href="https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/introduction">CAI’s Getting Started guide</a>, but then dedicate time to read the <a href="https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/index.html#_technical_specifications">C2PA specification document</a>. Although it is somewhat long and intimidating, it’s surprisingly comprehensible for non-experts.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, utilize ChatGPT to help explain complex concepts to you. Even though ChatGPT doesn’t know the technical details of C2PA (because its current version has limited access to information beyond certain dates), it still does a great job explaining concepts such as PKI and cryptographic signatures.</p><p>What's next for you when it comes to advances in AI safety and Content Credentials?</p><p>We’re planning to give users of our marketplace the option to add their own authorship credentials to the Content Credentials. Currently, the metadata indicates that the audio was modified by Respeecher, but it doesn't attribute the audio to its creator. Some users may prefer to remain anonymous, but others will choose to include their credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>Respeecher will continue to be at the forefront of initiatives to adopt data provenance standards across the AI synthetic media industry. It’s essential for companies to create a unified authentication layer for audio and video content, and content distribution platforms like YouTube and news websites have a crucial role to play in embracing this technology. Just as a lack of HTTPS warns users of potential security issues, a similar mechanism could alert users to the source of an audio file, enhancing transparency and authenticity.</p><p>We are also closely watching how the concept of cloud-hosted metadata develops. Embedding hard-to-remove watermarks in audio and video signals without making them obvious remains a largely unsolved problem. By storing metadata in the cloud and enabling checks for pre-signed content, we can potentially simplify authentication and the synthetic media detection problem.</p>

<p>Todo esto, sumado a las próximas elecciones de 2024, resulta en un contexto cada vez más desafiante. Esto ha impulsado a nuestro equipo a iniciar un <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/novo-projeto-ecossistema-de-informacao-mais-saudavel-america-latina/">proyecto con el objetivo de contribuir a un ecosistema de información sano y robusto</a> en América Latina y el Caribe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Como parte del proyecto, hemos estado conversando con representantes de organizaciones, activistas, conectores, comunicadores sociales, y periodistas sobre los desafíos que estamos enfrentando en el ecosistema de la información y las oportunidades que hemos identificado para la acción (te invitamos a leer sobre algunas de estas conversaciones <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/a-slow-burning-process-to-improve-the-information-ecosystem-we-need-to-rebuild-trust-and-focus-on-local-community-driven-initiatives/">aquí</a> y <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/community-diagnosis-protecting-the-health-of-the-latin-american-information-ecosystems/">aquí</a>). También estamos ofreciendo apoyo gratuito en las áreas de tecnología y datos a personas o grupos que trabajan por la justicia social en América Latina y/o el Caribe, especialmente quienes:</p>



 
 defienden el derecho a la información de sus comunidades (o de otros grupos que no tienen acceso a la información que necesitan), trabajan para llenar lagunas informativas en sus contextos, ayudan a las personas a acceder a información crucial sobre sus derechos o trabajan para difundir información de calidad sobre temas que suelen ser objeto de campañas de desinformación. 



 trabajan para construir ecosistemas informativos más saludables y robustos, ya sea a través de proyectos de educación mediática, dirigiendo pequeños medios de comunicación, trabajando en el periodismo local o la comunicación popular, organizando iniciativas informativas impulsadas por la comunidad o difundiendo información crítica a sus comunidades; 



 vigilan o investigan cómo afecta a sus comunidades el desorden informativo y/o encuentran formas creativas de fortalecer el ecosistema informativo local. 
 



<p>Bajo esta iniciativa, nuestro apoyo está abierto a comunicadores, organizaciones de la sociedad civil, líderes comunitarios y activistas que trabajan en una variedad de temas, incluyendo justicia de género, salud y derechos sexuales y reproductivos, justicia racial y antirracismo, justicia climática y medioambiental, derechos de los indígenas, derechos de las personas con discapacidad, justicia económica, derechos humanos y más.&nbsp;</p>

 Conoce más sobre nuestro trabajo 



<p>The Engine Room es una organización sin ánimo de lucro que cuenta con un equipo global de personas con experiencia en activismo, investigación y tecnología (algunas de los cuales trabajan en América Latina o tienen una gran experiencia en este continente).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nos asociamos con grupos cuyo trabajo desafía los desequilibrios de poder, las injusticias y los abusos de derechos y los apoyamos en el uso de la tecnología y los datos de manera que respondan a sus necesidades, políticas y principios. Desde 2011, nuestro <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/people/">equipo</a> ha trabajado con más de 700 organizaciones de todos los tamaños y de diferentes rincones del mundo para fortalecer sus estrategias de tecnología y datos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Como parte de este proyecto, estamos ofreciendo dos tipos de asociación de apoyo gratuito: Apoyo Ligero (<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">LiTS</a>) y Apoyo Intensivo (<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/">Matchbox</a>). Adaptamos nuestro apoyo a las necesidades de cada organización asociada, y nuestro trabajo puede incluir cosas como:</p>



 
 Fortalecimiento de la intuición técnica: Podemos trabajar con tu equipo para fortalecer la intuición técnica, la capacidad de navegar por los matices del trabajo con tecnología y la capacidad de equilibrar las oportunidades y los retos que plantea la tecnología.<br> 



 Diseño y ejecución de proyectos: Podemos apoyarte en el diseño de proyectos realistas, sostenibles y con impacto para abordar retos complejos en tu contexto, incorporando al mismo tiempo datos y tecnología a tu trabajo.<br> 



 Fortalecimiento de redes y conexión con otras organizaciones de forma segura: En nuestras conversaciones con defensores y activistas, se destacó como prioridad la necesidad de crear más alianzas y colaboración entre personas y organizaciones que trabajan para reforzar el ecosistema de la información. Podemos trabajar juntos para ayudar a tu organización a encontrar las mejores herramientas para conectar con otros activistas y organizadores.<br> 



 Datos responsables: Si en tu contexto faltan datos o información digital que serían cruciales para tu trabajo y las personas con las que trabajas, podemos apoyarte en la creación de un plan para la recopilación y gestión responsable de estos datos. También podemos colaborar contigo en el establecimiento de un proceso responsable y simplificado de conservación, archivo y eliminación de los datos que utilizas en tu trabajo diario.<br> 



 Cuidado digital y resiliencia: Podemos trabajar juntos para apoyar la capacidad de tu organización para protegerse de las amenazas a la seguridad digital (y responder a ellas), garantizar el bienestar de tu equipo y adoptar infraestructuras que respondan a tus necesidades y contexto.<br> 



 Documentar el trabajo y crear un archivo digital: Podemos colaborar con tu organización en el establecimiento de procesos tecnológicos y de información para documentar digitalmente el trabajo.

<p>A sociedade civil enfrenta desafios significativos nos ecossistemas de informação na América Latina e no Caribe: várias comunidades ainda lutam para <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fighting-misinformation-and-defending-free-expression-during-COVID-19-recommendations-for-states-1.pdf">exercer seu direito à informação</a>; a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-research-community-call-intersectional-approaches-to-data-and-digital-rights-advocacy/">desigualdade no acesso à Internet confiável e às tecnologias digitais</a> continua afetando muitas pessoas, especialmente em áreas rurais e territórios florestais; a <a href="https://latamjournalismreview.org/articles/new-map-sheds-light-on-the-state-of-disinformation-legislation-in-latin-america-and-beyond/">desinformação tem se tornado frequente</a>; e atores anti-direitos têm usado as tecnologias de informação para <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/for-rights-defenders-cyber-is-the-new-battleground/">atacar e minar o trabalho de ativistas</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tudo isso, combinado com as próximas eleições em 2024, resulta em um contexto cada vez mais desafiador, o que impulsionou nossa equipe a iniciar um <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/novo-projeto-ecossistema-de-informacao-mais-saudavel-america-latina/">projeto com o objetivo de contribuir para um ecossistema de informações saudável e robusto</a> na América Latina e no Caribe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Como parte do projeto, temos conversado com representantes de organizações, ativistas e jornalistas sobre os desafios que estamos enfrentando no ecossistema de informações e as oportunidades que identificamos para ação (você pode ler como foram algumas dessas conversas aqui e aqui). Também estamos oferecendo apoio gratuito nas áreas de tecnologia e dados a pessoas ou grupos que estejam trabalhando pela justiça social na América Latina e/ou no Caribe, especialmente aqueles que:</p>



 
 defendem o direito à informação para suas comunidades (ou para outros grupos que talvez não tenham acesso às informações de que precisam), trabalham para preencher lacunas de informação em seus contextos, ajudam as pessoas a acessar informações cruciais sobre seus direitos ou trabalham para disseminar informações de qualidade sobre tópicos que geralmente são alvo de campanhas de desinformação. 



 trabalham para construir ecossistemas de informação mais saudáveis e robustos, seja por meio de projetos de educação para a mídia, administrando pequenos veículos de notícias e mídia, trabalhando no jornalismo local ou em comunicação popular, organizando iniciativas de informação voltadas para a comunidade ou disseminando informações críticas para suas comunidades; 



 estão monitorando ou pesquisando como suas comunidades são afetadas pela desordem informacional e/ou descobrindo maneiras criativas de fortalecer o ecossistema de informações local. 
 



<p>Com isso em mente, nosso apoio está aberto a comunicadores, organizações da sociedade civil, líderes comunitários e ativistas que trabalham com uma variedade de questões, incluindo justiça de gênero, saúde e direitos sexuais e reprodutivos, justiça racial e antirracismo, justiça climática e ambiental, direitos indígenas, direitos das pessoas com deficiência, justiça econômica, direitos humanos e muito mais.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Se você faz parte de uma organização de justiça social que trabalha na região e gostaria de receber nosso apoio para usar tecnologia e dados, adoraríamos colaborar com você! Clique no botão abaixo para agendar uma chamada introdutória com nossa equipe.</p>

 Conheça mais sobre nosso trabalho 



<p>The Engine Room é uma organização sem fins lucrativos com uma equipe global de pessoas que são ativistas, pesquisadoras, e tecnologistas experientes (incluindo algumas que estão na América Latina ou têm experiência significativa de trabalho na América Latina).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fazemos parcerias com grupos cujo trabalho desafia desequilíbrios de poder, injustiças e abusos de direitos e os apoiamos no uso de tecnologia e dados de forma a atender às suas necessidades, políticas e princípios. Desde 2011, nossa <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/people/">equipe</a> já trabalhou com mais de 700 organizações de todos os tamanhos, de diferentes cantos do mundo, para fortalecer suas estratégias de tecnologia e dados.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Como parte desse projeto, estamos oferecendo dois tipos de parceria de apoio gratuito: Apoio Leve (<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">LiTS</a>) e Apoio Intensivo (<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/">Matchbox</a>). Personalizamos nosso apoio para atender às necessidades de cada organização parceira, e nosso trabalho pode incluir coisas como:</p>



 
 Fortalecimento da intuição técnica: Podemos trabalhar com a sua equipe para fortalecer a intuição técnica, aptidão para navegar pelas nuances do trabalho com tecnologia e a capacidade de equilibrar as oportunidades e os desafios trazidos pela tecnologia.<br> 



 Elaboração e implementação de projetos: Podemos te apoiar com a elaboração de projetos realistas, sustentáveis e impactantes para enfrentar desafios complexos em seu contexto e, ao mesmo tempo, incorporar dados e tecnologia ao seu trabalho.<br> 



 Fortalecimento de redes conexão com outras organizações de forma segura: Em nossas conversas com defensores e ativistas, a necessidade de criar mais alianças e colaboração entre pessoas e organizações que trabalham para fortalecer o ecossistema de informação foi destacada como uma prioridade. Podemos trabalhar juntas para ajudar a sua organização a encontrar as melhores ferramentas para se conectar com outros ativistas e organizadores.<br> 



 Dados responsáveis: Se no seu contexto, faltam dados que seriam cruciais para o seu trabalho e para as pessoas com quem você trabalha, podemos apoiá-la na criação de um plano para a coleta e gestão responsável destes dados! Também podemos trabalhar juntas para estabelecer um processo responsável e simplificado de retenção, arquivamento e exclusão de dados que você usa no seu dia-a-dia.<br> 



 Cuidados digitais e resiliência: Podemos trabalhar juntas para apoiar a capacidade da sua organização de se proteger de (e responder a) ameaças de segurança digital, garantir o bem-estar de sua equipe e adotar infraestruturas que respondam às suas necessidades e ao seu contexto.<br> 



 Documentando seu trabalho e criando seu arquivo digital: Podemos apoiar sua organização na criação de processos de tecnologia/dados para documentar digitalmente seu trabalho. 
 



<p>Se tem interesse em saber mais sobre como podemos apoiar o seu trabalho, você pode agendar uma chamada introdutória com a nossa equipe, onde compartilharemos informações sobre como trabalhamos e exploraremos juntos as possibilidades de colaboração.

<p>Civil society faces significant challenges in information ecosystems in Latin America and the Caribbean: various communities still struggle with <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fighting-misinformation-and-defending-free-expression-during-COVID-19-recommendations-for-states-1.pdf">exercising their right to information</a>; <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-research-community-call-intersectional-approaches-to-data-and-digital-rights-advocacy/">inequity in access to reliable internet and digital technologies</a> has continued to affect many, especially in rural areas and forest territories; <a href="https://latamjournalismreview.org/articles/new-map-sheds-light-on-the-state-of-disinformation-legislation-in-latin-america-and-beyond/">dis- and misinformation have become common</a>; and anti-rights actors have been using information technologies to <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/for-rights-defenders-cyber-is-the-new-battleground/">attack and undermine the work of activists</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this combined with upcoming elections in 2024 result in an increasingly challenging context, which has propelled our team to start a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-working-towards-a-healthier-and-more-robust-information-ecosystem-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/">project aimed at contributing to a healthy and robust information ecosystem</a> in Latin America and the Caribbean.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the project, we have been talking to organisers, activists and journalists about the challenges we’re facing in the information ecosystem and opportunities we identify for action (you can read how some of those conversations went <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/a-slow-burning-process-to-improve-the-information-ecosystem-we-need-to-rebuild-trust-and-focus-on-local-community-driven-initiatives/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/community-diagnosis-protecting-the-health-of-the-latin-american-information-ecosystems/">here</a>). We are also offering free tech and data support to individuals or groups who are working for social justice in Latin America and/or the Caribbean, especially those who:</p>



 
 advocate for access to information for their community (or for other groups that might not have access to the information they need), work to fill information gaps in their community, help people access crucial information about their rights, or work to spread quality information on topics that are often targeted by disinformation campaigns. 



 work to build healthier and more robust information ecosystems, whether it’s through media education projects, running small news and media outlets, working on local journalism or alternative media, organising community-driven information initiatives, or disseminating critical information to their communities; 



 are monitoring or researching how their community is impacted by info disorder, and/or&nbsp; and figuring out creative ways to strengthen our information ecosystem.&nbsp; 
 



<p>With the above in mind, our support is open to communicators, civil society organisations, community organisers and activists working on a variety of issues, including gender justice, sexual and reproductive health and rights, racial justice and anti-racism, climate and environmental justice, indigenous rights, disability rights, economic justice, human rights and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first in-depth security analysis of OpenID for Verifiable Credentials has been completed, with the goal of increasing confidence in the security of these specifications. The formal security analysis includes the protocols OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI) and OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP), both part of the <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials family</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.18419/opus-13772">formal security analysis</a> uses the Web Infrastructure Model (WIM), a detailed formal model of the web, which has been developed by the University of Stuttgart and used to complete formal analysis of other protocols including the OpenID Foundation standards OpenID Connect, FAPI 1.0 and FAPI 2.0, and the foundational IETF standard OAuth 2.0 (RFC6749). In this instance, the WIM is used to model the interaction of OID4VCI and OID4VP in an ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This work has been carried out as part of a master’s thesis at University of Stuttgart co-supervised by Verimi GmbH. The goal of the thesis was to prove that both protocols are secure with respect to the definition of security under certain assumptions and modeling decisions. The security definition used in the analysis covers several important properties around credential issuance and presentation; in particular, that an attacker must not be able to impersonate an honest user, initiate a login flow on a user’s device, or force a user to be logged in under an attacker-chosen identity.</p>
<p>For cases where certain preconditions are not met, the analysis revealed some potential attacks. In particular, the pre-authorized code flow in OID4VCI and the cross-device flow in OID4VP may be vulnerable to phishing attacks and require user attention to be secure. These attacks are not surprising, as cross-device flow vulnerabilities are a well-known class of attacks, affecting <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-cross-device-security-04.html">most cross-device protocols</a>. However, the analysis also confirmed the security of the same-device flows of OpenID for Verifiable Credentials. The OpenID Foundation’s Decentralized Credentials Protocols WG has taken the feedback from this master’s thesis into account in the current versions of the specifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to the analysis, a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.18419/opus-13772">master’s thesis</a>, for details on the assumptions, modeling decisions, security properties, and the formal mathematical proof.</p>
<p>Our thanks to Fabian Hauck for his master’s thesis, conducted under the supervision of Dr. Daniel Fett and Pedram Hosseyni M.Sc with Prof. Ralf Küsters as the Examiner at the Institute of Information Security, University of Stuttgart. The thesis was generously supported by Verimi GmbH through the IDunion project. Please note that this analysis is preliminary and has not yet been peer-reviewed. Additionally, it may not reflect recent changes in the current specifications as the analysis is based on the May 2023 versions of OpenID for Verifiable Presentations and OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance.</p>
 <br>OpenID Foundation 
<p>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate. </p>

<p>Welcome to Blockchain Commons’ yearly report on our status and projects.</p>



 What is Blockchain Commons? 

<p>We’ve revisited <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision/">Our Vision</a> in past annual reports for Blockchain Commons, but this year we have a great overview of Blockchain Commons that we want to share. It was penned by Simon Ratner, one of our long-time patrons at Proxy, and now Head of Engineering at ŌURA. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Blockchain Commons isn’t a traditional industry association that only organizes, where all the work is contributed by the member companies. They’re producing their own architectures and reference libraries and sample applications. So in a way they are co-developing their standards, remaining independent while working among industry companies.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“They provide specifications that actually exist and have been tested and vetted. This is especially important for a startup, since we’re benefiting the most from having standardized and interoperable work, as well as from having access to work of an additional engineering team.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’re appreciative of Simon for his recommendation, but also for his clear statement of what Blockchain Commons is and what we do. Blockchain Commons develops specifications that create interoperability. Doing so does indeed give smaller companies a leg up. While working with those companies, we’re also offering our own expertise. We’re doing so to benefit users and companies alike by creating a shared infrastructure that embeds our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">Gordian Principles</a> of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness.</p>

 Our Standardizations 

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsFF5HPKQIk">
  
</a></p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has been working on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research?tab=readme-ov-file#contents">specifications</a> for years. Our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/animated-qrs/">Animated QRs</a>, which are built on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/">URs</a>, were our first specification to receive strong uptake in the digital-asset wallet community. We released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsFF5HPKQIk">a video</a> this year to memorialize that. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a> data format has been one of our major initiates over the last year and a half or so.</p>

<p>But specifications are just the first step. We  ultimately need to work with standards bodies to ensure that our specifications are reliable and accessible in the long-term. In 2023, our specifications reached a sufficient level of maturity that we were able to begin that work.</p>

<p>Much of out new push for standardization focused on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/dcbor/">dCBOR</a>, or deterministic CBOR. This is a variant of the CBOR data format that allows for consistent representation of data, something that is vital for a variety of use cases including our own Envelope. We’ve just published <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/">v07</a> of the spec, with CBOR expert <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/person/cabo@tzi.org">Carsten Bormann</a> now on board as a co-author, so we’re quite hopeful this will become an actual standard soon.</p>

<p>We’ve also been working on an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-envelope/">Envelope standard for the IETF</a>. We hope that there is interest in the format, but ultimately we’ll be happy if we can get the larger community focused on hash-based elision as a privacy measure, whether that’s with Envelope or not.</p>

<p>Our Envelope standardization work also expanded to IANA, who registers <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml">CBOR tags</a>. Envelope is now registered with tag #200, allowing its widespread recognition whether it becomes an IETF standard or not. Other tags, which are used for <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/">URs</a>, are also officially registered in the #40000+ range.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a great year for this new step forward in our specification work. It gives us strong faith that as we finalize the development of specifications with our community, we can move them into standards for use by the larger ecosystem.</p>

 Our Community 

<p><a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/"></a></p>

<p>Work with the IETF helped Blockchain Commons to dramatically expand its community in 2023 through our meetings with that standards body. However, the Gordian Development community of wallet designers, chip manufacturers, and others continues to be our core constituency. As Simon wrote, part of Blockchain Commons’ mission is to act as an industry group that turns the needs of our patrons and partners into reality. That work is done with the Gordian community.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons held a full dozen meetings with community members in 2023, including eight regular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCkrqxOY1Fbp-P1Yv-7gmu75i2QS2Z6vk">Gordian Developer meetings</a>, one meeting focused on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HTuYL9-4T0">signing with Bitcoin keys</a>, two <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salons/">Silicon Salons</a>, and one <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/">FROST Round Table</a>. We’re very appreciative of everyone who took the time to join us, and we’ve taken some real pointers from the community this year, resulting in the publication of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-010-output-descriptor.md">Gordian output descriptor v3</a> and a new system for detailing <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/research/?tab=readme-ov-file#status">the status of our specifications</a>.</p>

<p>We expect community members to benefit from our meetings too. Most recently, we heard of a tape-out, where the design of a circuit is sent to a manufacturing facility, following the work at our Silicon Salons where we brought together hardware-wallet manufacturers with semiconductor manufacturers interested in supporting them.</p>

 Our Depository 

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uW6xlT4hTk"></a></p>

<p>Standards such as Envelope and dCBOR focus on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">openness</a>, but Blockchain Commons’ attention to resilience is at least as important. Openness ensures that a user will be able to control their digital assets through the interoperable tools of a variety of developers, while resilience helps them to be safe while doing so.</p>

<p>Since late 2022, our major resilience project has been <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/csr/">Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR)</a>. It attacks one of the biggest problems with independent control of your digital assets: it’s too easy to lose your keys (and the seeds they’re constructed from). Shamir’s Secret Sharing, which is part of our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">security-reviewed SSKR library</a>, offers one solution: you shard a secret and then only need to recover some of those shares to reconstruct your seed. But, the shares can be subject to loss just like the seed itself!</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/csr/">CSR</a>. It envisions a variety of automated ways to recover shares from remote servers using diverse authentication systems to maximize security. Throughout 2023, Blockchain Commons advanced <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Envelope</a> as a methodology for storing not just seeds, but the metadata critical for fully restoring both a seed and its assets. Toward the end of the year we also released our first version of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-depo-rust">Gordian Depository</a>, a CSR server that can remotely store those Envelopes (or other data).</p>

<p>The next step is for Blockchain Commons to publicly deploy its Depository, which we hope will be the first of a network of share servers, provided by a variety of organizations. We hope these organizations will include not just traditional Bitcoin wallet companies, but also organizations such as modern-art museums, who have a mission to not only display but also preserve artwork — and for NFTs that means protecting Ethereum and Tezos keys. A varied and diverse ecosystem like this will give users real choices for whom they want to store their seed shares with.</p>

<p>We hope to see this ecosystem development over the course of 2024, but the strong foundation is now there.</p>

 FROST is Coming 

<p>Though we mainly focus on the big picture in our annual report, we wanted to mention our increasing focus on FROST, a quorum signature system that uses Schnorr. We’ve been watching Schnorr signatures for a long time and think they’re both important and powerful because of abilities such as threshold, blind, and adapter signatures, as Christopher wrote in <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Schnorr-Intro/">“A Layperson’s Intro to Schnorr”</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">FROST</a>  became a lot more accessible in 2023 thanks to the Zcash Foundation’s release of <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/">ZF FROST</a>. We hosted a first <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/">round table</a> to give FROST implementers the chance to talk with each other about their work and expect to continue supporting this exciting new technology in the year ahead.</p>

 Our Websites 

<p></p>

<p>Of course, no specification, standard, or other work is worthwhile unless people can access it. As a result, Blockchain Commons put real work in 2023 into expanding our presence on the web.</p>

<p>Most importantly, we launched a new <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/">Developer Website</a> that collects together all of our tutorials, test vectors, and other info for developers, demonstrating how to implement URs, SSKR, and the rest. (Links throughout this yearly report connect back to developer pages.)</p>

<p>We also created a new <a href="https://advocacy.blockchaincommons.com/">Advocacy Website</a>, which focuses primarily on our support for (or criticism of)  upcoming digital-asset laws. This remains an important topic: most recently, we talked about <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/eidas/">the dangers of EIDAS in Europe</a> and looked back at <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/echoes-history/">the tragedies created by overidentification in the past</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve also updated our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/">Main Website</a> and our <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">SmartCustody Website</a> to fit the same format as our new sites and link them all into a cohesive whole.</p>

<p>Related, Christopher updated his own <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/">Life with Alacrity</a> blog pages, which offer many of his thoughts on collaboration and identity going back two decades. His new <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/tags/#musings-of-a-trust-architect">Musings of a Trust Architect</a> articles appear there as well (but also on the <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/posts/">Blockchain Commons blog</a>).</p>

<p>We of course continue to do much of our work in GitHub, which is the internet home of our library and apps — as well as our actual specifications, in the form of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/README.md">Research Papers repo</a>. We reorganized things there as well, with a new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/README.md#status">“Research Status”</a> system that reveals the adoption level and thus stability of each of our specifications.</p>

 Looking Forward 

<p>The Blockchain Commons <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision/">mission statement</a> highlights four objectives: creating a Commons, Architecture, and Demand and establishing relationships with Peers. We expect to continue to work on all of these objectives in 2024.</p>

<p>A lot of our work is part of creating a Commons. We’re thrilled to constantly add reference libraries and apps to the Commons, including <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Gordian Seed Tool</a>, which should see a 1.6 release early in 2024. We think that our new advocacy toward <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Open-Development/">Open Development</a> will be an important next step in creating this Commons; we expect to discuss that more widely in the coming year.</p>

<p>We talked about our Architecture underpinnings much more in 2023 with Christopher’s <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/">Musings of a Trust Architect articles</a>. We expect more of that in 2024, with the topics of edge identifiers and cliques currently in our queue for both discussion and experimentation. However, we’re also working on the opposite side of the spectrum, which involves making our architectural ideas into standardized reality. We’ll be continuing to work with IETF, with plans to release a Problem Statement on the needs for hash-based elision for data storage, and we’re also planning to move some of our specifications to BIPs, beginning with our animated QR work.</p>

<p>We also expect to further investigate the usage of NFCs in a secure digital-asset architecture. This will include an examination of commodity NFC smartcards with the intent of creating references and best practices for securing a variety of data, from seeds and share to backed-up keys for developers. This is of a piece with our work on Depo servers: the ultimate goal is to give users a choice as to how their store their digital-asset seeds &amp; keys.</p>

<p>Some of architectural work ties directly to our work on Demands. We want to increase the call for privacy-first solutions to better support human rights, protect against coercion, and generally allow people to decide what information they release to the world. Demonstrating the need for hash-based elision is one way to do so.</p>

<p>Finally, we will continue to support our Peers, especially through <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/blob/master/meetings/README.md#detailed-list-of-meeting-summaries-with-archives-of-video-mp3-and-transcripts">meetings</a>. Besides our regular Gordian meetings, we also hope to organize special-purpose events for emerging hot topics. This may include more <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/">FROST round tables</a>, additional <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salons</a>, or others as needs arise within the digital-asset space.</p>

<p>However, we need your help to ensure this future. The financial climate for web3 work became very poor in 2023 due to investments drying up for the whole sector. This has resulted in some of our long-term patrons being forced to step back or even merge their businesses, which has impacted their patronage. If your company benefits from our work, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a> to ensure it continues. We are particularly looking for companies able to become sponsors at the $1,000 a month or better level. Please contact <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">Christopher Allen</a> to learn more of the benefits of doing so.</p>

<p>Value to Canadians:</p>



<p>The purpose of the PCTF&nbsp;Authentication&nbsp;Component is to assure the on-going integrity of&nbsp;login&nbsp;and&nbsp;authentication&nbsp;processes by certifying, through a process of assessment, that they comply with standardized Conformance Criteria. The Conformance Criteria for this component may be used to provide assurances:</p>



<p>          ·&nbsp;&nbsp;That Trusted Processes result in the representation of a unique Subject at a Level of Assurance that it is the same Subject with each successful&nbsp;login&nbsp;to an&nbsp;Authentication&nbsp;Service Provider.</p>



<p>          ·&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the predictability and continuity in the&nbsp;login&nbsp;processes that they offer or on which they depend.</p>



<p>All participants will benefit from:</p>



<p>          ·&nbsp;&nbsp;Login&nbsp;and&nbsp;authentication&nbsp;processes that are repeatable and consistent (whether they offer these processes, depend on them, or both).</p>



<p>          ·&nbsp;&nbsp;Assurance that identified Users can engage in authorized interactions with remote systems.</p>



<p>Relying Parties benefit from:</p>



<p>          ·&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to build on the assurance that&nbsp;Authentication&nbsp;Trusted Processes uniquely identify, at an acceptable level of risk, a Subject in their application or program space.</p>



<p>Context:</p>



<p>The purpose of this review is to ensure transparency in the development and diversity of a truly Pan-Canadian, and international, input. In alignment with our&nbsp;<a href="https://diacc-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2fYrPnp6IfEBHfPEuSPoUi0VbjWCBPLg-rbAvg3CuA7DL8oYSjQHGTwDiBHNn9XMsZMXkOA9rQLiJ_dtRZH_XcXjF0HC9KOgR9wElFiHxDXpfifauYL0JEnmIZFfOvYZ-fnj2kVIyvhKJWJX9FJv7HTR7lY4DMWOlTzVJMQzCpiJR2RVK4LnPluE">Principles for an Identity Ecosystem</a>, processes to respect and enhance privacy are being prioritized through every step of the PCTF development process.</p>



<p>DIACC expects to modify and improve these Draft Recommendations based upon public comments. Comments made during the review will be considered for incorporation into the next iteration and DIACC will prepare a Disposition of Comments to provide transparency with regard to how each comment was handled.</p>

 Introduction <p>At 3Box Labs, the core team building Ceramic, we are continually striving to produce the best solution for off-chain storage. This requires a combination of simplifying the user experience, while also delivering on the demanding requirements of users when it comes to performance and safety. To accomplish this, we’ve started to introduce more code written in Rust to our codebase.</p><p>For those not familiar with Rust, Rust is a language that focuses on three areas</p>  Performance  Reliability  Productivity  <p>We will dive into what Rust offers for performance and reliability, and how that allows us to produce fast, reliable, and secure off-chain storage on Ceramic. We will not talk about productivity in this blog post, as that is somewhat subjective and leads to language debates (even if we do love the productivity).</p> 1. Performance With Efficient Memory Usage and Systems Programming <p>One of the main reasons that Rust is able to achieve its performance is that it does not use a virtual machine or garbage collector. When Rust code is built, it produces machine code and binaries at a systems level, like C or C++. To further improve on this, Rust also has zero-cost abstractions. Zero-cost abstractions allow developers to focus on writing clean, performant, and maintainable code, as the compiler will remove the abstractions used and produce optimized machine code.</p>Source: <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/?ref=blog.ceramic.network#hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;section=data-r22&amp;l=yyj30e-cn3">TechEmpower Round 22 Benchmarks</a><p>Rust regularly performs similarly to C and C++ in benchmarks, while often having some measurable performance improvement over Go. In the above image, you will see a <code>Lng</code> column indicating the language a webserver is written in. Rust webservers, denoted with <code>rs</code> and purple in color, outperform C (<code>C</code> - red), C++ (<code>C++</code> - red), and Go (<code>Go</code> - green).</p>Go (Purple) vs Rust (Blue) Comparison. <a href="https://discord.com/blog/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Source</a>.<p>Additionally, Rust regularly produces better 75% and 99% response times due to better memory management. Discord switched from Go to Rust largely because these spikes wreak havoc on systems and user experience. They would have @mention spikes of 2 seconds or higher with Go, while Rust would consistently be in the sub-second range.</p> 2. Reliability: Safety and Uptime <p>The decentralized nature of Web3 applications demands an unyielding commitment to safety. Additionally, our users demand availability of their data, so uptime is of primary importance. When dealing with systems languages like C and C++, most people are familiar with the multitude of common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) that are filed, with a large number due to issues around memory management.</p><p>As mentioned above, Rust performance is a result of its close-to-the-metal code and memory management without a garbage collector. To ensure safety, Rust has introduced a memory ownership system, enforced at compile time, rather than runtime. This ownership system determines who is using data, and when it is free to release that data and, once freed, ensures that no one else can improperly use that data.</p> <code>fn main() {
    {
        let x = 42;

        println!("x: {}", x);
    }

    println!("x: {}", x); // ERROR: x not in scope
}
</code> <p>This additional security has led to a large number of companies needing secure-by-default software to start implementing code in Rust. Rust was created by Mozilla for use in Firefox to improve performance and security. Google and Microsoft have both been introducing more Rust into systems such as Windows and Android.</p> 3. Performance and Safety: Binaries and Containerization <p>One final benefit to Rust is our ability to deliver binaries for systems, providing a verifiable supply chain to your running program, and allowing you to choose whether you want to run our software natively on your system, or through a container. For those of you choosing containers, we are also able to deliver much smaller images, usually 100-200mb or less, compared to our Javascript images, which are much closer to 1GB in size.</p> What’s Next <p>As we release more software in Rust, we will let you know and share upgrade paths for any software that is a replacement on our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">blog</a>. Additionally, we will be looking to build more functionality in WASM, so users that require in-browser functionality with performance and safety can leverage libraries that 3Box Labs produces.</p><p>We look forward to continuing to provide you with the fastest, most reliable off-chain storage for your Web3 needs.</p><p>If you'd like to tell us more about your project or get in touch with the core team please <a href="https://noteforms.com/forms/ecosystem-projects-i8uqzp?ref=blog.ceramic.network">fill out this form</a>.</p>

 Demystifying technology through common&nbsp;language <p>Here at the co-op we talk about a lot about mental models and metaphors. As we’ve written in the past, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/sim-city-2000-as-a-metaphor-for-open-recognition-and-open-badges-462fb8224a3c">metaphors are powerful things</a>, helping people understand complex ideas like how to build Open Recognition programmes. They can <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/non-violent-communication-in-communities-dde7b1bf9b8e">shape community culture</a>. They mean people can spend less time understanding a thing and more time working to make that thing&nbsp;better.</p>cc-by WAO<p>We’ve started working with the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC), an applied research lab working on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs). Hosted at <a href="https://mit.edu">MIT</a> with a membership portfolio that currently includes <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/who-we-are">12 other universities</a>, the DCC is leading the development of technical standards that underpin VCs. They are building demos and betas to help university registrars and IT departments, employers, vendors and developers understand the power of this technology.</p><p>When we talk about this work to people who don’t work in technology, we have to lean heavily on real-world metaphors to help people understand the underlying concepts of how technology works. Educators understand marking achievement with a credential much differently to technologists. As both educators and technologists, we need to find ways to explain the new and various worlds that technology opens up for&nbsp;us.</p><p>The DCC seeks to empower learners by enabling them to have ownership and control over their digital credentials. As an applied research lab, the DCC can show that the technology works, paving the way for much wider adoption. However, technology alone is never enough. Most people do not care about a technical standard per say, they care about what that standard can do for them. Aas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> famously pointed out, people tend to understand new things using existing mental&nbsp;models.</p><p>In this post, therefore, we want to play with a few examples, metaphors and mental models to help us explain what the DCC&nbsp;does.</p> Examples of standards <p>There are a couple ways to understand a ‘standard’.</p><p>A standard can be just the usual way of doing something. A standard can also be a reference to make sure things can be understood in the same way, no matter where or what is referencing the standard.</p><p>For example a kilogram in France is the same as kilogram in Germany, and a kilogram of feathers weighs the same as a kilogram of bricks. The kilogram is the standard, but where it is applied or what it is used for is up to whoever is using&nbsp;it.</p><p>Here’s some examples of standards you’ve probably heard&nbsp;about:</p>  Metric System: 100 centimetres is a metre and a foot is 12 inches. All our rulers and measuring tapes follow one of these systems, at least in the western industrialised world.  AM/FM Radio: “Amplitude modulation” or “Frequency modulation”, the way radios work is standardised.  Timezones, chemical symbols, maritime signal flags — our world has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_common_standards">plenty of standards</a>.  CC BY-ND Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>A technical standard is similar to these everyday standards, and how we get things such as the entire internet. We have technical standards that allow us to communicate and collaborate on the World Wide Web. However, because people need to understand what they are doing at any given point, we use homely metaphors — such as an envelope to signal ‘email’ (i.e. a digital message sent between servers).</p><p>Open technical standards are important when it comes to digital credentials. We don’t want a world in which the digital credentials we’ve earned at University X work differently to those at University Y and aren’t understood by Organisation Z. We need to make sure that our symbols of achievement make sense to whoever is looking at&nbsp;them.</p> Towards new metaphors for&nbsp;VCs <p>The DCC is active in helping shape the open technical standard for Verifiable Credentials and building ‘reference implementations’ on top of it. That’s a lot to take in if all you need to know is “Can we use DCC’s openly licensed work?” or “Is this person qualified?”</p>the DCC&nbsp;logo<p>In technology, standards are a way to ensure that solutions with different tech stacks work together in a way that is described as interoperable. There are common examples of technical standards in action such&nbsp;as:</p>  Email standard: Did you ever think about how you can send an email to any email address no matter what domain the email is pointing to? (e.g. laura@example.com can send an email to doug@mycooladdress.edu)  HTTP: You will have noticed the “http://“ or “https://“ in your browser menu bar. The HTTP application layer of the World Wide Web is what’s called a “standard protocol”.  URLs: Come to think of it “Uniform Resource Locator” are also standardised, which is why you can just type in <a href="http://blog.weareopen.coop">blog.weareopen.coop</a> and end up reading this&nbsp;post!  <p>The DCC exceeds at promoting interoperability. It creates and maintains open-source tools that facilitate issuing, verifying, and managing digital credentials in different contexts. The DCC contributes to the development of open standards necessary for Verifiable Credentials to gain global acceptance, like email&nbsp;has.</p> Mental models, metaphors and symbolism <p>Helping people understand examples of a standard is one thing, finding a metaphor for a specific standard is quite&nbsp;another.</p><p>A mental model is the container within which you can include a metaphor. A metaphor is, further, a container within which you can use symbolism and iconography.</p><p>If you have the mental model of chatting with your friends, the metaphor of “speech clouds” — this is a metaphor because language is not visible — helps you understand why most chat apps use speech clouds as logos and icons. This symbolism and iconography helps users understand that a piece of software can help them communicate with other&nbsp;people.</p><p>These mental shortcuts pop up all across technology — A folder icon to signify a new organising container for a body of work. A telephone to indicate making a call. A camera to designate a photo application.</p><p>Most people have a mental model of what “credentials” are, so how can we use other containers to explain Verifiable Credentials? The secret is in the name — “Verifiable” denotes “trust”, but it’s not actual trust. To use a metaphor the DCC often uses, VCs guarantee that what is inside the envelope hasn’t been tampered with, but doesn’t say anything about the letter inside&nbsp;it.</p><p>We trust other people’s trust. For example, if someone has a driver’s license, we trust that they know how to drive. It’s not just because they have the license, but rather we trust the agency behind the credential.</p><p>Often for trust, safety or verification, we use symbols like padlocks and vaults. For credentials, we often use seals and certification icons. Might using these kinds of iconography help users and implementers understand what is involved with cryptographically-signed credentials such as&nbsp;VCs?</p> Mental models for&nbsp;VCs <p>If we abstract away from “credentials” as the mental model, we might find other ways to explain this work. Another mental model that could help people understand what Verifiable Credentials are is the World Wide Web. Anyone can create a webpage, but some webpages are created by people or organisations we trust more than others. For example, when you want to know the weather, you likely go to the webpage of an organisation that employs meteorologists and uses weather prediction models.</p>the DCC’s work as a&nbsp;tree<p>Verifiable Credentials could also be thought about as state-issued identity documents. Be it a birth certificate, passport or drivers license, a marriage certificate or a school transcript. Even before the internet, these forms of identity documents are requested and verified by people other than the person who owns them (e.g. Laura’s birth certificate or Laura’s school transcript). These kinds of credentials are more than just the paper the credential is printed on. For example, a school transcript is a ‘product’ which is produced by a ‘school system’ that is predicated on national standards.</p><p>There are a variety of organisations that issue identity documents. They are issued in different countries and with different water marks. Somewhere underneath it all though, there are standards and processes, procedures and protocols that make identity documentation for many people* interoperable. No matter who issued your birth certificate, you can use it to verify your identity. The big flaw in this mental model is the fact that ANYONE, not just states or governments or elite organisations, can issue Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>The DCC doesn’t just work in standards. They also create infrastructure and lightweight products to help people visualise why these standards matter. This is part of the reason we wish to experiment with different mental&nbsp;models.</p><p>*Unfortunately not all people have even this amount of privilege. Indigenous people, refugees and people from certain countries do not always have the ability to verify their own identities. Transitioning to a world in which we use VCs for identity could&nbsp;help.</p> Finding the right&nbsp;language <p>We don’t have to choose a single mental model to help us talk about complex ideas. Instead, we can play with multiple models, metaphors and symbols to find things that resonates with the audiences we’re trying to communicate with.</p><p>In future posts, we’ll pick apart examples and metaphors for things like infrastructure, products, interoperability, data security, efficiency and any other terms or jargon that will can help people better understand what the Digital Credential Consortium is up&nbsp;to.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-to-find-the-right-mental-models-for-your-audience-c68097a7f0ed">How to find the right mental models for your audience</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   <p>The digital landscape is on the cusp of a monumental transformation. As of February 1, 2024, Google and Yahoo! are enforcing Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) protocols. This pivotal moment signifies the beginning of the end for online identity fraud, ushering us into a new era of digital identity security.</p>



 Understanding SPF, DKIM, and DMARC: The Trinity of Email Security 



<p>Before delving into the implications of this enforcement, let’s understand what SPF, DKIM, and DMARC entail:</p>



 
 SPF (Sender Policy Framework): This protocol verifies the sender’s IP address against the list of authorized sending IPs for a domain. It prevents email spoofing, ensuring that emails originate from legitimate sources. 



 DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): DKIM adds a digital signature to each email, which helps the receiving server verify that the email hasn’t been tampered with and is from a legitimate domain. 



 DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance): This protocol uses SPF and DKIM to provide a holistic approach to email validation. It allows domain owners to decide how an email should be treated if it fails SPF or DKIM checks. 
 



 The Impact on Online Identity Fraud 



<p>The enforcement of these protocols by internet giants like Google and Yahoo! is a game-changer in combating online identity fraud. By ensuring that emails are authenticated, it becomes increasingly difficult for fraudsters to execute phishing attacks and impersonate others. This move is a critical step towards a future where digital identity is secure and trusted.</p>



 The Path to Mandatory Digital ID 



<p>This development is not just about improving email security; it’s a significant stride towards the broader goal of establishing a mandatory digital ID. The enforcement of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC protocols lays the foundation for a more secure digital identity ecosystem. It sets a precedent for other online platforms and service providers to follow suit, gradually building a more robust and fraud-resistant digital world.</p>



 What This Means for You 



<p>For tech-savvy individuals and businesses, this change is a call to action. It’s essential to ensure that your domains are compliant with these protocols. Not only will this protect your digital identity, but it will also ensure that your communications are trusted and reach their intended recipients.</p>



 Embracing the Future 



<p>The enforcement of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC protocols marks a significant milestone in our journey towards a secure digital future. It’s a crucial step in the fight against online identity fraud, paving the way for the inevitable integration of mandatory digital IDs. As we embrace these changes, we move closer to a world where our digital identities are as secure and authentic as our physical ones.</p>



<p>Stay informed in online identity security, stay secure, and <a>join us</a> in welcoming this <a href="https://usdebtclock.org/">new era of</a> digital identity protection.</p>

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, January 12, 2024–Edge (NJEdge.net, Inc.) is pleased to partner with NOAA N-Wave to enable the organization as it expands and updates its vast range of services. N-Wave is the advanced, high-speed, and highly scalable network service provider operating from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). While it’s known as “NOAA’s Network,” N-Wave has expanded to serve multiple agencies in the U.S. federal government.</p>
<p>N-Wave recently joined forces with Edge to identify ways to elevate the network experience and expand their reach within the stakeholder community. To continue to effectively find networking solutions that benefit their stakeholder partners, leveraging the Science, Research, and Education (SR&amp;E) community has been instrumental in advancing their overall mission and has been the foundation of what they do. N-Wave has several partners within the SR&amp;E community, including Edge, Internet2, and the Global Network Operations Center (GlobalNOC) at Indiana University.&nbsp;</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		 “Edge is excited to partner with NOAA N-Wave as it expands into the future in supporting the mission of important stakeholders such as NOAA to advance science. We welcome the N-Wave team to the Edge community. It has been a pleasure to participate in N-Wave convenings and gain access to its collaborative community.”

<p>The Ceramic protocol has expanded ComposeDB's capabilities with a new feature called Interfaces (<a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-composedb/releases/tag/v0.6.0?ref=blog.ceramic.network">introduced in ComposeDB v0.6.0</a>). Interfaces are important for setting standards in data models.</p><p>Interfaces also constitute another step toward real data composability, which is the ability to easily combine and recombine data from various sources to create new datasets or insights.</p><p>This article explains Interfaces, why they're useful, and how they're implemented in ComposeDB.</p> What are Interfaces? <p>Interfaces are like a blueprint for data models. They define a set of fields that any type or model must include to be compliant with the Interface. This approach ensures that different models, though unique, maintain a level of standardization and interoperability.</p><p>In ComposeDB, Interfaces help create a common ground for diverse data models.</p><p>For a simplified example, you could have an Interface&nbsp;<code>Vehicle</code>&nbsp;that represents any kind of vehicle in a transportation system.</p> <code>interface Vehicle {
  id: ID!
  model: String!
  operators: [Person]
  usedIn: [Route]!
}
</code> <p>This means that any type that&nbsp;implements&nbsp;<code>Vehicle</code>&nbsp;must have these specific fields.</p><p>Here are some types that might implement&nbsp;<code>Vehicle</code>:</p> <code>type Car implements Vehicle {
  id: ID!
  model: String!
  operators: [Person]
  usedIn: [Route]!
  passengerCapacity: Int
  vehicleType: String
}
type Airplane implements Vehicle {
  id: ID!
  model: String!
  operators: [Person]
  usedIn: [Route]!
  wingspan: Float
  airline: String
}
</code> <p>You'll notice that both of these types possess all the fields from the&nbsp;<code>Vehicle</code>&nbsp;Interface, but they also feature additional fields:&nbsp;<code>passengerCapacity</code>,&nbsp;<code>vehicleType</code>,&nbsp;<code>wingspan</code>, and&nbsp;<code>airline</code>, that are unique to that specific kind of vehicle.</p><p>Interfaces are particularly useful when you wish to return an object or a collection of objects, and these objects could represent several different types.</p> Benefits of Interfaces in ComposeDB <p>Interfaces in ComposeDB offer several advantages:</p>  Standardization: They create a common standard for different models to follow, which is essential for consistency  Flexibility: Interfaces allow for the expansion of models by adding new fields, without breaking the established standards. (Note: Interfaces do not extend the existing models, they create new models that implement the same fields and constraints)  Efficient data queries: With Interfaces, it's easier to query data across various models, when these models share the same interface. You don't need to query by all the models separately, you can query by a single interface that these models share. This makes data retrieval more efficient.   Interface Implementation Example <p>An excellent example of Interfaces in action within Ceramic is the <a href="https://ceramic.network/patterns/verifiable-claims?ref=blog.ceramic.network">verifiable credentials</a> Interface. This Interface example standardizes the structure for decentralized identity systems.</p><p>It establishes a standard set of fields for all credential models, ensuring consistency across applications. At the same time, it allows you to add whatever additional fields you need for your own application.</p> <code>## Define the overarching VC interface that acts agnostic of our proof type
interface VerifiableCredential
  @createModel(description: "A verifiable credential interface")
{
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  issuer: Issuer!
  context: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  type: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  credentialSchema: CredentialSchema!
  credentialStatus: CredentialStatus
  issuanceDate: DateTime!
  expirationDate: DateTime
}

## Use the main interface to create a more specific interface - this one is for EIP712
interface VCEIP712Proof implements VerifiableCredential
  @createModel(description: "A verifiable credential interface of type EIP712")
{
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  issuer: Issuer!
  context: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  type: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  credentialSchema: CredentialSchema!
  credentialStatus: CredentialStatus
  issuanceDate: DateTime!
  expirationDate: DateTime
  proof: ProofEIP712! # The new field that is not present in the original interface
}

## Define our EIP712 type that uses VerifiableCredential and VCEIP712Proof interfaces and on top of that, adds credentialSubject specific to our use case
type VerifiableCredentialEIP712 implements VerifiableCredential &amp; VCEIP712Proof
  @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A verifiable credential of type EIP712")
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "issuanceDate" }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "issuer" }]) {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  issuer: Issuer!
  context: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  type: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  credentialSchema: CredentialSchema!
  credentialStatus: CredentialStatus
  issuanceDate: DateTime!
  expirationDate: DateTime
  proof: ProofEIP712!
  credentialSubject: CredentialSubject! # The new field that is not present in any of the two implemented interfaces
}
</code> <p>This snippet shows how an Interface (<code>VerifiableCredential</code>) is defined and how a specific type (<code>VerifiableCredentialEIP712</code>) implements it. This snippet is from our Verifiable Credentials example app and you can <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/verifiable-credentials/blob/with-interfaces/client/composites/00-verifiableCredential.graphql?ref=blog.ceramic.network">see more on GitHub</a>.</p><p>This example of the verifiable credentials Interface standardizes the basic structure for credentials in decentralized identity systems. By doing so, it facilitates various applications in creating, exchanging, and interpreting credentials in a consistent and reliable way.</p> Conclusion <p>Interfaces are crucial in the Ceramic protocol for helping decentralized applications work together. As managing data in a decentralized way becomes more common, knowing and using Interfaces will become more important.</p><p>Are you currently building a project on Ceramic or want to connect with the core team?

<p>“Q. How do you propose to do&nbsp;this?</p><p>A. By saving the knowledge of the race. The sum of human knowing is beyond any one man; any thousand men. With the destruction of our social fabric, science will be broken into a million pieces. Individuals will know much of the exceedingly tiny facets of which there is to know. They will be helpless and useless by themselves. The bits of lore, meaningless, will not be passed on. They will be lost through the generations. But, if we now prepare a giant summary of all knowledge, it will never be lost. Coming generations will build on it, and will not have to rediscover it for themselves. One millennium will do the work of thirty thousand.”</p><p>Hari Seldon, Foundation series by Isaac Asimov&nbsp;(1951)</p><p>October’s DKGcon saw the launch of the Metcalfe Genesis phase of the OriginTrail roadmap. The Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) has seen staggering growth since, reaching over 3MM Knowledge Assets published before the end of 2023. New partners have joined the OriginTrail ecosystem, bringing industry-leading real-world adoption and solving tangible problems of misinformation across&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>In 2024, we’re on the cusp of monumental progress as the Metcalfe Genesis phase continues, leading up to the much-anticipated launch of the OriginTrail DKG V8. On this path, we will see three impact bases get established, forming the V8 Foundation which is inspired by the legendary works of Isaac Asimov, symbolizing the bold steps into a future where knowledge and innovation converge.</p> Impact base: Trantor (established in Q1&nbsp;2024) <p>One of the prominent features of Trantor was the Library of Trantor, in which librarians indexed the entirety of human knowledge by walking up to a different computer terminal every day and resuming where the previous librarian left&nbsp;off.</p> Catalyst 1: Beta Knowledge mining&nbsp;launch <p>Knowledge Mining is the process of producing high-quality, blockchain-tracked knowledge for artificial intelligence (AI), supported by the NeuroWeb (parachain on Polkadot, formerly known as OriginTrail Parachain). During the beta knowledge mining, an initial 1,000,000 NEURO token pool will be made available to be mined by publishing high-quality Knowledge Assets to the DKG. Miners will be able to apply for the beta program and start knowledge mining as soon as January. The beta Knowledge miners will be eligible to claim NEURO rewards by publishing Knowledge Assets using both NeuroWeb and Gnosis blockchains. The beta program will be gathering key learnings on the dynamics of knowledge mining as the system matures from beta towards its fully decentralized version on NeuroWeb, setting the stage for the future of knowledge creation across all of humanity’s knowledge fields. Details are available in <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/tree/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-20-Knowledge-Mining-for-Decentralized-AI">OT-RFC-20</a> and more will be shared in the upcoming knowledge mining kit&nbsp;release.</p> Catalyst 2: Delegated staking&nbsp;launch <p>As NeuroWeb <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/overview">is loaded with growing enterprise adoption</a> and is used in production environments, the incubation of the new DKG staking module will initially be validated on the Gnosis chain. Gnosis is the ideal environment for staking incubation as DKG V6 integration will already include the new staking module (no breaking change risk). Igniting network activity on the Gnosis chain, 1,000,000 TRAC will be used to kickstart knowledge creation. At the same time, the DKG on NeuroWeb is expected to grow faster with Polkadot’s asynchronous backing feature and other upcoming updates (increasing throughput by a significant factor). Details on delegated staking are available in <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/tree/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-18-Growing-the-Trusted-Knowledge-Foundation">OT-RFC-18</a>.</p> Impact base: Terminus (established in Q2&nbsp;2024) <p>The founding population of Terminus consisted of 100,000 especially healthy scientists, whose ostensible purpose was to publish an Encyclopedia Galactica in order to preserve science and technology. The lack of natural resources forced Terminians to develop extremely high-efficiency tech, as their knowledge due to their position as the inheritors of the Imperial Library allowed them to do&nbsp;so.</p> Catalyst 1: Random sampling module for 100x scalability increase in Knowledge Asset throughput capacity <p>The explosive growth of the amount of Knowledge Assets on the DKG V6 has enabled the network to proceed towards the next scalability upgrade. DKG nodes will benefit from the improved “random sampling” method, a significant optimization of blockchain usage resulting in over 100x scalability increase in the amount of Knowledge Assets supported by the DKG and the blockchain layer.</p> Catalyst 2: Multichain growth <p>The multichain approach will explore integrations ranging from the most robust blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin) to the fastest yet less robust chains with strongly established markets, in accordance with the ecosystem’s neutrality principle.</p> Impact base: Gaia (established in H2&nbsp;2024) <p>The human beings on Gaia, under robotic guidance, not only evolved their ability to form an ongoing telepathic group consciousness but also extended this consciousness to the fauna and flora of the planet itself, even including inanimate matter. As a result, the entire planet became a super-organism.</p> Catalyst: AI-powered Autonomous Knowledge Mining <p>Synergizing the effects of Trantor and Terminus bases, Gaia drives the OriginTrail DKG native AI integrations with any model (e.g. Gemini, GPT), vector database (e.g. Milvus, Weaviate), and agent (e.g. AutoGPT). The AI-native capabilities enable a suite of autonomous activities — from discovering inferences in the DKG and mining new knowledge to validating existing data and autonomous agent-based solutions using trusted knowledge on the DKG. The Gaia impact base catalyzation leads to the Convergence in the Metcalfe roadmap&nbsp;phase.</p> Conclusion <p>The impact bases presented in this blog post serve as the V8 Foundation, describing core fields in which impact must be pursued to achieve an effective DKG V8 launch. The above does not focus on integrations with the world’s leading tech solution providers, growing governmental and institutional support, or other adoption updates. Each of the impact bases and their outcomes are therefore expected to be further augmented by the ongoing DKG adoption.</p><p>Stay #OnTrac(k)!</p> About OriginTrail <p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem-building decentralized knowledge infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI). With the mission of tackling misinformation, which is exacerbated with AI adoption, OriginTrail enables verifiably tracking origins of information, discoverability, and integrity of knowledge to enable trusted AI. It has various applications in the domains of real-world assets (RWAs), search and recommendation engines, question-answering systems, and generally knowledge-dependent applications (such as AI systems).</p><p>OriginTrail’s initial adoption was in global supply chains, serving as a trusted hub for supply chain data sharing, allowing customers to authenticate and track products and keep these operations secure. In recent years, the rise of AI has not only created unprecedented opportunities for progress but also amplified the challenge of misinformation. OriginTrail also addresses this by functioning as an ecosystem focused on building a trusted knowledge infrastructure for AI in two ways — driving discoverability of the world’s most important knowledge and enabling the verifiable origin of the information. The adoption of OriginTrail in various enterprise solutions underscores the technology’s growing relevance and impact across diverse industries including real-world asset tokenization (RWAs), the construction industry, supply chains, healthcare, metaverse, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>OriginTrail is creating a Verifiable Web for decentralized AI by empowering world-class brands and builders. It utilizes its unique Decentralized Knowledge Graph and OriginTrail Parachain to deliver AI-powered search and solutions for enterprises and individuals worldwide.</p><p>OriginTrail has gained support and partnerships with world-class organizations such as British Standards Institution, SCAN, Polkadot, Parity, Walmart, the World Federation of Hemophilia, Oracle, and the EU Commission’s Next Generation Internet. These partnerships contribute to advancing OriginTrail’s trusted knowledge foundation and its applicability in trillion-dollar industries while providing a verifiable web of knowledge important in particular to drive the economies of&nbsp;RWAs.</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/the-v8-foundation-8bf7f9f0a947">The V8 Foundation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Introducing a continuum of ambiguity and reflecting on importance of avoiding dead metaphors in the workplace Image created by DALL-E&nbsp;3<p>There are many things that mark individuals and organisations out as different. We can describe various characteristics and dispositions, but we can also point to different tolerances.</p><p>In this regard, perhaps the one we talk about the most is ‘risk’ tolerance, but in this post let’s explore the tolerance that individuals and organisations have to ambiguity. It’s key to understanding how change&nbsp;happens.</p> Let’s define&nbsp;terms <p>It might seem a little ironic to define a term like ‘ambiguity’, but it’s important to separate it from the idea that something is ‘vague’ or ‘unclear’.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.oed.com/">Oxford English Dictionary</a>, for example, contains several definitions for ambiguity:</p>  Originally and chiefly with reference to language: the fact or quality of having different possible meanings; capacity for being interpreted in more than one way; (also) lack of specificity or exactness.  An instance of ambiguity or uncertain meaning; a doubt; an uncertainty.  A word or phrase that can be interpreted in more than one way; an ambiguous expression.  A nuance which allows for an alternative reading of a piece of language; the fact or quality of having one or more such&nbsp;nuances.  Uncertainty about one’s course of action; doubt, hesitation. Also an instance of this: a feeling of uncertainty, a&nbsp;doubt.  The fact or quality of being difficult to categorise or identify, esp. due to changeable or contradictory qualities or characteristics. Also: something that is difficult to categorise or identify.  <p>If some of these definitions seem like how work sometimes feels, then you’re not alone! Life is ambiguous, but in different ways. Some types of ambiguity are more useful than others, and having a tolerance for ambiguity can be helpful in avoiding ‘dead metaphors’.</p><p>Let’s dig&nbsp;deeper…</p> Introducing a continuum of ambiguity <p>The image below looks simple but comes from plenty of research which spans everything from literary criticism to philosophy.</p>CC BY Doug Belshaw via <a href="https://ambiguiti.es">ambiguiti.es</a> Dead metaphors <p>One way of perhaps making this continuum immediately understandable is to say that something being ‘vague’ would be over to the left. The green bars represent different types of ambiguity, and then the phrase ‘dead metaphors’ represent terms and and ways of speaking which no longer have any explanatory power.</p><p>Here are some examples of dead metaphors — words or phrases which were once novel, but have become so common that they are now considered ‘dead’ or&nbsp;clichéd:</p>  Thinking outside the box — originally meant to encourage creative and unconventional thinking, it’s now a standard phrase for any form of innovation or different thinking.  Moving the goalposts — once a useful metaphor for changing criteria or rules unfairly, it’s now a routine way of describing shifting standards or expectations.  Game changer — initially used to describe something which changed radically the existing conditions or rules, now it’s often used to describe anything even slightly innovative.  <p>So now we understand that we’re dealing with the majority of our working life: the stuff that happens between something just being really unclear or vague, on the one hand, and something being a dead metaphor, on the&nbsp;other.</p> Where does ambiguity come&nbsp;from? <p>While there are different types of ambiguity, they stem from the overlap between what is denoted by a statement and what is connotes.</p>CC BY Doug Belshaw via <a href="https://ambiguiti.es">ambiguiti.es</a><p>The denotative aspect represents the literal, dictionary definition of a word, while the connotative aspect represents the associations, emotions, or additional meanings that the word carries beyond its literal definition.</p><p>There are many examples to help understand this:</p>  Dove — a bird (denotative) and also a sign of peace (connotative)  Home — where someone lives (denotative) and also a feeling of comfort and familiarity (connotative)  Cold — low temperature (denotative) and also a way of interacting that is unfriendly or&nbsp;distant.  <p>The overlap in the diagram, indicated by the arrow, represents words that carry both denotative and connotative meanings simultaneously. This can lead to ambiguity because the person who wrote or spoke the words cannot control their connotation in the mind of someone else. The ambiguity arises from the interplay between the precise, literal meaning and the variable, subjective interpretation of a word’s connotation.</p> Types of ambiguity <p>Given that we live in language and use it to understand the world around us, ambiguity is inevitable. However, as mentioned above, and as shown in the continuum image, there are different types of ambiguity, which are more or less useful for various purposes.</p><p>One way of thinking about these different types is as the state change of a substance from gas, to liquid, through to&nbsp;solid:</p>  Generative Ambiguity — this is where ambiguity can give rise to new ideas or interpretations. These are not usually well-defined and often only make sense to an individual. For example, you may have a flash of insight as to how something you’ve been grappling with in your personal life can help you with your professional life. This would likely only make sense to&nbsp;you.  Creative Ambiguity — here, ambiguity is used to help other people understand an idea. It remains highly contextual, so would only be understood by someone who shares your context: for example, you use a new term to make sense of how some problems your sector has been having are&nbsp;related.  Productive Ambiguity — this represents ambiguity that is beneficial or intentional in generating positive outcomes because it helps people shift their view. For example, as part of a strategy where leaving things unsaid or open to interpretation can lead to more flexible and adaptable solutions.  <p>So Generative Ambiguity is where a term or way of understanding something works for you. Creative Ambiguity is where it works for people like you (i.e. with similar domain knowledge). Productive Ambiguity is when it works for most&nbsp;people.</p> Using different types of ambiguity in your&nbsp;work <p>The first thing to say is that we should avoid vague, unclear statements as much as possible. Likewise, we need to stop talking in dead metaphors. Neither are particularly useful. Challenge both wherever you&nbsp;can.</p><p>Ambiguity, however, is useful, and sitting in it for a period of time can be creatively beneficial. Building up our tolerance of ambiguity involves recognising that not all ambiguity is equal — some types serve us better than others. Understanding how to use different types of ambiguity can be particularly useful in the workplace.</p> Generative Ambiguity <p>Generative ambiguity is a state where ideas are in flux, akin to a brainstorming session where every contribution is valued and nothing is off-limits.</p><p>To use this in your&nbsp;work:</p>  Encourage free thinking: create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing unpolished ideas. This could be through regular brainstorming sessions or a digital ‘ideas&nbsp;board’.  Embrace uncertainty: when presented with a new problem, resist the urge to find immediate clarity. Instead, allow ideas to percolate and evolve. (There’s a wonderful scene in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0300015/">I Capture the Castle</a> where the character played by Bill Nighy points to scraps of paper pinned all around his room and says that his “ideas are percolating”)  Reflect individually: set aside time for personal reflection. This can help in connecting disparate ideas, leading to innovative solutions.   Creative Ambiguity <p>Creative ambiguity thrives on context and shared understanding. It’s about communicating new concepts in a way that resonates with a specific audience.</p><p>To encourage this:</p>  Know your audience: tailor your communication to the background and experience of your team. After all, what makes sense in one context may not in another. This is particularly important if you work across countries and timezones.  Use metaphors wisely: use fresh metaphors that align with your team’s experiences to illustrate complex ideas. Metaphors are extremely powerful, so think about the benefits and potentially unexpected consequences of introducing a new&nbsp;one.  Test new terminology: introduce new terms or phrases that encapsulate broader concepts or strategies specific to your work environment. See what resonates.   Productive Ambiguity <p>Productive ambiguity can be strategic, helping build a culture which values flexible thinking without a one-size-fits-none ‘solution’.</p><p>To help this&nbsp;thrive:</p>  Encourage adaptability: when setting project goals, be clear on the outcomes but flexible on the methods to achieve them, allowing room for innovative approaches.  Practice strategic communication: sometimes less is more. Give enough information to guide but not so much that it stifles alternative interpretations or solutions.  Enable collaboration: bring together diverse teams to work on projects. The intersection of different knowledge bases can lead to a fruitful ambiguity that encourages new ways of thinking.   Conclusion <p>Navigating the continuum of ambiguity requires an awareness of language’s power and its impact on thought and communication. By consciously employing different types of ambiguity, we can create environments full ofinnovation, creativity, and strategic thinking.</p><p>It’s about choosing the right tool for the job: sometimes a scalpel, sometimes a hammer, and sometimes a paintbrush. Each type of ambiguity can be your ally, if approached with intention and understanding.</p><p>Do you need some help with navigating and using ambiguity in your organisation?

		<p>With the age of artificial intelligence (AI) well underway, how we work, learn, and conduct business continues to transform and open the door to new opportunities. In the classroom, AI can be a powerful teaching tool and support innovative and interactive learning techniques and critical thinking. Dr. C. Edward Watson, Associate Vice President for Curricular and Pedagogical Innovation with the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&amp;U) and formerly Director of the Center for Teaching and Learning at the University of Georgia, explores how AI is revolutionizing the future of learning and how educators can adapt to this new era of human thinking in his new book, Teaching with AI: A Practical Guide to a New Era of Human Learning (Johns Hopkins University Press.)</p>
<p>“AI is a significant game changer and is presenting a new challenge that is going to be dramatically different from past disruptive innovations,” says Watson. “Goldman Sachs and other sources estimate that two-thirds of U.S. occupations will be impacted by AI.1 With a vastly accelerating expectation within the workforce that new graduates will be able to leverage AI for work, there is a growing pressure on institutions of higher education to ensure students become well-versed in AI techniques. This new learning outcome for higher education is being termed AI literacy.”</p>
<p>AI is also introducing a new academic integrity challenge including how to accurately determine if students are using AI to complete assignments. Along with Teaching with AI co-author, José Antonio Bowen, Watson explores crucial questions related to academic integrity, cheating, and other emerging issues in AI-powered education. “The real focus of the book is how to create assignments and practices that increase the probability that students will engage with the work rather than turn to AI, as well as ways to partner with AI and use these tools in meaningful and impactful ways. Instead of fearing AI and how students may misuse it, the education community must employ logical pedagogical practices within the classroom that encourage our students to become competent partners with AI, including building AI literacy skills that will help them on their future career paths.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“I look forward to discussing the higher education landscape at EdgeCon and exploring suggestions for how we might move forward. We need to acknowledge that AI is going to be an important thread in the education and research industries. Disruption is not always a bad thing, especially in the workforce. AI can help improve efficiencies, reduce costs, increase productivity, and create new job opportunities. In the higher education setting, these tools have the potential to offer personalized learning experiences, strengthen retention, and resolve accessibility issues. Along with the potential challenges this type of technology may introduce, we must also look at the positive opportunities that will arise and how we can better prepare our students for the world that is already waiting for them.”</p>

		<p>AI in the Classroom and Beyond<br>
With over twenty-five years of experience in faculty and instructional development, Watson is nationally recognized for his expertise in general education, active learning, classroom practice, course design, faculty development, student learning, and learning outcomes assessment. “I believe in the transformative opportunities that higher education can provide individuals, especially first-generation students like myself,” shares Watson. “When I entered a master’s program in English, I became increasingly interested in the puzzle of how learning works. I wanted to better understand how to make learning more meaningful for students, how to engage them, and how to ensure what I’m teaching is not just memorized for an exam, but will be remembered and utilized long after the course is completed. As I advanced in my career, I was able to take what I learned helping students in my own classroom to provide programming and opportunities that could benefit the breadth of higher education.”</p>
<p>Even though change can be slow within the education community, Watson says the dramatic, fast shifts happening in the industry are causing many institutions to take notice. “Unfortunately, as higher education begins to adapt, AI is creating new digital inequities. Many institutions are struggling to determine how to best serve their students given the new challenges and opportunities. Institutions will need leaders who continue to explore how advancements like AI are changing their world and the ways in which they can harness and manage AI as a powerful teaching tool.”</p>
<p>“To begin to understand AI and its capabilities, I recommend that faculty copy and paste a current assignment into two or three different AI tools to better understand the opportunities, restrictions, and surprises. This can provide insight into ways to improve the assignment and to make it better aligned with the way students might be expected to complete similar work in the real-world post graduation. I think going forward, we will see AI more deeply integrated within systems we already depend upon.&nbsp;For instance, within learning management systems (LMS), it’s foreseeable that when&nbsp;students submit assignments, the AI-assisted LMS will check for AI, plagiarism, and may even grade and provide customized feedback using a faculty designed rubric.”</p>
<p>From a teaching perspective, AI can also be beneficial in helping instructors create rubrics and improve the quality of their course syllabus and assignments. “I hope more faculty look at AI as a toolbox, rather than something to fear,” says Watson. “Teachers are still the experts in their field, and AI can help them elevate their courses and find new ways to improve the learning experience. AI is not a search engine; it is more like a knowledgeable colleague. Using it is more about prompt engineering and having a conversation that fine tunes the results. Faculty should see AI as an idea generator that could be leveraged and helpful with many aspects of the classroom and beyond.”</p>
<p>ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in November 2022, is a common AI tool used to automate tasks, compose essays and emails, and have human-like conversations. According to a recent survey conducted by Study.com, 89 percent of students over the age of 18 have used ChatGPT to help with homework, while 48 percent confessed they had used it to complete an at-home test or quiz.2 “While many students are familiar with AI tools like ChatGPT, not all educators are aware of its prevalence, causing a disconnect,” says Watson. “Showing faculty how this tool can be useful is key and encouraging them to have open and honest conversations with students about how AI can be used as a tool of learning, rather than a way to cheat on their schoolwork is now an essential early-in-the-semester conversation. Instead of approaching AI with how it is breaking your pedagogy, consider how AI is relevant for what you would like to accomplish in preparing your students for the future.”</p>

		<p>Adapting Higher Education in a New Era<br>
With a theme of Excelling in a Digital Teaching and Learning Future, EdgeCon Spring 2024 will welcome Dr. Watson as a keynote speaker to explore how higher education is evolving and ways to overcome the challenges the industry is facing. “A recent Gallup survey shows a steep decline in how higher education is perceived in this country3,” says Watson. “Less than half of Americans have confidence in higher education. All of us within our industry should consider how we can positively impact this national perception of higher education as there are ramifications. Not preparing students for what will certainly be an AI-enhanced career or recklessly using AI detection tools in ways that might unjustly accuse significant numbers of students of cheating can be significantly dangerous for higher education. Combining such practices with the ongoing student debt crisis and a politically polarized higher education dynamic, and more and more students will question if higher education is still as important as it once was.&nbsp; Already many ask if higher education is still a cornerstone of the American Dream.”</p>
<p>“I look forward to discussing the higher education landscape at EdgeCon and exploring suggestions for how we might move forward,” continues Watson. “We need to acknowledge that AI is going to be an important thread in the education and research industries. Disruption is not always a bad thing, especially in the workforce. AI can help improve efficiencies, reduce costs, increase productivity, and create new job opportunities. In the higher education setting, these tools have the potential to offer personalized learning experiences, strengthen retention, and resolve accessibility issues. Along with the potential challenges this type of technology may introduce, we must also look at the positive opportunities that will arise and how we can better prepare our students for the world that is already waiting for them.”</p>

<p>The OASIS Board of Directors are integral to the organization's success. Read our Q&amp;A to gain a better sense of who they are and why they serve the OASIS community.</p> 


<p>Meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/altazvalani/">Altaz Valani</a>, an accomplished and award-winning DevSecOps evangelist who also stands out as an executive advisor, teaching instructor, and community builder.  </p>



<p>What has been your involvement at OASIS?<br>Along with being a Board member, I am also part of a few OASIS Technical Committees (TCs). My personal interest lies primarily in the cybersecurity and value stream space. It is, essentially, the intersection of secure technology and business value. Through my collaboration at OASIS, I am able to meet many individuals from diverse backgrounds. This diversity is one of the key strengths of the committees at OASIS.</p>



<p>What inspired you to join the OASIS Board of Directors?<br>I want to make a difference in this world. OASIS has amazing projects, many of which address key needs of the cybersecurity industry, specifically around the problem of data sharing. Being a Board member allows me to influence the direction of an internationally recognized organization with a long history of developing standards in an open ecosystem. It also gives me the opportunity to network and meet other like-minded individuals who also want to make a difference. Working together allows us to achieve what no single person could do on their own.</p>



<p>What types of skills/expertise do you bring to the OASIS Board, and how do you hope to make an impact?<br>My background is in software development and cybersecurity. My goal is to positively impact OASIS by helping to bridge gaps with other communities, setting future strategy, and socializing the impact of OASIS and its downstream open standards on the world.</p>



<p>Why are you passionate about OASIS’ mission?<br>From a cybersecurity perspective, there are so many tools out there that don’t talk to each other. Having an open standard that allows for smoother data interchange helps to drive the generation of key insights. It is from these insights that we can more effectively remediate some of our biggest cybersecurity problems.</p>



<p>What sets OASIS apart from other organizations?<br>First, OASIS has a clear onramp to international standardization. Through years of building a strong relationship with organizations like ISO, OASIS is uniquely positioned to bring the best of open development into the world of global standards. Second, the work done at OASIS is open and transparent. Anyone can see the work being done, and that builds accountability into the governance structure.</p>



<p>What are some reasons why companies, organizations, and individuals should bring their projects to OASIS?<br>Trying to do the heavy lifting on your own is extremely difficult and costly, but spreading the effort across multiple companies pays off. Additionally, there is an innovation component to this. As collaboration takes place, there are numerous ideas that emerge which you may not have considered, helping to advance innovation within your organization.</p>



<p>Do you have an impact story about your work in open source or standards?<br>Open projects have a profound impact on so many communities. In my experience, when a community shares their insights, they are earnestly seeking feedback for improvement. Feedback received then begets more feedback. That type of engagement allows an open project to remain relevant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I worked at The Open Group on developing an open standard for Zero Trust, the feedback from many people was extremely valuable – both as validation as well as opportunities for further refinement. In the end, what emerged was a set of principles and practices that provided valuable guidance for many organizations and practitioners.</p>



<p>What trends or changes in standards are most exciting to you?<br>AI is certainly a big topic today. What is exciting about it is the way it can help reduce the manual effort of poring through vast amounts of security information to make informed decisions. We have no shortage of security tools today. What’s missing is an open security observability layer that integrates disparate islands of security tooling data into meaningful insights.&nbsp;I see OASIS and other standards communities continuing to drive meaningful open solutions to the problem of cybersecurity and integration. Additionally, as AI emerges, there are many possible opportunities to standardize pieces of the lifecycle around model representation and explainable AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s a fun fact about you?&nbsp;<br>I once travelled to Mongolia and stayed in a ger. It was amazing to experience a totally different culture and to understand their rich history and fascinating customs.</p>

<p>Rarimo protocol allows users to seamlessly port their identities across Web3. One of Rarimo’s use-cases is RariMe, an extension that allows users to store and manage their identity credentials inside of Metamask, generating privacy-protecting Zero-Knowledge proofs that can be submitted to dApps. So far, there have been over 6,000 RariMe downloads.&nbsp;</p><p>RariMe initially used MetaMask local storage to hold credentials, but switched to Ceramic as it allows for data to be synced between multiple devices—both increasing the portability and improving the disaster recovery process for users.&nbsp;</p> The Story of RariMe <p>Rarimo is an interoperability protocol solving identity fragmentation in Web3. It aggregates issuers and standards, allowing dApps to verify and interact with a broad range of identity artifacts. This in turn allows users to port their identities across Web3. All of this is accomplished with privacy-preserving Zero-Knowledge technology. Rarimo can be thought of as a Chainlink for identities.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior use cases include:&nbsp;</p>  Launching the <a href="https://rarimo.medium.com/why-proof-of-humanity-is-so-important-and-why-rarimo-built-the-worlds-first-poh-aggregator-8d7088192c28?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Proof-of-Humanity plug-in</a>  This plug-in allows platforms to filter out bots by gating access to users who have proven their humanity.  Through a single integration, dApps gain instant access to a range of four identity providers representing different methods of verification: Gitcoin Passport, Unstoppable Domains, Civic, and Worldcoin. This allows users to choose exactly how they prove their humanity.    <a href="https://rarimo.medium.com/rarimo-x-polygon-id-spearheading-the-worlds-first-multi-chain-zero-knowledge-proofs-for-verified-cd9b9406751e?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Scaling PolygonID</a> by making their Zero-Knowledge Proofs multi-chain  Launching <a href="https://rarimo.medium.com/why-storing-your-identity-in-your-metamask-wallet-is-such-a-big-deal-5e7428f14aaf?ref=blog.ceramic.network">RariMe</a>, a MetaMask Snap&nbsp;  RariMe allows users to store identity credentials inside their MetaMask&nbsp;  It also allows them to generate Zero-Knowledge Proofs for all of their credentials  Users are able to store both their Web3 assets and identities in the same location     Why RariMe Built With Ceramic <p>Multiple other solutions were considered including IPFS, FileCoin, and Arweave. In the end, Ceramic was selected because it is free for users and comes with a convenient high-level API provided by Compose DB.</p><p>RariMe snap uses ComposeDB as the primary encrypted storage of Verifiable Credentials. The keys for authorization and encryption are tied to the MetaMask mnemonic phrase. The safe <a href="https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/rpc-api/?ref=blog.ceramic.network#snap_getentropy">getEntropy</a> method is used to derive them deterministically without compromising the security of crypto accounts. It is enough for the user to have the MetaMask mnemonic to retrieve and decrypt all her RariMe credentials.</p><p></p><p>This solution has the following advantages:</p>  Data is instantly synced between all devices that use the same MetaMask mnemonic  There is no need for manual backups because the data in Compose DB is durable  Straightforward UX, no extra steps or passwords required  Local storage capacity does not limit the maximum number of credentials. ComposeDB is scalable enough to handle millions of credentials   Try it Out <p>Test out RariMe by downloading it and by generating a Rarimo Proof-of-Humanity credential, which you can store inside your RariMe and use to gain access to gated human-only spaces, including a VIP Rarimo discord channel.&nbsp;</p><p>Download RariMe here: <a href="https://rarime.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">https://rarime.com/</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Prove your humanity here: <a href="https://robotornot.rarimo.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">https://robotornot.rarimo.com/</a></p>

<p>Digital transformation is projected to grow from $1.69 trillion in 2023 to $4.46 trillion by 2030. The internet makes duplication almost costless. Therefore, the challenge is how to create scarcity, which is crucial for establishing value and, in turn, enables monetisation and the development of new digital asset markets online. Piracy costs the global economy $1.13 trillion yearly, with U.S. video piracy losses up to $71 billion annually and job losses up to 560,000. Most online music is downloaded illegally (95%), and unlicensed software usage exceeds 50% in many countries.</p>
<p>The Digital Rights Management (DRM) market, valued at $3.6 billion, is expected to reach $24.63 billion by 2030. Traditional DRM, while attempting to protect digital assets, often imposes centralised control, creating bottlenecks and reducing the agility needed in today’s rapidly evolving digital space, raising significant issues around ownership, intrinsic value, and fair compensation. Revenue splits favour gatekeepers, such as YouTube, which retains 45%, and Google AdSense 50%; software, app, and music stores take 30% cuts.</p>
<p>As we witness the exponential growth of digital technologies, the need for decentralised identity for scalability and enhanced security in commerce becomes more pronounced. Blockchain technology is projected to reach $1.43 trillion by 2030, and the NFT market $231 billion.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="http://ela.city">Elacity</a> revolutionises digital rights management by leveraging blockchain and the <a href="https://elastos.dev/">Elastos SmartWeb</a> technology, ensuring secure, scarce, and valuable digital assets. It aligns with the Access Economy, focusing on monetising access to private property over direct ownership, delivering business models to Web3. A comparison in the real world is using Airbnb to monetise your home, or Grab for your vehicle. Picture traditional DRM online as giving someone else the keys to your home (content), and letting them control access and profits for a big fee. What’s worse is everyone globally relies on just a few people to do this.</p>
<p>Elacity, in contrast, is like having a secure access system: you control who enters and monetise directly through a global market. This approach offers creators transparency, control, and fair compensation up to 95%, marking a proactive step towards a future of seamless, equitable digital asset management. You can read their ‘<a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elacity-web3-whitepaper-the-access-economy-in-web3/">Access Economy in Web3</a>‘ whitepaper, here is an overview;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Decentralised DRM System: Elacity introduces a user-owned, decentralised DRM system for asset monetisation in the Web3 environment. This approach contrasts sharply with traditional DRM systems, which often rely on centralised license servers and control mechanisms. 
 Digital Capsules: A core feature of Elacity is the use of ‘Digital Capsules’—encrypted digital goods stored on decentralised networks. These capsules contain digital assets ranging from music, videos, software, and other forms of digital content. 
 Tokenisation of Rights: Elacity employs tokenisation to represent different rights and values associated with digital content. This includes:
 
 Access Tokens: These are scarce tokens embedded with specific rights, allowing the trading of access and retrieval of encrypted licenses directly from smart contracts. 
 Royalty Tokens: These tokens enable immediate revenue sharing from access token trading to royalty token holders. 
 Distribution Rights Tokens: These tokens define specific rights associated with access tokens, such as resale percentage, derivative rights, or transfer restrictions. 
 
 
 Blockchain and Smart Contracts: Elacity leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and immutable record-keeping. Smart contracts automate license issuance and facilitate immediate royalty payments, enhancing efficiency over traditional systems. 
 Global Digital Asset Exchange: The platform serves as a marketplace for digital assets, allowing for the exchange of these assets with scarce, tradable access and ownership rights. 
 Integration with Advanced Technologies: Elacity integrates advanced technologies like Elastos SmartWeb and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), reinforcing its commitment to decentralised and secure digital asset management. 
 Benefits for Stakeholders: Elacity offers numerous advantages, particularly for content creators and owners, such as:
 
 Creator Autonomy: It provides global control and monetisation opportunities for owners. 
 Web3 Business Models: The platform supports various business models, like buy or rent, in a decentralised marketplace. 
 Real-Time Payment and Licensing Efficiency: Payments are processed in real-time, and licensing is more efficient compared to centralised systems. 
 Enhanced Security and Privacy: Leveraging decentralised technologies, Elacity ensures enhanced security and privacy for users and their digital assets. 
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exponential growth of digital technologies underscores the need for systems like Elacity that adapt quickly. Blockchain, NFTs, and decentralised finance (DeFi) are pivotal in this new era, offering solutions for creating digital scarcity, automating complex agreements through smart contracts, and ensuring interoperability and scalability.</p>
<p>On the 9th of January, Elacity will be launching DRM for video on Elastos, offering Bella holders exclusive access to mint video capsules and providing a global access token marketplace for anyone to buy and watch video content back using their decentralised identity.

  DID Rotation  <p>Understanding DID Rotation: Transitioning between DID Methods</p>
     
  <p>In the realm of digital identity, the concept of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) stands as a cornerstone. DIDs are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, self-sovereign digital identities. This blog post explores possibilities to transition between different DID Methods and invites DID method implementors to join this journey towards more robust, interoperable, and secure digital identities.</p>
  
  What is DID Rotation?     
  <p>DID Rotation refers to the process of updating or changing a Decentralized Identifier (DID) while maintaining the continuity and integrity of the digital identity it signifies. This procedure is essential for various reasons, including enhancing security, adhering to emerging standards, or transitioning to a more sophisticated infrastructure. To facilitate DID Rotation effectively, we have identified three fundamental requirements for a DID method:</p>
  
     DID Rotation Requirements   DID-ROT #1: The original DID must include a reference to the new DID.<br>
(Motivation: enable resolver to switch between DID methods)  DID-ROT #2: The new DID must include a reference to the original DID.<br>
(Motivation: provide provenance &amp; legitimacy)  DID-ROT #3: There must be a proof that the original DID is deactivated upon rotation.<br>
(Motivation: prohibit forks)    
  An Example Implementation: did:oyd to did:ebsi     
  <p><code>did:oyd</code> was developed by OwnYourData and provides a self-sustained environment for managing decentralised identifiers. The <code>did:oyd</code> method links the identifier cryptographically to the DID Document and through also cryptographically linked provenance information in a public log it ensures resolving to the latest valid version of the DID Document. This is in contrast to other DID methods which are based on blockchain technology and provide a trust anchor based on the respective governance of the used ledger for handling sensitive data.</p>
<p><code>did:ebsi</code> is part of the European Union’s efforts to build a secure and interoperable blockchain infrastructure. It operates on a pan-European network of nodes, ensuring robustness and security. The technology encompasses APIs, smart contracts, and a decentralized ledger, which are used across various use cases to provide trusted information for business processes.</p>
<p>The <code>did:oyd</code> method offers a low-entry barrier for generating a large number of DIDs) proving particularly useful in scenarios where blockchain access is impractical. However, there are instances where the requirements and conditions evolve, necessitating existing identifiers to meet specific governance standards that are beyond the capabilities of this DID method.</p>
  
  Process     
  <p>A process that meets the aforementioned requirements can be outlined in the following four steps, as illustrated below:</p>
 
 Start with an existing/original DID 
 Create New DID: establish a new DID to replace the old one 
 Update Original DID: link the old DID to the new one for resolvers to find the new DID 
 Deactivate Original DID: deactivate the original DID to avoid forks 
 Update New DID: finally, update the new DID with references to the original, ensuring a seamless transition 
 
  
    
  Example     
  <p>The following DID demonstrates resolving a <code>did:oyd</code> to a <code>did:ebsi</code> document:</p>
<p><code><a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:oyd:zQmZ7wwgCxkExNeXHm9XLxAKs7Y7pubTKCHQLTxRrA3Fz51">did:oyd:zQmZ7wwgCxkExNeXHm9XLxAKs7Y7pubTKCHQLTxRrA3Fz51</a></code></p>
<p>And as reference here links to the respective DID Documents:</p>
 
 <a href="https://github.com/OwnYourData/oydid/blob/main/docs/res/did_oyd_orig-rot.jsonld">Original <code>did:oyd</code></a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/OwnYourData/oydid/blob/main/docs/res/did_ebsi_new-rot.jsonld">New <code>did:ebsi</code></a> 
 
  
  Resolution Process     
  <p>The resolution process for DID Rotation involves extending implementations with a <code>follow-alsoKnownAs=TRUE</code> flag that instructs the resolver to correctly interpret the <code>alsoKnownAs</code> attribute in DID Documents. This flag ensures that when a DID is updated or rotated, the resolution process continues to recognize and track the previous DID, linking it to the new one. Essentially, by setting <code>follow-alsoKnownAs=TRUE</code>, the system maintains a connection between the old and new DIDs, thereby preserving the continuity and historical integrity of the digital identity throughout the rotation process.</p>
  
  Call to Action

<p>Gemini is a cryptocurrency exchange and custodian, founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss in 2014. Gemini enables its users to transact both via a website as well as mobile apps to buy, sell and store cryptocurrency assets.</p>



<p>The Challenge/ Use Case</p>



<p>As a financial services vendor in a space that is highly targeted by criminals, the need for strong authentication is paramount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gemini’s security efforts are led by Chief Security Officer Dave Damato who is no stranger to the security industry and previously worked at security incident response firm Mandiant.</p>



<p>“So much of my career has been really focused on preventing and responding to incidents and strong two factor authentication is at the core preventing most of those attacks,” Damato said (in a session at the Authenticate Financial Services Summit). “It’s also why I’m so very enthusiastic about FIDO.”</p>



<p>How Gemini Uses FIDO To Secure Its Users</p>



<p>Gemini wanted to provide its users with the strongest level of security authentication to help minimize risk.</p>



<p>While using an SMS based two factor approach can be better than just a username and password, given the high value of a Gemini account, attackers might well go through the steps necessary to bypass SMS two factor. Beginning in 2019, Gemini began offering its customers the highest level of security possible and it did this by starting to support the FIDO2 authentication standard.</p>



<p>“FIDO2 is designed to overcome challenges and dramatically increase the cost for an attacker,” Damato said. “There’s no password that can be shared by our customers and that’s why FIDO2 is phishing resistant.”</p>



<p>Benefits</p>



<p>For Gemini, the use of FIDO2 provides a series of tangible risk mitigation benefits that helps to reduce the attack surface. Instead of needing to rely on a One-Time Password (OTP), SMS or backup codes, Gemini users can benefit from a more user-friendly FIDO2 powered experience.</p>



<p>Among the most common types of attack is credential stuffing, where an attacker makes use of passwords lost or stolen from one site, to re-use or ‘stuff’ into another. With FIDO, that risk is minimized for Gemini. Since FIDO strong authentication is based on cryptography and not a shared secret, even if a user reuses a password, the deployment of FIDO will minimize the risk significantly.</p>



<p>“The benefit to me as a company is that I don’t actually have to store, manage credentials or worry about other breaches, where credentials have been stolen,” Damato said.</p>

<p>As we eagerly anticipate the release of <a href="https://ela.city/">Elacity</a> DRM next week, it’s an opportune moment to address some of the most frequently asked questions surrounding this groundbreaking monetisation framework. Elacity delivers a protocol that helps people who create digital content – like videos, music, or software – to manage and make money from their creations in a new and modern way. It uses a special digital rights management system with blockchain technology that lets creators control who can access their work and ensures they get paid fairly and quickly when others use it. This system is designed to work globally, giving creators more freedom and flexibility in how they share and sell their digital products, a stark contrast to popular platforms today which take up to 50% in fees, control narratives and payout every few months. What to learn more about Elacity? Let’s jump into some FAQs!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is Elacity and how will it revolutionize the Access Economy?</p>
<p>Elacity is a pioneering platform delivering the <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elacity-web3-whitepaper-the-access-economy-in-web3/">Access Economy</a> to the Web3 space. It revolutionizes how digital assets are accessed and traded by introducing ‘Digital Capsules’—encrypted digital content stored on decentralized networks. These capsules come with scarce, tradable access rights, enforced through blockchain technology, allowing creators and organizations to directly monetize their digital assets in a global decentralized marketplace. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems, offering a more secure, transparent, and equitable model for managing digital assets.</p>
<p>These developments will enable creators to market, promote and monetize their content directly to their audiences, completely eliminating any reliance on intermediaries; in effect, bringing artists much closer to their audiences and finally removing third-party terms, conditions and ‘retentions’ which have traditionally limited creators’ ability to control and earn from their work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on the concept of Digital Capsules?</p>
<p>Digital Capsules are the core of Elacity’s offering. They are digital assets, ranging from videos, music, and documents, to software, that are encrypted and packaged for secure distribution. These capsules are stored on decentralized networks like the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and are accessed using unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent various rights – access, distribution, and royalties. This ensures that the assets are protected against unauthorized use while facilitating a fair and transparent marketplace for creators and consumers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does Elacity’s Access Economy Protocol (AEP) work?</p>
<p>The Access Economy Protocol (AEP) is a decentralized user-owned DRM system, integral to Elacity. It automates license issuance and facilitates immediate royalty payments. AEP operates by encrypting digital content into Digital Capsules, distributing these on decentralized networks, and utilizing smart contracts to manage and trade access, ownership, and distribution rights. This enables real-time payment, licensing efficiency, and direct creator-consumer connections, fundamentally transforming the way digital assets are managed and monetized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the benefits of Elacity’s model for content creators?</p>
<p>Content creators benefit significantly from Elacity’s model. It provides creator autonomy, allowing them to have global control and monetization opportunities through decentralized IDs. Creators can choose their own business models, from one-time sales to subscriptions, and receive instant payments directly to their decentralized finance wallets. Additionally, the tokenization aspect of Elacity turns access and ownership rights into scarce, tradable units, opening new avenues for revenue generation. Additionally, distribution rights allow for re-sale percentages to be assigned to access rights holders, providing transparent secondary markets where everyone is immediately paid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement refers to ‘future developments’ to integrate this mechanism with Elastos’ BeL2 Bitcoin Layer 2? What are these developments, what are the timelines and at what point will creators be able to transact directly in Bitcoin?&nbsp;</p>
<p>BeL2 is a Layer 2 protocol that connects Bitcoin with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) technology. It integrates with Elastos SmartWeb technology to enhance Bitcoin’s scalability, programmability, and privacy. This integration is achieved through the use of zero-knowledge proofs and smart contracts. Elacity is contractually leading this innovation with 10 separate engineers. The plan includes incorporating the Access Economy Protocol into this environment, aiming to unlock over $850 billion in dormant value through a Bitcoin Layer 2-powered access economy. We anticipate BeL2’s connection, with creators starting to transact and use Bitcoin on Elacity, in Q3 2024.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How will subscribers (or purchasers/resellers) be verified on the DRM system? How does Elacity ensure compliance and ethical considerations in its marketplace?</p>
<p>Elacity employs a sophisticated reputation system using verifiable credentials and zero-knowledge proofs. This ensures legal compliance and consumer protection, allowing users to verify their identity and age without compromising privacy. The platform’s commitment to ethical standards is evident in its support for parental controls and compliance, making it a trusted and secure environment for digital asset transactions.</p>
<p>For instance, those who publish will need to perform KYC checks and get a verifiable credential which can be shared as a zero-knowledge proof to publish on Elacity’s AEP protocol – this is where partnerships are also so important.&nbsp; Everyone is legally liable in their own countries, so we need to be careful not to make this a place for illegal content. It’s also important to understand Elacity can both be a monetization layer and a privacy layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, you might encrypt a video into a video capsule and create unique economics with access tokens around it for trading globally. Or you might create a video capsule with just 1 access token which you own, this now is a privacy layer for your data, gatekeepers like Google or even the Elacity team can’t view this data, which provides ethical considerations around decentralisation, your privacy and online rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How will the availability of Elacity DRM be rolled out in the market?</p>
<p>Initially, only Bella holders can mint video capsules. This is free to gather feedback on our new technology and manage costs associated with our IPFS node. This framework sets the groundwork for future decentralization and scalability. Next in Feburary, Bella holders can create affiliate links for external users to mint for free, allowing them to negotiate content publishing terms and earn a commission. Bella holders will also oversee content to ensure legality, acting as a governing layer with opportunities to earn immediate income from sales.</p>
<p>Finally, we will integrate Elabox and third-party cloud providers for easy IPFS node deployment and management. Users can then host their own shops, upload content independently, and be legally responsible for their content, decentralising the network. Cloud providers will offer extra bandwidth and global content availability as services in Elacity. This stage will also require KYC verification using zero-knowledge proofs for compliance and age-restricted content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All capsules uploaded on Elacity’s IPFS node prior is interoperable, enabling users to download and host on their new personal nodes. Consumers may also host nodes to download and store purchased content. The scalability of Elacity’s DRM will be addressed progressively, moving towards a fully decentralized access economy protocol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does this announcement reflect Elastos’ vision for a SmartWeb?</p>
<p>In Elastos’ vision for Web3, Rong Chen birthed the term ‘<a href="https://elastos.info/blog/rong-chen-and-the-evolution-of-the-internet-from-arpanet-to-web3-part-2/">SmartWeb</a>’, a category which transforms the Internet into a user-driven, digital ecosystem for asset ownership. It’s about merging decentralised technology and security, transitioning from centralised control to a more democratic space where users own and control their data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, with BeL2 technology, we will be able to issue and trade assets directly using BTC, with the security of these assets directly protected by BTC miners. Simultaneously, we can trade these assets on the Elastos SmartWeb and program them for new markets. This applies not only to video content, as in this example, but also extends to all forms of creative content, including books, films, music, and art.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does Elacity integrate with current Web3 and blockchain trends, particularly NFTs?</p>
<p>Elacity is at the forefront of integrating Web3 and blockchain innovations, particularly NFTs. It combines a decentralised DRM system for encryption and decryption with tokenization, where Access Tokens, Royalty Tokens, and Distribution Rights Tokens, all forms of NFTs, represent different rights and values of digital assets. This aligns with the scarcity and tradability principles of digital assets in the Web3 space, allowing for their trade in a global marketplace. NFTs in Elacity not only symbolize ownership but also immediately enforce the terms set by content creators, like usage rights and resale percentages, reflecting the unique capabilities of blockchain technology in managing digital rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the future prospects and expansion plans for Elacity?</p>
<p>Elacity’s roadmap includes expanding its framework beyond the current focus on video capsules to encompass a wider range of digital assets, such as music, ebooks, gaming, and software. The platform plans to support diverse business models, including subscription, pay-per-view, and free access with ad support. Future developments also involve enabling the expansion of ‘runtime,’ a secure execution environment that checks the blockchain for access rights before decrypting a capsule. For video and audio markets, we built a runtime media player that executes locally on a user’s device and communicates with decentralized storage nodes. Additionally, we have developed a proof of concept runtime for a virtual computer. Elacity’s vision is to become a decentralized computing platform that is loaded on demand, utilizing decentralized identities. This platform is underpinned by our access economy model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will Elacity disrupt or partner with Web2 creative platforms such as YouTube and Spotify?</p>
<p>In their own way, such platforms disrupted and transformed not merely the distribution of content, but how and why it was created.&nbsp; However, inconsistencies and incoherences remained, particularly in the case of Youtube which built a business monetizing content which was never necessarily ceded or authorized to them by the original creators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such platforms also remain essentially centralized intermediaries with the ability to control and sanction content according to their personal terms and agenda; all the time extracting a ‘tithe’ for doing so (in terms of proportion of advertising revenue or other analytics).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today’s announcement will provide video artists with a mechanism to promote and monetise their content directly with their audiences, on mutually agreeable terms, eliminating the dependence on any type of intermediary (wither in terms of traditional publishing, or Web2 services such as Youtube or Spotify).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s perfectly conceivable that such incumbent services will continue to promote and monetize artists’ content, but the arrival of a ‘direct’ alternative will reduce artists’ dependence on a third-party-based business model which may not be optimized for their interests, as well as bringing them in direct contact with their audiences.&nbsp; It could be the start of a new, much more intimate relationship between content creators and the communities that sustain them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How Will Elacity impact on traditional legal rights and ownership models?</p>
<p>See above.&nbsp; The Elastos model ensure that the last word remains with the creator and owner of the content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who owns the data rights within the Elacity ecosystem?</p>
<p>In the Elacity ecosystem, data rights ownership is straightforward. The creators or owners of digital assets retain the rights. These assets are encapsulated into ‘Digital Capsules’, and their ownership is registered and validated on a blockchain as unique tokens. This method ensures that ownership rights are clear, transparent, and secure, adhering to the core principles of Web3 which emphasize decentralization and user control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do the access tokens ensure an inclusive approach to Web3?&nbsp; Are they not elitist?</p>
<p>Access Tokens in Elacity are designed to democratize access to digital assets, akin to how physical goods are traded in the real world. For example, when you buy a book or a music CD, you can resell it; Elacity replicates this freedom for digital content. These tokens are tradable and represent specific access rights embedded within smart contracts. Unlike traditional digital platforms where purchased content often remains non-transferable and locked to the user, Elacity’s approach allows for the resale and transfer of digital assets, echoing the flexibility we have with physical goods.</p>
<p>While it might seem that requiring tokens for access could be elitist, in reality, this system enables a more inclusive and flexible approach. By tokenizing access, Elacity allows a wide range of economic models, from direct sales to rentals, thereby catering to different user preferences and financial capabilities. Moreover, Elacity’s system incorporates Ownership Tokens, which confer royalty rights. Owners of these tokens receive a share of the revenue generated from the asset, and these tokens can also be traded in the marketplace. This inclusive and flexible approach, facilitated by tokenization, lowers barriers to entry and opens up new economic models, ranging from direct sales to rentals, catering to diverse user preferences and financial capacities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does Elacity address or add to concerns about AI ownership?</p>
<p>Elacity contributes positively to the discourse on AI ownership by providing a transparent and decentralized framework for managing intellectual property rights in AI models. For instance, consider a scenario where users or organizations develop a bespoke AI model, which is their intellectual property. Using Elacity, they can package this AI model into an AI Capsule and sell access to it directly on a global marketplace. In this environment, distinct from current AI ecosystems, every time someone purchases access to the AI model, all contributors who hold Ownership Tokens tied to that model receive payment automatically.</p>
<p>This mechanism ensures that revenue is fairly distributed among all stakeholders, including those who contributed data or expertise to the AI model. The rights and usage terms are encoded into smart contracts on the blockchain, making them immutable and easily traceable. This setup not only clarifies AI ownership but also ensures that all contributing parties are equitably compensated, addressing one of the key concerns in the current AI landscape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is the data stored and security mechanisms created for content and payments?</p>
<p>In Elacity, data storage and security are handled through a combination of blockchain technology, decentralized file systems, and advanced encryption standards. Digital Capsules are stored on decentralized networks like the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer storage and content delivery network, ensuring resilience and reducing risks associated with centralized storage. The use of blockchain for recording ownership and transactions adds an additional layer of security. Content and payments are secured through smart contracts on the blockchain, providing transparent, immutable, and efficient transactions. The advanced encryption standard is employed for content encryption, ensuring the secure packaging of digital assets.</p>

<p>Dear Sir or Madam</p>
<p>My name is Nat Sakimura, and I am the Chairman of the <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation (Foundation)</a>1 and am one of the Chairs of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group (FAPI WG)</a>2. The OpenID Foundation would like to thank the CFPB for the opportunity to provide feedback on the recent draft Open Banking 1033 Rulemaking, and provide ongoing support as may be useful in your due process.</p>
 Introduction 
<p>The OpenID Foundation is a non-profit organization whose mission is to lead the global community in creating open standards that are secure, interoperable and privacy-preserving. As part of that mission, the OpenID Foundation closely collaborates with several significant ecosystems internationally that have Open Banking and Consumer Financial data sharing systems requirements, and, in some cases, the OpenID Foundation provides services to help those ecosystems operate and scale their deployments.</p>
<p>Delivery of Open Banking on a national basis is a big challenge. The complexity of multi-party ecosystems that process millions of transactions should not be underestimated. In the financial services security and privacy are critical concerns for consumers and are important in maintaining the reputation of the ecosystem. The costs arising from meeting these requirements can be challenging to manage and the burden of those costs should not fall unfairly on any entity type as that will reduce participation and limit the overall success of the ecosystem. The use of open standards that have had input from hundreds of industry experts, have been through formal security assessment, can be delivered using off-the-shelf software components, and have been demonstrated to successfully support Open Banking ecosystems elsewhere, and that demonstrably achieve positive outcomes for millions of consumers can help minimize both cost and risk overall. The OpenID Foundation provides highly applicable open standards, years of hands-on experience and supporting services to several Open Banking and Consumer Data right ecosystems around the globe.</p>
<p>We have structured our feedback in two ways, one being along a number of themes, the second being by specifically addressing a number of the specific questions that the CFPB included in their consultation paperwork. These are attached as a spreadsheet.</p>

 How the OpenID Foundation can contribute 
 
 Standardized “Communication Protocol” &amp; security 
 
 The most important item of feedback that the OpenID Foundation would like to offer is that use of an open industry standard, or “Standardized Communication Protocol”, should be required within the CFPB 1033 rulemaking. We define this “Standardized Communication Protocol” in the context of Open Banking as “the secure exchange of messages between the Consumer, Data Provider and the Third Party for the purpose of consumer authorization of access to data and services, and subsequent issuance of a Secure Access Token to the Third Party”. 
 The Communication Protocol is critically important for maintaining the security of data being passed (security being a feature that is focussed on preventing unauthorized access or modification). 
 A proven, rigorously tested open standard based Standardized Communication Protocol protects all ecosystem participants and addresses the need to authorize access to data and services, orchestrate authentication and provide Secure Access Tokens. These capabilities should be included by the CFPB as requirements of a Standardized Communication Protocol for Open Banking. 
 Without a Standardized Communication Protocol there is a significant cost incurred by all parties, but most notably by third parties’ where integration costs compound due to multiple different implementations provided by the Data Providers. The result of this being market dynamics that favor the largest entities over the smallest. 
 
<p>The OpenID Foundation provides one example of a Standardized Communication Protocol: the “FAPI profile of OpenID Connect.” This standard has been selected by many public and private Open Finance, Open Data, and Consumer Data Right ecosystems (e.g. the Australian Consumer Data Right, Australia’s ConnectID, UK Open Banking, Brazil Open Banking, Brazil Open Insurance, Saudi Arabia Open Banking, UAE Open Finance, USA FDX, Canada FDX, and HelseID Norway). These standards are proven at scale in many production deployments, both regulatory-driven and commercial. As a result, the OpenID Foundation has first-hand experience observing the pitfalls faced by ecosystems that lacked Standardized Communication Protocol mandates vs the benefits to those that had mandates.</p>
<p>In short, the OpenID Foundation strongly recommends the CFPB mandate use of a qualified industry Standardized Communication Protocol with a clear definition of its features in the final rule.</p>
 Conformance &amp; certification 
<p>The OpenID Foundation’s experience of working with multiple Open Banking ecosystems shows that while standards are very important they need support from complementary tools and services, specifically conformance testing tools and certification services.</p>
<p>The delivery of secure and interoperable Communication Protocol depends on Data Providers and third parties implementing it consistently and correctly. This can be tested empirically through the use of conformance testing tools. Tests significantly reduce time to detect implementation errors and reduce the cost and complexity for all parties. Public certification of conformance significantly increases the chances of interoperability being delivered across an ecosystem and provides evidence that the security aspects of the protocol have been implemented correctly too, increasing all parties’ confidence in the ecosystem as a whole.</p>
<p>In ecosystems that went ahead without a requirement for conformance testing, there were issues with interoperability and security. Where conformance testing is performed there have been several instances where significant security issues have been identified earlier in the lifecycle and were privately shared back to the Data Provider or Third Party to remediate prior to production deployment of vulnerable services.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation provides open source conformance testing tools for various specifications (including all versions of FAPI). These tools are written in close collaboration with the standards authors and contributors. While CFPB or nominated technical support partners can write their own conformance testing tools, re-use of existing test tools further reduces cost, risk, and time-to-market for implementations that use these OpenID Foundation maintained Standardized Communication Protocols. There is also a possibility to collaborate on specific additional CFPB or Qualified Industry Standards body requirements.</p>
<p>It is the recommendation of the OpenID Foundation that the CFPB rules should state that all ecosystem participants have their production implementations certified as conformant to the Standardized Communications Protocol prior to launch and periodically thereafter (we recommend at least annually) in order that implementations mitigate risks around interoperability and security. The certification should be backed by successful use of empirical testing conformance tools. As seen in other ecosystems, if this is not a clear requirement there is a significant risk that implementation errors will persist for longer than necessary and adverse consumer outcomes arise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the OpenID Foundation recommends that conformance testing results be published publicly to improve consumer trust and transparency.</p>
 Software availability and cost 
<p>When ecosystems and implementers elsewhere have been considering how to deliver Open Banking the question of cost has arisen and it is worth stating that there is a less obvious benefit of having a Standardized Communication Protocol. Software vendors now offer “off-the-shelf” components that can deliver existing Standardized Communication Protocols needed, this often reduces the cost of implementation. Using an existing, widely deployed Standardized Communication Protocol has the additional benefit of reducing the time to market for that ecosystem as well as capitalizing on existing skills and experience developed in the delivery of Open Banking elsewhere. The final significant cost reduction factor relating to a Standardized Communication Protocol is that Third Parties in particular can not only use off-the-shelf components but re-use it across their integrations with multiple Data Providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Entity metadata and trust 
<p>One area that seems absent from the rule making is how Data Providers may make reasonable decisions about whether to trust a Third Party that connects to them. The way the rules are currently drafted, it seems that this is a decision that is left up to each Data Provider. This could become a significant source of risk and cost to both the Data Providers as well as the consumers as Data Providers individually take decisions about third party access. It may even result in significant cost for Third Parties as they may be required to go through bi-lateral due-diligence procedures with many Data Providers in order to sufficiently mitigate these risks. An alternative approach would be to allow for some intermediary to define and apply supporting processes, and technology to do due-diligence on third parties and provide a streamlined system for establishing trust between third parties and data providers. If this is done in concert with a qualified industry standard communication protocol then the communication of that entity’s technical metadata will also allow much quicker technical integration once the due-diligence is done.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation recommends adding in additional rules to address how trust can be established in an interoperable and scalable fashion without bilateral, point-to-point trust requirements. This allows entities to onboard once, have a source of truth for trust and configuration that uses a standard communication protocol. It is also recommended to have a qualified industry standard specific to the exchange of this trust information and the associated integration details. The OpenID Foundation develops and maintains standards for this purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Lifecycle of standards 
<p>One topic that has been challenging and should be considered carefully in the rulemaking is striking a balance between the use of a small number of critical standards and the agility of the ecosystem when it comes to change over time. To future-proof the rulemaking, it would be appropriate for the rules to include a mechanism for on-going maintenance and versioning of qualified industry standards in a way that the benefits of standardization are realized, while mitigating the risk of inertia and cost of change to the ecosystem. To this end, we recommend the following processes are established:</p>
 
 Review proposed changes to the qualified industry standards at an ecosystem level and in partnership with relevant standards bodies, balancing the impact of change against the benefits that may be realized via the updates. 
 Process to ensure conformance to the updated standards. The current practice is a cadence of regular standards review, followed by a notice period on standards and any changes to requirements, and then a period of conformance and certification to ensure implementations reflect the updated requirements. 
 
<p>Failure to account for the lifecycle of standards can lead to resistance by key ecosystem participants who seek to minimize conformance costs at the expense of security, operational and user experience benefits. From a national perspective, this inflexibility can also reduce US competitiveness, when global open banking and open data use cases emerge and ecosystems seek to interoperate. As an example, domestic implementations of FAPI 1 and other standards like India’s UPI are not currently interoperable, but the use cases and path to global interoperability are emerging as domestic deployments mature. This global landscape and path to global interoperability is discussed in the 2023 OIDF whitepaper <a href="https://openid.net/2023/02/06/final-version-of-open-banking-and-open-data-ready-to-cross-borders-whitepaper-published/">“Open Banking, Open Data:</a> <a href="https://openid.net/2023/02/06/final-version-of-open-banking-and-open-data-ready-to-cross-borders-whitepaper-published/">Ready to Cross Borders?”</a>3.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation manages the lifecycle of its specifications in an open collaborative forum with a clearly documented process. Representatives of user communities around the world participate and their interests and needs are taken into account. The latest version of the OpenID Foundation’s Communications Protocol (FAPI 2.0 Security Profile) is currently going to a membership vote on “Final”, having successfully gone through previous stages of the process, including formal security analysis. As an example of good lifecycle management, having analyzed the benefits, many ecosystems are updating their roadmaps to migrate to FAPI 2.0.</p>
<p>3 https://openid.net/2023/02/06/final-version-of-open-banking-and-open-data-ready-to-cross-borders-wh itepaper-published/</p>
 Digital identity attributes 
<p>The current rule on Open Banking includes “Basic Account Information” in the scope. If this information remains in scope, then the CFPB should be able to answer the following questions affirmatively, as any answers to the contrary may have unintended consequences.</p>
 
 If Basic Account Information g. “name, address, email address, and phone number” are requested, is there the intent or even a requirement for this PII data to be requested separately with separate and explicit informed consent of this PII by the user? 
 If Basic Account Information g. “name, address, email address, and phone number” are requested, are there security requirements for Third Parties holding this information, how it can be used (e.g. a relevant purpose / use case) and are there requirements on Data Providers disclosing it (e.g. a higher authentication assurance level to share the PII vs bank account information), as this information arguably has additional risks relating to identity theft. 
 
<p>The scope of the CFPB is clearly financial services and attributes such as “name, address, email address, and phone number” are typically maintained by financial services organizations for communication with the customer and fraud mitigation purposes. There is a risk that including this information in the rule might allow a pseudo-assured identity market to emerge based on this basic account verification information. If this is the intent of the CFPB, then we recommend guidance for (1) and (2) to avert unintended outcomes, and ensure the user’s data rights are respected and this sensitive data is suitably protected. If it is not the intent of the CFPB to enable identity assurance use cases (based on ‘AML backed” digital identity data), we recommend the CFPB clarify the intent of the rule making and to make more explicit the use cases that are in and out of scope of the rulemaking.</p>
<p>Separately, the current requirement for Data Providers to “make available covered data when it receives information sufficient to: Authenticate the consumer’s identity…” is not very explicit about authentication and could be interpreted in various ways, some of which could have a significant risk of the incorrect consumer being identified and consequently consumer finance data being inadequately protected. A range of standards for consumer authentication that are sufficiently robust for use in financial services exist and all of these involve the consumer authenticating directly to each party rather than doing so via a third party. It is done this way mainly for enabling a variety of options for secure authentication and ensuring that consumer credentials do not need to be shared with a third party.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation does not address authentication directly other than requiring authentication to be done when the FAPI profile is used. This permits a range of choices for Authentication to be provided in the context of the Standardized Communication Protocol and Authentication of the consumer by the Data Provider directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The OpenID Foundation contribution 
<p>In accordance with our mission and vision, the OpenID Foundation will continue to actively engage with US market stakeholders (as we do with any market engaging in Open Data) to support the local market development, support due-diligence checks of our specifications, and adapt our operational capabilities to serve local ecosystems. In context of the current rules, the OpenID Foundation is keen to continue engaging and innovating along with key stakeholders in the US market, including the CFPB. The OIDF is willing to act as a Qualified Industry Standard Body or participate as part of a consortium that jointly act as a Qualified Industry Standards Body, or play both roles as required by the US market participants.</p>
<p>Should any OpenID Foundation standards be selected by any Qualified Industry Standards Body (either directly or as part of joint offering) there would be no charge for access to or use of OpenID Foundation specifications. Similarly, there is open source conformance testing software provided to test implementations of the key OpenID Foundation standards. These Open Source tools are made available to all for free. The OpenID Foundation also currently operates a cloud instance of the conformance testing tools that can be used by any party free of charge.</p>
<p>Self-certification of conformance to key standards can be asserted and published on the OpenID Foundation website for a small fee. To support ecosystems with deployment, we are also open to ecosystem-specific, strategic partnerships to deliver local stakeholder requirements.</p>
<p>Should any organization or individual wish to contribute to the OpenID Foundation’s on-going developments or maintenance of FAPI and related standards the only requirement would be the signing of the Intellectual Property Rights agreement, membership and fees do not apply. That said, membership of the OpenID Foundation entitles three key benefits: voting on the specifications at key milestones in their lifecycle, a significant discount on self-certification, and the opportunity to direct funds to projects of benefit to the OpenID Foundation community.</p>
<p>Please see attached our detailed comments on the CFPB rulemaking. We would be delighted to clarify any points in this cover letter or the attached documents, just contact us via <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org.</a></p>

<p>Dear Elastos Community,</p>
<p>In a recent legal development, as of December 26th, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has issued a Final Order and Judgment in the case involving the Elastos Foundation, Feng Han, and Rong Chen. This judgment represents a pivotal moment in the proceedings, marking the resolution of the claims against Elastos and the individual defendants.</p>
<p>The case revolved around allegations from plaintiffs Mark Owen and James Wandling, who asserted that the defendants had violated sections of the Securities Act of 1933 by selling and soliciting unregistered ELA cryptocurrency tokens. The court’s recent action brings closure to these claims against Elastos and the individual defendants. This conclusion represents a significant turn in the case, outlining the boundary of resolved issues.</p>
<p>As we near the end of this significant legal chapter, it’s important for members of the Elastos community to be aware of ongoing opportunities and developments. A proposed settlement of $2 million to resolve these claims means that if you purchased or acquired ELA tokens between January 1, 2018, and July 27, 2023, you might be entitled to a share of this settlement. If you believe you are eligible and affected by this case, the court is still open to accepting class claims. Your participation is important, and we recommend you to take action.</p>

<p>FIDO Alliance’s Andrew Shikiar emphasises the need for enterprises to adapt cybersecurity strategies due to rising AI-driven social engineering threats and a push for greater cyber-transparency. Traditional methods like company-wide phishing training may become inadequate. Shikiar suggests reducing reliance on passwords and adopting passkeys, either synced or device-bound, as a more secure and user-friendly authentication approach.</p>

<p>Target is a retailer with locations across the U.S as well as online ecommerce operations. Target also provides loyalty and credit card services to its customers.</p>



<p>The Challenge/ Use Case</p>



<p>The initial use case for FIDO at Target was to help enable a secure login experience across applications at the company, as part of a broader platform modernization effort.</p>



<p>Target’s challenge was to provide a consistent and secure login experience across applications at Target, to provide a seamless experience to its users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We had to reduce friction, wherever possible, be it in the authentication flow by reducing the dependencies on passwords, or in the onboarding process by making it easier for applications and business owners to easily consume the enterprise authentication services,” explained Nataraj Rao, Principal Engineer for Security Solutions at Target.</p>



<p>How Target Uses FIDO To Secure Its Users</p>



<p>Target initially integrated a FIDO server with its Single Sign On (SSO) platform to provide multi-factor strong authentication capabilities.</p>



<p>“Support for a wide variety of authenticators makes it possible for team members to choose from a wide variety of authenticators and avoids a scenario where they are not able to move forward, just because they did not have a specific authenticator at that time,” Rao said.</p>



<p>With a solid understanding of how FIDO works and how it can be integrated with Target’s systems there are multiple use cases where it can be deployed. Among those use cases is for providing additional verification, in a multi factor authentication flow. FIDO can be used as the primary authenticator and can completely eliminate passwords from the login equation. It can be used for native authentication to mobile applications, providing a very intuitive login experience for Target’s mobile users.</p>



<p>Benefits</p>



<p>FIDO2 in particular has been useful for Target as it’s integrated into most modern web browsers without the need for users to install any third-party software or plugin on their devices or browsers.</p>



<p>With FIDO, Target is able to provide a better authentication experience for its users and is taking steps toward enabling a passwordless future.</p>



<p>“We all know that it’s not easy to get rid of passwords immediately,” Rao said. “But let’s all take a step towards it.”</p>

<p>SURF is the shared IT organization for research institutes and universities in the Netherlands. The organization helps to connect over 100 different institutions across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Challenge/ Use Case:</p>



<p>With lots of students and educators that need access, SURF faces multiple challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2007, SURF has been developing and using a service it calls SURFconext, which provides a national identity federation for research and higher education. SURFconext is an identity federation that consists of over 180 different identity providers and it provides a single sign-on (SSO) capability for SURF’s member institutions. SURFconext is based on the SAML 2.0 standard and makes use of OpenID Connect and is used by 1.7 million people across the Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last decade, there have been increasingly sensitive workloads and growing security concerns with accessibility. Some member institutions were only enforcing access with basic password authentication and there was a need to introduce multi-factor strong authentication.</p>



<p>How SURF Uses FIDO To Secure Its Users</p>



<p>With multiple member organizations each using various technologies, SURF implemented an add-on service called SURFsecureID.</p>



<p>SURFsecureID is a hosted service that provides multi-factor authentication, with a step-up approach.</p>



<p>“The idea is that users authenticate at their home University using the password and before they are redirected to the service provider they are redirected to us where we require a second factor before sending them off to the service they initially requested,” explained<a href="https://authenticatecon.com/speaker/joost-van-dijk/"> Joost van Dijk</a>, Technical Product Manager at SURF.</p>



<p>The step up authentication approach makes use of FIDO2 standards to help protect SURF’s users.</p>



<p>Benefits</p>



<p>With FIDO, SURF is now able to provide strong authentication to users across the Netherlands in an approach that helps to improve resiliency and security.</p>



<p>One particular risk that FIDO helps SURF to minimize is that of phishing attacks which has been a growing concern since at least the onset of the pandemic.<br>“Especially since the COVID crisis began, we’ve seen a lot of phishing campaigns launched against our users and we see FIDO2 as an excellent way to mitigate this threat,” commented Joost van Dijk, Technical Product Manager at SURF.</p>

<p>The Company:&nbsp;</p>



<p>CZ.nic is a domain registry organization in the Czech Republic that has been in operation since 1998. The organization manages over 1.3 million domains and is operated as a not-for-profit entity.</p>



<p>In addition to the administration of domain names, CZ.nic is active in the development and deployment of internet technologies as well as identity services.</p>



<p>The Challenge/ Use Case:</p>



<p>One of the primary activities that the CZ.nic domain registry does is it needs to verify the identity of domain owners. CZ.nic has contact information on well over 800,00 domain owners and administrative contacts.</p>



<p>Verifying and authenticating the integrity of user identities is a key challenge that faces CZ.nic. The European Union has a regulation known as Network Information Security (NIS) version 2 (<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_BRI(2021)689333">NIS2</a>) that recommends that top level domain registries like CZ.nic have technology and policies in place to properly verify domain owners.</p>



<p>“There’s a common agreement that illegal content is usually linked to fake identities,” explained Jaromir Talir, technical fellow at CZ.NIC and member of eIDAS Technical subgroup. “In the case of domains, there is definitely the possibility to register fake identities as domain owners.”</p>



<p>To that end, CZ.nic developed the<a href="https://www.mojeid.cz/en/"> mojeID</a> (my ID) service as a way to authenticate user identities. MojeID serves as a central identity service where an individual identity can be associated with a domain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MojeID also acts as an identity provider that ties into the European Union’s<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation"> eIDAS</a> (electronic identification and trust services) approach for an identity system that works across the EU.</p>



<p>How CZ.nic Uses FIDO To Secure Its Users</p>



<p>CZ.nic started out with just a username and password for authentication and realized over time that there was a clear need to have stronger authentication options for users.</p>



<p>In 2018, CZ.nic began evaluating the FIDO U2F specification as a solution for two factor authentication. In 2019, CZ.nic shifted its focus to using FIDO2/WebAuthn as it began to roll out the technology for production deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benefits</p>



<p>The use of FIDO2 provides CZ.nic with an extensible framework that works across desktop and mobile operating systems and devices.</p>



<p>With FIDO, CZ.nic is able to provide its users with strong authentication for identity verification. FIDO2/WebAuthn is also a core element of the eIDAS enablement for MojeID, which requires the use of a FIDO authenticator, alongside username/password for access.</p>



<p>As of July 2021, CZ.nic had over 30,000 users with FIDO security keys.</p>

<p>CVS Health is a U.S. healthcare organization that includes multiple operating divisions including retail with CVS Pharmacy, which has nearly 10,000 locations across America. CVS Health also includes a large healthcare insurance business that integrates assets from Aetna.</p>



<p>As of Q2 2023, CVS Health is using passkeys for consumer logins to their mobile web service.</p>



<p>The Challenge/ Use Case</p>



<p>The key focus for CVS Health is to ensure integrity and confidentiality of customer data. The overall user experience also needs to be positive, to drive traffic to CVS’s digital assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CVS Health is on a path to help make its consumer authentication experience not only secure, but easier to use. CVS Health is also on a path toward enabling password-less experiences for consumers wherever possible.</p>



<p>“For the external user, they would just simply walk away, if the user log in experience is cumbersome, in any way,” Cisa Kurian, senior security advisor at CVS Health commented. “Good security is always a balance between security and usability.”</p>



<p>How CVS Health Uses FIDO To Secure Its Users</p>



<p>CVS Health is building out an authentication platform to provide password-less authentication capabilities in its web, mobile, IoT and voice applications. Passwordless authentication is enabled with biometric authentication using FIDO standards</p>



<p>“Our goal is to increase friction for a potential threat actor, while enabling ease of use for the legitimate user,” Kurian said.</p>



<p>Benefits</p>



<p>By adopting a FIDO based approach, CVS Health is able to provide an easier authentication experience for its users. Making the login experience more seamless also helps to improve the overall user experience as well.</p>



<p>“We chose FIDO because the standards are open, and allow for simpler and stronger authentication that is based on public key cryptography,” Kurian said. “In other words, it’s easy to use and more secure, at the same time.”</p>

As a result, we’ve seen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/18/chatgpt-said-i-did-not-exist-how-artists-and-writers-are-fighting-back-against-ai">Association of Photographers representatives</a> calling for the introduction of smarter laws while others, like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66164228">Sarah Silverman</a>, found enough ground in the current legal framework to launch a lawsuit against OpenAI for their large language model implementation ChatGPT. The impact of GenAI will be immense and it can significantly enhance counterfeit problems such as stealing intellectual property (IP) and lowering transparency across markets. Adding that to the already booming real-world counterfeit problem (estimated 10% counterfeit drugs globally, up to 50% of artworks suspected to be forgeries, $10–15 billion annual damages in the food and beverages industry&nbsp;…), there is a clear need to bring more powerful tools to counteract these trends and protect the innovators, artist, creators, and other IP owners. We should not show up with a knife to a gunfight.</p><p>That is why <a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Trace Labs</a> — core developers of <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> — and <a href="https://datana-storage.com/">DATANA</a>, the flagship project of <a href="https://biosistemika.com/">BioSistemika</a>, have inked a solution partnership in which DNA and Decentralized Knowledge Graph technologies are combined to deliver effective authenticity-focused solutions for many sectors, such as supply chains, real-world assets (RWAs), art, and many&nbsp;more.</p>Source: DATANA Unparalleled real-world asset (RWA) integrity with DNA and&nbsp;DKG <p>The fusion of DNA Data Storage (DDS) technology with Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) offers a disruptive approach to real-world assets (RWAs) authenticity verification, especially for high-value items. DDS is the process by which binary information is encoded into a sequence of nucleotides and synthesized to form synthetic data-carrying DNA molecules, which are then stored accordingly. Much like the unique DNA makeup of every person, consumer products can be outfitted with synthetically produced DNA tags unique to every unit, batch, or brand. These miniature DNA particles, or DNA tags, can be embedded in products or packaging, providing unique, tamper-proof identifiers, making counterfeiting extremely challenging. These tags can accompany and protect the authenticity of any physical RWA throughout its entire lifecycle. This can be achieved as the DNA is very hard to destroy, can be very well hidden, and has incredible storage capabilities so we need microscopically little of it (e.g. entire world’s data fits in a water bottle of&nbsp;DNA).</p><p>However, data in the DNA is not that easy to read and it cannot be frequently updated, which might be required and desired for many products. This is where the DKG steps in. By putting a smart anchor in the DNA and applying the global standard GS1 Digital Link on the product, we create a physical-to-digital connection that leads to extending the capabilities of the DNA tag. The DKG allows the product owner to add any additional information to it (about the production process, ingredients, quality parameters, ownership experiences).</p>Source: DATANA<p>All the information kept in the DKG has an owner and cannot be tampered with, giving the required digital protection. This protection extends towards the GenAI tools as well, as the DKG offers known sources that the GenAI can use and reference (see the Trusted AI framework implementation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHLkNCL9gCI">here</a>).</p><p>Looking towards the future, this technology could revolutionize sectors like luxury goods, where authenticity is paramount. In pharmaceuticals, it could be the backbone for verifying the legitimacy of drugs, combating counterfeit medicines that pose substantial risk to public health. In the food and beverage industry, it could ensure the origin and quality of organic or premium products, while in the art world, the powerful combination of technologies could authenticate artworks and historical artifacts.</p> DNA as a next-gen tool for authenticity verification <p>DNA-based tracking and authenticity verification offer a sophisticated and secure method for protecting real-world assets, leveraging the unique nature of DNA sequences. Products can be tagged using synthetic DNA markers modified to encode digital data, which are applied through various methods such as microscopic particles, direct surface application, integration into materials, or embedding in packaging. With its multiple and growing use cases, the DNA production industry is now advancing at an exponential rate.</p>Source: DATANA Benefits of DNA tagging&nbsp;systems <p>Using DNA for authenticity verification is a cutting-edge approach that leverages the unique and tamper-proof nature of DNA sequences. Here is how it can be implemented:</p>  DNA Tagging: Products can be tagged with synthetic DNA markers that are uniquely designed and nearly impossible to replicate. These markers can be applied to various products like luxury goods, pharmaceuticals, or agricultural products. The DNA sequences used are typically non-biological, meaning they do not come from living organisms but are artificially created.  Traceability: As products move through the supply chain, the DNA tag remains with them. This allows for the tracking of goods from the point of origin to the end consumer. At any stage of the supply chain, a sample of the DNA tag can be collected and analyzed.  Verification and Authentication: To verify the authenticity of a product, a small sample of the DNA tag is extracted and analyzed.  Simple and Covert Application: DNA tags can easily be applied to products in various covert forms (*see next section), preventing counterfeiters from detecting, replacing, or removing&nbsp;them.  Enhanced Encoding: Advanced DNA tagging systems also allow encoding significantly more data (metadata, media, etc.) into the tag itself, compared to alternative tracking forms (e.g. QR codes, barcodes). For example, a typical QR code can store roughly 1 kb of data, whereas a DNA tag can store up to 1MB of data (1000x&nbsp;more).  Regulatory Compliance and Quality Control: In industries like pharmaceuticals and food, DNA tagging can help ensure compliance with regulatory standards and improve quality control processes. This method is particularly valuable for high-value or sensitive products where authenticity and origin are crucial. The technology is advancing rapidly, making it more accessible and cost-effective for various industries.  <p>The application of DNA tags to products can vary depending on the type of product, the intended use of the tagging, and the durability required. Here are some common methods of applying DNA&nbsp;tags:</p>  Integration into Product Materials: For some products, DNA tags can be integrated into the material itself during the manufacturing process. This could involve adding DNA to plastics, textiles, or paper. For example, high-value clothing or documents can have DNA integrated into their fabric or&nbsp;paper.  Incorporation in Ink or Printing: DNA can be mixed with inks used for printing on products or their packaging. This method is useful for products that are already undergoing a printing process, such as packaged goods, books, or official documents.  Microscopic Particles or Encapsulation: DNA can be encapsulated in microscopic particles that are then applied to the product. These particles can be mixed into paints, varnishes, or adhesives that are then applied to the product’s surface. This method is often used for high-value items like artworks, electronics, or luxury&nbsp;goods.  Direct Application to Product Surfaces: In some cases, the DNA solution can be directly applied to the surface of the product. This could be through spraying, brushing, or immersing the product in the DNA solution. It is commonly used for products where the appearance is not a primary concern, or where the solution can be applied in an inconspicuous area.  Embedding in Packaging or Labels: DNA tags can be incorporated into the product’s packaging or labels. This is a less invasive method and is particularly useful for products where direct application of DNA might be impractical or could affect the product’s quality or integrity, such as food products or pharmaceuticals.  Coating with DNA-Infused Films: Products can be coated with a thin film that contains the DNA tag. This method is useful for a wide range of products, including electronics, automotive parts, and various consumer&nbsp;goods.  Injection into Products: In some cases, especially for large or solid items, the DNA tag can be injected into the product. This method ensures that the DNA is present inside the product, making it difficult to remove or tamper&nbsp;with.  Edible DNA Tags: For food products, edible DNA tags have been developed. These are safe for consumption and can be applied directly to the food or mixed into the food product during processing.  Source: DATANA Encoding DKG into DNA sequences: bridging digital and&nbsp;physical <p>Combining DNA tagging and OriginTrail technology can create a robust tool for enhanced supply chain tracking and authenticity verification for RWAs. Here is a brief overview of how these two technologies can be integrated:</p>  Assembling the Relevant Identifiers: The OriginTrail DKG enables connecting various identifiers across the entire product lifecycle to create a digital twin. These can include decentralized identities (DIDs), uniform asset locators or UALs (similar to URLs), and cryptographic proofs of the data (i.e. hashes) for immutability.  Encoding DKG into DNA Sequences: Depending on the product, tamper-proof data from the DKG (such as UALs) are then encoded into short, synthetic DNA sequences, which are “stitched” together in DATANA’s DNA writer. The initial encoding process translates the digital information into the biological sequence of DNA (A, T, C, G). Then, the physical DNA molecule is synthesized in a process that involves carefully mixing thousands of microscopic droplets containing the DNA building blocks at extreme speeds. Each mixture of droplets represents a unique biochemical reaction, resulting in the elongation of the data-coding DNA&nbsp;chain.  DNA Tagging: Synthetic DNA sequences, serving as trusted links to the DKG, are administered to the product as DNA tags, anchoring the connection between the product and the DKG digital twin. The selection of the DNA application method (microscopic particles, direct surface application, integration into materials or packaging, etc.) is contingent upon the product’s characteristics and the chosen implementation approach. Products undergo tagging with synthetic DNA markers employing diverse techniques like microscopic particles, direct surface application, integration into materials, or embedding in packaging. These distinctive DNA sequences are intentionally crafted to be tamper-proof and are exceptionally challenging to replicate.  Traceability and Verification: Throughout the supply chain journey, the DNA tag stays linked with the product. At any stage in the supply chain, it is possible to collect a sample of the DNA tag, followed by an analysis to extract the encoded data. As products progress through the supply chain, the DNA tag remains connected to them within the OriginTrail DKG. The interlinked knowledge assets construct a thorough and accessible record of the product’s voyage, incorporating details about manufacturing, transportation, storage, and&nbsp;sale.  DKG Verification: Retrieving digital data from DNA involves sequencing the DNA, translating its nucleotide sequence back to the original binary code. DNA sequencing is a rapidly advancing technology routinely used in molecular biology and genome sequencing. The DKG data extracted from the DNA sample undergoes comparison with what is stored on the OriginTrail DKG. If the two align, the product is confirmed as authentic, affirming that the information in the DKG aligns with the physical product. Authenticity verification involves collecting a small DNA tag sample from the product, followed by analysis using techniques like Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to confirm its match with the original DNA sequence stored in the OriginTrail DKG.  Privacy and Ownership: OriginTrail DKG provides options for configuring privacy settings, and guaranteeing secure management of sensitive data, including the details about the placement of DNA tags and other product information. Verifiable transfer of ownership, encompassing the DNA-tagged identifiers ensures transparency and accountability.  Ensuring Data Integrity: The integrity of the product information is maintained through cryptographic hashing on the blockchain within the OriginTrail DKG, ensuring that the last state can be verified.  AI-powered product interaction: DKG makes all the product information AI-ready, easily connecting to the constantly advancing AI tools. It allows users to interact with information through questions and prompts that are most relevant to them — learning more about the brand history, production process, ingredients quality or DNA protection on their products. All the responses such an AI-powered system provides are based on inputs from the DKG. AI based semantic search solutions can be developed to simplify and enhance the interaction with trusted product information on the&nbsp;DKG.  Source: DATANA Vision of the&nbsp;future <p>From high costs and complexity in implementation, to the technological requirements, and the potential stability issues of DNA tags under different environmental conditions, the real-world use case of DNA-based tracking and authenticity verification in protecting real-world assets is, however, not without its limitations.</p><p>Overcoming these aforementioned limitations demands collaborations between leading ecosystem players, with each leveraging their expertise for mutual and collective benefits.

<p>OASIS and the OASIS Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) TC are pleased to announce that Common Security Advisory Framework Version 2.0 Errata 01 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>This document lists proposed errata for the OASIS Standard “Common Security Advisory Framework Version 2.0.” The specific changes are listed in section 1.1, at&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/errata01/csd01/csaf-v2.0-errata01-csd01.html#11-description-of-changes">https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/errata01/csd01/csaf-v2.0-errata01-csd01.html#11-description-of-changes</a>.</p>



<p>The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) Version 2.0 is the definitive reference for the CSAF language which supports creation, update, and interoperable exchange of security advisories as structured information on products, vulnerabilities and the status of impact and remediation among interested parties.</p>



<p>The OASIS CSAF Technical Committee is chartered to make a major revision to the widely-adopted Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF) specification, originally developed by the Industry Consortium for Advancement of Security on the Internet (ICASI). ICASI has contributed CVRF to the TC. The revision is being developed under the name Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF). TC deliverables are designed to standardize existing practice in structured machine-readable vulnerability-related advisories and further refine those standards over time.</p>

<p>Published December 21, 2023, revised January 6, 2024.</p>
<p>Note: The deadline for indicating interest in the CAEP Interoperability Event has been extended from January 6, 2024 to January 12, 2024.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation, in partnership with <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en">Gartner</a>, would like to invite you to participate in an interoperability event where different implementers can demonstrate the compatibility of their implementations to the Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP) of the Shared Signals Framework (SSF), along with the Risk Incident Sharing and Coordination (RISC) profile. CAEP, SSF and RISC are open standards considered to be important to zero-trust security. Multiple implementers have announced their upcoming support for CAEP and related specs, as referenced in “<a href="https://openid.net/importance-of-shared-signals-framework/">The Importance of OpenID Foundation Shared Signals Framework</a>” on December 14, 2023.</p>
 Overview 
<p>The <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/identity-access-management-uk">Gartner Identity &amp; Access Management Summit</a> will be held in London on March 4-5th, 2024. As a part of this summit, Gartner has invited the OpenID Foundation to host an interoperability event that demonstrates standards-based interoperability between implementer products that implement the OpenID specifications CAEP, SSF and optionally, RISC.</p>
<p>In order to make this event a success, the OpenID Foundation, in partnership with Gartner, would like to invite you to participate as an implementer in this event. Anyone with an eligible implementation may sign up to be an implementer at this interop event without a requirement to be a contributor to the Shared Signals WG or a member of the OpenID Foundation. An eligible implementation is not required to be a production-quality / shipping product, but needs to be one the implementer reasonably believes will be a part of their operational / production services or will be a part of their shipping products in the near future. Space is limited so implementers will be included on a “first come first served” basis.</p>
 Event Outline 
<p>The CAEP Interoperability Event will have the following structure:</p>
 
 On or before Jan 6th, 2024: Implementers indicate their interest in participation 
 On or before Jan 17th, 2024: OpenID Foundation specifies, after discussing with implementers, the use cases that may be demonstrated by implementers 
 On or before Feb 3rd, 2024: Implementers commit to their participation 
 Feb 3rd – March 2nd 2024: Implementers perform online testing of their implementations against the <a href="https://sgnl-ai.github.io/caep-interop/openid-caep-interoperability-profile-1_0.html">interoperability specification</a> provided by the OpenID Foundation. This profile is preliminary and is under active discussion by the Shared Signals WG. Anyone may participate in this WG to discuss the interop profile without cost by signing an <a href="https://openid.net/intellectual-property/openid-foundation-contribution-agreements/">OpenID Foundation Contribution Agreement</a>. Online testing may be performed using <a href="http://caep.dev/">caep.dev</a>&nbsp;or using peer implementations that are available for such testing. 
 March 3rd, 2024: Venue (the Interop Event room) open for the entire day for Interop Event implementers to set up and perform final interoperability tests 
 March 4th, 2024 11:45am – 12:15pm: Gartner analyst Erik Wahlstrom hosts a breakout session that includes a description of the Interop Event and announces its results. Shared Signals WG co-chair Atul Tulshibagwale will join Erik on stage for provide details and for demonstrating interoperable products 
 March 4 2024 12:15 until 5:00pm: Appointment slots will be available through the Gartner event application to visit the Interop room. Implementors will be able to show implementations to conference guests with appointments, and answer questions. 
 [Subject to Sponsorship and venue availability] VIP drinks ~4:30-7:00pm March 4th reception for interop implementers to celebrate their first interop event, and select government and IAM guests to provide informal feedback and advice to further accelerate market adoption. 
 
 Implementer Commitments Desired 
 
 By Jan 12, 2024, confirm interest in participation by sending email to Shared Signals WG co-chair, Atul Tulshibagwale* at atul@sgnl.ai 
 By Jan 27 2024, discuss and review the interoperability profile and finalize participation details

 Mar 3 – 4 2024, Be present at the Gartner IAM Summit venue in London to participate in the interoperability event* 
 
<p>* Capacity for this interop event is limited to 8 implementations due to limited venue capacity.&nbsp; As a result, we will record expressions of interest and participation commitments on a “first come first served” basis. If implementers miss any of the deadlines above they may lose their spot to an organization on the waitlist. We encourage all implementers to ensure they are fully prepared on a timely basis. We will also maintain a waitlist of implementers if more than 8 show interest or are willing to commit.</p>
 Participant FAQ 
<p>What Commitments does a participant need to make in order to participate:</p>
<p>Participants need to make the following commitments:</p>
 
 Presence at the Interop Event room from March 3-4th during normal business hours. 
 Demonstrate support for at least one use-case specified in the <a href="https://sgnl-ai.github.io/caep-interop/openid-caep-interoperability-profile-1_0.html">CAEP Interoperability Specification</a>. The demonstration can be on prototype / developer code, but the participant should reasonably believe that the feature will be available in a short time frame in one or more of that participant’s products 
 Work to demonstrate interoperability with other products that are a part of Interop Event for all use-cases the participant has committed to support 
 Make a video recording of all interoperability use-cases that have been successfully tested with other participants 
 
<p>Is there an online service where implementations may be tested beforehand?</p>
<p>Participants can test their implementations against an online service that will be posted soon, specific to the new interop test profile. In the meantime, implementers may choose to test their implementations (transmitters and receivers) against caep.dev, a service developed by SGNL in partnership with the OpenID Foundation.</p>
<p>What signage may be presented in the Interop Event room by participants?</p>
<p>Signage will be made available on each of the tables where the interop demonstrations will be conducted in the breakout room 12:15-5:00pm March 4, 2024.</p>
<p>How will my product be displayed to the audience?</p>
<p>An OpenID Foundation representative will demonstrate all use-cases where there are more than 1 participant on stage. In order to demonstrate the use-cases, the OpenID Foundation will use some of the implementer products. All implementer products may be seen by the audience when they visit the Interop Event room. Gartner will invite people to visit the Interop Event room at the end of the presentation, and make appointments via the conference event application.</p>
<p>Is there a cost to implementers?</p>
<p>There is no cost to implementers to take part in this interoperability event.&nbsp; We are seeking an implementer willing to sponsor a small drinks reception on March 4th, 2024. More generally, we warmly welcome all implementers joining the OpenID Foundation as <a href="https://openid.net/intellectual-property/openid-foundation-contribution-agreements/">contributors</a> (at no cost) and as <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/benefits-members/">members</a> to support and sustain the OpenID Foundation.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/data-provenance-composedb-as-an-authenticated-database/">Data Provenance</a> article outlined several differentiating features while comparing Ceramic to smart contract platforms and centralized databases. When observed through the lens of the provenance and lineage of data, many challenges and design choices are inherently unique to a peer-to-peer, multi-directional replication layer that enables multi-master, eventually consistent databases to be built on top. As the article referenced above points out, the paradigm of true “user-controlled data” does not exist in traditional database terms, since user-generated content is authored by dedicated servers on the users’ behalf.</p><p>More recently, our team has been discussing and working on additional features to ComposeDB that feel different compared to those aimed to provide functional parity with what developers should expect from a database layer. Whereas the ability to filter and order based on schema subfields feels like a basic utility expectation, our more recent discussions around introducing features that allow developers to define single-write schemas, for example, call on use cases unique to decentralized data.</p><p>These feature ideas, and more importantly the problem statements behind them, impact certain patterns of data control more than others. These different architectural patterns are what we’ll attempt to unpack below by tying together their design, specific needs, how teams are currently building with them, and what role they play in the broader <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/into-the-dataverse/">dataverse</a>.</p> Users vs. Apps: Data Creation and Ownership <p>We’ve broken down these predominant patterns in the table below:</p><p>Before we dive in, it’s important to point out that the way Ceramic “accounts” (represented by <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/accounts/decentralized-identifiers?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DIDs</a>) interact with the network is itself a novel paradigm in data storage, and more akin to blockchain accounts transacting with a smart contract network. This is an important key to the underlying architecture that allows for the diversity of “data control” outlined in the table above. This article assumes readers are already familiar with this setup, at least on a basic level.</p><p>Finally, our position on these patterns is of the perspective that all are necessary and important to a diverse data ecosystem. As we’ll outline below, these emergent behaviors arise from the real needs of the applications that use them and their users. We hope that this article will help developers understand why these different models exist, what trade-offs and considerations they incur, and use that information to approach their data design in a more informed way.</p><p>With that out of the way, let’s dive deeper into each of these patterns.</p> Application-Generated, Application-Controlled <p>When I think of an archetypal use case for this quadrant, the idea of a “data oracle” comes to mind. That oracle is responsible for:</p>  Bridging the “gap” between two disparate networks by reporting data  Reliably providing said data in an opinionated, predictable, and steadily frequent way  <p>Looking at it through this lens, the “application-generated” thought transforms into more of an “application-provided” idea. Though the data itself originates elsewhere, the role of the oracle is to retrieve it, transform it into whichever format is needed by the storage layer, and write it to its final destination.</p><p>There are commonalities in behavior across teams creating and using this data quadrant:</p><p>Use of DID:Key</p>  Unsurprisingly, an application dedicated to writing reporting data to Ceramic frequently will be using a static seed (or set of static seeds) to authenticate DID:Key(s) on the Ceramic node  <p>Server-Side Generation, Server-Side Writes</p>  Given that the method used to write data to Ceramic doesn’t require authentication with a browser wallet, this action can be easily created as a server-side service  Similarly, another server service would be responsible for retrieving data from the data source and transforming it before supplying it to the service that writes it to Ceramic  <p>Application as the Trusted Vector</p>  Other teams relying on data provided by an oracle need to trust that the service won’t have intermittent failures  <p>Data Availability Motives</p>  As far as composability goes, the application writing the data, along with other applications building on that data, are incentivized to sync the data to ensure persistence  <p>Unique Needs</p>  Beyond basic sorting and filtering needed by any applications building on this data type, not much is needed  Consumers of this data (which is likely the application that controls it) trust the logic that was used to write the data to the network  <p>Ceramic Example</p>  Orbis authors <a href="https://scan.s3.xyz/streams/profile/did:key:z6MkkauvinSwdvqT6k44GZG6MArjD3qXiiEwfi5sKiHJ3JaE?network=MAINNET&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Pricefeed Data</a> to Ceramic to serve as an oracle   Application-Generated, User-Controlled <p>As outlined in the table, a great example that falls into this category would be credential data. In the analog world, universities issue diplomas to their students. The diploma is typically signed by the university’s chancellor or president, but the physical document is transferred and kept by the student (I understand that this is not a perfect analogy in the sense that it’s typically the university that verifies a student has received a diploma by employers or other interested parties).</p><p>In a broadly similar sense, this category manifests in Ceramic as tamper-evident data that are cryptographically signed by the application but point to the end user that controls its storage. Perhaps the data is encrypted by the user before it’s stored in Ceramic, with access control conditions to grant only whitelisted parties viewing abilities. Due to its tamper-evident qualities, all parties can rest assured of the fidelity of the data’s contents.</p><p>Here are some commonalities:</p><p>Use of DID:PKH</p>  The resulting Ceramic documents are almost always written by the user with an authenticated session created by their blockchain wallet  <p>Server-Side Generation, Client-Side Writes</p>  In the case of credentials, the application is likely using a static key to generate payloads server-side (once certain application conditions are met) and passes the payload to the user to write with the authenticated session stored in the browser  <p>Application as the Trusted Vector</p>  What matters most for consumers of this data is the application that attested to it and signed it  While the user has technical control over the data and who they share it with (if they encrypt it), they cannot change the data’s values  <p>Data Availability Motives</p>  We can assume that some of this data will be highly valuable—perhaps the application that issues the credential is highly respected and unlocks a lot of gates for the end user  The user that controls these documents will likely be the most compelled party to keep this data available. It will be important for other applications that consume this data, but arguably not as much  <p>Tamper-Evident, Cryptographically Signed</p>  Behavior is already aggregating along the lines of standards and formats like <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/examples/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Verifiable Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EAS Off-Chain Attestations</a>  <p>Unique Needs</p>  Under the use case example referenced above, applications that issue data for their users to store typically don’t reference other data (for example, a relation to another Ceramic document) that can easily be changed—each data object is inherently <code>whole</code>  Therefore, I’d argue no unique needs are obvious or necessary for this quadrant either  <p>Ceramic Example</p>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/gitcoin-builds-passport-on-ceramic/">Gitcoin Passport</a> issues Verifiable Credentials to its users while giving the users Ceramic ownership of their instances   User-Generated, Application-Controlled <p>This unique category feels most similar to what we’re used to in Web2, though the use cases in Ceramic might be somewhat novel. For example, if you think back to the tamper-evident qualities of an application-generated credential that’s stored by the user we referenced in the last section, the inverse could be necessary for some applications. Perhaps an application wants to create a petition that’s cryptographically signed by multiple users, but ownership of the final document that aggregates the individual signatures should be in the hands of the facilitator.</p><p>Perhaps the broader use case is positioned around collaboration, allowing individuals to input into the document with the resulting document representing that unified effort.</p><p>In terms of commonalities:</p><p>Use of DID:Key</p>  The application will most likely be authoring Ceramic documents using a static seed or set of seeds  <p>Client-Side Input, Server-Side Transformation, Server-Side Writes</p>  Under this design, it’s likely that the application is receiving input from user browser sessions but is set up such that once a condition has been met, it will transform the data into the format necessary to write it to Ceramic  <p>Application Server May or May Not Require Trust</p>  If the inputs from the users are in a format that’s tamper-evident, end users interacting with this setup simply need to trust that the server writes the data to Ceramic, but do not need to worry about data fidelity  <p>Data Availability Motives</p>  If the application’s primary value proposal is its ability to facilitate coordination across users or transform data in creative ways, the controlling application is most motivated to keep the data available (alongside other applications consuming it)  <p>Unique Needs</p>  Feature needs for this quadrant should be highly similar to the “application-generated, application-controlled” category, in the sense that the application can trust the static logic of its servers not to intentionally change and ruin its data   User-Generated, User-Controlled <p>We anticipate this final category to eventually be the most common across applications built on Ceramic, and much of the momentum we’ve witnessed thus far aligns with that narrative. More importantly, while each of these categories is valuable to the ecosystem, this one speaks most to the narrative around data interoperability, making the concept of users interacting with the same data primitives they own across disparate environments and applications possible.</p><p>A great showcase example would be a social application framework that allows users to create posts, comment on posts, and react to content, all tied together by a parent “context” representing an application environment. Other social applications can read from and build off of the same content artifacts, or define a unique context that uses the same data primitives but swaps out the connective tissue.</p><p>Under this model, users have sovereign control of their documents. Even if a user creates a session key that allows a malicious application to write incorrect data on their behalf, the session key will ultimately expire (or is manually revoked by the user), the application loses its write privileges, the Ceramic document never transfers ownership, and the user overwrites the data. End users are equally free to spin up custom UIs and nodes and edit their data that will render in the interfaces of the applications that defined those models.</p><p>However, high flexibility brings important considerations:</p><p>Use of DID:PKH</p>  This shouldn’t be surprising since most users will be creating authenticated sessions from their browser wallet  <p>Client-Side Generation, Client-Side Writes</p>  This also shouldn’t be controversial given that the inputs are coming from end users, and their sessions are authenticated to write the data to Ceramic  <p>Network Data Sync</p>  This is where more complexity comes into play. For the data users generate to propagate and become usable between applications, their underlying Ceramic nodes must sync and share information  While a multi-node architecture may be required for a single application (in which case the data sync is still important as far as performance goes), in this context I’m referring to data sharing across nodes operated by separate applications  To reduce or eliminate the necessity of trust between application environments, the underlying protocol must have built-in features to ensure data fidelity. Team A should not have to rely on the competency of Team B, and shouldn’t suffer if Team B somehow messes up  <p>Data Availability Motives</p>  Interest in keeping the data available should be fairly shared between the end users and the applications that use it  <p>Ceramic Example</p>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/orbis-launches-web3-social-protocol-on-ceramic-mainnet-and-opens-sdk-to-developers/">Orbis</a> is a social data model that provides intuitive tooling for developers who want to build social timelines, comment systems, private messaging, and more  <p>Unique Needs</p>  I think this is where we wade into territory that’s best illustrated by hypothetical situations:  <p>Let’s say a trust system for open-source software plugins is built on Ceramic. Individual plugins are represented by ComposeDB models. For example:</p> <code>type Plugin
    @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple plugin")
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "name" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "created" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "checkSum" }]) 
{
    owner: DID! @documentAccount 
    name: String! @string(maxLength: 100)
    description: String @string(maxLength: 100)
    created: DateTime!
    checkSum: String! @string (minLength: 64, maxLength: 64)
}</code> <p>Let’s assume that the <code>checkSum</code> field in this example represents the SHA-256 hash of the plugin’s code.</p><p>For people to trust and use the plugins, they rely on representations of user-generated trust:</p> <code>type Plugin @loadModel(id: "...") {
    id: ID!
}

type Trust
    @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A trust model")
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "trusted" }])
{
    attester: DID! @documentAccount 
    trusted: Boolean! 
    reason: String @string(maxLength: 1000)
    pluginId: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "Plugin")
    plugin: Plugin! @relationDocument(property: "pluginId")
}</code> <p>Under this current setup, you can easily imagine the following problematic situations:</p>  <code>Plugin A</code> receives a ton of authentic, well-intentioned trust signals over a few weeks. The controller of the <code>Plugin A</code> stream then decides to switch out the value of the <code>checkSum</code> field to refer to a malicious plugin that steals your money. Because the relationship is defined by the plugin’s stream ID, those positive trust signals will by default point to the latest commit in the event log (the malicious plugin)  <code>Plugin A</code> receives a ton of deceptive positive trust signals, all from <code>Account A</code>. Because (at the time of writing this article) there’s nothing that prevents <code>Account A</code> from doing so, <code>User Interface A</code> and <code>User Interface B</code> are left to do some custom client-side work to sort through the noise and present the truth to the end user. Since there are multiple ways of doing so, mistakes are made by <code>User Interface B</code>, and the end user is tricked yet again  <p>You can start to see the real ways these issues simply don’t exist elsewhere under the safeguard of an application’s server preventing adverse or unexpected behavior.</p> Solutions Actively Underway <p>Bringing this back to Ceramic’s current roadmap, we have two active feature integrations we’re working on to address these unique problems, each of which is actively in request-for-comment stages:</p><p>Native Support for Single-Write Documents (field locking)</p><p>This <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/rfc-native-support-for-single-write-documents-with-field-locking/1398?ref=blog.ceramic.network">active RFC</a> (request for comment) details a feature that would allow developers to define schemas that prevent certain fields within a model from being updated after the document is created. Using the <code>Plugin</code> example above, you can imagine how this might be useful in preventing a <code>Plugin</code> controller from maliciously updating key fields like <code>checkSum</code> to prevent users from being tricked.</p><p>A refactor of the <code>Plugin</code> schema definition using this feature might instead look like:</p> <code>type Plugin
    @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple plugin")
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "name" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "created" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "checkSum" }]) 
{
    owner: DID! @documentAccount 
    name: String! @locking @string(maxLength: 100)
    description: String @string(maxLength: 100)
    created: DateTime! @locking
    checkSum: String! @locking @string (minLength: 64, maxLength: 64)
}</code> <p>While actual syntax may vary, the <code>@locking</code> directive here is meant to identify the subfields that would be prevented from being updated after the document is created (most importantly, the <code>checkSum</code>).</p><p>Native Support for Unique-List Documents (”SET” accountRelation)</p><p>This <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/rfc-native-support-for-unique-list-relationships-between-stream-types-and-accounts/1406?ref=blog.ceramic.network">RFC</a> would help prevent situation #2 above from happening. While ComposeDB would currently allow <code>Account A</code> from creating as many <code>Trust</code> instances for <code>Plugin A</code> as they wanted (thus leaving it up to the competency and inference of the applications or interfaces using that data to resolve), this instead would make the following possible:</p> <code>type Plugin @loadModel(id: "...") {
    id: ID!
}

type Trust
    @createModel(accountRelation: SET, accountRelationField: "pluginId")
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "trusted" }])
{
    attester: DID! @documentAccount 
    trusted: Boolean! 
    reason: String @string(maxLength: 1000)
    pluginId: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "Plugin")
    plugin: Plugin! @relationDocument(property: "pluginId")
}</code> <p>Under this design, users can create as many instances of <code>Trust</code> as they want, but prevents them from creating more than 1 for any 1 plugin, given that the constraining field is on the <code>pluginId</code> field.</p> Get Involved <p>For you readers who find this problem space compelling, or want to get involved in ways that help shape the future of ComposeDB, we encourage you to react in the forum to the RFCs we mentioned above.

  <p>By Coleen Jose, Head of Community, CAI</p><p>When a group of 59 organizations gathered in January 2020 for the first Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) Summit, generative AI tools were not available for mass consumption. The main themes then were media literacy, context and intent, and the need to find a solution that drives trust and transparency online while mitigating the potential for bad actors. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Those discussions laid the foundation for the C2PA standard, verifiable Content Credentials, and the CAI’s open-source tools. Attendees envisioned these pillars as a way of ensuring clarity about the origins and history of the visual stories and media we consume online.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in 2020, the proliferation of mis- and disinformation across social media was also top of mind. Newsrooms and readers were struggling with challenging questions: How can we verify the origins of photographs and videos? How do we confirm facts emerging from a breaking news event? How do detection tools and digital forensics keep up with technological advances and the torrent of content before it goes viral?&nbsp;</p><p>Today, the speed of innovation in generative AI has again brought trust and transparency to the forefront. The potential of AI to both do good and cause harm is a dominant question&nbsp;in industry, policy, and media circles.&nbsp;</p><p>At this year’s CAI Symposium, held on Dec. 7, similar themes emerged. This time, over 200 people attended—from direct business competitors to experts in cryptography, identity, media, and policy. What they had in common was a commitment to the pursuit of an open solution to build trust and transparency into the digital ecosystem. Participants reflected the growing momentum of C2PA adoption across devices, software, services, and platforms. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Co-hosted with Stanford Data Science, the event was a full day of presentations, breakout sessions, and hands-on demonstrations from the CAI community.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are three takeaways from the CAI Symposium:&nbsp;</p><p>1. Scaling the chain of trust. Speakers from Adobe, the Partnership on AI, and WITNESS alluded to the importance of scaling trust and transparency solutions from the ground up, starting with frontier models, research, and development stages to the end-user experience. We saw hardware innovations in the form of Leica’s M11-P camera, the world’s first Content Credentials-enabled camera, which the company plans to extend to other products. With the introduction of generative AI tools on mobile devices, Qualcomm shared how building the C2PA standard into its chip processers can add transparency and mitigate potential harms.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;2. Elections and media integrity. Forty countries representing 3.2 billion people will go to the polls in 2024, and we’re already seeing AI-generated images and videos influencing the democratic process. Additionally, a steady stream of misleading imagery and deepfakes are emerging from the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The stakes have never been higher for media authenticity, and our work in this space is critically important. &nbsp;We were thrilled to highlight that BioBioChile became the world’s first media organization to implement Content Credentials on a live news website. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;3. User experience and consumer education. Significant work lies ahead to establish the <a href="https://contentcredentials.org">Content Credentials icon</a> as the starting point for a new language of authenticity and context. Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, one area with immense potential for innovation is ensuring an accessible, simple, and clear experience across mobile and web platforms. As technology continues to advance, it will be crucial to create a seamless and user-friendly interface for verifying content authenticity. This commitment to accessibility and clarity will play a pivotal role in enhancing user experience and promoting trust in the digital landscape.&nbsp;</p><p>The expertise and industry leadership that the CAI community brings spans engineering, product, trust infrastructure, policy, media, creativity, and education. We’re inspired by the ever-increasing adoption of Content Credentials and excited to take on the challenges ahead, together.&nbsp;</p><p>What began as a sea of promising ideas at the 2020 CAI Summit has evolved into a deep focus on deploying Content Credentials. The way forward depends on enabling honest discourse, surfacing challenges, and building solutions. If one thing was evident at this year’s Symposium, it's this community's commitment to that path.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you to our speakers, moderators, and demo presenters! </p>  <p>Opening Remarks by Dana Rao, Adobe</p>  <p>Leica Content Credentials by Nico Kohler and Jesko von Oeynhausen, Leica</p>  <p>C2PA Primer by Leonard Rosenthol, Adobe</p>  <p>Trust and attestation in a modern mobile SoC by Asaf Shen, Qualcomm</p>  <p>Navigating Trust: Provenance Technology in Journalism by Santiago Lyon, Adobe and David Clinch, Media Growth Partners</p>  <p>Perspectives from the MediFor and SemaFor Programs by Matt Turek, DARPA</p>  <p>Content Authenticity with Zero Knowledge by Dan Boneh, Stanford University</p>  <p>Safe and Sound?

  Union Farms: A leading pork producer achieves carbon neutrality in the name of sustainability
 
 
     

 
             Union Farms in Nebraska has addressed the challenge of measuring environmental impact in agriculture by adopting GS1 standards. 
     

 
             <p>In farming, despite its close connection to the earth, capturing, measuring, and analysing data for sustainability proves complex. This complexity is amplified in animal farming, where considerations like food safety and public health come into play.</p>

<p>Union Farms has addressed this challenge by integrating GS1 standards into its grain and pork operations. This integration allows for meticulous measurement of products and processes, with a focus on carbon sequestration, water, energy, and fertiliser stewardship.</p>

<p>The result is impressive – carbon neutrality, increased profitability through carbon credits, and future-proofing the family farm for subsequent generations.</p>

<p>During the event, attendees had the opportunity to delve deep into more than 30 developer workshops and deployment/implementation case studies, each one offering a window into the rapidly expanding adoption of phishing-resistant FIDO Authentication across the APAC region and beyond. These sessions revealed several critical insights, highlighting current trends and forecasting the promising future of this essential technological progression. Here are some notable observations:</p>



<p>Google: From 2019 to 2022, the APWG (Anti-Phishing Working Group) Phishing Activity Trends Report indicated that the number of phishing attacks increased by more than 150% per year. Attacks targeting the financial sector accounted for 27.7% of all phishing attacks.

<p>The ToIP Foundation is pleased to announce a 30 day public review of the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-did-method-webs-specification/index.html">did:webs Method Specification</a>. This blog post will explain the motivations for creating this new method for creating and resolving <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs), and also how to participate in the public review process.</p>



 Background 



<p>When DIDs were first invented, the inventors thought that someday there might be perhaps a dozen or so different types of DIDs, called <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">DID methods</a>. Their reasoning was that DIDs solved a very narrow problem—how to create a cryptographically-verifiable identifier—an identifier over which the controller (person, organization, device, bot, etc.) could prove control by virtue of having the associated private key. This new type of identifier would not need to be registered with any centralized authority and could not be spoofed or taken away by some other party (unless they could steal the private key).</p>



<p>Each DID method was simply a different way of specifying how the DID could be securely bound to a public/private key pair. While there are of course multiple ways to do that, what the DID inventors didn’t anticipate is: a) how badly cryptographically verifiable identifiers were needed, and, as a consequence, b) how many DID methods would be created. By the time the DID specification reached <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/w3c-vision-of-decentralization/">a final vote at the W3C</a> in 2022, 112 DID methods had been registered in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/">W3C DID Spec Registries</a>. As of this writing, there are now 184.</p>



 The did:web method 



<p>That’s 184 different ways to create a DID and resolve it to its corresponding DID document (which is where you find the current public key together with other metadata such as the network service endpoint where you can communicate with the controller). Given this massive number of options, it is no surprise that many developers threw up their hands and chose the one that seemed the easiest and most familiar: the did:web method.</p>



<p>What makes the did:web method so intuitive is that all it requires is posting a DID document on a web server. The resulting DID is simply: a) the string did:web: followed by the domain name of the web server and—optionally—the path name to the DID document (with each forward slash turned into a colon). Here’s a simple example: if the DID document will be stored at the URL:</p>



<p>     <code>https://example.com/user/alice</code></p>



<p>…then the corresponding did:web DID is:</p>



<p>     <code>did:web:example.com:user:alice</code></p>



<p>It is that easy. The irony is that the did:web method was very nearly rejected by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">W3C DID Working Group</a> for two reasons:</p>



 
 It is a stretch to call it decentralized since it depends on DNS domain names which require centralized registries. 



 As a result, it inherits all of the security flaws of DNS, and then adds the additional vulnerabilities of storing a “naked” DID document on a web server. Since the DID document contains the public key associated with the DID, anyone who can manage to replace the real DID document with their own version can completely hijack the DID. 
 



<p>For these reasons, once DID adoption started to kick in, it came as somewhat of a shock that did:web was proving to be so popular. In fact, some DID proponents became quite worried that the security issues with did:web might lead to a breach whose ensuing publicity might give all DIDs a bad name.</p>



 The light bulb 



<p>Thankfully, as those concerns mounted, by the summer of 2023, no less than four independent groups all had the same basic insight: the flaws in did:web could be fixed by tunneling a self-certifying identifier inside a did:web string.</p>



<p>What is a self-certifying identifier? See the following diagram that categorizes the three overall types of DIDs by the approach they take to how the DID is bound to the key pair:</p>







<p>In short, a conventional did:web DID is a category 1 administrative DID whose security depends on: a) a TLS certificate administered by a certificate authority, and b) the administrator of the web server. That’s two humans-in-the-loop, either of whose defenses can be penetrated to compromise the DID.</p>



<p>By contrast, a category 3 self-certifying DID, also called an autonomous DID is generated directly inside a digital wallet or hardware security module (HSM) and cryptographically bound to the associated DID. That means there are zero humans-in-the-loop. Anyone with a copy of the DID document can instantly verify—using only a cryptographic proof—that it is bound to that DID and only that DID.</p>



 The did:webs method 



<p>What the different groups realized is that all it takes to “tunnel” a self-certifying identifier inside a conventional did:web DID is to include it as the final path segment. So if the self-certifying identifier is:</p>



<p><code>Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M</code></p>



<p>…and the URL of the folder that will contain the DID document is…</p>



<p><code>https://example.com/user/</code></p>



<p>…then the resulting did:webs DID is:</p>



<p><code>https://example.com/user/Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M</code></p>



<p>In short, a did:webs DID is a valid did:web DID that has special cryptographic properties Thankfully, those properties solve both of the key challenges with the did:web method:</p>



 
 did:webs is more decentralized because, even though resolution of the did:web domain name depends on DNS, the security of the embedded self-certifying identifier does not. It can be generated and maintained in any digital wallet or key management system anywhere. In fact the same self-certifying identifier can be included in multiple did:webs DIDs stored on different web servers around the web, and they all serve as synonyms for each other (which can be explicitly declared in the did:webs DID document—see the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-did-method-webs-specification/index.html">did:webs specification</a> for details). 



 did:webs is more secure because security does NOT depend on the web server. If the web server is hacked and an attacker replaces the did:webs DID document with their own, the fake DID document will not verify because (unless the attacker has stolen the private key), it will not be cryptographically bound to the did:webs DID. 
 



 The did:webs Method Task Force 



<p>Armed with this insight that the simplicity and ease of implementation of did:web could be combined with the decentralization and security properties of self-certifying identifiers, the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/DID+WebS+Method+Task+Force">did:webs Method Task Force</a> was formed in July 2023. The mission was to develop a specification for the did:webs DID method that met the requirements defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 1.0 specification</a>, including creation, resolution, updating, and deactivation of did:webs DID documents.</p>



<p>Given that self-certifying identifiers have always been a foundational feature of the KERI family of specifications being developed by the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force">ToIP ACDC Task Force</a>, the new did:webs Method Task Force was able to rapidly draft a specification based on the autonomic identifiers (AIDs) used by KERI.</p>



<p>The task force previewed their draft did:webs specification at the 37th Internet Identity workshop in Mountain View, California. First Markus Sabadello and Lance Byrd presented <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BC9y4YvLPwOJwnwpwl8puJYwJHUONLovLITxOCOK8FY/edit?usp=sharing">did:webs for Muggles</a>, then Markus gave his <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/did-webs-iiw37-tutorial">did:webs IIW37 Tutorial</a> which covered:</p>



 
 how to create a did:webs identifier,&nbsp; 



 how the associated KERI self-certifying identifier secures the DID document,&nbsp; 



 how to host the information on Github or any other web server, and&nbsp; 



 how the <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">DIF Universal Resolver</a> resolves both the did:web and did:webs versions of the DID document. 
 



<p>Following the feedback received at IIW, the task force further refined the specification and verified it with several implementations. By early December, the task force was ready to request a full public review.</p>

<p>We’ve discussed in our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/attestations-vs-credentials-making-claims-interoperable/">Attestations vs. Credentials</a> blog and <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/examples/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Verifiable Credentials</a> guide how to make two claim standards “work together” on ComposeDB by improving querying efficiency and composability as a result of integrating interfaces. Taking a step back, one of the core benefits these formats unlock for developers is the tamper-evident verification assurance that the resulting signature payloads provide. More broadly, developers (and by extension the users of their applications) who want to use verifiable claims in their applications value claim portability.</p> Why does claim portability matter? <p>Unlike a public blockchain that reveals the behavior of a user address simply by observing its transaction history, claims produced in 'off-chain' environments require different qualities to be inherently 'provable'. At the same time, many developers agree that for certain types of data, or certain application environments, a fully on-chain architecture is both cost-inefficient and non-performant. As a result, some of the systems we’re seeing built on Ceramic today use standards like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> or <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/easscan/offchain?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EAS Offchain Attestations</a> to provide portability assurances.</p><p>Each document written to Ceramic in the form of a Verifiable Credential or off-chain EAS Attestation payload contains everything needed to later recall the document from Ceramic and validate the signatures. The document can therefore be considered “whole” and simply requires minor reconstruction (to create a Verifiable Presentation in the case of a VC, for example).</p> So, what’s the issue? <p>In the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/attestations-vs-credentials-making-claims-interoperable/">Attestations vs. Credentials</a> post, we used a simple <a href="https://beta.api.schemas.serto.id/v1/public/trusted-reviewer/1.0/ld-context.json?ref=blog.ceramic.network">VC definition</a> that is simply meant to illustrate a trust credential issued from one account that points to another. The credential subject therefore only contained two fields:</p>  <code>isTrusted</code> : a boolean field that represents whether the party is trusted or not  <code>id</code> : the DID of the recipient account  <p>Despite the brevity of this credential type, the payload of one example EIP712 instance was quite verbose:</p> <code>{

}</code> <p>As a result, the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/user-controlled-claims/blob/main/composites/00-verifiableClaims.graphql?ref=blog.ceramic.network">schemas</a> used to capture and store the VCs required several layers of interfaces with many subfields. Additionally, as mentioned before, the data itself would still require a process of normalization to create a presentation to be verified (for example the <code>context</code> key used in the ComposeDB schema would need to be replaced with <code>@context</code>).</p><p>This example also requires the end user to sign a transaction in their browser wallet each time a Verifiable Credential is issued, regardless of whether they wish to use a JWS or EIP-712 proof type. You can imagine how this would become cumbersome to a user who wants to issue several in one sitting.</p><p>The entirety of this setup seems like overkill for an assertion that uses such a simple data model. While it may be a necessity for architectures that require the W3C Verifiable Credential standard, those that don’t can ensure claim portability more simply. What if we instead leverage Ceramic’s core capabilities to more seamlessly design an architecture that accomplishes verifiable claims?</p> Example Application: Walk-Through <p>To illustrate how to do this, we’ve put together the following repository that this section of the article will reference:</p> <code>https://github.com/ceramicstudio/did-session-claims</code> <p>Before we begin to boot up a local deployment of our application, let’s talk through how our user authentication is configured, and how this relates to the portability of the claims we’ll produce.</p> Authentication <p>This example uses WalletConnect’s <a href="https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3modal?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web3Modal</a> module to pass authentication logic down through the child components of this application (thus making it possible for us to use for Ceramic authentication). If you navigate into <code>/src/pages/_app.tsx</code>, you can see how our Wagmi configuration encompasses our ComposeDB wrapper, both of which encompass any React components we’ll render to our client.</p><p>Let’s take a deeper look at the ComposeDB wrapper imported and used at the top level of our application. If you open up <code>/src/fragments/index.tsx</code>, you’ll notice how we’re using a React <code>createContext</code> hook to make our ComposeDB client (with our casted runtime definition), an <code>isAuthenticated</code> value, and a <code>keySession</code> object available to any child components that import and call the exported <code>useComposeDB</code> method.</p><p>Take a look at what’s happening in the <code>useEffect</code> hook within the <code>ComposeDB</code> parent object:</p> <code>export const ComposeDB = ({ children }: ComposeDBProps) =&gt; {
  function StartAuth(isAuthenticated: boolean = false) {
    const { data: walletClient, isError, isLoading } = useWalletClient();
    const [isAuth, setAuth] = useState(false);

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
      async function authenticate(
        walletClient: GetWalletClientResult | undefined
      ) {
        if (walletClient ) {
          const accountId = await getAccountId(walletClient, walletClient.account.address)
          console.log(walletClient.account.address, accountId)
          const authMethod = await EthereumWebAuth.getAuthMethod(walletClient, accountId)
          // create session
          const session = await DIDSession.get(accountId, authMethod, { resources: compose.resources })
          //set DID on Ceramic client
          await ceramic.setDID(session.did)
          await session.did.authenticate();
          console.log("Auth'd:", session.did.id);
          localStorage.setItem("did", session.did.id);
          keySession = session;
          setAuth(true);
        }
      }
      authenticate(walletClient);
    }, [walletClient]);

    return isAuth;
  }

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    isAuthenticated = StartAuth();
  }

  return (
    &lt;Context.Provider value={{ compose, isAuthenticated, keySession }}&gt;
      {children}
    &lt;/Context.Provider&gt;
  );
};</code> <p>Since we know our application will be using a wallet client (given our use of Web3Modal), we’ll rely on Wagmi’s <code>useWalletClient</code> method to obtain an account ID and authentication method that we’ll later use as arguments to create a <a href="https://did.js.org/docs/api/modules/did_session/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DID session</a>. In effect, the result creates and authorizes a DID session key for the user, and authorizes that session key with capabilities to write only across the specific data models references in the <code>{resources: compose.resources}</code> object argument. This is the predominant way blockchain accounts can use Sign-In with Ethereum and CACAO for authorization (yielding a parent did:pkh that authorizes child session keys with limited and temporary capabilities).</p><p>Finally, you’ll see how our <code>keySession</code> variable is redefined as the current authenticated session, thus exposing it to any React components that import <code>useComposeDB</code>.</p> DID Class Capabilities <p>If you take a deeper look at the <a href="https://did.js.org/docs/api/classes/dids.DID?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DID Class</a>, you’ll notice a <code>createJWS</code> method available to use that creates a JWS-encoded signature over a specified payload which is signed by the currently authenticated DID. This is what we’ll use to create an explicit JWS-encoded signature over our “Trust Credential” payloads, allowing us to easily determine who signed the payload, and determine if the credential has been altered.</p> Data Models <p>If you navigate into the /composites directory, you’ll find the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/did-session-claims/blob/main/composites/00-verifiableClaims.graphql?ref=blog.ceramic.network">schema definition</a> we’ll use to store this simple assertion type:</p> <code>## our broadest claim type
interface VerifiableClaim
  @createModel(description: "A verifiable claim interface") {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
}

type Trust implements VerifiableClaim
  @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A trust credential") {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  trusted: Boolean!
  jwt: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
}</code> <p>You’ll immediately notice that this definition is much more concise compared to the definitions we used for our Verifiable Credential or Attestation versions of the account trust credential. The <code>recipient</code> and <code>trusted</code> fields will be used to store the end values our users write to Ceramic, while a <code>jwt</code> field will hold our portable claim (which will be redundant against the plain values we’re writing in the two fields above it, but will provide the tamper-evident and portable qualities we’ll want).</p> Writing Our Credentials <p>If you imagine our <code>Trust</code> model without the <code>jwt</code> subfield, a write query to our ComposeDB client might look something like this:</p> <code>const data = await compose.executeQuery(`
      mutation{
        createTrust(input: {
          content: {
            recipient: "${completeCredential.recipient}"
            trusted: ${completeCredential.trusted}
          }
        })
        {
          document{
            id
            recipient{
              id
            }
            trusted
          }
        }
      }
    `);</code> <p>In our case, if you take a look into the <code>/src/components/Claim.tsx</code> component, you’ll notice how the <code>saveBaseCredential</code> method uses a few additional steps to create a JWT string prior to saving to Ceramic:</p> <code>const saveBaseCredential = async () =&gt; {
    const credential = {
      recipient: `did:pkh:eip155:1:${destination.toLowerCase()}`,
      trusted: true,
    };

    if (keySession) {
      const jws = await keySession.did.createJWS(credential);
      const jwsJsonStr = JSON.stringify(jws);
      const jwsJsonB64 = Buffer.from(jwsJsonStr).toString("base64");
      const completeCredential = {
        ...credential,
        jwt: jwsJsonB64,
      };
      const data = await compose.executeQuery(`
      mutation{
        createTrust(input: {
          content: {
            recipient: "${completeCredential.recipient}"
            trusted: ${completeCredential.trusted}
            jwt: "${completeCredential.jwt}"
          }
        })
        {
          document{
            id
            recipient{
              id
            }
            trusted
            jwt
          }
        }
      }
    `);
    }
  };</code> <p>First, notice how we define a <code>credential</code> object that includes only the essential values each assertion needs (the recipient, represented by their did:pkh, and the trusted value). Next, we’re using the <code>createJWS</code> method (mentioned previously) from our authenticated DID session (represented by the <code>keySession</code> yielded by the <code>useComposeDB</code> deconstruction at the top of the component). Finally, we Base64-encode the result and save it to Ceramic.</p><p>Notice how our <code>credential</code> doesn’t hard-code a <code>controller</code> (i.e. the account creating the assertion). As we’ll display later, the DID that was used to create the JWS can be easily extracted from the payload (along with the assertion values) and is therefore inherently included.</p> Getting Started <p>To begin, start by cloning the example app repository and installing your dependencies:</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/did-session-claims &amp;&amp; cd did-session-claims
npm install</code> <p>We’ve set up a script for you in <code>/scripts/commands.mjs</code> to automate the creation of your ComposeDB server configuration and admin credentials. You’ll use it in the next step by running the following command in your terminal:</p> <code>npm run generate</code> <p>If you take a look at your <code>admin_seed.txt</code> and <code>composedb.config.json</code> files, you’ll now see that an admin seed and server configuration have been generated for you. Taking a closer look at your server configuration, you’ll notice the following key-value pair within the JSON object:</p> <code>"ipfs": { "mode": "remote", "host": "http://localhost:5001" }</code> <p>Unlike several of our other tutorials where we run IPFS in “bundled” mode, we’ll need our IPFS instance running separately for this walk-through so we can show how to obtain the session key from the DAG node from IPFS (to prove that the session key used to create the Ceramic commit is the same as the session key that invoked the <code>createJWS</code> method referenced above).</p><p>We’ll want to start our IPFS daemon next (with pubsub enabled):</p> <code>ipfs daemon --enable-pubsub-experiment </code> <p>In a separate terminal, allow CORS (to enable our frontend to access data from the Kubo RPC API):</p> <code>ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin '["'"$origin"'", "http://localhost:8080","http://localhost:3000"]'</code> <p>Finally, start your application:</p> <code>nvm use 20
npm run dev</code> <p>This command will invoke the script created for you in <code>/scripts/run.mjs</code> responsible for deploying our ComposeDB schema on your local node, booting up a GraphiQL instance on port 5005, and starting your NextJS interface on port 3000.</p> Creating Assertions <p>If you navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in your browser, you’ll be able to authenticate yourself by clicking the “Connect Wallet” button in the navigation (using Web3Modal). You’ll also be prompted with a second signature request - this one is from the <code>/src/fragments/index.tsx</code> context we discussed earlier, which creates the DID session, with limited scope to write data only against the <code>VerifiableClaim</code> interface and <code>Trust</code> types (shown in “resources” below):</p><p>You should now see the following in your browser:</p><p>As mentioned above, the corresponding React component can be found at <code>/src/components/Claim.tsx</code>. We’ve added some logs into the code for you, so we recommend inspecting your console in your browser as you follow along.</p><p>Go ahead and enter a dummy wallet address into the <code>Address</code> input field, and click “Generate Claim.” You’ll notice several new logs in your browser console - we’ll walk through these as we explain what’s happening.</p><p>Above we spoke about how we’re using the <code>saveBaseCredential</code> method to use our authenticated session key to sign our credential and save it to Ceramic using a mutation query off of our ComposeDB client. In your text editor, you’ll also see that we’re invoking <code>validateBaseCredential</code> at the end of this call.</p><p>Let’s take a look at what’s happening here:</p> <code>const validateBaseCredential = async () =&gt; {
    const credential: any = await compose.executeQuery(
      `query {
        trustIndex(last: 1){
          edges{
            node{
              recipient{
                id

    );
    console.log(credential.data)
    if (credential.data.trustIndex.edges.length &gt; 0) {
      //obtain did:key used to sign the credential
      const credentialToValidate = credential.data.trustIndex.edges[0].node.jwt;
      const json = Buffer.from(credentialToValidate, "base64").toString();
      const parsed = JSON.parse(json);

      const ceramic = new CeramicClient("http://localhost:7007");
      const streamData = await ceramic.loadStreamCommits(stream);
      const cid: CID | undefined = streamData[0] as CID;
      const cidString = cid?.cid;
			//obtain DAG node from IPFS
      const url = `http://localhost:5001/api/v0/dag/get?arg=${cidString}&amp;output-codec=dag-json`;
      const data = await fetch(url, {

      const toJson: DagJWS = await data.json();
      const res = await newDid.verifyJWS(toJson);
      const didFromDag = res.didResolutionResult?.didDocument?.id;
      console.log(didFromJwt, didFromDag);

        console.log(

        );
      } else {
        console.log("Invalid");
      }
    }
  };</code> <p>First, we’re grabbing the most recent <code>Trust</code> model instance from our index (the one we just created). After we’ve extracted the value of the <code>jwt</code> field from this node and converted it back to a JSON object, notice how we eventually are able to extract the result of the <code>id</code> subfield after verifying the signature (which we subsequently assign to <code>didFromJwt</code>. This is the did:key that was used to sign the JWT.</p><p>Next, for the sake of proving ownership back to the parent did:pkh account, we’ll show how to obtain the did:key from the DAG node that was used to sign the Ceramic commit. After loading the stream commits based on the node’s StreamID and isolating the IPFS CID, we’re making a fetch request to our remote IPFS node running on port 5001, asking for the DAG node that’s tied to the Ceramic commit (for more information on the various API options, visit <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/rpc/?ref=blog.ceramic.network#api-v0-dag-get">Kubo RPC API</a>).</p><p>Similar to how we extracted the did:key from our <code>jwt</code> subfield, we can use the JSON result to verify the signature, and isolate the <code>id</code> field from the DID document. Finally, we log “Valid” after proving that the two DIDs are the same, proving that the did:key used to generate the portable JWS over the data is indeed the same as the controller of the Ceramic stream.</p><p>Finally, just for fun, we’ve set up an embedded GraphiQL instance on the same page for you - go ahead and submit the default query to view an instance result:</p> What have we learned? <p>Different teams will have different requirements related to verifiable claims. For some, the use of a standard like a W3C Verifiable Credential will be a requirement. Other teams might care more about ensuring claim portability which offers an easy way to tie signed data to a signer in a reliable way.</p><p>It’s also likely obvious to some readers that the logic we’ve set up to create a credential object and use the did:key to sign is not happening at the Ceramic protocol level but at the application level, which could be maliciously leveraged by applications to cause their users to generate falsy assertions (though the same could be said about the temporary write privileges a user grants to a certain set of ComposeDB model definitions when they sign and create their DID session).</p><p>At the very least, we hope you walk away from this article with a better understanding of how DID sessions work, how they’re created, and where the DAG nodes can be queried from a Ceramic node’s IPFS instance. There are trade-offs to be considered across all verifiable claim options, so we hope these ideas spark future creativity around new solutions.</p><p>Finally, if you’re interested in diving deeper into what can be done with DID sessions, check out this repository branch that shows how to allow users to generate VCs and EAS attestations using their session signature:</p> <code>https://github.com/ceramicstudio/user-controlled-claims/tree/did-session</code> <p>Navigate to our <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">forum</a> if you have questions or want to contribute to our <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/rfc-verifiable-credentials-on-composedb/1325?ref=blog.ceramic.network">RFC on verifiable claims</a>! </p>

<p>Creating guidelines for common digital wallet user patterns – we need your feedback.</p>







<p>Image Credit: Alta Nel</p>



 Introduction 



<p>The Human Experience Working Group’s Interaction Patterns Task Force is on a mission “to enable digital wallet experiences that are reliable, accessible, and trustworthy.” Think of it like a manual for new gadgets; the digital wallet landscape needs an evolving guide to the common principles and patterns of how we interact with them. We’re running a survey to understand what users and stakeholders really need and want from their ‘digital wallets,’ making it a collective effort. This goal isn’t to provide a singular, one-size-fits all approach; it’s about co-creating a living guide that recognises the diverse contextual needs of different digital wallet users and that keeps up with the twists and turns ahead. Join in by sharing your thoughts in the survey – it’s open to everyone and takes less than 10 minutes. Let’s shape the friendly future of digital wallets together!</p>



 New tech, old problems 



<p>Any time you or I are offered a new piece of technology, confusion is likely to ensue, at least to begin with. Imagine trying to use your air fryer for the first time without having read any of the instructions and imagine how folks felt when cars first hit the scene back in the late 1800s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In ancient times, pedestrians kept to the right side, carrying luggage on their right shoulder for protection. Charioteers preferred the right side for reins control, while armed individuals passed on the left for sword accessibility. The shift to right-hand traffic occurred when people stopped suspecting enemies in every encounter. This historical shift informed the psychology influencing the placement of a car’s driver’s side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to these valuable insights, these conventions and rules improved safety and efficiency, making it easier to teach and provided choices for drivers.</p>



<p>Then, in the early days of automobiles, a simple manual sufficed to guide users through the basic operations. However, as cars evolved with new features, complexities, and technological integrations, so did the need for a more sophisticated manual. The same principle applies to our digital experiences. What worked yesterday may not be sufficient for the challenges of today or the innovations of tomorrow.<br><br>“People ignore design that ignores people.”</p>



<p>— Frank Chimero, Designer</p>



 Understanding and shaping the future of digital wallet experiences 



<p>In an era defined by rapid technological advancements, the need for reliable and secure data exchange has never been more critical. The Human Experience Working Group’s Interaction Patterns Task Force has undertaken a mission to enable consistent, accessible, and trustworthy digital experiences for all.<br><br>Our goal is to create a living resource that contains learnings about the diverse needs and challenges faced by users and stakeholders in the realm of digital wallets, emphasizing a focus on the adoption, operation, and use of digital wallet services. This resource will facilitate those designing and developing in our community to seamlessly implement them.</p>



<p>Much like the evolution of manuals for complex tools such as cars (and air fryers), the emerging landscape of digital wallets demands a guide to navigate its intricacies. By following common principles and patterns of use, digital wallets can reduce cognitive load for users, allowing them to focus on the purpose and context of their interaction rather than the mechanics of operating a digital wallet.</p>



<p>In order to begin this work, we are gathering inputs to better understand the key needs and issues for digital wallet users and stakeholders, from designers to developers, users, issuers, verifiers and regulators. This survey will help to ensure the deliverables of the group meet the needs of the community and bring business value. Open to all, it serves as a channel for users and stakeholders to voice their perspectives, contributing valuable insights to help shape the future of all types of digital wallet experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The survey covers various topics, including:</p>



 
 Understanding how organizations and people engage with digital wallets for life, work and play.&nbsp; 



 Identifying digital wallets that perform well and those that are less effective 



 Determining what Trust over IP deliverables would be most valuable for those people and organizations that rely on digital wallets for their day to day business 



 Examining an individual’s trust preferences and optimal digital wallet experience 
 



 Digital wallet experiences are part of trust-building: Ongoing dialogue and collective responsibility 



<p>We recognise that creating a trustworthy digital environment is an ongoing process, and one that requires the creation of reliable repeatable experiences across the ecosystem. This is why we are encouraging an open dialogue that fosters a sense of collective responsibility and ownership, emphasizing that this landscape is a shared space that evolves through the active participation of its users.</p>



<p>By embracing the concept of an evolving manual, the community acknowledges that this journey is a dynamic process, and our understanding of it must continuously evolve. Not only will technologies develop but so will human behaviors as adoption and use of digital wallets increase. Through initiatives like the survey, we are co-creating a manual that will guide us through the complexities of tomorrow.</p>



<p>This survey is for everyone, and it’ll only take a quick 10 minutes of your time. Feel free to complete it as an individual, a representative of an organization, or even both! The survey will be available from December 13th to 22nd January. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesUrBCsDrmRZwauumBirk2RVy7Bj8fx7ZGJB9BbJkJP9KCuw/viewform">Access the survey right here!</a></p>



<p>We’re excited to share the survey results with the community in early 2024. Importantly this will include the deliverables from the task force that are most important to the community of technologists, designers, implementers and users of digital wallets.</p>

<p>Published December, 2023, revised February 14, 2024 to confirm interoperability demonstration at Gartner IAM conference held in London, UK.</p>
<p>Blog authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/appsdesh/">Apoorva Deshpande</a>, Engineering Leader, Okta.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation Shared Signals Framework (SSF) is an emerging and promising standard for sharing security signals between trusted parties. It has the potential to play a significant role in securing the world by enabling organizations to share indicators of compromise (Security Events) and other security information more easily and efficiently.</p>
 How SSF Can Help Secure Identity and Access by Sharing Security Events 
<p>SSF Events are either artifacts of malicious activity or indicators of session property updates that can be used to monitor, detect, and prevent attacks, without a standard way to share Security Events between organizations, information silos form and weaken defenders’ ability to identify and mitigate threats.</p>
<p>SSF provides a secure and privacy-preserving way for organizations to share information via events. It uses a standard format for representing these events and a secure transport mechanism for sharing them. This makes it easy for organizations to integrate SSF into their existing security infrastructure and to share Security Events with a wide range of partners.</p>
<p>By sharing events among trusted parties, organizations can exchange threat indicators across domains and collaborate to identify and mitigate threats more quickly and effectively.</p>
 Benefits of Using SSF to Share Security Events 
<p>There are several benefits to using SSF to share Security Events, including:</p>
 
 Zero trust security posture: Zero trust is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies the identity and authorization of users, devices, and applications. SSF aligns with zero-trust principles by enabling organizations to continuously share and update security signals, ensuring that access decisions are based on the most up-to-date information. 
 Reduced operational overhead: SSF can help organizations reduce the operational overhead of sharing Security Events by providing a standard and automated way. This allows organizations to leverage the collective knowledge of the federated ecosystem to make more informed access control decisions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. 
 Increased visibility: SSF empowers organizations to share information about their cloud security posture, including security policies, configurations, and incident response procedures. This transparency fosters collaboration and enables organizations to learn from each other’s experiences, improving overall cloud security posture. 
 Seamless Federated Identity Management: In federated identity management, multiple organizations manage user identities and access control. This shared responsibility can create challenges in ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive resources. SSF is crucial in addressing these challenges by enabling organizations to share security signals about users, devices, and applications. 
 Enabling Continuous Risk Assessment: SSF enables continuous risk assessment by providing a mechanism for sharing real-time information about user behavior, device health, and network activity. This continuous risk assessment allows organizations to dynamically adjust access control measures based on the evolving threat landscape. 
 
 NSA and CISA Report on SSF 
<p>The National Security Agency (NSA) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recently published <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/04/2003313510/-1/-1/0/ESF%20CTR%20IAM%20MFA%20SSO%20CHALLENGES.PDF">a report on the future of identity and access management (IAM)</a>. In the report, the NSA and CISA identified SSF as an emerging and promising standard for sharing security signals between trusted parties.</p>
<p>The report states that SSF has the potential to “revolutionize the way that organizations share security information.” It also notes that SSF is “gaining traction in the industry” and that it is “being used by several leading organizations.” Although this is not an endorsement of the specifications, it is encouraging to see the US government’s recognition of the SSF’s potential to support infrastructure security by closing critical gaps.</p>
 How SSF Will Be Useful in the Future 
<p>According to Okta’s blog post on <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/08/exploration-of-open-identity-standards/">the future of open identity standards</a>, SSF will be useful in the following ways:</p>
 
 Improving risk-based authentication: SSF profile signals can be used to assess the risk of a particular login attempt (Tokens Claim changed, assurance level change, etc.) and implement risk-based authentication measures, such as requiring additional authentication factors for high-risk logins. 
 Preventing fraud: SSF can be used to identify patterns of fraudulent activities (credentials change, Credential Compromise, etc.) and block fraudulent transactions by requesting re-authentication or step-up challenges. 
 Improving threat detection and response: SSF can be used to share Security Events and other security information between trusted parties, enabling them to detect and respond to threats more quickly and effectively. 
 
<p>Apple’s decision to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10254">mandate the Shared Signals Framework (SSF) for custom identity providers in Apple Business Manager</a> marks a step forward in adopting this open standard, signaling its growing recognition within the industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2023/06/okta-to-improve-user-experience-through-apple-business-manager/">Okta is proud to be one of the first identity providers to implement this new capability </a><a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2023/06/okta-to-improve-user-experience-through-apple-business-manager/">to integrate seamlessly with Apple’s new feature</a>, further solidifying SSF’s position as a promising industry standard with the potential to transform identity management practices.</p>
<p>Cisco’s <a href="https://sharedsignals.guide/">sharedsignals.guide</a><a href="https://sharedsignals.guide/"> has also supported the industry with a robust guide for developers on the benefits and how to take advantage of current shared signals capabilities</a>, and SGNL’s <a href="http://caep.dev">caep.dev</a> is a tool to help implementers build to the shared signals spec and get responses from a Transmitter.</p>
<p>The involvement of tech giants and start-ups underscores the framework’s maturity and potential to become the de facto standard for identity management in the coming years.</p>
 How to get involved in the Shared Signals Framework 
 
 Joining the SSWG as contributors: <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">The Shared Signals Working Group</a> (SSWG) is the group responsible for developing and maintaining the SSF specification. Interested parties can join the SSWG as contributors to help shape the future of the framework. 
 Taking part in the interop demonstration: The SSWG is planning an interoperability demonstration at the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/identity-access-management-uk/agenda">Gartner IAM conference held in London, UK</a>. Interested parties can participate in the demonstration to see how SSF can be used to share security signals between different products and vendors. Please email the co-chair of SSWG, <a href="mailto:atul@sgnl.ai">Atul Tulshibagwale</a>, if you are interested. 
 Early adoption: Early adopters of SSF will benefit from being at the start of deployment and vendor selection as these capabilities become baseline expectations for implementors ranging from the US Government to leading digital platforms and relying parties. They can also take a central role in the ecosystem governance efforts. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The OpenID Foundation Shared Signals Framework is a promising new standard for sharing security signals between trusted parties. It has the potential to play a significant role in securing the world by enabling organizations to share Security Events and other security information more easily and efficiently.</p>
<p>Organizations should consider adopting SSF to improve security posture and reduce the operational overhead of sharing Security Events.</p>

 WAO’s 2023 in&nbsp;Review <p>2023 is drawing to a close, so we thought a reflection and roundup on life inside of WAO would be a nice thing to do before we take some time off to reset for 2024. It’s been quite a full year, with a lot of amazing experiences that have pushed us along towards what we call <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/practical-utopias-and-rewilding-work-27c148d95b16">a practical utopia</a>. Our utopia is a working environment where our members and collaborators work within the intersections of things they care&nbsp;about.</p>Our practical utopia flower cc-by&nbsp;WAO Community is everything <p>Not only are members of WAO expert community builders, we are lucky to move within various communities that help us learn and grow. We consider ourselves a community, and as leadership in communities change, so does the culture. This year, Bryan stepped back from being a founding member of the co-op and became a collaborator. He came to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wao-were-almost-seven-8921f530284b">a final IRL meet-up in Amsterdam</a> to celebrate his membership.</p><p>As we said goodbye, we were all worried about how our relationship would change. While it was certainly an adjustment, and while we do miss Bryan in our internal channels and meetings, WAO still gets to work with him all the time! This year, we pulled him into several projects to help us find the right metaphors and visuals. We look forward to working with him in 2024&nbsp;too.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>As Bryan stepped back, Anne stepped up. Anne moved from being WAO’s intern to being a collaborator last year already. But this year, she spent more time “in the office”. She also finished her Bachelor of Arts degree in Media Education and Culture Studies, an accomplishment that fits in perfectly with our Learning and Development Department*.</p><p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/integrating-open-recognition-into-program-and-course-designs-5430a173a1f8">Anne’s educational story</a> has become a way for us all to talk about the need for Open Recognition, and her interest in gender equity and feminist workplaces has made WAO even more equitable and inclusive. We’re pleased to collaborate with Anne on her interests and looking forward to sharing her ePIC talk “Open Recognition is for Everybody — A feminist practice for more equal workplaces”.</p><p>*We don’t have departments ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p><p>This year, we were also lucky to collaborate with others in our network. There are too many to name, but we are ecstatic about our deepening relationships with many from <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a> and the <a href="https://badges.community">Open Recognition is for Everybody Community</a>, members of <a href="https://workers.coop">Workers.coop</a> and the world of cooperatives, as well as individuals in activist communities like <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/nurturing-the-wellbeing-economy-4396a8ad5bb4">WEAll</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/navigating-greenpeaces-critical-incident-network-5d9fe79ea824">Greenpeace</a>.</p> We have an awesome&nbsp;network cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>We kicked off the year helping some folks at Change.org <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/radiating-confidence-at-change-org-9fbbe9f4fc2f">rock their workshops and presentations</a>. Early in 2023, we also worked a bit with passbolt to help their budding community team plan for the rest of the year. We talked about <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-art-of-community-cultivating-online-connections-738cc90b0a39">anti-transactional relationship building</a> and, of course, Open Recognition. We also helped WEAll think about their digital strategy through the lens of “<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/people-process-product-5a3dfbe565b">People, Product and Process</a>”, and facilitated a hackathon for <a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/">Historic England</a> to allow their developers to get their hands dirty with AI. Each of these projects helped us learn more about our network and the organisations in&nbsp;it.</p><p>We returned to Amsterdam in the early summer, when <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/we-are-open-coop-x-mozilla-festival-house-23407548b900">we went to the Mozilla Festival</a> and talked about co-ops, <a href="https://ailiteracy.fyi">AI Literacy</a>, transparency and the power of open.

   <p>In our rapidly evolving digital world, the way we manage and verify our identities is undergoing a fundamental transformation. At the forefront of this change is the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which is set to redefine digital identity management. This 1000-word exploration delves into the essence of SSI, particularly its open-source variant, and examines why it is poised to be a cornerstone of our digital future.</p>



 Understanding Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) 



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity represents a paradigm shift in digital identity management. Unlike traditional models where third-party organizations hold and control individual identity data, SSI places the power back into the hands of the individual. It enables people to own, control, and share their personal information without the need for intermediaries. This approach not only enhances privacy but also reduces the risk of data breaches and misuse.</p>



 The Role of Open Source in SSI 



<p>Open source plays a pivotal role in the development and adoption of SSI technologies. By its nature, open source promotes transparency, community collaboration, and continuous improvement. These attributes are crucial for building a robust and trustworthy digital identity system.</p>



 Transparency and Security 



<p>In an open-source SSI system, the underlying code is available for anyone to review, audit, and improve. This transparency is vital for security. It allows experts worldwide to scrutinize the code for vulnerabilities, ensuring that the system is as secure as possible. In a domain as sensitive as identity management, such widespread scrutiny is invaluable.</p>



 Community-Driven Development 



<p>Open-source SSI benefits from community-driven development. A diverse community of developers, users, and stakeholders contribute to the project, bringing in a wide range of perspectives and expertise. This collaboration leads to more innovative and user-centric solutions.</p>



 Adaptability and Interoperability 



<p>Open-source projects are known for their adaptability. As new challenges and requirements emerge, the open-source SSI systems can evolve swiftly to meet these changes. Moreover, open-source projects often prioritize interoperability, ensuring that different systems and applications can work seamlessly together, an essential feature for widespread adoption of SSI.</p>



 The Advantages of SSI 



 Empowering Individuals 



<p>SSI empowers individuals with direct control over their personal information. They can decide what information to share, with whom, and for how long. This autonomy not only enhances privacy but also fosters a sense of control and dignity.</p>



 Reducing Reliance on Central Authorities 



<p>By decentralizing identity management, SSI reduces reliance on central authorities. This decentralization not only mitigates risks associated with data breaches at central points but also prevents misuse of power by these centralized entities.</p>



 Enhancing Privacy 



<p>Privacy is at the heart of SSI. By allowing individuals to share only the necessary information, SSI minimizes data exposure. For instance, instead of sharing a birth certificate to prove age, a person can simply provide a verification that they are over a certain age, without revealing their exact birth date.</p>



 Streamlining Verification Processes 



<p>SSI can streamline verification processes, saving time and resources for both individuals and organizations. For instance, once an individual’s credentials are verified and stored in their SSI, they don’t need to be re-verified each time they are used.</p>



 The Challenges Ahead 



 Technological Barriers 



<p>Despite its potential, SSI faces technological challenges. Developing a user-friendly, secure, and scalable SSI system is complex. There’s also the need for widespread interoperability among various SSI systems, which is a significant undertaking.</p>



 Regulatory and Legal Hurdles 



<p>SSI operates in a space that intersects with various legal and regulatory frameworks. Navigating these, particularly in areas like data protection and identity verification laws, is challenging.</p>



 Adoption and Awareness 



<p>For SSI to truly succeed, it needs widespread adoption. This requires not only technological solutions but also efforts to raise awareness and educate both users and organizations about the benefits of SSI.</p>



 The Road Ahead: Implementing Open Source SSI 



 Collaborative Development 



<p>The future success of open-source SSI hinges on collaborative development. Encouraging participation from diverse stakeholders, including governments, businesses, and civil society, is crucial.</p>



 Building an Ecosystem 



<p>Developing an ecosystem around SSI, complete with supportive tools, applications, and services, is essential. This ecosystem should be user-friendly and accessible to encourage adoption.</p>



 Policy and Regulation 



<p>Engaging with policymakers to develop supportive and clear regulatory frameworks is vital. These frameworks should protect users while encouraging innovation and growth in the SSI space.</p>



 Pilot Projects and Use Cases 



<p>Implementing pilot projects and highlighting successful use cases can demonstrate the practical benefits of SSI. These examples can range from streamlined online services to enhanced privacy in digital transactions.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Open-source SSI is more than just a new technology; it’s a movement towards a more secure, private, and user-centric digital world. Its promise lies in empowering individuals with control over their identity, fostering innovation through collaboration, and building a more inclusive digital society. While</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/examples/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Verifiable Credentials tutorial</a> and <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/data-provenance-composedb-as-an-authenticated-database/">Data Provenance</a> blog article, we discussed how some teams building on Ceramic use verifiable claims to make assertions about their users or allow their users to make claims about other users or non-user entities. At the time of writing this article, we’re seeing momentum build and excitement aggregate along particular claim standards (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> and attestations using the <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/welcome?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ethereum Attestation Service</a>). At the core of these standards are the features they unlock, not only for the users themselves but (importantly) the developers integrating them into their applications.</p><p>So what are these features? What are the differences in capabilities between standards currently being used? What trade-offs should developers consider before choosing one framework over another? Is there a world where they can be used together?</p><p>As you might’ve guessed, these are the topics we’ll cover below. More specifically, we will observe how these standards compare in the world of off-chain self-sovereign identity (SSI).</p> Common Features of Verifiable Claims  Schemas <p>If verifiable claims themselves are building blocks of online trust and reputation, the schemas those claims use provide their necessary structure. This ensures that two separate instances of a claim that fall into the same claim “family” can be predictably and reliably interpreted.</p><p>For example, if you were using a <code>courseCompleted</code> schema in an academic setting that used a required boolean field (representing whether or not a student passed a course) and a required string field (to identify the course by name), it would be hard to consume and interpret data instances that had additional unwanted fields or were altogether missing one of those two required fields.</p><p>Take a look at how the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.ceramic.network#data-schemas">data schemas</a> W3C section articulates the need for schemas in comparison to a <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/core--concepts/how-eas-works?ref=blog.ceramic.network#schemas-give-structure-to-the-attestation">similar section</a> on the EAS docs site. While the implementation differs, both point out that schemas are essential for enforcing data conformity within a given collection.</p> Public Schema Registries <p>A schema registry is another commonality between these emergent standards, with the connecting tissue being a place to publicly reference and house schemas. In the world of decentralization and SSI, the registry plays a particularly compelling role because it enables disparate applications to build on shared data models due to the predictability of the shape of each data instance.</p><p>For instance, if <code>Application A</code> is a Ph.D. program, it can validate credentials created by <code>Application B</code>, a four-year university, and issue credentials to the same <code>courseCompleted</code> schema. <code>Employer A</code> cares about credentials issued by both <code>Application A</code> and <code>Application B</code>.</p><p>For entities issuing claims, these registries both serve the purpose of helping those teams ensure their data conforms to the schemas they utilize, while (just as importantly) functioning as a discovery mechanism for types of SSI. Entities consuming and validating those claims use those schema definitions to validate whether a user has cryptographically signed a given statement, making it essentially impossible for bad actors to tamper with those claims.</p><p>Registries like <a href="https://schemas.serto.id/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Serto</a> service this need for applications using Verifiable Credentials, whereas <a href="https://github.com/Consensys/linea-attestation-registry?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Verax</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-contracts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EAS</a> use immutable on-chain registries where anyone can deploy or reference schemas for attestations.</p> Credential Metadata + Body <p>The most obvious commonality across standards is the assertion itself (presumably in the form of the schema it is using), alongside other important metadata such as expiration dates or revocation status. The form and corresponding values of the credential itself, for example, are checked against the expected form of the schema by issuers, thus making it easy to omit nonconforming data altogether.</p> Proof (Signatures) <p>Whereas a public ledger of record like a blockchain verifiably reveals the behavior of a user address simply by observing its transaction history (thus simplifying the observability of on-chain attestations so long as a user’s account hasn’t been hacked), verifiable claims produced elsewhere must include cryptographic proofs that verify the provenance of those assertions. Similar to the role of public schema registries, attached proofs ensure that consuming entities can reliably verify that a given user has made some claim, agnostic of where the claim was stored or when it was produced.</p><p>For example, the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-sdk/blob/master/src/offchain/offchain.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EAS off-chain module</a> incurs an <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EIP-712</a> <code>signTypedData</code> request that packages the contents of the attestation as method arguments, encodes, hashes, and requests a user signature over the hash of that data. <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/veramo/blob/next/packages/credential-eip712/src/agent/CredentialEIP712.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Veramo’s EIP-712 module</a> (just one method of producing a signature with Veramo) similarly requests and yields an EIP-712-conforming payload over the Verifiable Credential being signed.</p><p>Finally, public data ledgers like Ceramic are architected on mutable data streams, allowing users to create and mutate their streams as much as they desire under a single authenticated session. Users might choose to make claims about themselves or others without an additional attestation or framework layer.</p><p><a href="https://www.oamo.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Oamo</a>, for example, is a platform build on Ceramic that helps individuals own and monetize their data by granting access to it to other organization and companies in exchange for rewards. Oamo generates claims authored by the application itself (as opposed to user-authored claims). For example, Oamo would issue a certain claim type after a user has connected their Twitter account. Unlike teams like <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/gitcoin-passport-on-ceramic-enabling-trustworthy-beta-round-donations/">Gitcoin</a> that are storing Verifiable Credentials on Ceramic, Oamo uses predefined ComposeDB schemas to provide claim structure, with no additional Verifiable Credential or attestation frameworks or layering on top. You can view one of these model definitions <a href="https://scan.s3.xyz/models/modelview/kjzl6hvfrbw6cb8b9j326870su0gmlziwepl5nu8jk9tybwxe7mobm67cqd58a3?network=MAINNET&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p><p>Similar to a blockchain, if a data consumer is aware that claims are being authored by users they care about in this type of environment, they can choose to index on those streams and can rest assured of the provenance and lineage of that user data. Ease of portability to a different environment later on, however, might be an issue under this paradigm.</p> Decentralized Identifiers <p>If you’re reading this, chances are you already know the whole spiel on DIDs, so we won’t spend too much time here. The important key to note here is how these identifiers are viewed as an essential pillar of SSI. Similar to how issuers and consumers of verifiable claims containing proofs can collaborate on shared data due to the inherent characteristics of those claims, DIDs ensure that individual users can take their identity from one context to another without the permission or awareness of some central actor.</p> Choosing between Claim Types <p>Despite their similarities, developers who choose to incorporate claims into their applications must consider the trade-offs and differences in experience each method offers. For the purpose of this comparison, I’m intentionally isolating “off-chain” claims (produced either by signed meta transactions, or claims generated on a public data ledger like Ceramic, both of which incur no cost to the issuer).</p><p>Given this brief comparison, it’s easy to understand why many teams choose to build high-portability claim types like Verifiable Credentials on top of a public data network like Ceramic. This combination works in complimentary fashion to enable easy portability and verifiability (when using a framework), alongside the availability and discoverability benefits of a network.</p> Making Claim Standards Interoperable <p>Given the similarities between the two tamper-evident claim methods, developers might want to give their users optionality by allowing them to choose which one to use. For teams building on Ceramic and utilizing ComposeDB, they can offer their users this flexibility without degrading the efficiency of their query logic. By using interfaces, developers can define a “family” of data under a <code>verifiableClaim</code> (or other preferred name) interface, and define the low-hanging similarities between the two standards as interface subfields. The standard-specific subfields can be used as differentiators defined within higher-level types.</p><p>For example, let’s say an application wants to allow their users to create <code>accountTrust</code> claims that point to a DID and contain a boolean value representing trust or distrust (here’s a <a href="https://beta.api.schemas.serto.id/v1/public/trusted-reviewer/1.0/ld-context.json?ref=blog.ceramic.network">VC definition</a> and <a href="https://easscan.org/schema/view/0x776c6c1d76055522753787b3abfdbeeff262cda35eebecaf83059b738698ef62?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EAS schema</a> that do exactly this). Here’s a resulting payload from each:</p> <code>// Credential

</code> <p>You’ll notice a few things right away that underline differences we’ll have to account for when saving to ComposeDB. For example, the <code>issuer</code> and <code>[credentialSubject.id](&lt;http://credentialSubject.id&gt;)</code> fields within our Verifiable Credential use DIDs, whereas the <code>account</code> (akin to issuer) and <code>message.recipient</code> within our attestation use Eth addresses. The signatures are also different in observing the <code>signature</code> object within our Attestation instance vs. our <code>proof.proofValue</code> credential field.</p><p>Let’s assume we want to make these work as-is without deploying new Verifiable Credential or Attestation schemas.</p> Layer 0 (Broadest) <p>Since we’re allowing our users to both author their own claims and corresponding Ceramic documents, our broadest-level interface can therefore tie together the claim creator with the claim recipient:</p> <code>## our broading claim type

interface VerifiableClaim 
@createModel(description: "A verifiable claim interface")
{
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
}
</code> <p>We will need to account for the differences between the payloads and how they must be saved. For example:</p> <code>//attestations

recipient: "${"did:pkh:eip155:1:" + attestation.message.recipient}"

//VCs

recipient: "${credential.credentialSubject.id}"
</code>  Layer 1 <p>Our next level down entrypoint can therefore dictate the claim type that was used:</p> <code>## our overarching VC interface that acts agnostic of our proof type

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>  Layer 3 <p>Our next layer can include the specific values relevant to the claim. We’ve maxed out the layers we want to use for our Attestations (so we’ll define this as a type), while our Verifiable Credentials will detach the proof type from the claim:</p> <code>interface AccountTrustCredential implements VerifiableClaim &amp; VerifiableCredential  
  @createModel(description: "A verifiable credential interface for account trust credentials")
{
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  issuer: Issuer! 
  context: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  type: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  credentialSchema: CredentialSchema!
  credentialStatus: CredentialStatus
  issuanceDate: DateTime!
  expirationDate: DateTime
  credentialSubject: AccountTrustSubject! 
}

type AccountTrustSubject
{
  id: DID! @accountReference
  trusted: Boolean! 
}

type AccountAttestation implements VerifiableClaim &amp; Attestation 
  @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "An account attestation")
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["time"] }])
{
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  attester: DID! @accountReference
  uid: String! @string(minLength: 66, maxLength: 66)
  schema: String! @string(minLength: 66, maxLength: 66)
  verifyingContract: String! @string(minLength: 42, maxLength: 42)
  easVersion: String! @string(maxLength: 5)
  version: Int!
  chainId: Int! 
  r: String! @string(minLength: 66, maxLength: 66)
  s: String! @string(minLength: 66, maxLength: 66)
  v: Int! 
  types: [Types] @list(maxLength: 100)
  expirationTime: DateTime
  revocationTime: DateTime
  refUID: String @string(minLength: 66, maxLength: 66)
  time: Int! 
  data: String! @string(maxLength: 1000000)
  trusted: Boolean!
}
</code> <p>Incorporating into our querying:</p> <code>query VerifiableClaims {
  verifiableClaimIndex(last: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        recipient {
          id
        }
        controller {
          id
        }
        ... on VerifiableCredential {
          issuer {
            id
          }
          ... on AccountTrustCredential {
            credentialSubject {
              id {
                id
              }
              trusted
            }
          }
        }
        ... on Attestation {
          ... on AccountAttestation {
            attester {
              id
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>  Layer 4 (most specific) <p>Finally, since we’ve defined our <code>AccountTrustCredential</code> interface as agnostic of our proof type, our final layer will define types that differentiate based on proof:</p> <code>type AccountTrustCredential712 implements VerifiableClaim &amp; VerifiableCredential &amp; AccountTrustCredential &amp; VCEIP712Proof 
  @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A verifiable credential of type EIP712 for account trust credentials")
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "issuanceDate" }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "trusted" }]) {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  issuer: Issuer! 
  context: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  type: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  credentialSchema: CredentialSchema!
  credentialStatus: CredentialStatus
  issuanceDate: DateTime!
  expirationDate: DateTime
  credentialSubject: AccountTrustSubject! 
  trusted: Boolean!
  proof: ProofEIP712!
}

type AccountTrustCredentialJWT implements VerifiableClaim &amp; VerifiableCredential &amp; AccountTrustCredential &amp; VCJWTProof 
  @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A verifiable credential of type JWT for account trust credentials")
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "issuanceDate" }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "trusted" }]) {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  issuer: Issuer! 
  context: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  type: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  credentialSchema: CredentialSchema!
  credentialStatus: CredentialStatus
  issuanceDate: DateTime!
  expirationDate: DateTime
  credentialSubject: AccountTrustSubject! 
  trusted: Boolean!
  proof: ProofJWT!
}
</code> <p>Putting it all together in a query example:</p> <code>query VerifiableClaims {
  verifiableClaimIndex(last: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        recipient {
          id

</code> <p>You can begin to see how developers who might want to account for multiple claim types, each with sub-options offering different proof types, while still exposing these as queryable under an overarching claim family can start to do interesting things with precision using interfaces.</p><p>Developers will still need to keep the reconstruction and validation mechanics in mind, given the deconstruction and alterations made to the data in order to save to ComposeDB and make it interoperable under a <code>VerifiableClaim</code> interface, and the client-side work required to reconstruct the claim into an acceptable format to be verified.</p><p>To view and experiment with the example code yourself, visit and clone <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/user-controlled-claims?ref=blog.ceramic.network">this repository</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

<p>On November 23, we held the second community call for our project directed at <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-working-towards-a-healthier-and-more-robust-information-ecosystem-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/" title="">building a healthier and more robust information ecosystem</a> in Latin America and the Caribbean. We were joined by 20 participants from 10 countries in the region and had a collective conversation about the different ways each participant and their organisations were working to strengthen this&nbsp; ecosystem, and about the challenges they’re facing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We appreciate everyone who came to share their perspectives and expertise with the group. In this blog post, we’re sharing some of the major themes that emerged from this conversation.</p>



 “If the actors who are damaging the information ecosystem are really good at collaborating, we have to be even better” 



<p>When talking about how the information ecosystem in the region could become stronger, the need for more collaboration between different actors who are working to create healthier information ecosystems was quickly pointed out by participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are quite a lot of similarities in terms of the challenges civil society faces in the information ecosystem across the region – whether it’s the existence of coordinated groups perpetuating mis- and disinformation or local governments rolling out similar strategies to curtail civil society organising. To respond to this context, practitioners mentioned wanting to have multidisciplinary spaces where those working towards social justice can have dialogue about common challenges they’re facing in the information ecosystem, share strategies and projects they’re working on, and eventually combine efforts and work on projects together.</p>



<p>Though collaboration was seen by participants as something needed in the space, they also shared how difficult it can be to secure long-term resources to make regional and/or cross-sector collaboration possible. Participants from countries like Brazil, Argentina and Colombia talked about how collaboration requires a lot of time and coordination – “to build trust, consolidate relationships, find alignment” – and it can be hard to secure funding to undertake the activities and the work of forming alliances, which is sometimes seen as “invisible” and/or “not urgent”.&nbsp;</p>



 Threats to civil society and machismo as concerning features of information ecosystems in the region&nbsp; 



<p>During our conversation, participants also indicated the impact that governments with authoritarian tendencies have had on the information ecosystem in the region. Participants shared that they have been dealing with governmental surveillance, censorship in digital platforms and, occasionally, the spread of misinformation and disinformation coming from state actors. One participant working on sexual and reproductive health and rights, for instance, shared that though they work on a regional level, their content on social media was removed at the request of a municipal government in one of the countries in which they work, showing the impact that local governments can have on the information ecosystem more broadly.</p>



<p>Relatedly, a number of participants described how expressions of machismo, including gender based violence and gendered dis- and misinformation, are defining features of the information ecosystem in Latin America. For instance, one practitioner described how they witness a large amount of disinformation on sexual and reproductive health and rights, and in their work, they face significant issues, such as censoring and digital attacks. Another person working to share audiovisual content on sexual and gender dissidences in Latin America also faces censorship in the process of sharing their work. To those who joined our conversation last week, building a healthier and more robust information ecosystem in the region requires <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/10-inspiring-initiatives-fighting-online-political-violence-in-latin-america/" title="">fighting these types of gendered violence</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Building bridges and sharing knowledge for a stronger information ecosystem 



<p>During this call, participants talked about leveraging digital technologies (as well as using other relevant strategies!) to communicate with each other and create bridges across different sectors and areas of work, which includes building collective knowledge around skills such as communications, digital security and data, digital rights, and more. To this end, like in the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/a-slow-burning-process-to-improve-the-information-ecosystem-we-need-to-rebuild-trust-and-focus-on-local-community-driven-initiatives/">previous community call</a>, participants highlighted the importance of working to improve information ecosystems on a local level, fostering a sense of community and responding to the information needs of their communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the inspiring initiatives we got to know a little more during the call and who are working towards strengthening their local information ecosystems include:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.taturana.org/" title="">Taturana</a>, a Brazilian film distribution organisation working with local mediators to make social impact movies more accessible;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://datalabe.org/" title="">DataLabe</a> a narrative and data lab from Maré in Rio de Janeiro;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://mujeresalborde.org/programa/al-borde-producciones/" title="">Escuela Audiovisual al Borde</a>, organised by Mujeres Al Borde to help people can create their own narratives and content;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://nosmulheresdaperiferia.com.br/" title="">Nós Mulheres da Periferia</a>, a Black-women led journalistic vehicle in Brazil;&nbsp; 



 Linterna Verde’s project <a href="https://www.circuito.digital/" title="">circuito.digital</a> through which they help organisations to understand content moderation problems and document cases;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://latfem.org/" title="">LatFem</a>, a digital native feminist media working to provide quality information in the region;&nbsp; 



 … and many more (we’ll keep sharing more about this in our blog over the next few months!). 
 



<p>Participants also talked about support and investment in work done by indigenous, quilombola and black-led organisations as something that is crucial to having stronger local information ecosystems in the region.</p>



 What’s next and how you can get involved 



<p>During the next few weeks, we’re interviewing researchers, communicators, journalists, civic media professionals, digital rights defenders and social justice activists working to build better information ecosystems in Latin America and the Caribbean. We’ll also host another community call for this project in the beginning of 2024 – keep an eye on our blog and <a href="https://us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=1747fd8a7bf587bd4a215d984&amp;id=53139510a0" title="">newsletter</a> for more info on how you can join us!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/community-diagnosis-protecting-the-health-of-the-latin-american-information-ecosystems/" title="">Read in English</a></p>



<p>No dia 23 de novembro, realizamos a segunda chamada comunitária do nosso projeto voltado para a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-working-towards-a-healthier-and-more-robust-information-ecosystem-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/" title="">construção de um ecossistema de informação mais saudável e robusto</a> na América Latina e no Caribe. Contamos com a presença de 20 participantes de 10 países da região e tivemos uma conversa coletiva sobre as diferentes maneiras pelas quais cada participante e suas organizações estavam trabalhando para fortalecer esse ecossistema e sobre os desafios que estavam enfrentando.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Agradecemos a todas as pessoas que vieram compartilhar suas perspectivas e conhecimentos com o grupo. Nesta publicação, compartilhamos alguns dos principais temas que surgiram dessa conversa.</p>



 “Se os atores que estão prejudicando o ecossistema de informação são muito bons em colaborar uns com os outros, nós temos que ser ainda melhores” 



<p>Ao falar sobre como o ecossistema de informações na região poderia se fortalecer, participantes rapidamente apontaram a necessidade de mais colaboração entre os diferentes atores que estão trabalhando para criar ecossistemas de informação mais saudáveis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Há muitas semelhanças em termos dos desafios que a sociedade civil enfrenta no ecossistema de informações em toda a região – seja a existência de grupos coordenados que perpetuam a desinformação ou os governos locais que implementam estratégias semelhantes para restringir a organização da sociedade civil. Para responder a esse contexto, participantes da chamada mencionaram o desejo de ter espaços multidisciplinares onde aqueles que trabalham em prol da justiça social possam dialogar sobre os desafios comuns que estão enfrentando no ecossistema de informação, compartilhar estratégias e projetos em que estão trabalhando e, por fim, combinar esforços e trabalhar em projetos juntos.</p>



<p>Embora a colaboração tenha sido apontada por participantes como algo necessário no espaço, as pessoas presentes também compartilharam como pode ser difícil garantir recursos de longo prazo para viabilizar a colaboração regional e/ou intersetorial. Participantes de países como Brasil, Argentina e Colômbia falaram sobre como colaboração significativa exige muito tempo e coordenação – “para criar confiança, consolidar relacionamentos, encontrar alinhamento” – e pode ser difícil garantir financiamento para realizar as atividades e o trabalho de formação de alianças, que às vezes é visto como “invisível” e/ou “não urgente”.</p>



 Ameaças à sociedade civil e machismo como características preocupantes dos ecossistemas de informação na região&nbsp; 



<p>Durante nossa conversa, participantes também indicaram o impacto que governos com tendências autoritárias têm tido sobre o ecossistema de informação na região. Compartilharam que têm lidado com vigilância governamental, censura em plataformas digitais e, ocasionalmente, com a disseminação de desinformação proveniente de agentes estatais. Uma das pessoas presentes, que trabalha com saúde e direitos sexuais e reprodutivos, por exemplo, relatou que, embora trabalhe em nível regional, seu conteúdo nas mídias sociais foi removido a pedido de um governo municipal em um dos países em que trabalha, mostrando o impacto que os governos locais podem ter sobre o ecossistema de informações de forma mais ampla.</p>



<p>Várias participantes descreveram como as expressões de machismo, inclusive a violência baseada em gênero e a desinformação de gênero, são características definidoras do ecossistema de informação na América Latina. Por exemplo, uma pessoa descreveu como ela testemunha uma grande quantidade de desinformação sobre saúde e direitos sexuais e reprodutivos e, em seu trabalho, enfrenta problemas significativos, como censura e ataques digitais. Outra pessoa que trabalha para compartilhar conteúdo audiovisual sobre dissidências sexuais e de gênero na América Latina também relatou enfrentar censura no processo de compartilhamento de seu trabalho. Para quem participou da nossa conversa na semana passada, a construção de um ecossistema de informações mais saudável e robusto na região exige o <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/10-inspiring-initiatives-fighting-online-political-violence-in-latin-america/" title="">combate a esses tipos de violência de gênero</a>.</p>



 Construindo pontes e compartilhando conhecimento para um ecossistema de informação mais forte 



<p>Durante a chamada, participantes falaram sobre o aproveitamento das tecnologias digitais (bem como o uso de outras estratégias relevantes!) para se comunicarem entre si e criarem pontes entre diferentes setores e áreas de trabalho, o que inclui a construção de conhecimento coletivo sobre habilidades como comunicação, segurança e dados digitais, direitos digitais e muito mais. Para isso, assim como na <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/a-slow-burning-process-to-improve-the-information-ecosystem-we-need-to-rebuild-trust-and-focus-on-local-community-driven-initiatives/" title="">chamada comunitária anterior</a>, participantes destacaram a importância de trabalhar para melhorar os ecossistemas de informação em nível local, promovendo um senso de comunidade e respondendo às necessidades de informação de suas comunidades.</p>



<p>Algumas das iniciativas inspiradoras que conhecemos durante a chamada e que estão trabalhando para fortalecer seus ecossistemas de informações locais incluem:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.taturana.org/" title="">Taturana</a>, uma organização brasileira de distribuição de filmes que trabalha com mediadores locais para tornar os filmes de impacto social mais acessíveis;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://datalabe.org/" title="">DataLabe</a>, um laboratório de narrativa e dados da Maré, no Rio de Janeiro;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://mujeresalborde.org/programa/al-borde-producciones/" title="">Escuela Audiovisual al Borde</a>, organizada pela Mujeres Al Borde para ajudar as pessoas a criarem suas próprias narrativas e conteúdo;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://nosmulheresdaperiferia.com.br/" title="">Nós Mulheres da Periferia</a>,&nbsp; um veículo jornalístico liderado por mulheres negras no Brasil;&nbsp; 



 O projeto <a href="https://www.circuito.digital/" title="">circuito.digital da Linterna Verde</a>, por meio do qual eles ajudam as organizações a entender os problemas de moderação de conteúdo e a documentar casos;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://latfem.org/" title="">LatFem</a>, uma mídia feminista nativa digital que trabalha para fornecer informações de qualidade na região;&nbsp; 



 …e muitas outras iniciativas (que continuaremos a compartilhar em nosso blog nos próximos meses!) 
 



<p>Participantes também falaram sobre o apoio e o investimento no trabalho realizado por organizações indígenas, quilombolas e lideradas por pessoas negras como algo crucial para ter ecossistemas de informação locais mais fortes na região.</p>



 Próximos passos e como você pode se envolver 



<p>Durante as próximas semanas, entrevistaremos pesquisadores, comunicadores, jornalistas, profissionais de mídia cívica, defensores de direitos digitais e ativistas de justiça social que trabalham para criar ecossistemas de informação melhores na América Latina e no Caribe. Também realizaremos outra chamada comunitária para este projeto no início de 2024 – fique de olho em nosso blog e <a href="https://us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=1747fd8a7bf587bd4a215d984&amp;id=53139510a0" title="">boletim informativo</a> (em inglês) para obter mais informações sobre como se juntar a nós!</p>



<p>Como parte desse projeto, nossa equipe está oferecendo suporte gratuito de tecnologia e dados para organizações de justiça social, ativistas e jornalistas. Se estiver interesse, é só <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">marcar uma chamada conosco</a>.</p>

		<p>NEWARK, New Jersey, December 11, 2023 – To expand knowledge access, community, and practice in the digital learning space, Edge in collaboration with Neumann University launches the Mid-Atlantic Digital Learning Colleges &amp; Universities Affinity Group.</p>
<p>The genesis of the idea for the group derived through a partnership with Alexandra Salas, Vice President for Digital Learning &amp; Innovation at Neumann University. The inaugural meeting, held November 28, 2023, drew digital learning leaders from representatives of institutions from three states, including Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Vital topics of discussion included:</p>
 
 Organizational structure of instructional design offices 
 Quality assurance frameworks 
 The role of AI in instructional design and education 
 
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		 “Having an affinity group where four year institutions in the Mid-Atlantic area can have a platform where we can engage, share, find common ground, and discuss our collective differences, and our challenges will in terms of growth opportunities and troubleshooting and to figure out new ways of staying relevant in higher ed.” 
 — Alexandra Salas<br>
Vice President for Digital Learning &amp; Innovation<br>
Neumann University 
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>Elaborated, Joshua Gaul, Associate Vice President &amp; Chief Digital Learning Officer, Edge, “This affinity group is a great opportunity to connect with colleagues to share ideas and build relationships. I love connecting with people I know and don’t know to talk about trends, struggles, and any other current topics in our field. Having intelligent discussions with intelligent people is something I will always welcome! We are off to a great start – I can’t wait to grow it more!”</p>
<p>Mid-Atlantic Digital Learning Colleges &amp; Universities Affinity Group member Dr. Earl W. Brieger, Chief Online Learning Officer, Gannon University added, “Our new affinity group is important to help the members consider new approaches to instructional design that promote student engagement and meaningful interactions.” Continued Dr. Brieger, “In higher education, a dedicated group focused on instructional design, pedagogy, and compliance plays a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of our institutions’ online learning experiences. By leveraging our pedagogical expertise and knowledge of innovative technology, this new group helps ensure the development of engaging and effective online instruction, fostering student success and promoting a culture of continuous improvement in teaching methodologies.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		 “Participating in the Mid-Atlantic Digital Learning Colleges &amp; Universities Affinity Group broadens perspectives by incorporating diverse experiences and approaches from across the region. It complements similar in-state groups focusing on localized challenges. The initial meeting quickly showed that we are all experiencing similar challenges and can share solutions.” 
 — Dr. Ron Hansen<br>
Director of Instructional Systems, Innovation, Learning, and Effectiveness<br>
Chesapeake College 
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>Mid-Atlantic Digital Learning Colleges &amp; Universities Affinity Group meetings will be held virtually monthly, along with plans for future in-person meetings. All digital learning practitioners and/or support personnel from throughout the region are encouraged to attend.

<p>Momentum continues in Japan with notable passkey deployments, while SBI Sumishin Net Bank announces membership and Mercari is appointed to Board of Directors&nbsp;</p>



<p>TOKYO, December 8th, 2023 – 2023 has been ‘the year of passkeys,’ as major consumer brands began offering them to make more than 7 billion user accounts ready for passwordless sign-ins. This momentum behind FIDO is the focus of today’s 10th FIDO Tokyo Seminar, where hundreds gathered to learn about the latest developments in the global push to eliminate dependence on passwords. Presenters include those from the Digital Agency of Japan, the National Institute of Informatics, the Taiwan government, Amazon, FIDO Alliance, Google, KDDI Corporation, LY Corporation, Mercari, NTT DOCOMO, Tik Tok and more.</p>



<p>FIDO Authentication uptake soars in 2023 as passkeys become available for consumer and workforce applications</p>



<p>Passkeys, which can be available across a user’s devices or bound to a single device, provide phishing-resistant security with a user experience far superior to passwords and other phishable forms of authentication. Many major consumer brands including Adobe, Amazon, Apple, CVSHealth, Dashlane, DocuSign, Google, Hyatt, Instacart, Kayak, LY Corporation, Mercari, NTT DOCOMO, Nintendo, 1Password, PayPal, Shopify, TikTok and others began offering them for cross-device sign-in to their services in 2023. Usage jumped in the workforce, too, as companies such as Fox, Hyatt, Intuit, Target and more bolstered their authentication options with passkeys.</p>



<p>Consumers also gained more flexibility for passkey management this year, as credential managers such as 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane and LastPass joined Apple, Google and Microsoft as available options for managing passkeys across devices.</p>



<p>Service providers are realizing the benefits of passkeys</p>



<p>Google made passkeys the <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/passkeys-default-google-accounts/">default sign-in method</a> for personal Google accounts and over <a href="https://safety.google/authentication/passkey/">9 million organizations</a> can allow users to sign in-to Google Workspace or Google Cloud using passkeys. Google, which has shared many early results from its implementation, reported passkeys are <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/passkeys-default-google-accounts/">40% faster than signing in with passwords</a>. Some other reported benefits have been reported from Intuit, which has seen a 97% sign-in success rate, and a 70% reduction in sign-in time with passkeys, and Mercari, which has seen a 82.5% authentication success rate&nbsp; with 20.5 seconds time reduction for authentication when compared to&nbsp; SMS OTP sign-ins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notable Momentum in Japan</p>



<p>Specifically in Japan, notable FIDO momentum discussed in the seminar included:&nbsp;</p>



 
 KDDI now has more than 10 million au ID customers now using FIDO authentication (as of August 2023); and KDDI has seen a dramatic decrease (nearly 30%)&nbsp; in calls to its customer support center as a result.&nbsp; 



 LY Corporation now has 21 million of FIDO active users among 44 millions of enabling the password-less option; over 40% of all user authentication on smartphones are FIDO authentication now.&nbsp; 



 Mercari has seen the benefits of passkeys, with 2.1 million users enrolled, and now seeing sign-in speeds at 4.4 seconds (which is 20.5 second time reduction), and a 82.5% sign-in success rate (15% improvement).&nbsp; 



 NTT DOCOMO has released its own Digital Identity Guidelines, and since deploying passkeys has seen dramatic enrollment (almost double in a year, now 37%) and reduction in successful phishing attacks. 
 



<p>Along with the many deployments in Japan, there are 64 of the FIDO Alliance’s 250+ member companies actively taking part in the FIDO Japan Working Group (FJWG). The FJWG is now beginning its 8th year working together to spread awareness and adoption of FIDO in the region. Notably, SBI Sumishin Net Bank today announced that they have joined FIDO Alliance as a Sponsor member, effective immediately, and Mercari has been appointed to the FIDO Alliance Board of Directors.</p>



<p>Consumers and workforce users are aware of, and want to use, passkeys</p>



<p>Passkeys are not only available across a wide array of services, but recent studies have shown that consumers and workforce users are aware of, and want to use, passkeys. A recent report from <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> and <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastpass.com%2F&amp;esheet=53518663&amp;newsitemid=20230809614908&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=LastPass&amp;index=1&amp;md5=77c9b141f704e56ec2c9543ec95bc3d7">LastPass</a> showed that businesses believe passkeys will help make them more secure: 92% believe passkeys will benefit their overall security posture, and 93% agree that passkeys will eventually help reduce the volume of unofficial (i.e., “Shadow IT”) applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another FIDO Alliance report revealed that passkeys have grown in consumer awareness despite still being live just over a year, rising from 39% in 2022 to 52% awareness today, while more than half of respondents said they had set up a passkey to sign into an account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, www.fidoalliance.org, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

<p>“The way you train that (AI) system will have to be crowdsourced&nbsp;… if you want it to be a repository of all human knowledge, all humans need to contribute to it.” — Yann&nbsp;LeCun</p><p>OriginTrail is an open decentralized knowledge system of collectively ownable, discoverable and verifiable units of knowledge, connected in a Decentralized Knowledge Graph, safeguarded by several blockchains. World class companies are already using OriginTrail to create value for their ecosystems. For example, OriginTrail is enabling frictionless international trade for over 40% of US imports by fostering secure exchange of security audits. With the Metcalfe phase initiated in November, the OriginTrail ecosystem entered a journey to achieve a 100.000x growth of the verifiable web of knowledge, pursued in two stages — the genesis, and convergence. The genesis phase creates opportunities for organizations and individuals who will mine the most valuable Knowledge Assets using the latest advancements on the AI-specific layer 1 blockchain — the OriginTrail Parachain (on Polkadot), which will evolve into NeuroWeb.</p><p>This RFC introduces knowledge growth incentives through a key innovation — Knowledge Mining, a decentralized way of growing the trusted knowledge base for humanity, and defines the scope of the beta Knowledge Mining program. The beta program is supported by the <a href="https://www.ngisearch.eu/view/Events/OC1Searchers">EU’s Next Generation Internet initiative — NGI Search</a> through the ChatDKG project. In addition to that Trace Labs (OriginTrail Core Developers) have provided support through the <a href="https://chatdkg.ai/">ChatDKG Grant program</a> aimed for builders of Decentralized AI tools and integrations with the DKG, which are to be piloted in the Knowledge Mining beta&nbsp;program.</p>This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme via the NGI Search <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101069364__;!!D9dNQwwGXtA!W2TymOXKZfJknzduXKZepycFGpQKHCYE2taARqr71Z_4hUad5Z9nJ1iA0WXSsznErIrWwkS6l5ttaifbtFcALg$">grant agreement 101069364</a> and linked with the <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://ngi.eu__;!!D9dNQwwGXtA!W2TymOXKZfJknzduXKZepycFGpQKHCYE2taARqr71Z_4hUad5Z9nJ1iA0WXSsznErIrWwkS6l5ttaifkmkhTvg$">Next Generation Internet Initiative</a>.<p>This RFC is used as information support for the upcoming referendum on OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot seeking&nbsp;to:</p>  Confirm the Knowledge Mining mechanics  Introduce the new naming for OriginTrail Parachain (token ticker OTP) to reflect its unique value proposition as an enabler for the verifiable web through decentralized Artificial Intelligence, becoming NeuroWeb (token ticker&nbsp;NEURO)*  <p>* — No new token is being created, OTP tokens become Neuro&nbsp;tokens</p> Decentralized global intelligence: Synergy of blockchains and Decentralized Knowledge Graph <p>“The word synergy comes from the Greek sin-ergo, meaning, to work together. It describes a mutually supportive atmosphere of trust, where each individual element works towards its own goals, and where the goals may be quite varied; nevertheless, because all elements of a synergetic system support one another, they also support the whole.” — Buckminster Fuller</p><p>The breakthrough of creating a decentralized global intelligence is underpinned by driving both vertical and horizontal synergies that enable network&nbsp;effects.</p><p>Vertical synergies</p><p>OriginTrail forms a strong synergy between knowledge graphs and blockchains. The result of that synergy is a Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) integrated with multiple blockchain networks. Each vertical integration of the DKG to a blockchain network not only brings additional resilience and scale to the OriginTrail DKG, but also enriches that blockchain with native DKG capabilities.</p><p>Horizontal synergies</p><p>Building a cross-chain knowledge base enables horizontal synergies between various blockchain ecosystems. With the proposed knowledge mining design, knowledge miners can mine new knowledge on any of the DKG integrated blockchains and be eligible for claiming their rewards on NeuroWeb. Due to DKG design, all knowledge published on one blockchain can be accessed on any other integrated blockchain, allowing synergy of knowledge assets across&nbsp;chains.</p> Knowledge Mining <p>Data can be an extremely valuable resource, when turned into highly structured, contextualized knowledge. We’ve seen this materialize in many systems from AI models to knowledge graphs driving insights for big corporations (Google, Amazon, Netflix, IKEA, Uber — to name a few), effectively proving the inherent value of knowledge.</p><p>OriginTrail aims to create the largest public knowledge base in the world, by doing so in a collaborative, crowdsourcing approach, via a unique approach called Knowledge Mining.</p><p>Knowledge Mining is the process of producing high quality, blockchain tracked knowledge for artificial intelligence, pioneered by the OriginTrail ecosystem. This cyclical process leverages the key component of the OriginTrail technology — Knowledge Assets — which are ownable containers for knowledge with inherent discoverability, connectivity and data provenance.</p><p>Similarly to the concept of Bitcoin mining, where miners collectively provide computing resources to the network and receive incentives in coins, knowledge miners contributing useful knowledge to the OriginTrail DKG will receive NEURO tokens (currently OTP). With Knowledge Mining incentives enabled across multiple blockchains, the ambition is to drive exponential growth of trusted knowledge in the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph.</p><p>There are 4 general steps in the Knowledge Mining&nbsp;cycle:</p>  Discovery — during which contributors discover profitable “gaps” in knowledge in the DKG, signaled by knowledge consuming applications  Publishing — once a gap is identified, knowledge miners create and publish a set of Knowledge Assets in the DKG. The aim is to incentivise high quality Knowledge Assets (based on content, structure, usage signal and other quality criteria)  Enrichment — participants can collectively improve existing knowledge by various enrichment activities, such as connecting Knowledge Assets to existing high quality Knowledge Assets (e.g. providing linking signal via <a href="https://docs.origintrail.io/decentralized-knowledge-graph-layer-2/dkg-basic-concepts#what-is-a-ual">UALs</a>), providing economic signal (e.g. via knowledge market purchase activity, direct economic stake on specific Knowledge Assets, etc) and usage signal (e.g. by utilizing specific knowledge, indicating its usefulness)  Learning — the system finally “learns” from the previous steps in several ways, including DKG entity relevance updates (e.g. equivalent to PageRank), such as reasoning based on newly available knowledge, repopulating vector stores and training AI models based on the newly acquired knowledge.  <p>Knowledge miners publish to the DKG by spending TRAC tokens, utilizing the underlying blockchain native token for gas fees (e.g. NEURO/OTP on NeuroWeb/OriginTrail Parachain, xDAI on Gnosis, ETH on Ethereum etc), while receiving NEURO tokens based on the level of their contribution, regardless of their blockchain of choice to perform Knowledge Mining.</p><p>NEURO token incentives will be distributed to knowledge miners based on both the quality and quantity of their contributions, regardless of the blockchain they choose for Knowledge Mining. It’s important to note that this mechanism is designed to evolve alongside the development of Knowledge Mining. As the ecosystem grows adjustments will be made to further improve fairness and efficiency of the reward system until the system matures. This dynamic approach ensures that participants are continually incentivized and rewarded for their valuable contributions. The process of Knowledge Mining implementation is subject to updates guided by the decentralized governance system on NeuroWeb (governance details available in <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/tree/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-15-OriginTrail-Parachain-Governance">OT-RFC-15</a>).</p><p>To kickstart the first Knowledge Mining system and validate the approaches, we are introducing the Genesis Knowledge Mining beta&nbsp;program.</p> Genesis Knowledge Mining beta&nbsp;program <p>The initial beta program is aimed at kickstarting Knowledge Mining through a Supervised Knowledge Mining approach as part of the Metcalfe Genesis phase of the OriginTrail roadmap. To establish dynamic cycles and quick iterations, the initial beta Knowledge Mining program will be executed as described below.</p> Mechanics of the beta Mining&nbsp;program <p>The initial beta Knowledge Mining will be facilitated by OriginTrail Core developers and all interested knowledge miners can participate by using the <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/knowledge-mining-kit">Knowledge Mining Kit</a>, containing a set of tools and tutorials on knowledge mining. The aim of the beta program is to validate the intended approach in a simplified manner (MVP approach) so that improvements and potential flaws can be discovered in a timely manner. The beta Knowledge Mining will be performed only on OriginTrail Parachain (NeuroWeb).</p><p>Discovery: To establish dynamic cycles and quick iterations, the genesis Knowledge Mining beta program will have a narrow focus on two specific knowledge domains:</p>  Knowledge about the wider OriginTrail ecosystem (AI, knowledge graph and blockchain technologies, and their relation to OriginTrail)  Knowledge relevant for the construction industry  <p>Details of how discovery can be done, and the specifics on the two knowledge domain topics will be presented in the Knowledge Mining&nbsp;kit.</p><p>Publishing: Several tools and instructions will be provided for creation and publishing of Knowledge Assets in the Knowledge Mining Kit, and will gradually expand over the course of the beta&nbsp;program.</p><p>Enrichment: Will focus on connecting relevant Knowledge Assets (linking signal) and token locking (economic signal)</p><p>Learning: Initially the learning step will be performed by OriginTrail Core developers, introducing mined Knowledge Assets into OriginTrail World.</p><p>All details of the process, including how you can participate will be explained in the Knowledge Mining Kit. A total of 1.000.000 OTP tokens (to become Neuro tokens) will be designated for the Knowledge Mining Beta program&nbsp;rewards.</p> OriginTrail Parachain becomes NeuroWeb — the Knowledge Mining blockchain <p>The OriginTrail Parachain is poised for a transformative evolution into NeuroWeb, a blockchain platform specifically tailored for Knowledge Mining and Knowledge-centric functions. This shift represents an advanced stage in the evolution of the original concept behind OriginTrail Parachain and its OTP token (to be renamed to NEURO), a progression that will be thoroughly detailed in the upcoming NeuroWeb whitepaper, detailing the NEURO token economic model designed to incentivize the growth and dissemination of knowledge.</p><p>To ensure community involvement and support, a Referendum vote is to be executed on the OriginTrail Parachain. This critical step will not only confirm the community’s support for the proposed change but also mark the beginning of the Knowledge Mining beta program. The community is invited to review this Request for Comments (RFC) and provide comments as soon as possible, after which the referendum voting will take place. The referendum voting will kickstart on Monday, December 18th&nbsp;2023.</p><p>Looking ahead, the Genesis Knowledge Mining beta program is set to commence in January&nbsp;2024.</p><p>To conclude, the referendum vote will&nbsp;entail:</p>  Confirmation of the name change from OriginTrail Parachain to&nbsp;NeuroWeb  Confirmation on the Knowledge Mining&nbsp;concept   Conclusion <p>This RFC introduces the concept of Knowledge Mining and the dedicated artificial intelligence blockchain NeuroWeb which will implement Knowledge Mining capabilities in Web3. The wider community is invited to provide feedback on the presented proposals and participate in confirming the indicated direction in the coming referendum to be voted upon <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/issues/41">discussion on this&nbsp;RFC</a>.</p><p>#TraceON</p><p>About OriginTrail</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by enabling a universe of AI-ready Knowledge Assets, allowing anyone to take part in trusted knowledge sharing.

 Not-for-Profit Registry Launches to Spur Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Through Transparent Digital&nbsp;Tool  The SAFc Registry will transparently and rigorously connect corporate aviation customers to clean fuel deployment, reducing emissions from air travel and air&nbsp;freight. <p>Dubai, United Arab Emirates — December 6, 2023 — A new independent, not-for-profit sustainable aviation fuel certificate (SAFc) registry launched today at COP28, supporting major consumers of air travel and transport in their efforts to help directly decarbonize flight with an enterprise-grade digital tool. The registry was created by clean energy nonprofit RMI and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), in collaboration with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) and digital solutions developer Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>The <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">SAFc Registry</a> connects corporate consumers, airlines, freight forwarders, and clean fuel producers in one universally accessible platform that will spur the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) via the purchase of SAF certificates. Led by impartial nonprofits, the careful, transparent design of the registry builds on industry best practices and went through public consultation to ensure that the SAF certificates exchanged realize their intended environmental impact and can be claimed towards emissions reduction goals.</p><blockquote>“The SAFc Registry is the culmination of RMI’s ongoing work to catalyze the sustainable aviation fuel market. By creating a throughline from corporate consumers to fuel producers, we can expand investment in SAF infrastructure and increase supply of low-carbon fuels. Voluntary uptake is critical to scaling a burgeoning market, and we hope this registry can serve as an example for other sectors in the future.” said Bryan Fisher, Managing Director at the clean energy nonprofit RMI.</blockquote><p>SAF is made from renewable or waste materials and can decrease the lifecycle emissions of flight by more than 80%. However, the fuel is not yet widely available and carries a significant green price premium. The Registry helps address this market gap by connecting corporate demand for emissions reductions to SAF producers through an auditable ledger for certificates which decouples the emissions benefits of SAF use from the physical fuel supply. It is the final piece of market infrastructure — in addition to robust <a href="https://rsb.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RSB-PRO-20-001-001-RSB-Book-and-Claim-Manual-3.0.pdf">standards</a>, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificate-safc-emissions-accounting-and-reporting-guidelines/">accounting guidelines</a>, and structured <a href="https://flysaba.org/2023/04/04/first-collective-purchase-of-sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificates/">RFPs</a> — to create a robust and de-risked market for SAFc investment.</p><blockquote>“For corporations and airlines, no other registry offers full transparency and tracks sustainable aviation fuel integrity to ensure high impact in fighting climate emissions,” said Elizabeth Sturcken, Managing Director, Net Zero Value Chains, at&nbsp;EDF.</blockquote><p>Major corporations that fly employees and goods around the world are urgently seeking ways to reduce the climate impacts from air transport. Emissions from travel, part of the “Scope 3” emissions in corporate emissions accounting, often represent the lion’s share of a business’ carbon footprint. SAF certificates enable companies to directly buy the auditable, credible emissions claims that represent a volume of sustainable aviation fuel displacing the same volume of conventional jet fuel for climate disclosures. These SAF certificates can be issued and retired in their name on the registry. Purchase of the certificates spurs fuel producers to invest in SAF production by sending a strong demand signal and creating a secondary value&nbsp;stream.</p><p>Major customers like Bank of America, Boom Supersonic, Boston Consulting Group, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Meta have already banded together to <a href="https://flysaba.org/2023/04/04/first-collective-purchase-of-sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificates/">collectively procure SAF certificates through SABA</a>, an alliance of the world’s most ambitious corporations addressing the emissions of flight through collective action. Future joint procurement efforts can use the SAFc Registry to seamlessly ensure the delivery of SAF certificates and sustainability assurances to&nbsp;buyers.</p><blockquote>“The SAFc Registry stands alone among other registries for being state-of-the-art, purely independent, and non-profit led. It should be the choice for any aviation customer looking to decarbonize their use of aviation,” said Kim Carnahan, Head of the SABA Secretariat and CEO of Neoteric Energy and&nbsp;Climate.</blockquote><p>The open-source software behind the SAFc Registry was designed to deliver an intuitive experience and great transparency to end-users. Each action on the SAFc Registry is validated, scrubbed of sensitive data, and digitally recorded. For registry users, the public, and auditors, this represents a continuous audit of registry operations.</p><blockquote>“We’re proud to support this best-in-class registry from inception and are already looking forward to new features focused on even easier ease-of-use and increased transparency,” said Jesse Morris, CEO at Energy&nbsp;Web.</blockquote><p>RMI, EDF, SABA and Energy Web will provide a tour of the new registry in a <a href="https://rmi.org/event/webinar-safc-registry-what-it-is-how-to-engage-and-why-it-matters/">webinar</a> on December 12th, 2023, and show how SAFc can help organizations meet sustainability goals by supporting auditable claims in climate disclosures.</p><p>Notes to&nbsp;Editors</p><p>About RMI</p><p>RMI, founded as Rocky Mountain Institute, is an independent nonprofit founded in 1982 that transforms global energy systems through market-driven solutions to align with a 1.5°C future and secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future for all.

The Lissi wallet supports selected eIDAS standards required for European digital identity&nbsp;wallets.<p>In response to the revision of the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/european-digital-identity-provisional-ag/product-details/20231116CAN72103">eIDAS regulation</a>, the European Union is introducing a common set of standards and technical specifications, which are designed to facilitate the seamless issuance, presentation and verification of verifiable identity data across borders. We are excited to announce that the Lissi ID-Wallet supports selected standards, as we will further elaborate in this&nbsp;article.</p><p>The technical standards of the eIDAS 2.0 regulation are defined in the <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework">Architecture Reference Framework</a> (ARF). These standards are crucial as every <a href="https://neosfer.de/en/unveiling-eidas-2-0-the-dawn-of-the-eudi-wallet-era/">European Digital Identity Wallet</a> (EUDI Wallet) and applications interacting with it will need to support the required standards and technical specifications, which include communication protocols and credential formats among others. At <a href="https://www.lissi.id/">Lissi</a>, we have extended our wallet to ensure alignment with core standards:</p><p>Communication protocols: Currently, the only proposed communication protocol is OpenID4VC (OpenID for verifiable credentials), which we integrated as the worlds first wallet as part of a <a href="https://idunion.org/2023/04/26/contributing-to-the-development-of-openid4vc-with-idunion/">prototypical implementation in 2021</a>. It is mandated for the presentation of the foundational identity (eID or PID — Person Identification Data), which will be issued by a member state. With the current status of the regulation, member states will have the flexibility to choose their own issuance protocols for the PID, however QEAA and EAA need to be issued via this protocol.</p><p>Credential formats: The ARF standards currently propose multiple credential formats, including two different types of verifiable credentials as well as an ISO mobile driver’s license (mDL) credential format. In order to use the benefits of multiple credential formats, the PID will be issued as verifiable credential and ISO mDL simultaneously. For all other (qualified) electronic attribute attestations (such as an educational degree, employee pass, customer card, insurance claim etc.) the issuer is free to choose one of the supported types of credential formats according to the&nbsp;ARF.</p><p>We are thrilled to announce that the Lissi ID-Wallet, is now supporting these new crucial standards:</p>  OpenID4VC, which includes OpenID4VCI (OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance) and OpenID4VP (OpenID for Verifiable Presentations).  SD-JWT-based Verifiable Credentials with JSON payloads (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-terbu-sd-jwt-vc-02">SD-JWT&nbsp;VC</a>).  <p>The wallet is publicly available as a beta version for both iOS (<a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">TestFlight</a>) and A<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta">ndroid</a> platforms. We encourage developers of issuance and verification software to test their implementations against our wallet to ensure interoperability and seamless functionality. We currently test our own issuance and verification software with selected clients. If you are interested in exploring our <a href="https://www.lissi.id/for-organisations">ID-Wallet connector software</a> with a free trial <a href="https://r82hs8os9o6.typeform.com/to/HDfiwoNP">reserve your spot on our waitlist&nbsp;now</a>.</p><p>The new standards are implemented based on the High Assurance Interoperability Profile (HAIP). It’s worth noting that there are other important standards as part of the eIDAS 2.0 regulation, such trust lists, public key infrastructure, digital signatures and more, which we will explore in future articles and won’t go into detail&nbsp;here.</p><p>In addition the Lissi ID-Wallet still supports the following standards which are not defined in the ARF, however, are used in many other identity projects:</p>  The DIDcomm communication protocol  Anonymous credentials also called “Anoncreds”  <p>As we witness the European community unite around a shared vision for a trusted digital future, we are proud to offer solutions that facilitate the required testing and integration of these pivotal standards. We look forward to continuing our journey alongside you, contributing to a harmonious and interconnected digital&nbsp;Europe.</p>

 Mapping learning processes and&nbsp;outcomes <p>Often, when reflecting on ‘learning’, people recall their days of compulsory schooling, filled with specific content to learn and tests to complete. Yet, when we stop to think about it, most learning experiences differ from this. From learning to tie shoelaces, to the intricacies of how to interact on a social network, we learn by imitation and from&nbsp;others.</p><p>In other words, learning occurs both unintentionally and intentionally, both solo and collectively. It’s something that happens daily in all different kinds of ways. So when we’re thinking of designing learning experiences with and for others, we need to be aware of different forms of learning; each can be used effectively for various purposes.</p> Learning in four quadrants <p>A good place to start in understanding different forms of learning is with the work of <a href="https://www.sterksamenwerken.nl/userfiles/files/1B-Collectie-%20leren-Simons-De-Laat-2002.pdf">De Laat &amp; Simons</a> (2002). They map learning processes and learning outcomes against each other to create four ‘quadrants’ of learning. A slightly adapted version, with the quadrants renamed for clarity, can be found&nbsp;below:</p><p>To explain those four quadrants with some examples:</p> 1. Individual Learning <p>Self-directed learning processes and personal knowledge acquisition.</p><p>Examples:</p>  Learning to cook a new dish by following a recipe found in a cookbook or online, adjusting it through trial and error to suit one’s own&nbsp;taste.  An independent bookstore owner researching and implementing a new inventory system to better track sales and customer preferences.  An activist educating themselves on legal rights and protest strategies through various self-study materials to organise a non-violent civil disobedience campaign for social&nbsp;justice.   2. Networked Learning <p>Individual learning that occurs as a result of being part of a broader&nbsp;network.</p><p>Examples:</p>  Using a neighbourhood social networking app to exchange gardening tips and local plant knowledge with nearby residents.  A cafe owner joining a national coffee shop network to share insights on sustainable sourcing and eco-friendly practices.  Environmental scientists across the globe collaborating through a virtual network to share research on plastic degradation, aiming to develop new solutions to the plastic waste&nbsp;crisis.   3. Participatory Learning <p>Individuals actively engaging in learning communities.</p><p>Examples:</p>  Local people sharing knowledge and learning from each other’s experiences in a community garden about planting seasons, pest control, and crop rotation.  A coworking space that hosts weekly skill-sharing sessions where entrepreneurs share expertise on various topics such as marketing, legal issues, or funding strategies.  The forum of a social movement where members discuss and learn from each other about effective strategies for advocating policy changes to address income inequality.   4. Cooperative Learning <p>Structured group learning with common goals and shared knowledge creation.</p><p>Examples:</p>  A group of friends forming a book club where they read and discuss books together, each person bringing their own perspective to the discussion.  Renewable energy companies working together through a consortium to develop a shared framework for assessing the environmental impact of their products.  An international coalition of NGOs designing a cooperative learning program for young leaders from marginalised communities, focusing on climate action and sustainable development.   Types of social&nbsp;learning <p>As we can see, the difference here is not simply between ‘learning alone’ or ‘learning with others’. Putting to one side Individual Learning, let’s dig into the three types of learning involving a collective or ‘social’&nbsp;element:</p><p>Where do Communities of Practice (COPs) sit in relation to these three types of learning? The answer is that CoPs can involve all three, depending on the members of the community, how they interact, and what their goals are. This is why the value cycles we discussed in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">our post</a> about the Community Conversations workshops are so important. CoPs change and mature over time, with different forms of learning happening for different people at different times.</p> Conclusion <p>There is no one form of learning that is best for every situation. For example, you might find a manual useful for fixing a boiler, but a manual would be of little use when learning to&nbsp;abseil.</p><p>Using the right type of learning depends both on the process you want to follow and the outcome you want to&nbsp;reach:</p>  If you want to help people or organisations enhance their own knowledge or skills by interacting with others, then look at a Networked Learning approach.  If you want to help them work separately on the same (or similar) goals then consider a Participatory Learning approach.  If you want shared involvement to reach a common goal, then perhaps a Cooperative Learning approach would be best&nbsp;suited.  <p>Taking the time to understand both what you and your learners want from a situation can save a lot of time, money, and frustration. Designing a course to deliver the latest information might be important in the world of compliance training, but for the vast majority of learning experiences, it’s the social component that provides a lot of the&nbsp;value.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/social-learning-the-heartbeat-of-communities-and-networks-55a9b3d33e8d">Social Learning: The Heartbeat of Communities and Networks</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>&nbsp;We recently interviewed Ivan Basart, who is the co-founder and CTO of a Spanish based digital services company called <a href="https://www.validatedid.com/en?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Validated ID</a>. Validated ID have been long standing Associate members of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) and we sat down to learn more about their company, their story and the service that they're offering. View the interview in it's entirety on <a href="https://youtu.be/kHylglExigM?ref=blog.identity.foundation">YouTube</a></p><p>&nbsp;Limari Navarrete: I always like to start out my first question with getting a sense of the story of not just your company, but also you yourself, how you came to decentralized identity. I feel like everyone has a really great story that's very intriguing, so I'd like to hear yours. Maybe you can tell us a little bit about that.</p><p>&nbsp;Ivan: Actually, my story is quite connected with the wider history. I've been around digital identity and the digital signatures and cryptography space for almost 25 years. I feel old when I say that statement, but that's the reality. It's being a long time. I've been involved in different companies and different projects and that also was interesting, because I've seen the evolution of this space. I've been involved in many projects which were complete failures in terms of adoption, mainly working on digital certificates, many in Europe and in other countries so they can have digital certificates or national ids.</p><p>&nbsp;In that sense, most of the projects that were happening at the beginning of the century through 2010, most of them were very bad in terms of adoption, and that was also one of the reasons why we created Validated ID. I'd say that in my case, what I'm trying to do in this company is cleaning my karma. After working on a lot of projects that not many people were using, we were able to run a company with services that were secure and quite usable while thinking about the user experience.</p><p>&nbsp;When we created Validated ID, you think about the name, we had in mind mainly identity validation, things like the definitions and the problems that you are trying to solve with SSI. But at that time that was in 2012, so more than 11 years ago, the identity landscape was completely different, really the technology was not there. So that's why, when we started the company, the first thing we started was on digital signatures, which was very hot at that time. It's actually our main business.</p><p>&nbsp;So we started our journey with Validated ID working on digital signatures, digital certificates as a trust services provider. Then with the blockchain space, all these things about decentralized identity appear. It really completely took our attention because it was the initial goal of the company. We started working on that at the very beginning and we are founding members of the DIF. Even before the DIF we were part of the Rebooting Web of Trust, we were also part of the Sovrin foundation. We were part of many initiatives that were part of the beginning of the SSI space. When the DIF was created we were very interested in being part of it because it was one of the main think tanks that helped to settle down all these things.</p><p>&nbsp;So that’s briefly my story and Validated ID’s story.&nbsp; We really had this digital id idea the whole time, even before SSI existed. Sometimes things happen that way. You have an idea, but you need to wait till really the market and the masses are there in order to make it happen. So that’s how it was in our case.</p><p>&nbsp;Limari Navarrete: Maybe you can share an overview of Validated ID’s services. I went to the website and you are intersecting a lot of industries with your various products. Can you give us a sense of how you brought SSI to those various products and to some of those industries?</p><p>&nbsp;Ivan: Sure, so Validated ID as it’s called in Europe, is a trust service provider. We are offering services about trust. This is regulated here in Europe. We have a regulation which is called eIDAS (electronic identification and trust services) which regulates digital signature and digital identities which now is under revision. &nbsp;The new revision of eIDAS, as most people who are listening will know, is talking about wallets and things like that. But as I said, we were here before all that from 2012.</p><p>So in that sense, we are offering these kind of services to the market. Our main service is digital signatures but in different flavors, or with different technologies, from using biometrics, to user certificates, to remote signatures or face to face. These are our main services, which are also combined with issuance of certificates and things like that. However from 2017, we start working on SSI. (Self-Sovereign Identity) Those are services that are at a very different maturity level in Validated ID but also in general. But SSI is part of our portfolio of services as a trust service provider. It’s not something isolated, it’s connected with existing services about trust that we're already offering.</p><p>&nbsp;For instance, if you need to create a digital signature you may be able to use a wallet to prove your identity in the process of making a signature and proving who you are. If you go into a facility for a face to face validation, when you create a signature this process of face to face validation could be useful in order to create an attribute &nbsp;that goes into a wallet. So we are trying to connect the ecosystems or services so that SSI can be integrated into the portfolio of services about trust. We think that SSI and the wallet could be very disruptive to existing trust services.  Take digital signature because this is our main service, with digital signatures what you need to do are two things:</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prove that you are okay with providing the content of a specific document</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prove your identity</p><p>&nbsp;The way that we are proving our identity nowadays is sometimes very complex using certificates or a very weak DocuSign style proof of identity which mainly only proves that you have access to an email account.</p><p>&nbsp;So when you’re able to have a wallet, in order to prove your identity and not just your identity, but an extended version of your identity, certain attributes that you work for a company, that you are over 18, these kind of things, this we think can be very disrupting in this space. So that's why we think that the SSI service will be part of the ecosystem of services that we have, and the evolution of the system and services that we are offering currently to the market.</p><p>&nbsp;Limari Navarrete:  I think it's a good segue into my next question, which is about one of the projects that Validated ID has been a part of recently which was in collaboration with SEIDOR to bring Verifiable Credentials to five universities in Catalonia. I'd like to hear more about that and I'm sure our audience would be very interested to hear more about that project and where things are with that.</p><p>&nbsp;Ivan: It’s a very interesting project. It's called Camins, which is a Catalan word which means paths. So this project is about delivering an SSI platform ecosystem in order to let those universities issue credentials to students and teachers, to allow access to the university, the virtual campus or get a diploma. One important thing here is that this project is very connected with the EBSI project. EBSI is the European Commission Project about SSI. It’s a ledger but it’s more than that. It’s really specifications, definitions of credentials and so on. This project is very connected to that. Those universities have been working within the EBSI project for years and now they are taking their knowledge and experience and deploying a platform which is compliant with the EBSI and is able to deliver those use cases to citizens. SEIDOR is also our partner and they are doing more of the work of managing the project itself. As Validated ID, what we are providing is the technology and SSI expertise to be able to create this platform, to customize the platform and get it integrated with EBSI, and to put it in place for deployment.</p><p>&nbsp;Here the time frame is that soon, I think at the at the end of this year, beginning next year, there will be a first version deployed. With that they will first create internal use cases in order to test it, and so on, but the goal is really to use that for the deployment of all the citizens of those five universities in Catalonia. Also, the ability to exchange credentials from university to university. If I have a credential for a diploma from your university, I can exchange that information with another university. The good thing about using EBSI is that some of the credentials of the data structure are already defined. So there is an interoperability already defined at different levels, at the protocols, but also the semantics and so on. I think it's a very nice use case on a very nice project, because it's a way of proving that SSI is not just something theoretical We are really at the point that we we can deploy those kinds of projects as a real world use case.</p><p>Watch the video in it's entirety at <a href="https://youtu.be/kHylglExigM?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://youtu.be/kHylglExigM</a></p>

<p>The most common passwords of 2023, including “123456” and “admin,” have been exposed, leaving millions vulnerable to hacking. Cybersecurity researchers, in collaboration with NordPass, warn users to adopt unique and secure passwords. Hackers can breach accounts with weak passwords in seconds. The study, analyzing 4.3TB of leaked data, highlights the importance of password managers and mentions the promising role of FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance in developing passkeys as a secure alternative. Despite advancements, the transition away from traditional passwords is expected to take time.</p>

<p>FIDO Alliance webinar aimed at U.S. federal data-security officials to promote digital authentication while reassuring<br>them not to panic. It emphasizes that new anti-phishing measures are forthcoming, flexible, and won’t replace existing<br>personal ID verification (PIV) methods. The webinar and accompanying white paper suggest narrowing down<br>authentication methods to counter phishing, integrating FIDO authentication within the government’s zero trust<br>strategy, and conducting pilots for suitable authenticators while implementing digital ID risk assessments (DIRAs) to<br>overcome cultural barriers in adoption. The panelists stressed the importance of considering FIDO authentication as a<br>replacement for vulnerable authentication methods rather than PIVs and CACs.</p>

<p>FIDO Alliance seeks increased government involvement to develop comprehensive guidelines for implementing a<br>phishing-resistant authentication standard within federal agencies. Co-chaired by Teresa Wu of IDEMIA, the working<br>group released an initial white paper and plans further collaboration with government entities to shape FIDO<br>authenticator implementation in the US government. This initiative responds to the Office of Management and Budget’s<br>call for phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) by 2024, providing an alternative to the Personal Identity<br>Verification (PIV) standard in certain scenarios, focusing on cloud environments and temporary access needs, aiming to<br>supplement rather than replace PIV authentication.</p>

<p>Over a period of six months, The Engine Room worked with<a href="https://www.evanigeria.org/" title=""> Education as a Vaccine (EVA) </a>, a non-profit organisation founded in 2000 that works in partnership with children and young people to advance their rights to health and protection from all forms of violence by strengthening capacities, providing direct services and influencing policies, for improved quality of life.</p>



<p>This post looks back at our work together in the course of our partnership (run&nbsp; through our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/">Matchbox support programme</a>), which focused on EVA Nigeria’s data collection, analysis, storing and sharing practices and processes; how the organisation uses the data they collect; and areas of potential improvement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This included:</p>



 
 Assessing the current data ecosystem and data lifecycle in order to identify opportunities for strengthening their data processes in ways that are both responsible and effective . 



 Working together to determine how Eva Nigeria can approach data management more strategically for advocacy 



 Strengthening knowledge around responsible data management 



 Engaging in practical responsible data management exercises 



 Co-creating a data management policy. 
 



 Local Context 



<p>In Nigeria, internet use is widespread, but the speeds are often slower than recommended for work. While there are laws in place to protect people’s digital rights and data, Nigeria was ranked as the 32 most-breached country in early 2023, with a <a href="https://techcabal.com/2023/05/23/nigeria-is-witnessing-a-disturbing-surge-in-data-breaches/">64% increase in documented data breaches</a> from the previous quarter. In 2021, the government also <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/1/12/nigeria-ends-its-twitter-ban-after-seven-months">temporarily banned Twitter,</a> which had significant economic and social impact. Despite these issues, however, there’s a strong sense of digital activism in Nigeria, with various campaigns mobilising the public.&nbsp;</p>



 What We Learned 



<p>EVA uses a variety of communication platforms and tools for internal collaboration, project management, and data analysis. As concerns were raised about high property crime rates in Nigeria, the team was interested in strengthening their security. To support in this, our team conducted a thorough assessment of EVA’s practices. This included:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Context research: Our team conducted desk research covering the ways that Eva Nigeria’s varied contexts (geographical, network make-up, applicable legislation, etc.) impact potential risks and strategies.<br><br> 



 Documentation review: We reviewed information and communications documentation, including strategies and policies, and any documentation on relevant security incidents.<br><br> 



 Interviews and surveys: We conducted interviews and surveys with the team to better understand their experiences with tech and data.<br><br> 



 Mapping critical processes: Our team facilitated a data mapping session with the team where we traced the lifecycle of two critical operational processes involving data.<br>&nbsp;<br> 



 Capacity Building: Based on our findings, we facilitated a group session that supported the learning goals of the organisation.&nbsp; 
 



 Looking Towards the Future 



<p>Our partnership surfaced several opportunities for EVA Nigeria to explore in terms of data and security practices – both internally and with their mobile apps:&nbsp;</p>



 Responsible Data 



<p>EVA is an organisation that already uses data in a variety of ways to achieve its mission. We recommended that they primarily focus on incorporating responsible data practices into their workflow. Understanding what data is being collected and for what purpose, and assessing its sensitivity, can help the team identify risks. Additionally, knowing where the data is stored and who has access to it is important for any organisation who wants to better secure their data. Relatedly, minimising data collection, especially when it comes to sensitive information like location and sexual health, was also recommended to keep their users safe.&nbsp;</p>



 Strengthening Organisational Security 



<p>Given the context in which the team works and the ways in which they collaborate, we recommended implementing secure communication guidelines and practices that include using encrypted tools like Signal for internal chats. For video conferencing, we advised switching to services that prioritise privacy, such as Jitsi Meet or BigBlueButton. We also suggested establishing a comprehensive password management process that covers strong password creation, two-factor authentication, and periodic password changes. Training and guidelines for device security were also recommended, focusing on password protection, disk encryption, and limiting personal use on work devices.&nbsp;</p>



 Developing Privacy Policies 



<p>We recommended that EVA’s mobile applications have a comprehensive privacy policy detailing the specific data points collected and their intended use. Data management information should also be standardised across all of EVA’s apps. Lastly, we suggested that future app improvements should focus on innovative yet thoughtful approaches that prioritize both user needs and privacy protection.</p>



 What’s Next 



<p>We are excited to see how EVA’s efforts will continue to shape their organisation’s data management and security practices. From our side, we found this partnership incredibly rewarding, with opportunities to expand our knowledge about health initiatives in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>

This latest one offered a sobering reminder that while New Zealand is sadly behind in a domain where nothing is more important than protecting children from harm online, this community can help with effective and pragmatic industry – government collaboration. I want to draw your attention to these among our list of great achievements this year, because they have each broken new ground for Aotearoa</p>



<p>Alongside the above, and our monthly Coffee Chat series now boasting well over 100 registrations, we ran our Perspectives on Decentralised Identity series in the late summer featuring DINZ members&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/perspectives-on-decentralised-identity-summer-series-2023-webinar/">RealMe</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/perspectives-on-decentralised-identity-summer-series-2023-webinar-2/">Mattr</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/perspectives-on-decentralised-identity-summer-series-2023-webinar-3/">TANZ</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/03-april-perspectives-on-decentralised-identity-summer-series-2023-webinar/">CentraPass</a>&nbsp;(now Futureverse). In autumn DINZ hosted US based digital identity conformity assessment company Zygma who presented the first ever&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/an-analytic-discussion-with-aotearoa-new-zealand-industry-members-around-the-digital-identity-services-trust-framework/">technical analysis of the DISTF Trust Framework</a>. As winter gave way to spring DINZ member ForgeRock put its customers Kiwibank and Westpac on the stage to talk to a big crowd about their experiences with&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/continuous-delivery-what-is-it-and-why-it-matters-to-your-business/">Continuous Delivery</a>. Earlier this month DINZ members&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/air-new-zealand-flying-forward-with-passkeys-delivered-by-authsignal/">Air New Zealand hosted another sold out event with partner Authsignal sharing their successful implementation of passkeys</a>&nbsp;– the first implementation for an airline and the first known implementation in the Australia/NZ region.</p>



<p>December sees us at the Reserve Bank ‘myth busting’ some often misunderstood aspects of our domain, and then our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/digital-identity-annual-meeting-2023/">members Annual Meeting on 7 December</a>&nbsp;to announce our 2024 Executive Council, which will round out our events for the year. With it we will farewell the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Council of ‘23</a>&nbsp;under whose custodianship of the events above, the list of mahi below and a refreshed 2024 strategy and action plan, have propelled DINZ to new heights. Our sincere thanks to them, particularly those that finish their term this year.</p>



<p>Aside from the standout successes above, members have curated two submissions –&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DINZ-Response_-Biometrics-discussion-document-2023.pdf">one</a>&nbsp;on the Privacy Commission’s consultation on a code of practice for biometrics, and&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DINZ-Submission-Targeted-Engagement-DISTF-Regulations.pdf">the other</a>&nbsp;on DIA’s targeted consultation on the DISTF regulations. Being an election year, we published DINZ’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2023/09/26/trusted-digital-identity-critical-for-new-zealands-digital-future/">Manifesto&nbsp;</a>and have just completed our Briefing for Incoming Ministers to be published shortly. Our perspectives have captured the attention of&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2023/09/13/biometric-industry-warns-that-regulation-may-bring-unintended-consequences/">national</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2023/09/12/digital-id-group-calls-for-biometrics-code-in-nz-to-avoid-stifling-innovation/">international</a>&nbsp;media following biometrics but also&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2023/04/04/your-personal-data-whats-at-risk-and-whats-being-done-to-protect-it/">the fallout from the Latitude and Optus data breaches</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/mntBLOCKSTORAGEhomemasternews_importersrcColin-Wallis-_-Digital-Identity-New-Zealand_1_Pub.mp3">findings outlined in our report.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>This newsletter that you are reading is published 11 times per year bringing you digital identity-related news from members and from around the world. By any measure, our events and written work is a stellar output from a part time team, only made possible by&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-members/">members’</a>&nbsp;subscriptions and sponsorship. So thank you!&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/join/">Not a member</a>&nbsp;and not sponsoring? There are many sponsorship opportunities available. Please get in contact:<a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">&nbsp;info@digitalidentity.nz.</a></p>



<p>Looking ahead, 2024 is already shaping up well event-wise as more members recognise the value of DINZ hosting their events. We have several online and in person events planned for Q1 and Q2 and DINZ will be supporting its members at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fintechhui.nz/">Fintech Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;in February, the&nbsp;<a href="https://event.brightstar.co.nz/2024NZCyberSecuritySummit">National Cyber Security Summit</a>&nbsp;in March, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://nzgovdata.co/">Government Data Summit</a>&nbsp;in May. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/working-groups/">member working and special interest groups</a>&nbsp;are already gearing up for what will be a busy year ahead with member expertise shaping submissions and the development of education &amp; guidance materials. The refreshed strategy calls for deeper, wider and more international context given the extent of change coming such as the EU Digital Wallet, Australian digital identity related legislation and our own DISTF Act effective 1 July.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My New Year’s resolution: Put an end to silos. Teach ourselves to view different activities ‘in the round’ and interrelate them, not silo them to save effort under the guise of ‘focus’. I have seen too many silos in our domain in 2023 and as a nation we are the poorer for it.</p>



<p>This is DINZ’s last newsletter for 2023, so on behalf of the 2023 Executive Council, Ngā mihi o te Kirihimete me te Tau Hou.</p>

Key themes for the year covered various aspects such as digital identity, biometrics, digital onboarding, verification/authentication, secure credentials, and verifiable credentials. The two-day event revolved around the overarching theme that digital identity is transitioning into a comprehensive, large-scale implementation. A significant focus was on Decentralized Identity, ranging from blockchain solutions to discussions about verifiable credentials. The presentations were policy-oriented, featuring esteemed speakers from organizations like DHS, UN, the Canadian Government, and the EU. These speakers emphasized the importance of collaboration and interoperability as essential goals to facilitate seamless citizen travel, international work, and the establishment of trust in online interactions.</p><p>The Internet Identity Workshop in Mountain View, California, centered around technological advancements in decentralized digital identity solutions. Spanning three days, the event delved into key topics, including OpenID4VC, AnnonCreds 2, W3C, TrustOverIP, DIDComm, JSON-LD, KERI, GLEIF's VLEI, decentralized ecosystem governance, backup and restore, and credential recovery. For credential recovery, the discussions offered a comprehensive solution that encompasses defining the data format, experimenting with compression and encryption, and ensuring the compressed format remains developer-friendly. Additionally, conversations surrounding backup and recovery focused on standardizing methods for backing up application data, especially wallet data, to provide users with a seamless experience. This included challenges like backing up specific information, and the need to reissue credentials in certain scenarios (see below for more from DIF @ IIW).</p><p>The Interoperability Group meets bi-weekly at 8am PT/11am ET/5pm CET Wednesdays</p> 📡 <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-usergroup/tree/main?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm User Group </a> <p>The DIDComm Demo is live!

  <p>This is the meant to be the beginning of a discussion on the topic of Open Development as a growth beyond Open Source.

Please <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions/121">join us in those discussions</a> and how you might think about the topic differently and on how we can make Open Development a reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The term “open source” gets a lot of attention. It usually refers to the open-source model, where developers collaboratively create software and then release their source code for free distribution, modification, and usage. The idea has entered the modern culture: definitions can be found in the Meriam-Webster Dictionary<a>1</a> and the OED<a>2</a>.</p>

<p>Open-source software is very important to a variety of modern computer platforms. It’s the heart of blog publishing in WordPress, the core of cryptocurrency in Bitcoin, and the foundation of web browsers in projects such as Firefox and Chromium. Unfortunately, open source is all too often seen as all that’s needed. Though there are innovators who are thinking about open source as part of a larger ecosystem<a>3</a>, they’re the exceptions. We need to more broadly realize that the open-source model needs to become a larger open development movement<a>4</a> that can fill in the gaps and resolve the problems of traditional open-source software.</p>

 The Limits of Open Source 

<p></p>

<p>The biggest limitation of the traditional open-source model is that it’s just a licensing regime: no less, no more. A license describes how software can be distributed and used but it doesn’t require a project to be designed, developed, or supported in an open way. And those additional levels of consideration are crucially important: whereas the open-source model describes how you can use a product, a larger open-development movement is needed to reveal whether that product is actually useful or not.</p>

<p>Without open development, open source is full of limitations and disadvantages. These issues are not requirements of the open-source model, but they are obvious and expected consequences of open-source software as it currently exists, which focuses on specific licenses that are used for software created largely by volunteer teams of development.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the open-source model doesn’t even necessarily do its licensing well. The Free Software movement and then the open-source model that followed innovated free and open licenses, from copyleft to the GPL and the MIT License. However, open-source software organizations have been reluctant to update these classic licenses to the modern day. We need something not just newer, but better.</p>

<p>Beyond that, many disadvantages of open source stem from the fact than open-source projects tend to be volunteer-led. As a result, improvements found in open-source projects are typically driven by a developer “scratching … a personal itch” <a>5</a>. Though this certainly can create innovation, it’s not necessarily directed toward production releases. Even though open-source advocate Eric S. Raymond encouraged involving users and customers, that often doesn’t happen. As a result, open-source software has a reputation for being hard to use, with poor user interfaces and poor documentation<a>6</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s the issue of long-term support: what happens to open-source software after it’s been released? As the initial developers move on and the years stack up? As new threats and the ever-changing internet require new changes? Too often, this continuing support isn’t considered in the open-source model.</p>

<p>Limitations with licenses, development models, and support models all point toward the need for a larger open-development movement, as a level-up of the traditional open-source model.</p>

 Principles of Open Development 

<p>Open development is a larger infrastructure that encompasses open-source licenses but does so while laying out a complete methodology for these projects, from their initial conception through their long-term support. It is built on what we see as the intrinsic goal of the open-source model: for a community to create common resources that can be freely used for the good of all. However, open development looks at this goal as part of an ecosystem that goes well beyond the idea of just developing code and releasing it under an open license.</p>

<p>To be truly open, and to support development from inception through long-term support, we believe an open-development community must increasingly abide by a set of principles as it rises up through the spectrum of openess.</p>

<p>These principles include:</p>

 
   
    <p>Accessibility. An open-development community must be open to all comers. There must be clearly stated rules for how to join the community, how to participate in the community, and how to remain a member of the community. Though there certainly may be (and should be) ways to remove problematic members from the community, the reasons and procedures for doing so should be clearly stated as well.</p>
   
   
    <p>Collaboration. An open-development community must be collaborative. It must have ways that people can make themselves heard and can help to determine the community’s direction through <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/systems-for-collective-choice/">collective choice</a>. This representation and collaboration should encompass developers, users, and distributors alike. The democratic and collaborative choice of an open-development community might be a true democracy, where everyone gets a vote, but more likely it’s some other form of decision making that reflects the needs and limitations of an online community, such as rough consensus, a meritocracy, or representative democracy. Existing communities have already resolved this issue in well-considered ways, and should be considered models. <a>7</a><a>8</a></p>
   
   
    <p>Diversity. A truly open community must not only accept diversity of ideas, but also seek it out in order to improve its development. This should include finding people from many walks of life and with many backgrounds who think in many different ways and have many different skills: people of diverse cultures, classes, genders, races, and points of view. Studies have shown that deep-level diversity is beneficial to the core creativity of a project <a>9</a>, and open-development projects should embrace that. Open development must further embrace “vertical” diversity: a community should include not just designers and developers but also potential consumers (users) and potential distributors (often, businesses). Through early interactions with people who might use and who might sell a product, an open-development community can conquer many of open source’s current problems with usability.</p>
   
   
    <p>Strategy. The collaboration of open development must be about a  community, not just the individuals. That means that it needs to be able to thoughtfully plan, not just to respond to the whims of whoever is programming at the time. In order for the accessibility, diversity, and representation of an open-development community to actually matter, the community must always move forward in consideration with the needs, desires, and thoughts of its many members.</p>
   
   
    <p>Transparency. Similarly, an open-development community must demonstrate that it is abiding by the desires of its members through full transparency, encompassing its membership, its goals, its governance, its processes, and its ongoing support. Obviously, code should be open, but so should membership statistics, meeting minutes, voting results, and more. The idea of “open” should be embraced throughout the community.&nbsp;This open transparency should not be confused with radical transparency, which has its own pitfalls <a>10</a>: transparency needs to be balanced with the privacy of developers, patrons, and clients, and it needs to be managed to enhance the goals of open development, not to deteriorate the work of its members.</p>
   
   
    <p>Sustainability. Open development must be something that consumers and distributors can depend on over the entire lifespan of the software. That means that a concept of long-term commitment must be built in from the beginning, to provide for both upgrades and for fixes for the project. (The lack of this type of support is one of the biggest limitations of the traditional open-source model to date.)</p>
   
   
    <p>Openness. The final principle of open development is simply openness. An open-development community must ultimately commit to interoperability within its ecosystem such that there is no lock-in, allowing users the opportunity for open choice among ecosystem elements and the ability to move their own information and assets to other platforms as they see fit.</p>
   
 

 Best Practices of Open Development 

<p></p>

<p>Open development isn’t a binary choice, but rather a spectrum. No one, no matter how deeply committed they are to open development, is likely to immediately encompass the entire set of principles. However, software development can become increasingly open and increasingly dedicated to these principles as it incorporates additional best practices.</p>

<p>What follows is a description of seven levels for open development, each of which adds new best practices to the ones before.</p>

 Level 0: Open Source 

<p>A minimal level of open source represents the classic understanding of the term: code is placed under a license, made vaguely available to the public, and that might be it.</p>

 
   Code is largely available for viewing. 
   Code is largely available for use under some open source license. 
   Some code may be restricted in viewing or usage based on hardware interfaces, software interfaces, or simply the privacy needs of the creator. There may be reasonable security, trade secrets, or licensing restrictions. These restrictions and their reasoning may not even be well defined. 
   Non-open code must be UX or backends or servers. 
 

 Level 1: Inspectable 

<p>The lowest bar for open development requires that current code (not some old, dusty forgotten version) can be inspected.</p>

 
   Code is versioned. 
   Code is available via <code>git</code> in a public repo. 
   Public code remains relatively current. 
   Code in private repos is regularly published. 
 

 Level 2: Observable 

<p>For an open-open development project to be observable, more than the code is open: the whole development process is.</p>

 
   Git Issues are used to record bugs and feature requests. 
   Git Branches are used to process incorporation of new code. 
   Git Releases are used to record official publications of code. 
   Docs record parts of code that are not openly Inspectable and Observable, as well as documenting why. 
 

<p>(Though this level specifies “Git”, equally open alternative systems would also meet the best practices.)</p>

 Level 3: Reproducible 

<p>Reproducibility considers those unpublished parts of a code base, and promises that code can still be compiled and tested, even without them.</p>

 
   Stubs or fake services are used to fill in for code that is not open. 
   Code is fully compilable and runnable using stubs. 
 

 Level 4: Testable 

<p>A minor advance on reproducability requires the creators of code to go the extra mile to help developers test their compiled code.</p>

 
   Open test suites allow full testing of reproducible code. 
 

 Level 5: Cooperative 

<p>The next level of open development turns members of the public from observers into potential contributors.</p>

 
   Road Maps are shared. 
   Specs are shared. 
   A person is dedicated to coordination of public contributions. 
   Public can file issues and will receive responses in a reasonable amount of time. 
   Public can contribute pulls, which will be considered. 
   Public is clearly defined to include people not closely aligned with creators. 
 

 Level 6: Distributed 

<p>When an open-development project has reached the Distributed level, it has largely embraced the open-development principles.</p>

 
   A product has been shipped. 
   At least two companies or organizations are committed to the project. 
   Open specifications prevent vendor lock-in. 
   Open specifications prevent single points of failure. 
 

 Level 7: Standardized 

<p>Finally, standardized open-development can create tools available to everyone in the ecosystem.</p>

 
   Specifications preventing vendor lock-in are under an IP Regime of an international standards organization. 
   Specification defining project interoperability have been approved as international standards. 
 

 Integrating with Open Silicon 

<p>Even an open-software model that has been extended to Level 7 of Open Development doesn’t fill in the whole picture. That’s because any software is ultimately dependent on the hardware that’s running it. Perhaps this isn’t of much importance for the average software program, but it becomes crucially important when you have software that focuses on privacy, security, cryptography, or related categories. For those, you must have <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-open-silicon/">Open Silicon</a> to ensure that the openly developed open software does what you expect it to.</p>

<p>The Principles of Open Development can be applied to Open Silicon with some challenges.</p>

 
   Accessibility. Obviously, open-software developers need to be invited into Open Silicon communities, so that they can ensure that their software can be properly represented in the silicon. But, there should also be way for external hardware developers to join as well. 
   Collaboration. Both open-software developers and external hardware developers should be able to make their own contributions to the silicon designs (or at the least to the goals of the silicon design). 
   Strategy. To create meaningful strategic plans, software developers and chip designers must work together on the  requirements of silicon. Our <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salons</a> offer an example of what this strategic collaboration looks like for the cryptographic industry. 
   Diversity. Bringing in the open-software community should notably improve the diversity of silicon-design communities. 
   Transparency. Unfortunately, transparency will be one of the biggest challenges for Open Silicon. No matter how much silicon designers might want to be transparent, they’re also going to be bound by IP restrictions that are unfortunately endemic to the interwoven field of chip design. A concerted effort to offer simulation of hardware  that is linked to open-software development should be prioritized to help improve transparency despite these issues. 
   Sustainability. There may be less concerns about sustainability in Open Silicon, because the chips won’t have the same issues that software tends to have with bitrot: where functioning apps stop working due to changes in lower level technologies. Nonetheless, it needs to still be an issue for consideration. 
   Openness. Interoperability among chips may be a sticking point due to the high cost of entry into the field, but it nonetheless is a crucial requirement to integrate with open-software models, since they need to be able to count on a reliable, deterministic experience across all hardware. 
 

<p>Some of the best practices may face even more challenges than these principles due not only to IP restrictions within the extant semiconductor field but also issues with reproducibility. Parallel best practices may need to be outlined for hardware-focused development. See the <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-open-silicon/">Musings on Open Silicon</a> for more thoughts on these and other challenges.</p>

 Open Questions 

<p>Open Development’s principles and best practices form a starting point for discussing open development. There’s still a lot more to consider, including:</p>

 
   Black Boxes. Black boxes that are part of an open system, but have been purposefully closed (which includes IP-restricted silicon), are obviously problematic. We need to better codify how they can be incorporated into open systems, and what we might need to verify about their inputs and outputs. 
   Contracts. NDAs and other contracts are a common element of business life. Best practices for open development should ensure that they don’t negatively impact the openness of the project except as they meet the same criteria for why elements of development might not be open in the first place. 
   Ethics. Obviously, ethics also need to be a consideration in open development, especially because the openness of development could expose its developers to free riding and other threats. However, to date legal attempts to institute ethics, such as with licenses that require updates to be given back to the community, may have done more to make development uninteresting to potential partners. 
 

 Conclusion 

<p>Open development is much bigger than just open source. It requires committing to certain principles and adopting best practices that create a much larger ecosystem that ensures both the openness and the resilience of the technology being developed. In many case, that includes digging all the way down to the hardware.</p>

<p>This article provides a starting point for what’s required to make that larger ecosystem function. It’s intended to start conversations to help us better codify the goals of open development, its needs, and ultimately the best practices that will get us there.</p>

<p>Please just us <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions/121">to further discuss</a> the topic of Open Development.</p>

 Appendix: The Heartbleed Use Case 

<p>The 2012-2014 Heartbleed bug in OpenSSL demonstrated why long-term commitment is a crucial element for open development.</p>

<p>When TLS first appeared in the late ’90s, it was part of an enthusiastic, well-supported drive for improved internet security. Companies like Microsoft, Netscape, and Consensus Development were expending extensive commercial time and effort on the development of these standards, which in turn led to the creation of companies worth billions of dollars.</p>

<p>Fast forward fifteen years and the success of TLS was obvious. It secured almost all of the commerce on the internet, with about 60% of that occurring through a single open-source library: OpenSSL. Unfortunately, OpenSSL has never been properly supported. In fact, by spring 2014, OpenSSL was being developed by a single engineer working quarter time. Inevitably, this led to a major problem: Heartbleed, a massive security vulnerability that affected almost every commerce server on the internet.</p>

<p>This is a common problem in the open-source model. The source is created by enthusiastic developers, but eventually, they move on. Meanwhile, the corporations that are making extensive use of the open-source projects aren’t supporting the community. This is one of the prime reasons that a larger open-development movement is required.</p>

<p>The not-for-profit, Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ), has provided a briefing to incoming Ministers Collins, Lee and vanVelden highlighting the opportunity to move Aotearoa New Zealand forward to become a more productive digital economy through the adoption and use of digital identity (identification).</p>



<p>In its briefing, DINZ emphasises the critical role digital identity plays in fostering trust in online transactions and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A trusted digital economy necessitates assurances that users are who they claim to be, that the services we use are genuine and that products we purchase are what they claim to be. This ecosystem of mutual trust is crucial for any government promoting its country’s digital economy, domestically and to the world,” says DINZ Executive Director Colin Wallis.</p>



<p>The briefing outlines opportunities and challenges, including improving digital identity laws and implementation in New Zealand, alongside recommendations to help move New Zealand forward to a more efficient and productive economy.</p>



<p>Opportunities and Challenges:</p>



<p>Globally, the digital identity verification check market was valued at $11.6 billion USD in 2022, expected to reach $20.8 billion USD by 2027.</p>



<p>DINZ estimates that embracing digital identity could boost New Zealand’s economy by 0.5%-3% of GDP, equating to roughly $1.5 billion to $9 billion NZD.</p>



<p>Despite the positive step of passing the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) Act in April 2023, arguably development of digital identity in New Zealand is slower compared with international common law counterparts. However, DINZ acknowledges the positive efforts by DIA in the compilation of the rules for accreditation and its intentions regarding market uptake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DINZ sees five opportunities to improve digital identity related laws and implementation:</p>



 
 Work with DINZ through the implementation of the DISTF Act 



 Make sure the digital identity related requirements in the Customer &amp; Product Data bill harmonise with the DISTF 



 Ensure the Privacy Act 2020 appropriately directs how biometrics technology collects, processes and stores information, with input from DINZ 



 Fill the current vacuum in child online safety by leveraging work undertaken in the UK and EU 



 Work with DINZ to make authoritative sources of identity available digitally as verifiable credentials. 
 



<p>“DINZ is enthusiastic about engaging with government officials over the next five years. We look forward to contributing to the development of key digital identity initiatives, educating the public and businesses, and supporting the implementation of the DISTF,” says Colin.</p>

 Value, maturity, influence, and the ORE CoP birthday&nbsp;survey Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for Educators Co-op<p>We’ve written a lot about how to develop healthy communities, but what we’ve not explicitly written about in this context is the overlap between “education” and “work”. CoPs provide an excellent way to continue life-long learning, network with other professionals who are interested in a topic and create change in areas we strive to improve. All of these benefits are only possible, though, if you have a healthy, sustainable community.</p><p>We’re pleased that the Open Recognition is for Everybody community continues to grow. Not only do new people pop into the CoP, members are developing real relationships with one another. In this post, we’ll share some outputs from our annual birthday survey and show how trust and connection are keystones to a&nbsp;CoP.</p> Data <p>To measure the health of a community we can look at raw numbers, such as the number of new members that have joined in a specified time period. With over 430 people in the ORE community, it’s grown 27% over the past&nbsp;year.</p><p>But that doesn’t tell the whole picture, which is why it’s important to use structured surveys to discover other data, including sentiment. Last year, we <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-to-gather-data-on-a-community-of-practice-881af2846d0d">showed you how</a> to gather data on a CoP using an approach from McMillan and Chavis’s 1986 paper ‘Sense of community: A definition and&nbsp;theory’.</p><p>This time, we again madesure that we not only asked the same questions, but included a box for free-text entry so people could give us unfiltered feedback. We’re sharing some of the positive results from the survey. It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows, but the forecast is&nbsp;healthy.</p><p>Trust within a community is crucial for collective success and in itself a form of growth. The more people trust each other, the easier it is to move together towards a collective vision. High scores on our 4-point scale, which intentionally lacks a neutral middle option, indicate strong trust&nbsp;levels.</p> That’s all very well in practice, but what about in&nbsp;theory? <p>Last week, we shared <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">short recap videos of Community Conversations</a>, a three-part workshop series about making the most of your Community of Practice&nbsp;(CoP).</p><p>In this post, instead of walking you through the methodologies and metrics, we’re simply going to share a few highlights from the results of the ORE birthday survey, linking it to what we covered in Community Conversations.</p> Value <p>Value cycles in relation to CoPs refer to the different stages of value creation that occur as members of a CoP interact, share knowledge, and learn from each other. These cycles help to assess and understand the value generated by learning in social contexts.</p><blockquote>“I appreciate opportunities to connect with peers, regardless of differences in geographical location and time zones.” (survey participant)</blockquote><p>One of the key things that members of the ORE community value is connection, a feeling of going deeper than the ‘Immediate value’ of Cycle 1 and gaining fulfilment from being able to apply what’s learned in the community to their own work (Cycle&nbsp;3).</p><p>‘Vibes’ are not something easy to measure, but they are important for any kind of CoP, including the ORE community. Thinking about the different kinds of value that communities can generate was the focus of our first <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">Community Conversations workshop</a>.</p> Maturity <p>The work we have done around maturity models is all about navigating your community through its growth stages. We’ve been heavily influenced by the work of Emily Webber, Bailey Richardson, Kevin Huynh &amp; Kai Elmer&nbsp;Sotto.</p><blockquote>“This community is emergent and resilient. I feel we have been coming out of the closet in the last year and building momentum like never before… signals are that we might be reaching the inflection point of the exponential curve.” (survey participant)</blockquote><p>There are ups and downs in the life of any online community, but the idea is that community members feel like they are part of something that is evolving, and that they feel a connection to&nbsp;others.</p><p>Again, ‘connection’ is a difficult thing to measure, but asking how important the community is to members is a good way of trying to figure this out. The second <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">Community Conversations </a>workshop explored <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/towards-a-maturity-model-for-online-networked-communities-v0-1-7c78c2bee8d5">maturity models</a> to help your CoP move in the right direction.</p> Influence <p>Ultimately, the reason people become members of CoPs is to make a difference. They want to improve their own practice, but also make a difference and impact on the world. By being part of an online community, individual members have the ability to influence things which they may not be able to do&nbsp;alone.</p><blockquote>“I feel belonging to this community more than any other I inhabit professionally. In fact, this community has been the constant while my professional affiliation has changed a few times…” (survey participant)</blockquote><p>One way in which influence happens is for one community to influence another. In the case of the ORE community, there is a reasonably high confidence that what we are advocating for (Open Recognition! Open Badges!) is something that is having a wider&nbsp;impact.</p><p>In the third <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">Community Conversations workshop</a> we discussed communities as change agents, introducing the <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-73529560caa3">two loops model</a> and our work around systems convening. The latter is based on the work of Etienne and Beverly Wenger-Trayner.</p> Conclusion <p>We’ve selected some of the results from our survey to illustrate points relating to our series of Community Conversations workshops. We’ve work to do in the ORE community, for example, in helping people have more agency and giving more and different ways for members to meet up in synchronous ways.</p><p>What we do know, based on the work we’ve done (and shared!) around value cycles, maturity models, and influence, is that the ORE community is on the right&nbsp;track.</p><p>If you’d like to join the community, check out <a href="https://badges.community">badges.community</a>.

    Stellar Lumens (XLM) 



<p>Speculation in the cryptocurrency market is nothing new, and the Stellar network with its native currency, Lumens (XLM), has not been immune to it. A recent topic of interest among investors and enthusiasts is the potential for XLM to be backed by silver. This notion stirs up discussions about stability and intrinsic value, aligning digital assets with traditional precious metals.</p>



<p>However, as of now, Stellar Lumens is not backed by silver or any other physical commodity. It remains a decentralized protocol aimed at facilitating cross-border transactions. The speculation around XLM being backed by silver is purely hypothetical and not grounded in any announced plans or developments by the Stellar Development Foundation.</p>



<p>For investors, it’s important to differentiate between actual plans and rumors or wishful thinking. While the idea of backing a cryptocurrency with a tangible asset like silver is intriguing, it would represent a significant shift from the current operation and philosophy of the Stellar network. Such a move would aim to bring the perceived stability and historical reliability of silver to the digital currency space.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while the concept is thought-provoking, it’s essential to approach such speculation with caution. Investors should base their decisions on verified information and understand the speculative nature of discussions about silver backing for XLM or any other cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Stellar Lumens (XLM), the native digital asset of the Stellar network, has a rich history and a substantial presence in the cryptocurrency market. Created in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, along with former lawyer Joyce Kim, Stellar Lumens was envisioned as a decentralized protocol for fast and low-cost cross-border monetary transactions.</p>



<p>Initially, Stellar had 100 billion lumens, but the supply limit has since been reduced to 50 billion lumens, aligning with a focus on managing inflation and maintaining the asset’s value. The Stellar Development Foundation, which supports the Stellar network, has implemented significant upgrades over the years, including a new consensus algorithm in 2015, designed by Stanford professor David Mazières.</p>



<p>The Stellar network has expanded its reach through various partnerships and projects, such as the launch of Lightyear.io, a commercial entity of Stellar in 2017, and later Interstellar, which resulted from Lightyear’s acquisition of Chain, Inc. in 2018. In 2021, Franklin Templeton used Stellar to launch the first “tokenised” US mutual fund, marking a significant milestone in the adoption of blockchain technology in traditional finance.</p>



<p>While the notion of XLM being backed by silver remains speculative, the currency’s actual history, market capitalization, and strategic partnerships highlight its role as a dynamic player in the digital currency space.</p>

<p><a href="https://masca.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Masca</a> is an open-source, decentralized identity wallet that lets you manage your off-chain identifiers and attestations. It is a <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">MetaMask Snap</a> plugin for MetaMask that extends its base functionalities for decentralized identifiers (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DIDs</a>) and verifiable credentials (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">VCs</a>)—turning MetaMask into an identity hub.</p><p>Masca is developed by <a href="https://github.com/blockchain-lab-um?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Blockchain Lab:UM</a>, an R&amp;D laboratory specializing in blockchain technology, decentralized identity, and decentralized artificial intelligence.</p><p>Ceramic, as one of the supported storage solutions in Masca, plays a crucial role in enabling users to store their data, have it available on different devices, and will serve as a foundation for data interoperability with other projects in the future.</p> Decentralized Identity and Data Management With Masca <p>As decentralized applications (dApps) and other decentralized solutions become more complex and personalized for users, there is a growing need to manage user identity and associated data. Given that the amount of data is expected to grow exponentially, off-chain solutions are essential to handle this vast amount in a scalable, efficient, and inexpensive way.</p><p>For quite some time, MetaMask has been working on a feature called MetaMask Snaps—a system that enables extended functionalities of the base MetaMask with Snaps. Snaps are JavaScript programs, each running in its own isolated execution environment inside MetaMask, and can run arbitrary logic, thus significantly extending the functionality of MetaMask.</p> How Does Masca Work? <p>Masca is a MetaMask Snap that provides a straightforward way for users to manage their identity, data and attestations. At the same time, Masca also offers dApp developers a simple-to-use interface to integrate decentralized identity functionalities into their applications. There are (almost) endless attestation types, but some examples are conference attendance, government, KYC, education, and various gaming credentials.</p><p>The decentralized identity space is still in a somewhat early stage, various solutions and protocols are being developed and tested. Masca offers flexibility with multiple integrations for developers to choose what suits their use cases and needs. Masca supports multiple DID methods (did:pkh, did:ethr, did:key, did:jwk, did:polygonid, etc.) and cryptographically-signed data formats (JWT, JSON-LD, EIP712). Some of the integrated projects include <a href="https://ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a>, <a href="https://polygon.technology/polygon-id?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Polygon ID</a>, and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Home?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EBSI</a>.</p><p>Masca uses Veramo Client for DID management, as well as for the creation, presentation, and validation of Verifiable Credentials. In alignment with Masca’s mission, the snap also offers flexibility around data storage, allowing users to toggle between the local MetaMask Snap state (which exists fully off-chain and exclusively in the user’s browser), as well as storage on the Ceramic Network.</p><p>Masca was successfully rolled out during the Open Beta release of MetaMask Snaps in September 2023. For more information, you can visit this <a href="https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-snaps-our-first-step-on-the-road-to-becoming-fully-permissionless/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">link</a> and the <a href="https://snaps.metamask.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Snaps directory</a>.</p> What issues did Masca face before using Ceramic? <p>In the beginning, users could only store their data locally, which meant directly in their MetaMask wallet in the encrypted storage. But that presents a problem when switching to different devices (using the same seed phrase), because the data is unavailable and not synchronized. It also was not possible if users want to share their data in a structured and composable way, which is why Masca chose to build on and integrate Ceramic.</p><blockquote>“Ceramic Network is a data ledger that builds on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and creates an abstraction layer that makes it much more suitable for endless use cases, one of them being data vaults for identity data.”- Masca team</blockquote> Why Masca Chose Ceramic <p>Ceramic offers a scalable network for data, builds on top of the same primitives as Masca (DIDs), and provides developer-friendly tools for development. Structuring the otherwise unstructured data into data streams, controlled by user accounts, creates a powerful solution for managing identity data.</p><p>Ceramic also has a <a href="https://www.notion.so/a3a7a58f81544d33ad3feb84368775d4?pvs=21&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">broad ecosystem of projects</a> working on diverse challenges and problems. By being part of this ecosystem, the Masca team says it aims to connect with other projects in the identity space and work together to tackle those challenges, such as conforming to the same data models and making data truly composable across different applications. Building more rich and complex decentralized identities can also help solve the challenges with reputation and Sybil attacks in the future.</p> How Masca Uses Ceramic <p>Masca is now live on Ceramic Mainnet! Ceramic is currently used in the Masca ecosystem for two primary purposes:</p>  Verifiable Credential Storage: Since VCs are off-chain attestations, users must store them somewhere. Ceramic offers a scalable way to store attestations.  Schemas: Each VC has a strictly defined structure and data model, which are defined with schemas. Using schemas, VCs of the same type are consistent across different applications.  <p>Users can freely migrate their credentials between Snap-encrypted storage and Ceramic Network as they wish.

<p>How to Fail Innovation 101<br>
In today’s academic landscape, universities expect their Information Technology (IT) Departments to be hubs of innovation. However, the prevalent understanding of ‘innovation’ often leans towards adopting market trends rather than being truly forward-looking. Unfortunately, these ‘innovations’ are often external, sourced from third-party software, rather than emerging from the IT team’s internal processes and practices.</p>
<p>This presentation aims to redefine innovation and highlight its potential within IT departments. We will explore the motivations for innovation, common missteps, and how to develop operational strategies that foster, not stifle, innovation.</p>
<p>A positive environment for innovation can benefit the entire IT team. It encourages employees to develop more effective processes and practices, and empowers IT leadership to create an environment that nurtures innovation or remove existing barriers to it.</p>
<p>We will delve into various theories of innovation, drawing analogies from a range of domains including rainforests, gardens, machines, and even Plato’s Divine Frenzy. The presentation underscores the unique pressures on IT departments to innovate, making a clear distinction between innovation and invention.</p>
<p>Innovation, according to our perspective, isn’t just about creating something new—an act of invention—but about altering product, process, or practice life cycles to enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and advantage. We will provide insights on implementing innovation effectively, while also addressing potential pitfalls and challenges.</p>

<p>Creating a Path for Faculty Success in Online and Hybrid Course Development<br>
When our first Online Teaching Certificate debuted in 2017, it was a five-session series offered in person. Over time, we added a second five-session level two and transitioned to a hybrid, then fully asynchronous experience. Both levels are suitable for both new and experienced professors who want to transition to online teaching or enhance their existing skills. Using the University’s chosen quality assurance rubric as the foundation, we cover a wide range of topics, including course design, objectives and alignment, student engagement strategies, accessibility, and ideas for assessment and feedback. Our course is designed to be practical, interactive, and engaging, providing best practices in creating and delivering an online course. Level two expands on the quality assurance rubric and introduces the Transparency in Learning and Teaching process, creating engaging lectures, and utilizing the learning management system and templates. Faculty leave both levels with completed materials to use in their own online or hybrid course.</p>

<p>AI and the Evolution of Strategic Planning and Assessment in Higher Education<br>
Merging theoretical discourse with practical demonstrations, this session will explore the nascent role of AI in higher education. We will focus particularly on GPT-4.0 and its potential for transforming the strategic planning process. Key areas of focus will include the use of AI in designing new strategic planning objectives and embedding sustainable but agile strategic planning assessments in existent objectives. Live demonstrations will exhibit the versatility of GPT-4.0, as we delve into “prompt engineering,” to generate explicit and actionable outcomes. Furthermore, we will explore the socio-cultural implications of integrating AI into higher education, highlighting its powerful “reasoning” capabilities, while acknowledging its limitations and potential risks. In this session, we will highlight the vital role of human responsibility in the effective use of AI. Particularly, we will focus on our own unique abilities in language mastery and logical reasoning, which when synergized with AI, enable us to attain achievements beyond what AI could reach on its own. Our objective is to provide a transformative understanding of how AI, particularly GPT-4.0, can be leveraged as a versatile resource in managing the complexities of strategic planning.</p>

<p>Using Chatbots to Improve the Online Learning Experience<br>
Chatbots improve the online learning experience by assisting users navigating library websites in search of information. Understanding users’ questions to the chatbot and placing them in subject categories reveals the types of information they are searching for. This presentation will discuss a current project conducting a content analysis of questions posed to the Lehman Library’s chatbot, which uses the ChatGPT AI. The presenters will highlight some of the chatbot’s weakness, specifically the questions users pose that it cannot reliably answer. How the information gleaned from the analysis may improve the library website through content additions and layout changes will be discussed. The presenters will argue that projects using artificial intelligence, like chatbots, can lead to better online learning experience for library users, who rely on both the chatbot and the library website to provide them with information on library and campus-related services and resources.</p>

<p>Modernizing and Enhancing Analytics Infrastructure While Moving to the Cloud<br>
“Rob Stirton, VP of Institutional Effectiveness and CIO at County College of Morris, will demonstrate how CCM uses insights from their analytics platform for real-time decision making across the institution. CCM initially implemented GCOM’s on-premise Student Success Analytics (SSA) platform to integrate data across the entire student lifecycle and develop a clear line of sight between the college’s strategic goals and daily operations. This solution leveraged their existing business intelligence software investment and dramatically improved the availability and accuracy of information through visual analytics for all audiences, while significantly reducing workload on IT and researchers. Eliminating manual data processes allows CCM department chairs to establish goals for enrollment and retention and measure progress, grant writers to include valuable details about student populations to strengthen their applications, and students services staff to improve retention for transfer students.</p>
<p>Building on this success, CCM took the natural next step in their analytics journey: modernizing in the cloud with GCOM’s SSA Cloud platform. SSA Cloud increases access and usability and reduces management costs while seamlessly integrating data sources with hybrid cloud architecture. The cloud environment is managed by GCOM, reducing CCM’s need to staff expensive, in-demand skillsets to support the infrastructure. With the move to the cloud, CCM is better equipped to adapt to changing technical business needs, while leveraging built-in capabilities such as machine learning models that identify admissions and financial aid fraud, and dynamic data exploration and ad-hoc reporting that limits the need for users to write queries.</p>

<p>Building Data Analytics Centers for Colleges &amp; Departments<br>
“Every college, department and functional office at Rowan University needs access to data at their fingertips for decision making. Building common dashboards and models for everyone does not meet the needs of everyone. If we start tweaking common dashboards to meet the needs of everyone, the dashboards become unusable and complex. To solve this problem, we use Extract, Transform, &amp; Load process to build complex and common datasets. We build various predictive models using these common datasets. We use these datasets and models and package them into data portals that we call as data centers. We build visualizations, KPIs, dashboards and reports based on these data sets and models and package them into different data centers. These data centers will have all the data one would need in a college or a department in a way they can easily consume and make decisions on. These data centers consist of dashboards, KPIs, reports, and predictive models in one place.”</p>

<p>Establishing Procedures to Improve Monitoring Effectiveness<br>
We have all been monitoring our networks, servers and applications for years. &nbsp; However, our effectiveness with leveraging monitoring tools is never in alignment with our service improvement goals.&nbsp; For the past two years we have been implementing improved monitoring strategies for the entire IT organization to leverage.&nbsp; These strategies have identified gaps in monitoring areas and allowed us to consolidate monitoring tools to improve how we use monitoring.&nbsp; This session will provide an overview of our monitoring services and the strategies we have implemented to provide improved IT services to the Princeton community.</p>

<p>A “DIDComm 101” presentation at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) in Mountain View last month inspired the creation of a new tool that enables anyone to easily send and receive DIDComm messages. Colton Wolkins, Senior Software Engineer at Indicio, explains.</p><p>Please provide a quick introduction to DIDComm and the DIDComm Demo&nbsp;</p><p>DIDComm is short for DID Communication, a protocol which lets people and software use Decentralized Identifiers (also known as DIDs) to communicate securely and privately over many channels including the Internet, Bluetooth, mobile push notifications, and QR codes.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea for the DIDComm Demo came about just before the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) in California last month. Sam Curren (Indicio’s Senior Systems Architect, and Deputy CTO) realized that everything he was presenting at IIW using slides, we could show using a simple self-serve tool that helps people see for themselves how DIDComm works.&nbsp;</p><p>The DIDComm Demo allows you to connect to another person, a computer, a phone or simply another window in a different browser tab so you can see DIDComm messages traverse back and forth after the messages have been decrypted.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason we wrote this as a separate app was to allow people to see how DIDComm works without needing to sift through or learn a substantial stack like Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py).</p><p>Who is the Demo designed for?&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who wants to understand how the technology works. For example, developers who want to build their own solutions on top of DIDComm can connect to the Demo from whatever they are building, to test that messages are being sent correctly.&nbsp;</p><p>We used a chat window approach to make it easy to understand. The tool is stripped down to the essentials, so it’s easy to see what’s going on. If you open up your browser’s network inspector, you’ll find all your messages are encrypted and your data is secure.&nbsp;</p><p>The DIDComm Demo is entirely open source. If anyone wants to <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-demo?ref=blog.identity.foundation">look at code</a>, to see how it works and learn from it, they can.&nbsp;</p><p>Please explain the concept of mediators in DIDComm, and their role in the DIDComm Demo&nbsp;</p><p>DIDComm doesn’t provide an inherent way to store messages. Also your phone’s IP address is always changing, so there’s no way to talk directly to it. Mediators are cloud-based agents that enable DIDComm messages to be stored and routed.</p><p>For example, if your travel agent sends you a DIDComm message about your flight, the mediator stores the message if your phone is offline. When the phone comes back online it talks to the mediator and says “Here I am, please send me any messages.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mediators tend to be hosted on the public Internet, so they have a domain name which points to the mediator’s IP address. They can either deliver messages directly to mobile devices, or collect messages from many agents at a single endpoint for future delivery.&nbsp;</p><p>A mediator must be accounted for when the sender encrypts a message. For example: If I am connected to you and I send you a message through your mediator, I first encrypt it so only you can decrypt it, then I encrypt it again so only your mediator can read whom to send the message to.&nbsp;</p><p>The DIDComm Demo is connected to a mediator. That’s what enables two people across the world to send messages to each other. At the moment, it happens to use the Indicio mediator (we don’t gain any insight into whether a message is coming from the Demo or any other application). We’re hoping to support more mediators, as other organizations bring WebSocket-capable mediators online.</p><p>DIDComm uses did:peer2 DIDs to establish a connection. The public keys are included in the DID document — one for signing, one for encryption — together with a service endpoint (a location to talk to), in this case, the Indicio Mediator’s DID. When you send a message, the Demo app resolves the mediator’s DID and finds the URL to which to relay the message.</p><p>For more information on mediators, see <a href="https://book.didcomm.org/routing/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://book.didcomm.org/routing/</a></p><p>How can someone access the DIDComm Demo?&nbsp;</p><p>Go to <a href="https://demo.didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">demo.didcomm.org</a>.

<p>This article, like <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/echoes-history/">“Echoes from History: Designing Self-Sovereign Identity with Care”</a>, is drawn from a book I have in process called FOREMEMBRANCE, which chronicles how identity was abused in WWII and how those dangers linger to the present day._</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ABSTRACT: eIDAS v2.0, released as a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/european-digital-identity-provisional-ag/product-details/20231116CAN72103">provisional agreement on November 16, 2023</a>, offers the first large-scale codification of digital identity. Unfortunately, it contains not just technical problems but also major philosophical missteps that could make it highly dangerous to its users, especially given the increasing threat of regime change in Europe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The history of identity is a sobering one. It’s just more than century old in its modern, codified and organized, form but in that time identity has been reponsible for atrocities. In <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/echoes-history/">“Echoes from History: Designing Self-Sovereign Identity with Care”</a>, I wrote about one of the worst misuses of identity, when Jacobus L. Lentz supported the Nazis in their use of Dutch identity records during World War II, resulting in the death of 75% of the country’s Jews. It didn’t have to be that way: in France, another identity pioneer by the name of René Carmille had control of a similar trove of identity records, but only selectively disclosed some of his data to the Nazis. Only 23% of the Jewish people in France fell to genocide as a result.</p>

<p>However, the stories of Lentz and Carmille are not mere historical prologue. They are powerful warnings about the care that must be taken in the use of personally identifiable data in the twenty-first century and beyond, as the collection of that personal information multiplies and enters the digital space. These warnings are particularly important today, as the European Union just reached <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/european-digital-identity-provisional-ag/product-details/20231116CAN72103">provisional agreement</a> on their next-generation digital-identity regulation, eIDAS, on November 16th. This was despite the fact that it is filled with both technical oversights and poor identity designs that could allow a repeat of the Dutch disaster under Lentz.</p>

<p>It is disturbingly ironic that six days later, on November 22nd, Geert Wilders rose to prominence in the Netherlands in a shock election win<a>1</a> after running on a platform of hate and intolerance toward Muslims. What happens when isolationists and nationialists such as Geert Wilders, Victor Orbán, and Marine Le Pen take ahold of a badly flawed identity system? Unfortunately, history offers us dark lessons.</p>

 Two Roads Diverged 

<p></p>

<p>The digital world is a new frontier, and like all frontiers it has enjoyed waves of migrations. First came the pioneers: rugged individuals who set their own norms and created their own communities. Then came the corporations: companies intent on monetizing that frontier. Last came the governments: existing authorities intent on setting their own rules and regulations for this new world.</p>

<p>Today, the digital world stands at a crossroads. The conflicting ideas of the pioneers and the corporations are already writ large in differing models for identity on the internet. But now, governments are looking to exert their control over digital space, and it will ultimately be they who decide which of those models persists.</p>

<p>Despite the internet being ultimately founded by governments, who enabled the centralized authority of institutions such as IANA, ICANN, and various Certificate Authorities, the users of the internet have always yearned to be free. They’ve long wanted to control their own digital identities, to define their own relationships with other networked individuals.</p>

<p>One of the first clear statements of this was Phil Zimmerman’s development of the PGP software in 1991. Superficially, it was a technology that allowed for the encryption of data so that it could only be read by its intended recipipent. But PGP went far beyond that. It gave each user a personal identifier that they controlled. They could decide what information to release in correlation with their PGP key and to whom.</p>

<p>Following Zimmerman’s initial deployment of PGP, generations of digital pioneers offered their own takes on digital identity. Most of this occurred  courtesy of organizations such as the Identity Commons<a>2</a>, the Internet Identity Workshop<a>3</a>, and Rebooting the Web of Trust<a>4</a>. Their goal has been to allow for the creation of “decentralized identity” that is not controlled by any one entity. It was a very different take from either Lentz or Carmille, with a user in control of his identity information rather than giving it over to the state.</p>

<p>A number of those ideas about self-sovereign identity have become reality with the standardization of decentralized identifiers (DIDs)<a>5</a> and Verifiable Credentials (VCs)<a>6</a> by the IETF. Now users can have personal control of an identifier that says who they are, and they can associate signed credentials with it, from recommendations to licenses to certifications. It’s a model for digital identity that, if deployed correctly, can avoid the worst dangers of identification, because a user can decide what information to release and to whom.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s not the only way.</p>

<p>Just as users have been building up models for digital identity that give power back to individuals by allowing them to hold their personal data close, corporations have been going in the opposite direction, trying to link together as much information as they can.</p>

<p>You look at a product on Amazon, and suddenly every other site on the internet is trying to sell you on like products. This is a purposeful invasion of your digital privacy that advertising companies celebrate<a>7</a>. But, it’s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Companies all across the internet collect huge amounts of data and share it with each other<a>8</a>, creating the potential for huge honeypots of personal information. Imagine a maleovolent party accessing every single bit of data collected by Google, potentially including what websites you visit, what items you purchase, and even where your Android phone is located at any time. It becomes even worse when internet companies require your real-name, as Facebook<a>9</a> does, potentially creating a real-world connection to that digital data trove. The possibilities are catastrophic if a sufficiently bad actor gets a hold of that information.</p>

<p>These are the two possibilities for digital identity as we enter the third phase of the development of the digital world, where countries and other polities are beginning to lay down their own rules and regulations. We could go the way of the self-sovereign pioneers, who want to minimize information and correlation in a way that would have made Carmille proud, or we could go the way of the corporations that want to collate and correlate everything for their own selfish self-interest, something that Lentz likely would have blindly supported.</p>

<p>Unfortunately eIDAS v2.0, one of the first major definitions of digital identity, could go either way.</p>

 The EU’s Unintential Consequences 

<p>eIDAS v2.0, the new extended version of the Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services that is a product of the European Union,  was released as a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/european-digital-identity-provisional-ag/product-details/20231116CAN72103">provisional agreement</a> on November 16, 2023. The EU has been a major force in proclaiming individual rights on the internet, and they seem to have the best intentions of empowering and protecting their citizens. Unfortunately, their biggest initiatives to date have been mixed successes due to their inability to recognize the unintentional consequences of their regulatory design.</p>

<p>The GDPR <a>10</a> and the EPrivacy Directives<a>11</a> had laudable goals <a>12</a> but have resulted in endless clicking of buttons to access websites in Europe and have largely benefited large corporations who are able to fulfill the regulations<a>13</a>. The EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market<a>14</a> has resulted in countries trying to grab cash from search engines<a>15</a> and getting cut off from news as a result<a>16</a>.</p>

<p>Generally, these digital regulations demonstrate a concerning repetition of unintended consequences and insufficient understanding of the digital space in EU legislation. If those problems were to recur in identity-focused legislation, it could be catastropic.</p>

 eIDAS on the March 

<p></p>

<p>eIDAS v2.0 details the legal and technical requirements for countries to offer digital identities that can be stored on devices and reused<a>17</a>. It requires the creation of digital wallets that can be filled with both an identifier and credentials. If you’ve long dreamed of having a driver’s license, university records, or health records that are digitally stored in a portable way, that’s what eIDAS v2.0 does<a>18</a>.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of theoretically good material built into eIDAS v2.0. It supports interoperable digital wallets with high security standards. It also enables digital signing and can be set up remotely without having to present physical documents in person<a>19</a>.</p>

<p>There’s also hope that self-sovereign identity (SSI) could still be a possibility with the release of eIDAS. After all, the provisional agreement states that one of its goals is “to provide people with control over their online identity and data”<a>20</a>. One study on the topic thus suggested there was no innate contradiction between eIDAS and the individual-empowering principles of SSI<a>21</a>. Another laid out bridge scenarios<a>22</a>. Yet another author noted that “selective disclosure” of information, where users individually decide what identity elements to release, had been a principle since eIDAS 1.0. However, nothing is guaranteed: that final article also notes that the user’s personal, self-sovereign control of data is purposefully limited by the design<a>23</a> of eIDAS.</p>

<p>Ultimately whether eIDAS will create new digital honeypots of information will depend on eIDAS’ final deployment and how it’s arbitrated by countries’ laws and courts. Unfortunately, the EU’s record on digital legislation is problematic, and as it’s proposed eIDAS is full of holes that could lead to big problems in our future.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with eIDAS as it currently stands is a worldwide web-security issue. eIDAS mandates that web browers accept security certificates from individual member states and the EU can refuse to revoke them even if they’re dangerous<a>24</a>. The provisional agreement does note that “The obligation of recognition, interoperability and support of QWACs is not to affect the freedom of web-browser providers to ensure web security, domain authentication and the encryption of web traffic in the manner and with the technology they consider most appropriate.”<a>20</a>. However, that’s clearly a contradiction: web browsers can not ensure web security if there’s an obligation to recognize CAs from member states.</p>

<p>That obligation not only reverts the web to an outdated model for security management, but it also puts every single transaction on the web at the mercy of the least trustworthy administrator in the least trustworthy EU state, including states such as The Netherlands and Poland, now threatened by nationalists. Potentially, millions of people would have the ability to break web security. Perhaps worse, it allows the surveillance of users at European websites by European governments<a>25</a>.</p>

<p>There are numerous problems with the actual identity model of eIDAS as well.</p>

<p>This begins with the identifier at the heart of the proposal, which is problematic because it’s meant to be persistent<a>26</a>. That allows for extreme correlation of everything a person ever does with their identity, over an infinite amount of time, and thus creates huge honeypots of personal information that will be massive targets for attacks. Earlier proposals even called for the identifier to be unique for each person, which would have multiplied the problem a hundredfold (and violated the Constitutions of some member states)<a>27</a>. The provisional agreement leaves the question of uniqueness up to the member states themselves but at least offsets that somewhat with support for pseudonyms<a>28</a>.</p>

<p>The cryptographic technology used by eIDAS is also at issue because of the very conservative and limited choices of the EU. Modern signature schemes and other cryptography likely to offer better protection for the enormous personal data likely to be compiled under eIDAS are all prohibited<a>29</a>. This leaves it very vulnerable.</p>

<p>eIDAS data is ultimately collected in wallets, which will be government-backed and will use identities provided by corporations. This allows the possibility for either entity to illicitly collect personal data<a>30</a>. Though the current governments and selected corporations might be trustworthy, the same guarantee can’t be made for future controllers of those entities. Thus, the data and app model at the core of eIDAS is just a mortgage for future problems.</p>

<p>In other words, there are problems up and down the entire eIDAS stack, including identity creation, identity assignment, cryptographic protection, web-based security, and app design. Too much data is being collected in one place, it’s potentially available to too many people, and it’s too vulnerable.</p>

<p>The stories of Lentz and Carmille should have taught us the core importance of minimizing data and intrinsically protecting it from misuse.</p>

<p>eIDAS does not.</p>

<p>The problem is that the EU creating a digital identity without understanding modern theories for how to create safe identities that can benefit their users without making them vulnerable.</p>

<p>Identities need to minimize data correlation. Identities need to minimize data correlation. The EU’s original take on a unique identity shows how badly misguided they are on this criterion, and even now the decision is going to get punted to the member states. But there should never be a single identity that correlates your taxes, your transit through different countries, your rental of a bicycle, your usage of digital euros<a>31</a>,and whatever else gets jammed into the eIDAS framework. And that data shouldn’t last forever (and in fact doing so goes against the GDPR’s right to be forgotten<a>32</a>).</p>

<p>Identities need to minimize identification. That same person renting a bike should need to reveal nothing more than their ability to pay to rent and possibly replace the bicycle. A person buying an alcoholic beverage should only need to reveal their age. A person reporting a public-works issue, such as a pothole, should potentially reveal nothing. Ultmately identity is about managing the risk between two parties. The risk to individuals must be minimized by minimizing the identification data they’re required to share.</p>

<p>For eIDAS identities to successfully meet the human-focused goals of the EU, they need to reflect the power imbalance between the state and the individual, and in those situations where their needs are equal, or where the needs of the individual are greater, they need to maximize the power of the individual.</p>

<p>To go back to the example of an individual reporting a pothole, the risk that the state faces for a false report is low: they might waste resources if they schedule a non-existent public-works repair, but they are very large and can easily amortize that loss. In contrast, the risk that an individual faces is much greater. If their identity were revealed, they might be “outed” as a troublemaker or they might face retribution from a worker who had previously failed to fix that pothole. (Obviously, these repercussions would be even greater for a matter of more import, but the fact that they exist for even a small issue is notable.) As a result, despite the power imbalance where the state holds the most power, it must give the most protection to the individual in this situation, by not requiring identification data.</p>

<p>Certainly, there are technical solutions that can resolve some of the most extreme problems remaining in eIDAS. The state-mandated CAs need to be removed, identifiers must be required to be non-persistent and non-unique, cryptography must be expanded, and the creation of identifiers and wallets must be decentralized.</p>

<p>However, the philosophical issues are just as important. The minimization of data collection, data correlation, and personal identification must be incorporated into eIDAS as actual regulations or the very strongest of recommendations. eIDAS ultimately must say not just what things must be done for compliance, but what things must not be done to preserve the privacy of user data.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>In order to protect our human rights, we need to ensure that modern-day information systems protect our data in meaningful ways. As we learned <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/echoes-history/">through the lessons of Lentz and Carmille</a>, there are two paths before us.</p>

<p>On the one hand, we have the path of Jacobus Lentz. He maximized the information that he collected, he happily stored it all together, and he thought merely about the efficiency of its use. His information thus wasn’t protected against a regime change, and the Nazis used it to commit genocide against 75% of the Netherlands’ Jewish population.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have the path of René Carmille. He collected very similar information to Lentz, but he was aware of the sensitivity of some information, so he ensured that it couldn’t be correlated with other personally identifiable information. A third as many Jews died in France as The Netherlands (by percentage), and it seems likely that Carmille’s protection of personal records was a major factor.</p>

<p>Moving across the 20th and 21st centuries, we’ve unfortunately more frequently cleaved to the path of Lentz than Carmille. The Census Bureau turned over records of Japanese-Americans to President Roosevelt and thousands died and tens of thousands more were deeply scarred. Records of young DACA immigrants passed from President Obama to President Trump and their lives were thrown into grave uncertainty. The smaller stories of individual people whose lives were destroyed due to the theft or sharing of data (legal or not) are uncountable. Lentz remains ascendant; his lessons unlearned.</p>

<p>But the digital frontier offers a new opportunity to do things right. We can ensure that identities are controlled by people and used to benefit those people and society as a whole. We can protect people and their identities against regime change, which has become all too much of a possibility in Europe, as demonstrated by Poland and the Netherlands. We just have to do so before it’s too late.</p>

<p>The biggest danger and the biggest opportunity in the current day remains eIDAS. With the release of a provisional agreement, it might already be too far along to prevent its ratification in that form. But either now or afterward we must take the opportunity to legislatively minimize the data collected and correlated for identities.</p>

<p>We must give individuals the ability to control their personal identity as much as is possible in a shared society.</p>

    Navigating Identity in the Digital Age 



 Back Story 



<p>Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Joins UNDP in Pioneering Digital Infrastructure Drive</p>



<p>The United Nations Development Program has launched an ambitious initiative, the “50-in-5” campaign, to boost the digital public infrastructure (DPI) across the globe. This strategic move, strongly supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, aims to see 50 countries develop and scale at least one DPI component by 2028. These components include digital payments, ID, and data exchange systems that are integral to achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.</p>



<p>A cohort of 11 nations, including technological front-runners like Estonia and emerging economies like Bangladesh, have stepped forward as the first movers in this groundbreaking journey. The Gates Foundation’s involvement underscores its ongoing commitment to DPI, highlighted by a $200 million fund established in September 2022. Melinda French Gates has emphasized the transformative potential of mobile devices in furthering digital identities, which are central to DPI’s expansion.</p>



<p>India’s Aadhaar, the world’s largest biometric ID system, is poised to play a significant role in this global narrative. Recognized at the G20 Summit in New Delhi, Aadhaar could serve as a blueprint for countries in Africa and Asia to roll out their digital identity technologies. With such a robust backing and a clear target, the “50-in-5” campaign is set to embark on a path that could reshape how nations and their citizens interact with technology and governance.</p>



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity vs. UNDP’s Digital Public Infrastructure</p>



<p>In the digital era, the quest for a secure and efficient identity management system has led to the emergence of two distinct philosophies: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and the United Nations Development Program’s (UNDP) digital public infrastructure (DPI) approach as recently endorsed by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): A User-Centric Model</p>



<p>SSI is a user-centric model that grants individuals complete control over their digital identities. Unlike traditional identity systems that rely on centralized authorities, SSI is built on blockchain technology, allowing for a decentralized and autonomous structure. Users can manage their identities without intermediary oversight, deciding when and to whom they reveal their information​<a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/self-sovereign-identity/#:~:text=Time%20to%20read%3A%209%20minutes,a%20passport%20or%20driver%E2%80%99s%20license"></a>​​<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/22/2811#:~:text=2.2.%20Self,and%20manage%20their%20digital%20identities"></a>​​<a href="https://www.identity.com/self-sovereign-identity/#:~:text=Verifiable%20credentials%20and%20decentralized%20identifiers,known%20as%20a%20blockchain%20network"></a>​. Christopher Allen’s principles of SSI emphasize that control over personal data is fundamental, positioning users not merely as subjects within digital realms but as their sovereigns​<a href="https://blockchainhub.net/blog/blog/self-sovereign-identity-vs-data/#:~:text=Principles%20of%20Self,important%20principles%20include%20the"></a>​. This system is geared towards a future where identity verification is both secure and private, with verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers ensuring accessibility across the globe at any time​<a href="https://www.identity.com/self-sovereign-identity/#:~:text=Verifiable%20credentials%20and%20decentralized%20identifiers,known%20as%20a%20blockchain%20network"></a>​​<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/eidas-observatory/ssi-and-eidas-vision-how-they-are-connected-share-your-views.html#:~:text=Self,groups%20have%20raised%20their"></a>​.</p>



<p>UNDP’s Digital Public Infrastructure: A Collaborative Framework</p>



<p>The UNDP’s DPI initiative, on the other hand, encompasses a network of digital components like payments, ID, and data exchange systems. This infrastructure is designed to aid countries in achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. With the Gates Foundation’s backing, the “50-in-5” campaign aims to implement DPI components in 50 countries by 2028​<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/gates-foundation-backs-un-campaign-to-accelerate-digital-infrastructure/"></a>​. Unlike SSI, the DPI approach involves a more collaborative framework, possibly relying on centralized or semi-centralized systems that can be adopted at a national scale. The focus here is on interoperability and inclusiveness, aiming for a safe and universally accessible digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>The Core Differences</p>



<p>The key difference between SSI and DPI lies in the locus of control and the approach to decentralization. SSI is about empowering the individual as the sole owner of their identity, with blockchain technology ensuring that control remains with the user​<a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/self-sovereign-identity/#:~:text=Time%20to%20read%3A%209%20minutes,a%20passport%20or%20driver%E2%80%99s%20license"></a>​​<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/22/2811#:~:text=2.2.%20Self,and%20manage%20their%20digital%20identities"></a>​​<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/eidas-observatory/ssi-and-eidas-vision-how-they-are-connected-share-your-views.html#:~:text=Self,groups%20have%20raised%20their"></a>​. DPI, while it may utilize some decentralized features, is more about creating a common digital infrastructure that can be shared among nations and governed by a collective of stakeholders, including governments and international organizations​<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/gates-foundation-backs-un-campaign-to-accelerate-digital-infrastructure/"></a>​.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while both SSI and DPI aim to address the challenges of identity in the digital age, they offer different paths forward. SSI is a bottom-up approach that starts with individual autonomy, whereas DPI represents a top-down strategy that focuses on creating a shared digital environment. As the digital landscape evolves, the interaction between these two models will likely shape the future of digital identity governance.</p>

<p>We’re excited to share the latest improvements to Ceramic, version 3.0. This upgrade is packed with significant improvements:</p> Ceramic Node Software 3.0 <p>We’re kicking things off with the launch of Ceramic 3.0, the latest version of our node software. We urge you to upgrade your Ceramic packages to this version for an optimal experience.</p> Node.js Version 20 Support <p>A key highlight of Ceramic 3.0 is its compatibility with Node.js version 20. Please note that older versions of Node.js, such as v16, are no longer supported with the new Ceramic versions. Therefore, upgrading your Ceramic node to v3.0 necessitates a simultaneous <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-update-node-and-npm-to-the-latest-version/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">upgrade to Node.js v20</a>.</p><p>This change allows you to leverage the most recent features and performance enhancements offered by Node.js.</p> Upgrade Your Ceramic Node <p>For those running a Ceramic node, we&nbsp;strongly advise&nbsp;upgrading to the latest version. While older nodes may continue to function, they will no longer receive technical support or bug fixes. To ensure you’re well-supported, and prevent future compatibility issues, we recommend updating your node.</p><p>Prior to transitioning, <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/introducing-ceramic-3-0-with-node-js-version-20-support/1373?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ensure your client application builds against the latest versions of the @ceramicnetwork/http-client package</a>. This step will guarantee a seamless experience with future updates.</p><p>Click <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/introducing-ceramic-3-0-with-node-js-version-20-support/1373?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a> for more info on upgrading your Ceramic node. </p> Goodbye to Non-Standard DID Methods <p>We’ve retired some older, unused code—specifically, the DID:ETH, DID:NFT, and DID:SAFE features. These were previously available but were never recommended for production use. We’re now officially discontinuing them. If you’ve been using these DID methods, it’s time to let go as they’re no longer supported.</p> Future Features on the Roadmap <p>Ceramic 3.0 paves the way for exciting features that we anticipate in <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ceramicstudio/projects/2/views/1?ref=blog.ceramic.network">upcoming releases</a>, such as worker threads for parallelized signature verification. These changes are expected to boost performance, setting the stage for more future enhancements.</p><p>As always we'd love to hear your feedback on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">forum</a>! </p>

<p>The U.S. government has embraced FIDO authentication, and is now looking for further guidance around how to implement this technology into the government’s existing PIV-centric ecosystem used to manage enterprise access for government employees and contractors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To provide this guidance, the FIDO Alliance published a paper, “FIDO Alliance Guidance for U.S. Government Agency Deployment of FIDO Authentication.”</p>



 
 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-fido-alliance-guidance-for-u-s-government-agency-deployment-of-fido-authentication/">Read the paper</a> 
 



 



<p>This resource is the first output of a new committee formed by the FIDO Alliance’s Board of Directors at the request of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The Committee, whose goal is to improve and accelerate adoption of FIDO technology within federal agencies, includes representatives from CISA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the General Services Administration (GSA), the Department of Defense, in addition to other FIDO Alliance members.</p>



<p>The Committee is aligned with the government’s efforts to modernize identity to counter threats, and encourages agencies to advance their Zero Trust Architecture journeys by implementing identity capabilities that support both FIDO and PKI-based phishing-resistant MFA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also provides guidance on implementation of FIDO credentials within the federal digital identity ecosystem in order to meet immediate priorities defined in OMB 22-09, Federal Zero Trust Strategy and advance cybersecurity outcomes by enabling future phases of Federal Zero Trust Architecture efforts.</p>



<p>Alternative options for phishing-resistant authentication are necessary in the federal workforce, for example, for individuals who are not PIV eligible, or to quickly enable access for new employees who are waiting for their PIV to be issued, or those individuals who work remotely and don’t need access to federal facilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This document highlights areas where FIDO offers the best value to address U.S. Government use cases as an enhancement of existing infrastructure, while minimizing rework as agencies advance their zero trust strategies with phishing-resistant authentication tied to enterprise identity as the foundation.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance will host a webinar, “Deploying FIDO Authentication in U.S. Government Agencies,” covering the essential information in this white paper on November 28, 2023 at 1:00 PM ET / 11:00 AM PT. To register for the webinar, <a href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/4419611/509DCD451A69E91608E646994220EE55">click here</a>.</p>

<p></p><p>Polygon is a decentralized blockchain network that allows for the permissionless exchange of value.</p><p><a href="https://polygonid.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Polygon ID</a>, part of the Polygon ecosystem, provides a Self-Sovereign Identity solution leveraging the power of Zero-Knowledge Proofs. It consists of a set of libraries, tools and ready-made applications that can be used to facilitate trusted, secure and privacy-preserving relationships between identity holders, issuers and verifiers.</p><p>Polygon ID is open-source and can be deployed to any EVM-compatible chain.&nbsp;</p><p>In our latest guest blog, Polygon ID protocol engineer, Oleksandr Brezhniev,  Technical Sales lead for the American region, Otto Mora and Digital Project Manager, Alex Rosales answer our questions about the company's new product release.</p><p>Your website states that Polygon ID is "The first identity solution that allows users to use zero-knowledge proofs&nbsp; generated from off-chain verifiable credentials to interact with smart contracts." What use cases do you envisage and what are the benefits of this approach?</p><p>Know Your Customer (KYC) is a key use case. We've seen multiple Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects moving in this direction, including Uniswap, which recently has implemented the possibility to allow only verified liquidity providers in the new version of their protocol. Also Centralized Finance (CeFi) apps (such as centralized exchanges, on-ramp services, etc.) can benefit from better user experiences coming from reusable verifications. No more passing KYC on each platform separately!</p><p>But also there's a range of use cases not related to KYC. For example:</p>  Decentralized Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) may allow voting only to their GitHub contributors.  Limit who can join a DAO based on belonging to a social group, like "Women in Tech."  Build communities to solve issues and fund local development projects.  Distribute tokens (airdrop) among “Active Steam players” to attract new users to a Web3 game.  <p>In regard to voting and airdrops there is an interesting use case, Sybil resistance. Based on a Proof-of-Uniqueness credential (for example, issued by an identity verification provider), a user can prove that they are unique without disclosing any personal information and can vote only once, no matter how many Ethereum addresses and Decentralized Identifiers the user has. Protection from Sybil attacks and bots is crucial for decision making and fair funds distribution.</p><p>Another problem this capability can solve is recovery of access to user accounts. For example, an <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Abstracted Account </a>(a new way to make Ethereum accounts more secure, with a better user experience) allows you to change the account “owner” if the new “owner” proves to be the same person, using credentials from a trusted KYC provider or from preselected, trusted friends.</p><p>To sum up, bringing off-chain data in the form of Verifiable Credentials on-chain improves security and compliance without sacrificing user privacy, reduces fraud, increases automation, improves user experience and opens new possibilities for Decentralized App (DApp) developers.</p><p>And with the recent implementation of on-chain issuer in the protocol, it's also possible to decouple on-chain data from the user's Ethereum address, and prove (on-chain and off-chain) for example that his balance is over some threshold without revealing the address and exact amount.</p><p>Your website also states that "Polygon ID meets W3C Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier (DID) standards." Why is this important and what business benefits does it deliver?</p><p>This statement signifies our alignment with key industry standards and protocols that relate to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, which is important to us because of:</p>  Interoperability and Compatibility: Conformity to the W3C standards for Verifiable Credentials (VC) and Decentralized Identifiers (DID) means that Polygon ID aims to work seamlessly with other platforms and systems that also adhere to these standards. It simplifies integration with existing tools and solutions on the market, increasing its utility and versatility.  Trust and Security: W3C VC and DID standards are designed to provide a secure and trustable way of handling identity and credentials in a decentralized and privacy-preserving manner. By aligning with these standards, Polygon ID can assure its users that their identity and credentials are handled in a secure and privacy-conscious way. This can be especially important in applications involving sensitive personal or financial data, such as in the finance and healthcare sectors.  Future-proofing : Many identity solutions, especially in the Web3 space, develop their own incompatible ways of representing identifiers and credentials. Being an early adopter and promoter of standards, combined with our novel privacy-preserving method to prove statements and do selective disclosure based on ZKPs, can give Polygon ID a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving decentralized identity space. It demonstrates our commitment to innovation and a future-proof approach to technology development. This can be appealing to both developers and businesses looking for long-term, stable solutions.  <p>Consequently, this positions us for greater adoption and brings us closer to fulfilling our vision of empowering individuals and giving them back control over their identities and personal data.</p><p>How does being a member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation help Polygon ID align to the W3C standards and related DIF specifications?&nbsp;</p><p>Through our membership in the DIF, the Polygon ID team can interact with various industry working groups that are very relevant to us:</p>  DIDComm: Our protocol utilizes a subset of DIDComm called iden3comm that was developed specifically for Iden3 / Polygon ID. In this working group we can contribute this technology and align with other members interested in DIDComm.  Claims and Credentials Working Group: allows the alignment of credentials and schema standards including “basic identity credentials” that we are currently creating with our Polygon ID Common Schemas initiative.

<p>This article was originally published as an advance reading for <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/events/#rwot-12-cologne-2023">RWOT12 in Köln, Germany</a> on August 9, 2023. It has been slightly edited for this reprint.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ABSTRACT: Self-sovereign identity represents an innovative new architecture for identity management. But, we must ensure that it avoids the pitfalls of previous identity systems. During World War II, two identity pioneers, the Dutch Jacobus L. Lentz and the French René Carmille, took different approaches toward the collection and recording of personally identifiable data. As a result, 75% of Dutch Jews fell victim to the Holocaust versus 23% of the Jews in France. Our foundational work on self-sovereign identity today could have similar repercussions down the road, so it’s imperative that we design this foundation responsibly with diligence and foresight, especially as the threat of significant regime change toward authoritarian governments looms ever larger across the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a></a></p>

<p>On January 26, 2020, on the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz during World War II, Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands offered a historic apology for how the country had failed its Jewish citizens during that War, which resulted in over 100,000 of them being deported and murdered by the Nazis. He acknowledged that one of the problems was the Netherlands’ civil service, stating: “When state authority became a threat, our public institutions failed in their duty as guardians of justice and security. To be sure, within the government too there was resistance on an individual level. But too many Dutch officials simply did as they were told by the occupying forces.”<a>1</a></p>

<p>A similar acknowledgement had been offered almost 25 years earlier by President Jacques Chirac of France, who stated that “the criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French, by the French state”.<a>2</a> In France, some 76,000 French and foreign Jews were deported by the Nazis, but it was from a larger population that also had a larger demographic of Jewish peoples.</p>

<p>When distilled down to the bare and heartless statistics, the difference between the countries is stark: in the Netherlands, 75% of Jews tragically lost their lives, compared to 23% in France. The difference lies in how each country dealt with identity: what they were willing to record and what they were not. Since regimes inevitably change, since data inevitably changes hands from one person to another, this type of consideration is crucial.</p>

<p>It is especially crucial today because regimes have been changing quickly and drastically across the world and many of the new governments have been raised up through their declarations of intolerance and hatred. The freshest example is ironically in the Netherlands, where Islamophobe and isolationist Geert Wilders’ PVV party won a plurality of votes, giving him the opportunity to become Prime Minister<a>3</a>. He’s promised to ban the Quran, and one shudders to think of what he might do with identity records of Muslims. But, he’s far from alone. Victor Orbán, the authoritarian Prime Minister Hungary, has conducted attacks against the LGBT community<a>4</a>. Marine Le Pen has made increasingly credible runs for French President as the head of the National Front. In the United States, Donald Trump, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and even the Supreme Court have attacked disadvantaged peoples and taken away rights. Many of these ingredients are the same as those seen in World War II, but our data collection has reached new heights, and thus offers even greater dangers.</p>

<p>These harsh lessons remain especially important for the new technologies of digital identity, which have boosted information compilation even beyond that of the physical world. That includes both self-sovereign identity, an ideology to reclaim human dignity and authority in the digital world and an emerging suite of applications designed to enable that movement, and other new digital-identity systems. We must heed the grave lessons of history as we look forward, to ensure that digital identity technology of all types is never used in a similar genocide.</p>

 Impeccable Identity: Lentz’s Tragic Legacy 

<p></p>

<p>The story of identity in the Netherlands during World War II is still writ on the landscape of Amsterdam today, at the National Holocaust Names Monument, where Prime Minister Rutte gave his famous speech in 2020, and a few blocks away at the intersection of Plantage Kerklaan and Plantage Middenlaan, where the municipal building that held the records of the region’s population once lay.</p>

<p>Today, there’s nothing special about the structure that once housed the records building, other than a somber plaque affixed to a wall. It reads, “27 Maart 1943: Vernieling Bevolkingsregister”. March 27, 1943: Destruction of the population register. Therein lies the crux of the story of how the Netherlands recorded too much identity information, and how they made one last attempt to destroy it after the Nazis gained control of the country.</p>

<p>That story begins, as Prime Minister Rutte acknowledged, in the Dutch Civil Service, which the Nazis recognized as “Germanic” in its orderly thoroughness. So much so that they left the cadres of Dutch civil servants alone to run things, with Germanic leadership installed above them. In particular, the story begins with one operational functionary by the name of Jacobus L. Lentz.</p>

<p>In 1932, Lentz was appointed the head of the National Inspectorate of Population Registers in The Netherlands. This was a critical post in the 1930s because of the Great Depression: the Inspectorate ensured that all citizens had equitable access to basic services. Thanks to its efficiency, the small nation fared better than even the greatest European powers during the 1930s, helping to keep its citizens out of the poverty that was blanketing the globe. Looking to ensure that this happy efficiency was maintained and even bettered, the Dutch government tasked Lentz with promoting yet greater order by bringing consistency and uniformity to population registers throughout the country.</p>

<p>Lentz was thus instrumental in what followed. By 1936, a decree required that every resident in the Netherlands must have a personal identity card, one copy to be carried on their person and a duplicate to be filed in the civil archives. These archives also contained a cornucopia of personally identifying information, including gender, race, ethnicity, occupation, residence, familial relations, and religion. They were centralized in a single office in each officially recognized region of the Netherlands, all of which used the same systems so that the data was interoperable, ensuring that Lentz’s data was useful in civil governance and planning.</p>

<p>Lentz meticulously rationalized, standardized, and organized the Netherlands records held in that building at the intersection of Plantage Kerklaan and Plantage Middenlaan. Thanks to him, the comprehensive efficiency of the archives, which even incorporated special filing cabinets of his own patented design aimed at expediting searches and cross-checks, made it possible for the Netherlands to provide amply and justly for its citizens during the depths of the greatest economic crisis in modern world history. This aligned with Lentz’s vision of creating “the paper man.”<a>5</a> His work was recognized at the highest level by a royal award bestowed on him by no less a figure than nation’s queen.</p>

<p>The thoroughness and accessibility of the centralized registries throughout the Netherlands made them high-priority targets for capture by the Nazi invaders following their occupation of the Netherlands in May 1940. The Nazis understood their immense value in accelerating the hunt for Jews and other “undesirables”. Lentz himself was recognized as an especially valuable local asset. No sooner did the Dutch government capitulate than occupation authorities asked him to create a comprehensive national personal identity card that was extremely difficult to alter or forge. For Lentz, this, in fact, had been a pet project for years, one his superiors had consistently resisted as being “un-Dutch.” Now he was being asked to do it! He tackled the project with remarkable enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Soon, Lentz had cards that could be compared against the corresponding files in a central civil registry, which he had redesigned for accessory and access. Even if a card was forged, the registry was thus a backup. By September 1941, these cards and files included a thorough census of Dutch Jews, each of whom now carried a card emblazoned with a large letter J.</p>

<p>On the night of March 27-28, 1943, resistance operatives, some of whose names are incribed on that plaque, disguised themselves as local police officers, and, in a daring operation attempted to burn down the registry and the files it housed. Brilliantly planned and executed though it was, the attack fell short of achieving its objective. To be sure, some 800,000 identity cards fell victim to the flames and flood, but, that destruction only amounted to 15 percent of the registry’s records. It was soon back in business, and the Jewish genocide ramped up.</p>

<p>Lentz was arrested by Netherlands police in May 1945 for his collaboration with the Nazis and eventually sentenced to three years in prison. But it was far too late. This perfection of record keeping, this creation of a “paper man” who could be cross-referenced through a closely held certificate and a central registry, was core to the high rate of murder of the Netherlands’ Jews, which Prime Minister Rutte apologized for on that cold winter day in 2020.</p>

<p>This dark chapter should serve as a stark warning for our work on self-sovereign identity — as should the fact that things can be very different, as evidenced by a similar situation in France with a very different conclusion.</p>

 Subversive Systems: Carmille’s Quiet Resistance 

<p>In France, the story instead begins with René Carmille, an engineer, a World War I officer, and a spy for France’s Deuxième Bureau during the first World War. His own move toward the registration of identity came not because of the Great Depression, but instead the needs of the military.</p>

<p>Carmille’s work was founded on early punch-card technology, something that had also been used in The Netherlands, but was more central to Carmille’s work in France. By 1935, he was developing a registry for the French army that was to be used for conscription and mobilization. Carmille proposed a twelve-digit personal registration number as the core of this registry (which later became 13 digits after the occupation and division of France). This ID could be used to determine a person’s date of birth and place of birth, as well as a “complete personal profile”<a>6</a>, which included details on professional skills and well as other attributes.</p>

<p>By 1940, the Nazis were attempting to produce censuses of the Jews in France, but they were facing notable obstacles. Prime among them was the fact that the government had not polled on the question of religion since 1872 and had no interest in doing so now. There also weren’t sufficient electronic tabulators to catalogue the results from France’s immense population: France instead depended on Remington typewriters or even pen and paper for much of their tabulation.</p>

<p>Enter René Carmille. In November 1940, he created France’s “Demographic Service in Vichy”, opened offices on both sides of the occupation border running down the middle of France, contracted for 36 million Francs worth of tabulating machines, and announced plans for a new census of French citizens. He would replace the “anarchic” methodology that France had previously used to record census data with something more modern; afterward, French citizens would have to carry “uniform identity cards”, which linked to precise details on vocational expertise. Carmille’s new census would also reverse France’s long-standing omission of religious data by including data in “column 11” that would require participating Jews to not only report their own religion, but also that of their grandparents. Like Lentz, Carmille ultimately had his own version of a paper man, saying: “We are no longer dealing with general censuses, but we are really following individuals.”<a>7</a></p>

<p>It appeared to be exactly what the Nazis were seeking.</p>

<p>If Carmille had ever properly tabulated this data, the results likely would have been similar to those in the Netherlands: identity turned to discrimination and ultimately genocide. But, that didn’t happen. Instead, Carmille purposefully programmed his machines to never punch data for column 11 and hid more than 100,000 punched cards of Jews in his office. Call it an early form of data minimization and selective disclosure<a>8</a>. Carmille ensured that the personal data most likely to harm people was not made available to the people most likely to use it for harm.</p>

<p>There is some disagreement about Carmille’s role in the Vichy government and what damage he might have done there. However, the historical data seems to support him continuing to be a counter-intelligence officer, and that he purposefully sabotaged the census of the Jews while simultaneously using his data collection appartus to compile a listing of 800,000 French soldiers ready to rise up against the German occupation, 300,000 of them who were ready for near instaneous mobilization. Which was exactly what happened: on December 5, 1942, French troops captured the French National Statistics Service office in Algiers and used Carmille’s data to mobilize thousands of French troops.</p>

<p>René Carmille was arrested by the Nazis in February 1944, interrogated by a Nazi torturer, and sent to Dachau, where he died in January 1945. Though his work may have saved the lives of tens or even hundreds of thousands of Jews in France, it required sacrifice.</p>

<p>Once we collect identity data, its use is almost inevitable: pushing against that tide is the work of giants.</p>

 Two Models, One Truth 

<p>Self-sovereign identity has a dual nature.</p>

<p>On one hand, there exists a clear need for more defined identity. This was the main focus for self-sovereign identity when it was first discussed at <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/events/#rwot-2-id2020-2016">RWOT2</a> and <a href="https://id2020.org/">ID2020</a> in 2016. Then, one of our primary use cases was the stateless refugee who could be denied access to government services. It echoed (albeit with better foresight) the challenge that Jacobus Lentz faced with migration in the 1930s, when he put together a system to make sure all Dutch could have access to civic support during the Great Depression.</p>

<p>Conversely, there’s a call for minimizing identity data. This asks a crucial question that’s of both historical and ethical importance: What is the minimum identifying data access necessary to give you the right to be able to do things without unduly impinging on your privacy, dignity, and entitlement to respect? It builds on the truth the René Carmille discovered as he purposefully excluded religious information from his census: personal information can be dangerous, damaging, and even deadly.</p>

<p>Often, we share our personal details and other identity, erring on the side of oversharing, grounded in our current trust toward the data collector. The contrasting approaches of Lentz and Carmille demonstrate why that isn’t sufficient: the regime can always change. The intended use of data can be easily misinterpreted or manipulated. Lentz’s Great Depression data could be used by the Nazis to genocide Dutch Jews; and what the Nazis thought was their French Census Data could be used by Carmille to raise an army. And this isn’ just a historic concern: under Trump’s administration, there were similar attempts to repurpose the voluntary registrations of “Dreamers” from the previous administration, threatening residents who illegally entered the country as children with deportation.</p>

<p>Ultimately, data will be used to the fullest extent that it can be and it may be used for the worst purposes possible, entirely at odds with the original purpose of the collection. As architects of the next generation of self-sovereign identity systems, we must prioritize user empowerment, enabling each individual to fully control their identity. We have to think about strategies of data minimization and selective disclosure. We have to consider what data needs to be collected, and what does not. We do not want to make a new paper (electronic) man.</p>

<p>We must instead remember the past when identity was weaponized and six million and more died as a result. But we need to operationalize that remembrance by transforming it from reflection into a vision for the present and the future. Call it remembering forward. Call it foremembrance.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>The time for action is now. The dreams of self-sovereign identity that were first imagined at RWOT2 and ID2020 have been made realities by standards such as DIDs<a>9</a> and Verifiable Credentials<a>10</a>. Numerous companies have emerged to support these standards, while governments are beginning to adopt them. Simultaneously, the European Union is in the process of rolling out eIDAS<a>11</a> as an ecosystem of electronic identity. We are at a tipping point where the standards for future identity will be set in the days, months, and scant years ahead.</p>

<p>At this crossroads, we could go the way of recording too much information. We could create great honeypots of data for use or abuse by future regimes, or even by criminals. By recording our gender, our sexual orientation, our religion, our political affiliation, or even just our favorite books, movies, and songs, we could open ourselves up to future discrimination or worse. This would be the way of Lentz.</p>

<p>But there’s another path, one that normalizes the minimization of information. As self-sovereign identity designers, we must ask if we are protecting our users; we can do so by following <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">the original goals of self-sovereign identity</a>, by allowing the person represented by an identity to decide what information goes out. Simultaneously, we can do our best to influence the design of eIDAS and other more centralized systems to similarly adopt rules of data minimization and selective disclosure. This would be the way of Carmille.</p>

<p>We are a crucial crossroads in the design of digital identity. When the next history books are written, we must be Carmille, not Lentz.</p>

<p>A roundup of the most commonly asked questions on our Discord and Forum. If you have questions for the team please ask them on our <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Forum</a>. </p>  General FAQ <p></p> What is Ceramic? <p>Ceramic is a shared data network for managing verifiable data at scale, providing the trust of a blockchain with the flexibility of an event streaming system. Thousands of developers use it to manage reputation data, store attestations, log user activity, and build novel data infrastructure. Ceramic frees developers from the constraints of traditional data infrastructure, enabling them to tap into a shared data ecosystem and network effects, so they can focus on bringing their unique vision to life. </p> What is ComposeDB <p>ComposeDB, built on Ceramic, is a decentralized graph database that uses GraphQL to offer developers a familiar interface for interacting with data stored on Ceramic. This enables seamless data model publication, discovery, and reuse, fostering a composable data ecosystem.</p> What is the difference between Ceramic and ComposeDB? <p>ComposeDB provides a graph structure for interacting with data on the Ceramic network (i.e. native indexing). The nodes in the graph are ‘accounts’ or ‘documents’, each possessing a globally unique ID, while ‘edges’ are queryable relationships.You can read more about these concepts in our <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/core-concepts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">docs</a>.</p> Why did we choose GraphQL for ComposeDB? <p>We achieve interoperability with a wide ecosystem of existing programing environments by allowing GraphQL queries over JSON documents.</p> What is the difference between Ceramic and The Graph? <p>The Graph is a service indexing and querying data on L1 and L2 blockchains. You do not write data to The Graph, you write data to the blockchain and then query it with The Graph.</p><p>Ceramic is more like a decentralized version of a traditional database (like Postgres or MongoDB). It’s optimized for writes and speed. It provides its own built-in indexing and querying functionality (via ComposeDB).</p><p>The Graph is good for querying large amounts of data from blockchains. Ceramic is good for storing, managing and querying large amounts of data.</p> What makes Ceramic a better choice than alternatives?  What’s the difference between Ceramic and a traditional blockchain? <p>Unlike financial asset blockchains that rely on slow and unscalable synchronous global state changes, Ceramic uses fast, asynchronous, parallel transaction processing and eventual consistency to enable the scale and throughput needed by large data applications. </p><p>Current blockchain protocols cannot scale to support the level of processing needed for data applications, for the simple fact that there are so many data events occurring all day, every day, in every application. That’s why Ceramic’s data consensus properties can be treated differently than value consensus properties, like those you’d find on Bitcoin or an L2. Ceramic supports data that changes (i.e. mutable) with fast, decentralized, high-volume transaction processing.</p> What’s the difference between using Ceramic to store and query data and storing the data on the blockchain? <p>Ceramic shares many similarities with a blockchain, while simultaneously offering features that optimize for low-cost mutable data at scale, thus underlining key differences. Below are some similarities and differences:</p><p>Accounts: Ceramic uses the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/dids/introduction?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Decentralized Identifier</a> standard for user accounts (DID PKH and Key DID are supported in production). Similar to blockchains, they require no centralized party or registry. Additionally, both PKH DIDs and Key DIDs ultimately rely on public key infrastructure (PKH DIDs enable blockchain accounts to sign, authorize, and authenticate transactions, while Key DIDs expand cryptographic public keys into a DID document).</p><p>Signing Transactions: data in Ceramic (or streams) support <a href="https://chainagnostic.org/CAIPs/caip-74?ref=blog.ceramic.network">CACAO</a> (Chain Agnostic Capability Object), which enables the ability for one account to authorize another account to construct signatures over limited data on their behalf. Therefore, unlike manually signing individual transactions on a blockchain, Ceramic allows accounts to cryptographically authorize multiple writes in a given window, which is ideal for settings in which a database would be used to support user data that’s meant to change over time. These transactions also occur at no cost to individual users, which is yet another key difference between writing data to Ceramic vs. a blockchain.</p><p>Immutability: streams in Ceramic are organized into immutable event logs, with each commit representing an unchangeable, tamper-evident snapshot of a piece of data. Similar to how blockchains act as an immutable ledger revealing a history of the deterministic outputs of accounts transacting with other accounts and smart contracts, event logs in Ceramic give developers insight into both the immutable <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/data-provenance-composedb-as-an-authenticated-database/">data provenance</a> and lineage of data relevant to their users.</p><p>Querying: while developers can leverage libraries like <a href="https://web3js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web3.js</a> to read past transaction history or actively listen to transactions across accounts and contracts, blockchains (like Ethereum) do not offer native network support for querying or indexing blockchain data. This should come as no surprise - they are not designed to do this.Conversely, Ceramic is specifically designed to provide simple structure and open access to data events as they occur in the network, while simultaneously offering credibly decentralized qualities. </p><p>Ceramic’s underlying data structure (a self-certifying event log) also allows for endless database “flavors” to be built on top to further improve the developer experience. ComposeDB, for example, offers native GraphQL support, automatically splits read/write load capability, and allows developers to index on data “families” (or model instance documents related to preexisting schema definitions) across the network.</p> How much does it cost to use Ceramic Network? <p>At the moment, the only costs associated with building on Ceramic are the costs of running a Ceramic node on the cloud provider of your choice. The protocol doesn’t charge a direct fee nor are there any ecxplicit costs to store and load data from the network. This fee structure is subject to change as the Ceramic community may decide to support crypto-economic incentives and rewards.</p> Which blockchains does Ceramic support? <p>The standard use of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/122?ref=blog.ceramic.network">SIWX</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">CACAO</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DID:PKH</a>&nbsp;allows anyone to implement support for another blockchain or account type to authenticate and authorize writes to the Ceramic Network. Additionally a few standard interfaces enables you to implement an auth and verification library that allows anyone to use it with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did/tree/main/packages/did-session?ref=blog.ceramic.network"><code>did-session</code></a>, the primary library to use DID based accounts with Ceramic. There is just a few steps you have to take, outlined <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/dids/guides/add-chain-support?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p> Does Ceramic have a native token? <p>Ceramic does not have a native token.</p>  Technical FAQ <p></p> Do I have to run a node if I want to use ComposeDB? <p>It depends on your use case. If you just want to play around to learn and understand ComposeDB, it is not necessary to run a node. You can use our <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/sandbox?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Sandbox</a> or Wheel (which can run in memory). For development purposes, you can either use a third party node operator, such as <a href="http://hirenodes.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">hirenodes.io</a>, or run your own node (follow our guide <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/nodes?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>).</p> Is running a node a public, permission-less thing or does one need to sign up for it? <p>Running a node is permissionless! However, to anchor commits to mainnet, it is necessary to register your node’s DID with the Ceramic Anchor Service.</p> What are the benefits to running a node? <p>You have control over performance and costs of your own data without relying on others.</p> What operating system do I need to run a Ceramic node? <p>Currently, Ceramic nodes use Node.js, so any system that can run Node.js may be used. Ceramic nodes are most often run on Linux servers but have also been run on MacOS.To run on Windows we recommend using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux).</p> Is there an official RPC that can be used directly for Ceramic? <p>When used in a Web3 context, an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) node consists of a server that generally runs a protocol’s client software. An RPC endpoint is the network location that an application can access to perform requests (for example, dApp retrieving blockchain data for its users).The Ceramic Network does not currently offer hosted RPC node-running (and corresponding community endpoints) as a service. Instead, for both decentralization and performance purposes, we encourage developers to either <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-server/running-in-the-cloud?ref=blog.ceramic.network">run their own node</a> or work with a node-running service (such as <a href="https://hirenodes.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Hirenodes</a>) to set up performant and available endpoints for their applications.</p> What is a DID? <p>DID stands for Decentralized Identifier which is a W3 standard. Whenever a document is updated, it is signed by the user's DID, so that the ownership and provenance of all writes is verifiable.</p> What’s the “admin DID” for? <p>It’s the identity required on the “server” side of the ComposeDB to set up a composite for your node, which instructs your node which Models it should index. You can write data into your Ceramic node with any DID, but the admin DID is the only one able to change the set of Models used by the node.</p> What’s the difference between the “node DID” and the “admin DID”? <p>The Node DID is used for anchoring and the Admin DID is used to deploy composites.</p> Can I use an Ethereum address as a DID? <p>Yes you can! You can use Ethereum as well as Solana addresses via the <code>did:pkh</code> DID method. Check this <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/dids/authorization?ref=blog.ceramic.network">link</a> for details.</p> How do you run queries on ComposeDB? <p>ComposeDB is a graph database because the documents within it can reference other documents and form a graph, using GraphQL to query that relationship graph. You should reference supported <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/api/sdl/scalars?ref=blog.ceramic.network">scalars</a>.</p> Who can modify the data? <p>Each document in ComposeDB is represented by a Ceramic stream that has a single DID that is the controller. The controller DID is the only one allowed to write data into that stream and updates to the stream must be signed by the controller DID’s private key.</p> Is the data on Ceramic Network public or private? <p>All the data on Ceramic (including ComposeDB) is public by default. One can encrypt the data before putting it onto the network. You can follow the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/tutorial-encrypted-data-on-composedb/">Encrypted Data Tutorial</a> tutorial for one possible method and you can also utilize the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/lit-protocol-and-ceramic-integration-tutorial-storing-encrypted-data-on-composedb/">integration between Ceramic and Lit protocol</a>.</p> Can data be deleted on Ceramic Network? <p>All data written to Ceramic are signed payloads that are organized in the core data structure (a self-certifying event log) that the protocol relies on. </p><p>This structure relies on <a href="https://ipld.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">IPLD</a> content addressing to form an immutable log (on top of which applications, or databases like ComposeDB, can be built). Ceramic nodes also encompass several layers of the <a href="https://libp2p.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">libp2p</a> stack to help communicate stream updates in the network.</p><p>It’s important to understand how the services described above play an important role in answering the question of whether data on Ceramic can be deleted. While developers can pin streams on their node to prevent Ceramic’s default garbage collection behavior (and unpin, or discontinue indexing on models if using ComposeDB), data in its raw format may still be accessible within the IPFS network (though, if not pinned by any Ceramic nodes, it will effectively be “deleted” from the Ceramic network).</p> Do I need my private key to create a composite on ComposeDB? <p>Yes! While creating a composite, you sign some bytes with your private key. The signature becomes part of the composite. Don’t worry, private keys are not leaked through composites. We encourage making composites public.</p> Can you transfer the ownership of a stream on Ceramic Network? <p>Ceramic uses a DID as the controller of the stream. This means that if you use a DID that can be transferred you can transfer ownership by transferring the DID. Most of the time you will not need to transfer ownership, but rather sign a CACAO to grant some device or service the capabilities that you wish to delegate.</p> How can I incorporate ComposeDB into my dApp? <p>We have a starter application <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/launching-create-ceramic-app/">here</a>.</p> What is a CACAO? <p><a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/74?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Chain Agnostic Capability Object</a></p>  Company FAQ <p></p> What is the relationship between 3Box Labs and Ceramic? <p>While 3Box Labs is the original inventor of the Ceramic Network and have been integral to bootstrapping the Ceramic ecosystem, we're committed to migrating Ceramic to an independently-governed foundation and stepping back to play a reduced role over time. In a way, 3Box Labs is just like any other contributor to an early stage protocol.</p> What is the corporate structure of 3Box Labs? <p>3Box Labs is a US corporation registered in Delaware with employees and contractors located across the US and Europe.</p> How will Ceramic be governed? <p>Ceramic is already 100% open source, peer-to-peer software and anyone can participate in the network by simply running a Ceramic node. Formal governance of the network will progressively decentralize over time, eventually exiting to the community and a standalone foundation.</p>  💡  Have a question that’s not here?

<p>Canada’s trusted digital ID leader, the DIACC, releases its Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) Trust Registries Final Recommendation V1.0, signalling it’s ready for inclusion in their <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/">Certification Program</a>.</p>



<p>Why is the PCTF Trust Registries component important?</p>



<p>A Trust Registry is a critical component of the new and emerging decentralized digital identity architecture, playing a crucial role in establishing and maintaining trust in digital identity ecosystems, especially regarding identity verification and authentication. The Trust Registries component provides conformance criteria for the development and certification of Governance Requirements (business structure, ecosystem scope, governance processes, policies, and standards), Trust Registry Operations (technology &amp; infrastructure management and technical services), and Registration and Certification Management (certification/verification/trustmark services, registration, suspension, and revocation processes), to ensure that a Trust Registry is, in fact, trustworthy.</p>



<p>What problems does the PCTF Trust Registries component solve?</p>



<p>Digital identity ecosystems and their associated Trust Registries use a Trust Framework (such as the PCTF) to define how ecosystem actors like Issuers, Verifiers, Holders, and Digital Wallets should or must operate to be considered trustworthy. As an essential requirement in the decentralized identity architecture, with its interconnection with many Holders, Digital Wallets, Issuers, Verifiers, and other Trust Registries, ecosystems must strive for interoperability (locally, regionally, and internationally). Adherence to standards and frameworks must be a prioritized goal for ecosystem governance organizations, which is reflected in many of the criteria of the Trust Registries component.</p>



<p>Who does the PCTF Trust Registries component help?</p>



<p>The PCTF Trust Registries component is a valuable resource for entities to use as guidance to develop their Trust Registries. Entities with Trust Registries currently in use can leverage the conformance criteria as a risk management tool to ensure their registry is as robust as possible. Having an organization’s Trust Registry certified through DIACC’s <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/">Voila Verified Certification Program</a> sends a clear market signal that the certified Trust Registry is reliable, secure, and can be used confidently.</p>

<p>The importance of trust in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to dominate the headlines — whether it’s the challenges of managing intellectual property or the tendency of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to produce errors or “hallucinations.” Only a few days ago we saw Elon Musk enter this field with xAI’s Grok and in an interview with Lex Fridman he highlighted the importance of receiving responses you can trust when interacting with AI&nbsp;products</p><p>“…it (LLM) unfortunately hallucinates most when you least want it to hallucinate. When you’re asking the important and difficult questions that’s where it tends to be confidently wrong. So we’re really trying hard to say how do we be as grounded as possible so you can count on the results?”</p><p>The truth, however, is an elusive concept, especially if attempted to be captured by a single organization/product. A better approach is through connectivity and transparency achieved by leveraging multiple open source technologies. Turing Award winner Dr. Bob Metcalfe explained this idea,&nbsp;saying,</p><p>“… through connectivity, decentralized knowledge graphs, blockchains and AI are converging — and it’s an important convergence, because it is going to help us with one of the biggest problems we have nowadays, which is the&nbsp;truth.”</p><p>OriginTrail has been, since inception, committed to fighting one of truth’s greatest arch-nemesis — misinformation. It continues on this mission in the age of AI, where the misinformation problem is growing exponentially. The growing challenges, however, also offer a growing field of opportunities, which are being unlocked with OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) used as foundation for verifiable web.</p><p>The key building blocks of the verifiable web have become available with the V6 of the OriginTrail DKG which enabled some of the most notable achievements of the Turing phase which were showcased on the Decentralized Knowledge Graph conference (DKGcon) in early October and which to date produced around two million AI-ready Knowledge Assets.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ekG1Bl-tCjc?si=Vu_nPLJ7MfdpPl4f&amp;t=622">DKGcon - Decentralized Knowledge Graph Conference</a></p><p>The Turing phase achievements also showed how the OriginTrail DKG acts as an enabler, rather than a competitor to the AI systems created by Microsoft, Google and xAI. Through the ChatDKG framework initiative we have seen the first version of <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/af4b5a7a-040b-47d2-9ac6-cf073967c51a">Microsoft Copilot</a>, integrations with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLofzKfAOLY">GoogleAI</a> and xAI enablement already being researched as a part of the Metcalfe&nbsp;phase.</p>Enabler, not a competitor of the likes of Microsoft, Google,&nbsp;xAI. Metcalfe phase — growing knowledge by a&nbsp;100.000x <p><a href="https://youtube.com/live/8kw7Y3PauHI?feature=share">Metcalfe phase - fighting misinformation with decentralized AI</a></p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/ecosystem/roadmap">The Metcalfe phase of the updated roadmap</a> pursues an ambitious goal of creating the world’s largest verifiable web for AI consisting of 100 billion Knowledge Assets, bringing a 100.000x scalability increase. As the name of the phase suggests, it will seek to produce network effects across the OriginTrail DKG and use novel techniques to pursue autonomous DKG growth based on the genesis knowledge foundation being created by <a href="https://origintrail.io/ecosystem/landscape">organizations and individuals alike.</a> The genesis part of the Metcalfe’s phase also introduces knowledge mining and knowledge signaling capabilities to drive constant growth of the Verifiable Web.</p><p>Following the Genesis stage and the transition to an AI-native V8, further capabilities will become available in the Convergence stage. By leveraging the advancements in AI and the DKG, we will unlock autonomous knowledge mining which in turn leads to an autonomous DKG. At that stage, new knowledge gets added to the DKG with very limited human involvement. Services such as AI agents will be performing knowledge inferencing directly on the DKG to find any “blind spots” in the knowledge they can fill as well as search for new knowledge and bring it to the DKG in accordance with knowledge signaling.</p> First steps into the Metcalfe phase start&nbsp;today <p>The Metcalfe phase activities are already on the way and today, two important updates become available in their beta versions:</p>  <a href="https://world.origintrail.io/">OriginTrail World</a> — the first version of the platform that will combine all relevant knowledge about OriginTrail technology and how to use it, including integration guidelines with other products on the&nbsp;market.  <a href="https://twitter.com/ChatDKG">ChatDKG on X</a> — the beta version of ChatDKG running on X platform that you can use to prompt and receive responses based on the knowledge that is available in the DKG. The first version is currently ring-fenced on knowledge available in the OriginTrail World platform, and the demo dataset of the chatAnalyst.ai product covering Tesla’s SEC filings and quarterly reports. ChatDKG on X starts by supporting 100 prompts daily and also comes with a possibility to subscribe for the first version of Knowledge Mining — all the details are available directly on the ChatDKG&nbsp;links.  <p>Go ahead, tweet a question and tag @ChatDKG on X to test it&nbsp;out.</p>This is just the beginning of the exciting journey.

<p>Initial considerations for an electronic patient record (EPR) began around 2005, and the <a href="https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/de/home/gesetze-und-bewilligungen/gesetzgebung/gesetzgebung-mensch-gesundheit/gesetzgebung-elektronisches-patientendossier.html">Federal Act on the Electronic Patient Record</a> (EPDG in German) entered into force on April 15, 2023. Often criticized as «PDF graveyard», in mid-2023 the EPR only holds around 20,000 records, or 2 permille of the population, for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>To improve this unsatisfactory situation, the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) conducted a <a href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/de/consultation-procedures/ended/2023#https://fedlex.data.admin.ch/eli/dl/proj/2022/97/cons_1">consultation</a> on a comprehensive revision of the EPDG from June to October 2023. Due to the political processes, an update of the EPDG is not expected until 2028 at the earliest.</p>
<p>Alongside many other organizations, DIDAS also submitted a statement as part of this consultation, the most important points of which are listed below:</p>
 
 Person centric in order to grant every citizen access to her or his complete health data 
 Technology neutrality in order to take into account future wallet-based solutions 
 Openness and standards to ensure the highest possible level of interoperability 
 Immediate measures to generate benefits before 2028

<p>In a byline, FIDO Alliance executive director Andrew Shikiar discusses the recent cyberattacks on MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment which showcased the widespread effects data breaches can have on an organization. These attacks, as well as so many other high-profile breaches over the past few years, happened because of continued reliance on legacy sign-in credentials like passwords and SMS one-time passcodes that can be easily given away and reused.</p>

<p>I was listening to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/actors-strike-ends-openais-big-moves-and-guest-mattie-kahn/id1073226719?i=1000634368519">the latest</a> <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=%22Pivot+podcast%22">Pivot Podcast</a> when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Swisher">Kara Swisher</a>&nbsp;played a clip from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman">Sam Altman</a>‘s keynote at OpenAI’s <a href="https://devday.openai.com/">Developers Day</a>, earlier this week. Spake Sam (at the 35:18 mark),</p>
<p>We believe that AI will be about individual empowerment and agency on a scale we’ve never seen before</p>
<p>Whoa!&nbsp;That’s what we’ve been working toward here at ProjectVRM since 2006.</p>
<p>Shall we call it IEASWNSB? (Pronounced “Eewasnib,” perhaps?) We might have better luck with that than we’ve had with VRM, Me2B, and other initialisms and acronyms.</p>
<p>For fun, I asked <a href="https://www.bing.com/create?">Bing Image Create</a>, which uses OpenAI’s DALL-E to produce images, to make art with its boss’s words. It gave me the images above. <a href="https://www.bing.com/images/create/individual-empowerment-and-agency-on-a-scale-we27ve/654ffe8b1f794fb8b5819f691333d40e?FORM=GUH2CR">Here’s the link</a>.</p>
<p>Those are a little too Ayn Randy for me. So I tried just “Empowered individuals,” and got <a href="https://www.bing.com/images/create/individual-empowerment-and-agency-on-a-scale-we27ve/654ffe8b1f794fb8b5819f691333d40e?FORM=GUH2CR">this</a>—</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bing.com/images/create/individual-empowerment-and-agency-on-a-scale-we27ve/654ffe8b1f794fb8b5819f691333d40e?FORM=GUH2CR"></a></p>
<p>—which is almost the ulta-woke opposite of the first one.</p>
<p>But never mind that. Let’s talk about individual empowerment with AI help. Here’s my personal punch list:</p>
 
 Health. Make sense of all my health data. Suck it in from every medical care provider I’ve ever had, and help me make decisions based on it. Also help me share it on an as-needed basis with my current providers. 
 Finances. Pull in and help me make sense of my holdings, obligations, recurring payments, incomes, whatever. Match my orders and shipments from Amazon and other retailers with the cryptic entries (always in ALL CAPS) on my credit card bills. I want to run every receipt I collect through a scanner that does OCR for my AI, which will know what receipt is for what, where it goes in the books it helps me keep, and yearly helps me work through my taxes. The list can go on. 
 Property. What have I got? I want to point my phone camera at everything that a good AI can recognize, and make sense of all that too. Know all the books on my shelves by reading their spines. Know my furniture, the stuff in my basement. Help me keep records of my car’s history after I give it the VIN number I photographed under the windshield, and run all the records I’ve kept in the glove box through the same scanner I mentioned above. Whatever. Why not? 
 Correspondence. I have half a million emails here, going back to 1995. (Wish it went back farther.) Lots of texts too, in lots of systems. Help me do a better job of looking back through those than my various clients do. Help me cross-reference those with events I attended and other stuff that may be relevant to some current inquiry. 
 Contacts. Who do I have in my various directories? How many entries are wrong in one way or another? Go through and correct them, AI helper, based on whatever clever new algorithm works for that. 
 Calendar. Tell me where I was on a given day, what I was doing, and who I was with. Knowing all that other personal data (above) will help too. 
 Business relationships. Look into all my subscriptions and help me <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2021/05/25/solving-subscriptions/">fight the fuckery</a> behind nearly all of them. Make better sense of all the loyalty programs I’m involved with, and help me unfuck those too since most of them are about entrapment rather than real loyalty. 
 Other involvements. What associations do I belong to? How deeply am I involved with any or all of them? Can we drop some? Add some? Have some insights into how those are going, or should go? 
 Travel. I have 1.6 million miles with United Airlines alone. Where did I go? When? Why? What did I pay? Are there ways to improve my relationships with airlines and other entities (e.g. car rental agencies, Uber/Lyft, Airbnb, cruise lines)? 
 Shopping. We’ve been talking (and working toward) <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Intentcasting">intentcasting</a> it seems forever, but mostly since the late aughts. Now with AI, it’s easy to imagine countless possibilities that begin with one’s intent to buy rather than retailers’ intent to sell. Words to wise sellers: A) Make it as easy as possible for customers’ personal and privacy-guarding AI agents to find what you’ve got and know as much about it as possible, and B) Fire every marketer and marketing system that wants in any ways to trap, milk, coerce, and otherwise fuck over customers. Meanwhile, customers should have AI capacities that keep them from getting screwed, to know when the screwing happens, and to help do something about it. 
 
<p>Our lives are packed with too much data for our meat brains alone to fully comprehend and put to use. AI is good for that. So bring it on.</p>
<p>And don’t bet that any of the bigs, including OpenAI, to give you anything on the punch list above*. They’re too big, too centralized, too stuck in a mainframe paradigm. They look for what only they can do for you, rather than what you can do for yourself—or do better with your own damn AI.</p>
<p>Personal AI today is where personal computing was fifty years ago. We don’t yet have the Apple II, the Osborne, the TRS-80, the Commodore PET, much less the IBM&nbsp; PC or the Macintosh. We just have big companies with big everything,&nbsp; with hooks for developers. And soon an app store (also announced in Sam Altman’s keynote).</p>
<p>Real personal AI is a huge greenfield. Going there is also, to switch metaphors, a blue ocean strategy. <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2020/10/26/blue/">Wrote about that here</a>.</p>
 
<p>*Except by pouring all that data into their LLM. Not yours.</p>
