 Value, maturity, influence, and the ORE CoP birthday&nbsp;survey Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for Educators Co-op<p>We’ve written a lot about how to develop healthy communities, but what we’ve not explicitly written about in this context is the overlap between “education” and “work”. CoPs provide an excellent way to continue life-long learning, network with other professionals who are interested in a topic and create change in areas we strive to improve. All of these benefits are only possible, though, if you have a healthy, sustainable community.</p><p>We’re pleased that the Open Recognition is for Everybody community continues to grow. Not only do new people pop into the CoP, members are developing real relationships with one another. In this post, we’ll share some outputs from our annual birthday survey and show how trust and connection are keystones to a&nbsp;CoP.</p> Data <p>To measure the health of a community we can look at raw numbers, such as the number of new members that have joined in a specified time period. With over 430 people in the ORE community, it’s grown 27% over the past&nbsp;year.</p><p>But that doesn’t tell the whole picture, which is why it’s important to use structured surveys to discover other data, including sentiment. Last year, we <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-to-gather-data-on-a-community-of-practice-881af2846d0d">showed you how</a> to gather data on a CoP using an approach from McMillan and Chavis’s 1986 paper ‘Sense of community: A definition and&nbsp;theory’.</p><p>This time, we again madesure that we not only asked the same questions, but included a box for free-text entry so people could give us unfiltered feedback. We’re sharing some of the positive results from the survey. It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows, but the forecast is&nbsp;healthy.</p><p>Trust within a community is crucial for collective success and in itself a form of growth. The more people trust each other, the easier it is to move together towards a collective vision. High scores on our 4-point scale, which intentionally lacks a neutral middle option, indicate strong trust&nbsp;levels.</p> That’s all very well in practice, but what about in&nbsp;theory? <p>Last week, we shared <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">short recap videos of Community Conversations</a>, a three-part workshop series about making the most of your Community of Practice&nbsp;(CoP).</p><p>In this post, instead of walking you through the methodologies and metrics, we’re simply going to share a few highlights from the results of the ORE birthday survey, linking it to what we covered in Community Conversations.</p> Value <p>Value cycles in relation to CoPs refer to the different stages of value creation that occur as members of a CoP interact, share knowledge, and learn from each other. These cycles help to assess and understand the value generated by learning in social contexts.</p><blockquote>“I appreciate opportunities to connect with peers, regardless of differences in geographical location and time zones.” (survey participant)</blockquote><p>One of the key things that members of the ORE community value is connection, a feeling of going deeper than the ‘Immediate value’ of Cycle 1 and gaining fulfilment from being able to apply what’s learned in the community to their own work (Cycle&nbsp;3).</p><p>‘Vibes’ are not something easy to measure, but they are important for any kind of CoP, including the ORE community. Thinking about the different kinds of value that communities can generate was the focus of our first <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">Community Conversations workshop</a>.</p> Maturity <p>The work we have done around maturity models is all about navigating your community through its growth stages. We’ve been heavily influenced by the work of Emily Webber, Bailey Richardson, Kevin Huynh &amp; Kai Elmer&nbsp;Sotto.</p><blockquote>“This community is emergent and resilient. I feel we have been coming out of the closet in the last year and building momentum like never before… signals are that we might be reaching the inflection point of the exponential curve.” (survey participant)</blockquote><p>There are ups and downs in the life of any online community, but the idea is that community members feel like they are part of something that is evolving, and that they feel a connection to&nbsp;others.</p><p>Again, ‘connection’ is a difficult thing to measure, but asking how important the community is to members is a good way of trying to figure this out. The second <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">Community Conversations </a>workshop explored <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/towards-a-maturity-model-for-online-networked-communities-v0-1-7c78c2bee8d5">maturity models</a> to help your CoP move in the right direction.</p> Influence <p>Ultimately, the reason people become members of CoPs is to make a difference. They want to improve their own practice, but also make a difference and impact on the world. By being part of an online community, individual members have the ability to influence things which they may not be able to do&nbsp;alone.</p><blockquote>“I feel belonging to this community more than any other I inhabit professionally. In fact, this community has been the constant while my professional affiliation has changed a few times…” (survey participant)</blockquote><p>One way in which influence happens is for one community to influence another. In the case of the ORE community, there is a reasonably high confidence that what we are advocating for (Open Recognition! Open Badges!) is something that is having a wider&nbsp;impact.</p><p>In the third <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">Community Conversations workshop</a> we discussed communities as change agents, introducing the <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-73529560caa3">two loops model</a> and our work around systems convening. The latter is based on the work of Etienne and Beverly Wenger-Trayner.</p> Conclusion <p>We’ve selected some of the results from our survey to illustrate points relating to our series of Community Conversations workshops. We’ve work to do in the ORE community, for example, in helping people have more agency and giving more and different ways for members to meet up in synchronous ways.</p><p>What we do know, based on the work we’ve done (and shared!) around value cycles, maturity models, and influence, is that the ORE community is on the right&nbsp;track.</p><p>If you’d like to join the community, check out <a href="https://badges.community">badges.community</a>.

    Stellar Lumens (XLM) 



<p>Speculation in the cryptocurrency market is nothing new, and the Stellar network with its native currency, Lumens (XLM), has not been immune to it. A recent topic of interest among investors and enthusiasts is the potential for XLM to be backed by silver. This notion stirs up discussions about stability and intrinsic value, aligning digital assets with traditional precious metals.</p>



<p>However, as of now, Stellar Lumens is not backed by silver or any other physical commodity. It remains a decentralized protocol aimed at facilitating cross-border transactions. The speculation around XLM being backed by silver is purely hypothetical and not grounded in any announced plans or developments by the Stellar Development Foundation.</p>



<p>For investors, it’s important to differentiate between actual plans and rumors or wishful thinking. While the idea of backing a cryptocurrency with a tangible asset like silver is intriguing, it would represent a significant shift from the current operation and philosophy of the Stellar network. Such a move would aim to bring the perceived stability and historical reliability of silver to the digital currency space.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while the concept is thought-provoking, it’s essential to approach such speculation with caution. Investors should base their decisions on verified information and understand the speculative nature of discussions about silver backing for XLM or any other cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Stellar Lumens (XLM), the native digital asset of the Stellar network, has a rich history and a substantial presence in the cryptocurrency market. Created in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, along with former lawyer Joyce Kim, Stellar Lumens was envisioned as a decentralized protocol for fast and low-cost cross-border monetary transactions.</p>



<p>Initially, Stellar had 100 billion lumens, but the supply limit has since been reduced to 50 billion lumens, aligning with a focus on managing inflation and maintaining the asset’s value. The Stellar Development Foundation, which supports the Stellar network, has implemented significant upgrades over the years, including a new consensus algorithm in 2015, designed by Stanford professor David Mazières.</p>



<p>The Stellar network has expanded its reach through various partnerships and projects, such as the launch of Lightyear.io, a commercial entity of Stellar in 2017, and later Interstellar, which resulted from Lightyear’s acquisition of Chain, Inc. in 2018. In 2021, Franklin Templeton used Stellar to launch the first “tokenised” US mutual fund, marking a significant milestone in the adoption of blockchain technology in traditional finance.</p>



<p>While the notion of XLM being backed by silver remains speculative, the currency’s actual history, market capitalization, and strategic partnerships highlight its role as a dynamic player in the digital currency space.</p>

<p><a href="https://masca.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Masca</a> is an open-source, decentralized identity wallet that lets you manage your off-chain identifiers and attestations. It is a <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">MetaMask Snap</a> plugin for MetaMask that extends its base functionalities for decentralized identifiers (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DIDs</a>) and verifiable credentials (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">VCs</a>)—turning MetaMask into an identity hub.</p><p>Masca is developed by <a href="https://github.com/blockchain-lab-um?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Blockchain Lab:UM</a>, an R&amp;D laboratory specializing in blockchain technology, decentralized identity, and decentralized artificial intelligence.</p><p>Ceramic, as one of the supported storage solutions in Masca, plays a crucial role in enabling users to store their data, have it available on different devices, and will serve as a foundation for data interoperability with other projects in the future.</p> Decentralized Identity and Data Management With Masca <p>As decentralized applications (dApps) and other decentralized solutions become more complex and personalized for users, there is a growing need to manage user identity and associated data. Given that the amount of data is expected to grow exponentially, off-chain solutions are essential to handle this vast amount in a scalable, efficient, and inexpensive way.</p><p>For quite some time, MetaMask has been working on a feature called MetaMask Snaps—a system that enables extended functionalities of the base MetaMask with Snaps. Snaps are JavaScript programs, each running in its own isolated execution environment inside MetaMask, and can run arbitrary logic, thus significantly extending the functionality of MetaMask.</p> How Does Masca Work? <p>Masca is a MetaMask Snap that provides a straightforward way for users to manage their identity, data and attestations. At the same time, Masca also offers dApp developers a simple-to-use interface to integrate decentralized identity functionalities into their applications. There are (almost) endless attestation types, but some examples are conference attendance, government, KYC, education, and various gaming credentials.</p><p>The decentralized identity space is still in a somewhat early stage, various solutions and protocols are being developed and tested. Masca offers flexibility with multiple integrations for developers to choose what suits their use cases and needs. Masca supports multiple DID methods (did:pkh, did:ethr, did:key, did:jwk, did:polygonid, etc.) and cryptographically-signed data formats (JWT, JSON-LD, EIP712). Some of the integrated projects include <a href="https://ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a>, <a href="https://polygon.technology/polygon-id?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Polygon ID</a>, and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Home?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EBSI</a>.</p><p>Masca uses Veramo Client for DID management, as well as for the creation, presentation, and validation of Verifiable Credentials. In alignment with Masca’s mission, the snap also offers flexibility around data storage, allowing users to toggle between the local MetaMask Snap state (which exists fully off-chain and exclusively in the user’s browser), as well as storage on the Ceramic Network.</p><p>Masca was successfully rolled out during the Open Beta release of MetaMask Snaps in September 2023. For more information, you can visit this <a href="https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-snaps-our-first-step-on-the-road-to-becoming-fully-permissionless/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">link</a> and the <a href="https://snaps.metamask.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Snaps directory</a>.</p> What issues did Masca face before using Ceramic? <p>In the beginning, users could only store their data locally, which meant directly in their MetaMask wallet in the encrypted storage. But that presents a problem when switching to different devices (using the same seed phrase), because the data is unavailable and not synchronized. It also was not possible if users want to share their data in a structured and composable way, which is why Masca chose to build on and integrate Ceramic.</p><blockquote>“Ceramic Network is a data ledger that builds on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and creates an abstraction layer that makes it much more suitable for endless use cases, one of them being data vaults for identity data.”- Masca team</blockquote> Why Masca Chose Ceramic <p>Ceramic offers a scalable network for data, builds on top of the same primitives as Masca (DIDs), and provides developer-friendly tools for development. Structuring the otherwise unstructured data into data streams, controlled by user accounts, creates a powerful solution for managing identity data.</p><p>Ceramic also has a <a href="https://www.notion.so/a3a7a58f81544d33ad3feb84368775d4?pvs=21&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">broad ecosystem of projects</a> working on diverse challenges and problems. By being part of this ecosystem, the Masca team says it aims to connect with other projects in the identity space and work together to tackle those challenges, such as conforming to the same data models and making data truly composable across different applications. Building more rich and complex decentralized identities can also help solve the challenges with reputation and Sybil attacks in the future.</p> How Masca Uses Ceramic <p>Masca is now live on Ceramic Mainnet! Ceramic is currently used in the Masca ecosystem for two primary purposes:</p>  Verifiable Credential Storage: Since VCs are off-chain attestations, users must store them somewhere. Ceramic offers a scalable way to store attestations.  Schemas: Each VC has a strictly defined structure and data model, which are defined with schemas. Using schemas, VCs of the same type are consistent across different applications.  <p>Users can freely migrate their credentials between Snap-encrypted storage and Ceramic Network as they wish.

<p>The OpenID Foundation board or directors unanimously approved updating the Foundation’s Bylaws by a 75% supermajority vote as required by the Bylaws (Section 9.2 Bylaw Amendments) at the November 16, 2023 board meeting. The new <a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OIDF-Org-Doc-Bylaws-Final-11-16-2023.pdf">Bylaws</a> are effective as of November 16, 2023.</p>
<p>From the founding of the OpenID Foundation, the Foundation has intended to maintain balance between Sustaining and Individual (“Community”) representatives and later Corporate representatives on the board. For many years, The Foundation has had 6-7 Sustaining members at a ratio to 3 Community and 1 Corporate representatives. The Foundation currently has 12 Sustaining members and over 150 Corporate members.</p>
<p>The Executive Committee (EC) and Board recently revisited the topic of balance of board members and agreed to proceed with updating the ratios of Community and Corporate representatives on the board relative to the number of Sustaining members. The EC and Board noted that adding more representatives brings more voices and expertise to the Board, balancing the Sustaining member voices.</p>
<p>A summary of key changes to the Bylaws:</p>
 
 Update Individual representative to Community representative to better reflect the position 
 Add additional Community representatives to the Board in line with the ratio in Byalws, as of December 1st of each year 
 Add an additional Corporate representative to the Board when more than 140 corporate entities are members, as of December 1st of each year 
 Create a minimum number of Board members as 5 people, and a maximum of 38, as per the proposal 
 
<p>All changes to the Bylaws are documented in the <a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Summary-of-Changes-to-Bylaws-Final-11-16-2023.pdf">“Summary of Changes to Bylaws”</a>.</p>
<p>2024 OpenID Foundation election will be updated based on the Bylaws to include:</p>
 
 2 Community representative seats for 2-year terms (1 seat prior) 
 2 Corporate representative seats for 1-year terms (1 seat prior) 
 
<p>The 2024 OpenID Foundation election will kick off on Monday, December 11, 2023 with full details including election schedule published then.</p><p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/oidf-updates-bylaws/">OpenID Foundation Updates Bylaws</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID Foundation</a>.</p>

		<p>Reimagining How Technology Can Transform Your Institution<br>
Hosted in partnership with Kean University, EdgeCon Autumn brought together attendees from around the region to explore how technology can transform their institution and accelerate important initiatives involving cybersecurity, campus networks, cloud strategy, and student support applications. Held on November 2 at Kean University, EdgeCon Autumn provided a panel discussion and a full agenda of breakout sessions allowing participants to dive deeper into a variety of topics. With 93% of attendees rating the event 4-5 stars (with 5 being the top end of the scale), this premier event also provided an opportunity for members of the higher education technology community to connect, share valuable insight, and build relationships with industry leading vendors who support technology transformation across the institution.</p>
	 
 




 
	 
		<p>Balancing Innovation and Risk<br>
To kick off the conference’s exciting day of events, attendees were invited to a panel discussion, Balancing Innovation and Risk Through the Process of Digital Transformation, led by David Sherry, Chief Information Security Officer, Princeton University and Ed Wozencroft, Vice President for Digital Strategy and Chief Information Officer, New Jersey Institute of Technology. This presentation provided college and university leaders with a unique perspective on balancing innovation and risk through an accelerated period of digital transformation.</p>
<p>Especially as technology increasingly integrates with every facet of higher education, many organizations are concerned about compliance, data privacy, and the performance and financial health of their institution. The discussion emphasized ways that leaders across an organization can participate in a cultural shift to take advantage of new tools such as AI, data analytics, and innovative SaaS applications, while responsibly managing institutional risk through strategic planning and collaboration. Participants were able to explore how effective planning and collaboration can mitigate risk and ways to identify areas on their campus where digital transformation can produce positive change.</p>
<p>How to Fail Innovation<br>
In today’s academic landscape, universities expect their Information Technology (IT) Departments to be hubs of innovation. The breakout session, How to Fail Innovation 101, aimed to redefine innovation and highlight its potential within IT departments. Dr. Robert Clougherty, CIO, Drew University, discussed the motivations for innovation, common missteps, and how to develop operational strategies that foster, not stifle, innovation. Exploring how a positive environment for innovation can be beneficial to an entire IT team, Dr. Clougherty delved into various theories of innovation and how to implement these advancements effectively, while also addressing potential pitfalls and challenges.</p>

This interactive session shared best practices in creating and delivering an online course and ideas for creating engaging lectures and using the learning management system and templates.</p>
<p>High Performance Computing<br>
In a world where massive amounts of data are being created and collected every single second, turning that data into insight requires continuous dedication to innovative ways in deciphering large amounts of data and transforming it into wisdom. Breakout session, High Performance Computing – Value Proposition in Research, presented by Paul Attallah, National Account Manager, DataBank, discussed how High Performance Computing (HPC) is the foundation for scientific, industrial, and societal advancements and how this technology will be essential in helping transform data into human advancement and progression.</p>
<p>Starting Your Zero Trust Journey<br>
As cybersecurity challenges continue to grow, the Zero Trust security model has become well established in the industry to help secure organizations and improve cyberthreat defense. John Bruggeman, Consulting CISO, CBTS, led the breakout session, Find Out Where to Start Your Zero Trust Journey, to help answer the question, How do you know where to start your Zero Trust journey? Attendees learned how using a Zero Trust readiness assessment can show an institution what parts of the people, process, and technology triad they already have in place, what gaps exist, and how to create a scalable security model that protects all data, systems, and networks.</p>

<p>How to Fail Innovation 101<br>
In today’s academic landscape, universities expect their Information Technology (IT) Departments to be hubs of innovation. However, the prevalent understanding of ‘innovation’ often leans towards adopting market trends rather than being truly forward-looking. Unfortunately, these ‘innovations’ are often external, sourced from third-party software, rather than emerging from the IT team’s internal processes and practices.</p>
<p>This presentation aims to redefine innovation and highlight its potential within IT departments. We will explore the motivations for innovation, common missteps, and how to develop operational strategies that foster, not stifle, innovation.</p>
<p>A positive environment for innovation can benefit the entire IT team. It encourages employees to develop more effective processes and practices, and empowers IT leadership to create an environment that nurtures innovation or remove existing barriers to it.</p>
<p>We will delve into various theories of innovation, drawing analogies from a range of domains including rainforests, gardens, machines, and even Plato’s Divine Frenzy. The presentation underscores the unique pressures on IT departments to innovate, making a clear distinction between innovation and invention.</p>
<p>Innovation, according to our perspective, isn’t just about creating something new—an act of invention—but about altering product, process, or practice life cycles to enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and advantage. We will provide insights on implementing innovation effectively, while also addressing potential pitfalls and challenges.</p>

<p>Creating a Path for Faculty Success in Online and Hybrid Course Development<br>
When our first Online Teaching Certificate debuted in 2017, it was a five-session series offered in person. Over time, we added a second five-session level two and transitioned to a hybrid, then fully asynchronous experience. Both levels are suitable for both new and experienced professors who want to transition to online teaching or enhance their existing skills. Using the University’s chosen quality assurance rubric as the foundation, we cover a wide range of topics, including course design, objectives and alignment, student engagement strategies, accessibility, and ideas for assessment and feedback. Our course is designed to be practical, interactive, and engaging, providing best practices in creating and delivering an online course. Level two expands on the quality assurance rubric and introduces the Transparency in Learning and Teaching process, creating engaging lectures, and utilizing the learning management system and templates. Faculty leave both levels with completed materials to use in their own online or hybrid course.</p>

<p>Find Out Where to Start Your Zero Trust Journey<br>
How do you know where to start your Zero Trust journey? Do you have all the parts of Zero Trust in place to control risk to your crown jewels? If you don’t know where to start, you probably need to assess your situation.&nbsp; Using a Zero Trust readiness assessment you can see what parts of the people, process, and technology triad you already have in place and what you don’t.&nbsp; With a readiness assessment you can figure out what to focus on first in order to tackle the remaining parts of the Zero Trust jigsaw.</p>

<p>AI and the Evolution of Strategic Planning and Assessment in Higher Education<br>
Merging theoretical discourse with practical demonstrations, this session will explore the nascent role of AI in higher education. We will focus particularly on GPT-4.0 and its potential for transforming the strategic planning process. Key areas of focus will include the use of AI in designing new strategic planning objectives and embedding sustainable but agile strategic planning assessments in existent objectives. Live demonstrations will exhibit the versatility of GPT-4.0, as we delve into “prompt engineering,” to generate explicit and actionable outcomes. Furthermore, we will explore the socio-cultural implications of integrating AI into higher education, highlighting its powerful “reasoning” capabilities, while acknowledging its limitations and potential risks. In this session, we will highlight the vital role of human responsibility in the effective use of AI. Particularly, we will focus on our own unique abilities in language mastery and logical reasoning, which when synergized with AI, enable us to attain achievements beyond what AI could reach on its own. Our objective is to provide a transformative understanding of how AI, particularly GPT-4.0, can be leveraged as a versatile resource in managing the complexities of strategic planning.</p>

Understanding users’ questions to the chatbot and placing them in subject categories reveals the types of information they are searching for. This presentation will discuss a current project conducting a content analysis of questions posed to the Lehman Library’s chatbot, which uses the ChatGPT AI. The presenters will highlight some of the chatbot’s weakness, specifically the questions users pose that it cannot reliably answer. How the information gleaned from the analysis may improve the library website through content additions and layout changes will be discussed. The presenters will argue that projects using artificial intelligence, like chatbots, can lead to better online learning experience for library users, who rely on both the chatbot and the library website to provide them with information on library and campus-related services and resources.</p>

<p>Modernizing and Enhancing Analytics Infrastructure While Moving to the Cloud<br>
“Rob Stirton, VP of Institutional Effectiveness and CIO at County College of Morris, will demonstrate how CCM uses insights from their analytics platform for real-time decision making across the institution. CCM initially implemented GCOM’s on-premise Student Success Analytics (SSA) platform to integrate data across the entire student lifecycle and develop a clear line of sight between the college’s strategic goals and daily operations. This solution leveraged their existing business intelligence software investment and dramatically improved the availability and accuracy of information through visual analytics for all audiences, while significantly reducing workload on IT and researchers. Eliminating manual data processes allows CCM department chairs to establish goals for enrollment and retention and measure progress, grant writers to include valuable details about student populations to strengthen their applications, and students services staff to improve retention for transfer students.</p>
<p>Building on this success, CCM took the natural next step in their analytics journey: modernizing in the cloud with GCOM’s SSA Cloud platform. SSA Cloud increases access and usability and reduces management costs while seamlessly integrating data sources with hybrid cloud architecture. The cloud environment is managed by GCOM, reducing CCM’s need to staff expensive, in-demand skillsets to support the infrastructure. With the move to the cloud, CCM is better equipped to adapt to changing technical business needs, while leveraging built-in capabilities such as machine learning models that identify admissions and financial aid fraud, and dynamic data exploration and ad-hoc reporting that limits the need for users to write queries.</p>

<p>NIST 800-171 &amp; GLBA: Understanding Compliance Requirements So You Can Confidently Self-Assess<br>
There are 14 sections related to security and privacy within NIST 800-171 that higher education will be assessed on, and which they may be expected to comply with by July 2024, for new Federal Tax Information (FTI) handling procedures under the FAFSA Simplification Act. This requirement is in line with the current and future GLBA Safeguards Rule, which applies to all Title IV colleges and universities, and is included in both the SAIG agreement and the Federal Single Audit.</p>
<p>Compliance with NIST 800-171 is also broadly a contractual obligation for research institutions handling Controlled Unclassified Information on their networks for the purposes of grant-funded research, and these organizations are expected to conduct self-assessments to determine and maintain compliance. This session will help you understand these requirements and the way ahead towards assessing your institution to ensure you are on track.</p>

<p>Building Data Analytics Centers for Colleges &amp; Departments<br>
“Every college, department and functional office at Rowan University needs access to data at their fingertips for decision making. Building common dashboards and models for everyone does not meet the needs of everyone. If we start tweaking common dashboards to meet the needs of everyone, the dashboards become unusable and complex. To solve this problem, we use Extract, Transform, &amp; Load process to build complex and common datasets. We build various predictive models using these common datasets. We use these datasets and models and package them into data portals that we call as data centers. We build visualizations, KPIs, dashboards and reports based on these data sets and models and package them into different data centers. These data centers will have all the data one would need in a college or a department in a way they can easily consume and make decisions on. These data centers consist of dashboards, KPIs, reports, and predictive models in one place.”</p>

<p>Published November 21, 2023, revised November 22, 2023 to include Deutsche Telekom quote.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to announce that it has joined the Linux Foundation’s CAMARA project as an Associate Member.</p>
<p>CAMARA is an open source project within Linux Foundation that defines, develops and tests the APIs enabling seamless access to Telco network capabilities. Initiated in 2021 by a small number of telco operators, vendors and hyperscalers, CAMARA launched in February 2022 with 22 initial partners; it has since grown to over 250 participating organizations with over 750 contributors.</p>
<p>Based on the history of supporting the technical development of GSMA Mobile Connect and the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) community, the Foundation is ready to contribute to CAMARA based on the experience from working with similar industry organizations as well as leading the global adoption of technical standards for Open Banking.</p>
<p>Shilpa Padgaonkar with Deutsche Telekom and Active Maintainer of CAMARA commented, “Deutsche Telekom is a member of the OpenID Foundation&nbsp;and one of the founding members of&nbsp;CAMARA&nbsp;and we are very excited about the liaison agreement. We strongly believe that this cooperation will accelerate valuable contributions to the project on several identity and consent topics and help us drive a shared vision on the&nbsp;OpenID Foundation&nbsp;standards and create sustainable&nbsp;CAMARA-based solutions for the future.”</p>

<p>A “DIDComm 101” presentation at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) in Mountain View last month inspired the creation of a new tool that enables anyone to easily send and receive DIDComm messages. Colton Wolkins, Senior Software Engineer at Indicio, explains.</p><p>Please provide a quick introduction to DIDComm and the DIDComm Demo&nbsp;</p><p>DIDComm is short for DID Communication, a protocol which lets people and software use Decentralized Identifiers (also known as DIDs) to communicate securely and privately over many channels including the Internet, Bluetooth, mobile push notifications, and QR codes.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea for the DIDComm Demo came about just before the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) in California last month. Sam Curren (Indicio’s Senior Systems Architect, and Deputy CTO) realized that everything he was presenting at IIW using slides, we could show using a simple self-serve tool that helps people see for themselves how DIDComm works.&nbsp;</p><p>The DIDComm Demo allows you to connect to another person, a computer, a phone or simply another window in a different browser tab so you can see DIDComm messages traverse back and forth after the messages have been decrypted.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason we wrote this as a separate app was to allow people to see how DIDComm works without needing to sift through or learn a substantial stack like Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py).</p><p>Who is the Demo designed for?&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who wants to understand how the technology works. For example, developers who want to build their own solutions on top of DIDComm can connect to the Demo from whatever they are building, to test that messages are being sent correctly.&nbsp;</p><p>We used a chat window approach to make it easy to understand. The tool is stripped down to the essentials, so it’s easy to see what’s going on. If you open up your browser’s network inspector, you’ll find all your messages are encrypted and your data is secure.&nbsp;</p><p>The DIDComm Demo is entirely open source. If anyone wants to <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-demo?ref=blog.identity.foundation">look at code</a>, to see how it works and learn from it, they can.&nbsp;</p><p>Please explain the concept of mediators in DIDComm, and their role in the DIDComm Demo&nbsp;</p><p>DIDComm doesn’t provide an inherent way to store messages. Also your phone’s IP address is always changing, so there’s no way to talk directly to it. Mediators are cloud-based agents that enable DIDComm messages to be stored and routed.</p><p>For example, if your travel agent sends you a DIDComm message about your flight, the mediator stores the message if your phone is offline. When the phone comes back online it talks to the mediator and says “Here I am, please send me any messages.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mediators tend to be hosted on the public Internet, so they have a domain name which points to the mediator’s IP address. They can either deliver messages directly to mobile devices, or collect messages from many agents at a single endpoint for future delivery.&nbsp;</p><p>A mediator must be accounted for when the sender encrypts a message. For example: If I am connected to you and I send you a message through your mediator, I first encrypt it so only you can decrypt it, then I encrypt it again so only your mediator can read whom to send the message to.&nbsp;</p><p>The DIDComm Demo is connected to a mediator. That’s what enables two people across the world to send messages to each other. At the moment, it happens to use the Indicio mediator (we don’t gain any insight into whether a message is coming from the Demo or any other application). We’re hoping to support more mediators, as other organizations bring WebSocket-capable mediators online.</p><p>DIDComm uses did:peer2 DIDs to establish a connection. The public keys are included in the DID document — one for signing, one for encryption — together with a service endpoint (a location to talk to), in this case, the Indicio Mediator’s DID. When you send a message, the Demo app resolves the mediator’s DID and finds the URL to which to relay the message.</p><p>For more information on mediators, see <a href="https://book.didcomm.org/routing/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://book.didcomm.org/routing/</a></p><p>How can someone access the DIDComm Demo?&nbsp;</p><p>Go to <a href="https://demo.didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">demo.didcomm.org</a>. You’ll see a Help button there with a tutorial, plus a link to the github repo.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

<p>This article, like <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/echoes-history/">“Echoes from History: Designing Self-Sovereign Identity with Care”</a>, is drawn from a book I have in process called FOREMEMBRANCE, which chronicles how identity was abused in WWII and how those dangers linger to the present day._</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ABSTRACT: eIDAS v2.0, released as a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/european-digital-identity-provisional-ag/product-details/20231116CAN72103">provisional agreement on November 16, 2023</a>, offers the first large-scale codification of digital identity. Unfortunately, it contains not just technical problems but also major philosophical missteps that could make it highly dangerous to its users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The history of identity is a sobering one. It’s just more than century old in its modern, codified and organized, form but in that time identity has been reponsible for atrocities. In <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/echoes-history/">“Echoes from History: Designing Self-Sovereign Identity with Care”</a>, I wrote about one of the worst misuses of identity, when Jacobus L. Lentz supported the Nazis in their use of Dutch identity records during World War II, resulting in the death of 75% of the country’s Jews. It didn’t have to be that way: in France, another identity pioneer by the name of René Carmille had control of a similar trove of identity records, but only selectively disclosed some of his data to the Nazis. Only 23% of the Jewish people in France fell to genocide as a result.</p>

<p>However, the stories of Lentz and Carmille are not mere historical prologue. They are powerful warnings about the care that must be taken in the use of personally identifiable data in the twenty-first century and beyond, as the collection of that personal information multiplies and enters the digital space. These warnings are particularly important today, as the European Union just reached <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/european-digital-identity-provisional-ag/product-details/20231116CAN72103">provisional agreement</a> on their next-generation digital-identity regulation, eIDAS, on November 16th. This was despite the fact that it is filled with both technical oversights and poor identity designs that could allow a repeat of the Dutch disaster under Lentz.</p>

 Two Roads Diverged 

<p></p>

<p>The digital world is a new frontier, and like all frontiers it has enjoyed waves of migrations. First came the pioneers: rugged individuals who set their own norms and created their own communities. Then came the corporations: companies intent on monetizing that frontier. Last came the governments: existing authorities intent on setting their own rules and regulations for this new world.</p>

<p>Today, the digital world stands at a crossroads. The conflicting ideas of the pioneers and the corporations are already writ large in differing models for identity on the internet. But now, governments are looking to exert their control over digital space, and it will ultimately be they who decide which of those models persists.</p>

<p>Despite the internet being ultimately founded by governments, who enabled the centralized authority of institutions such as IANA, ICANN, and various Certificate Authorities, the users of the internet have always yearned to be free. They’ve long wanted to control their own digital identities, to define their own relationships with other networked individuals.</p>

<p>One of the first clear statements of this was Phil Zimmerman’s development of the PGP software in 1991. Superficially, it was a technology that allowed for the encryption of data so that it could only be read by its intended recipipent. But PGP went far beyond that. It gave each user a personal identifier that they controlled. They could decide what information to release in correlation with their PGP key and to whom.</p>

<p>Following Zimmerman’s initial deployment of PGP, generations of digital pioneers offered their own takes on digital identity. Most of this occurred  courtesy of organizations such as the Identity Commons<a>1</a>, the Internet Identity Workshop<a>2</a>, and Rebooting the Web of Trust<a>3</a>. Their goal has been to allow for the creation of “decentralized identity” that is not controlled by any one entity. It was a very different take from either Lentz or Carmille, with a user in control of his identity information rather than giving it over to the state.</p>

<p>A number of those ideas about self-sovereign identity have become reality with the standardization of decentralized identifiers (DIDs)<a>4</a> and Verifiable Credentials (VCs)<a>5</a> by the IETF. Now users can have personal control of an identifier that says who they are, and they can associate signed credentials with it, from recommendations to licenses to certifications. It’s a model for digital identity that, if deployed correctly, can avoid the worst dangers of identification, because a user can decide what information to release and to whom.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s not the only way.</p>

<p>Just as users have been building up models for digital identity that give power back to individuals by allowing them to hold their personal data close, corporations have been going in the opposite direction, trying to link together as much information as they can.</p>

<p>You look at a product on Amazon, and suddenly every other site on the internet is trying to sell you on like products. This is a purposeful invasion of your digital privacy that advertising companies celebrate<a>6</a>. But, it’s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Companies all across the internet collect huge amounts of data and share it with each other<a>7</a>, creating the potential for huge honeypots of personal information. Imagine a maleovolent party accessing every single bit of data collected by Google, potentially including what websites you visit, what items you purchase, and even where your Android phone is located at any time. It becomes even worse when internet companies require your real-name, as Facebook<a>8</a> does, potentially creating a real-world connection to that digital data trove. The possibilities are catastrophic if a sufficiently bad actor gets a hold of that information.</p>

<p>These are the two possibilities for digital identity as we enter the third phase of the development of the digital world, where countries and other polities are beginning to lay down their own rules and regulations. We could go the way of the self-sovereign pioneers, who want to minimize information and correlation in a way that would have made Carmille proud, or we could go the way of the corporations that want to collate and correlate everything for their own selfish self-interest, something that Lentz likely would have blindly supported.</p>

<p>Unfortunately eIDAS v2.0, one of the first major definitions of digital identity, could go either way.</p>

 The EU’s Unintential Consequences 

<p>eIDAS v2.0, the new extended version of the Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services that is a product of the European Union,  was released as a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/european-digital-identity-provisional-ag/product-details/20231116CAN72103">provisional agreement</a> on November 16, 2023. The EU has been a major force in proclaiming individual rights on the internet, and they seem to have the best intentions of empowering and protecting their citizens. Unfortunately, their biggest initiatives to date have been mixed successes due to their inability to recognize the unintentional consequences of their regulatory design.</p>

<p>The GDPR <a>9</a> and the EPrivacy Directives<a>10</a> had laudable goals <a>11</a> but have resulted in endless clicking of buttons to access websites in Europe and have largely benefited large corporations who are able to fulfill the regulations<a>12</a>. The EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market<a>13</a> has resulted in countries trying to grab cash from search engines<a>14</a> and getting cut off from news as a result<a>15</a>.</p>

<p>Generally, these digital regulations demonstrate a concerning reptition of unintended consequences and insufficient understanding of the digital space in EU legislation. If those problems were to recur in identity-focused legislation, it could be catastropic.</p>

 eIDAS on the March 

<p></p>

<p>eIDAS v2.0 details the legal and technical requirements for countries to offer digital identities that can be stored on devices and reused<a>16</a>. It requires the creation of digital wallets that can be filled with both an identifier and credentials. If you’ve long dreamed of having a driver’s license, university records, or health records that are digitally stored in a portable way, that’s what eIDAS v2.0 does<a>17</a>.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of theoretically good material built into eIDAS v2.0. It supports interoperable digital wallets with high security standards. It also enables digital signing and can be set up remotely without having to present physical documents in person<a>18</a>.</p>

<p>There’s also hope that self-sovereign identity (SSI) could still be a possibility with the release of eIDAS. After all, the provisional agreement states that one of its goals is “to provide people with control over their online identity and data”<a>19</a>. One study on the topic thus suggested there was no innate contradiction between eIDAS and the individual-empowering principles of SSI<a>20</a>. Another laid out bridge scenarios<a>21</a>. Yet another author noted that “selective disclosure” of information, where users individually decide what identity elements to release, had been a principle since eIDAS 1.0. However, nothing is guaranteed: that final article also notec that the user’s personal, self-sovereign control of data is purposefully limited by the design<a>22</a> of eIDAS.</p>

<p>Ultimately whether eIDAS will create new digital honeypots of information will depend on eIDAS’ final deployment and how it’s arbitrated by countries’ laws and courts. Unfortunately, the EU’s record on digital legislation is problematic, and as it’s proposed eIDAS is full of holes that could lead to big problems in our future.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with eIDAS as it currently stands is a worldwide web-security issue. eIDAS mandates that web browers accept security certificates from individual member states and the EU can refuse to revoke them even if they’re dangerous<a>23</a>. The provisional agreement does note that “The obligation of recognition, interoperability and support of QWACs is not to affect the freedom of web-browser providers to ensure web security, domain authentication and the encryption of web traffic in the manner and with the technology they consider most appropriate.”<a>19</a>. However, that’s clearly a contradiction: web browsers can not ensure web security if there’s an obligation to recognize CAs from member states.</p>

<p>That obligation not only reverts the web to an outdated model for security management, but it also puts every single transaction on the web at the mercy of the least trustworthy administrator in the least trustworthy EU state. Potentially, millions of people would have the ability to break web security. Perhaps worse, it allows the surveillance of users at European websites by European governments<a>24</a>.</p>

<p>There are numerous problems with the actual identity model of eIDAS as well.</p>

<p>This begins with the identifier at the heart of the proposal, which is problematic because it’s meant to be persistent<a>25</a>. That allows for extreme correlation of everything a person ever does with their identity, over an infinite amount of time, and thus creates huge honeypots of personal information that will be massive targets for attacks. Earlier proposals even called for the identifier to be unique for each person, which would have multiplied the problem a hundredfold (and violated the Constitutions of some member states)<a>26</a>. The provisional agreement leaves the question of uniqueness up to the member states themselves but at least offsets that somewhat with support for pseudonyms<a>27</a>.</p>

<p>The cryptographic technology used by eIDAS is also at issue because of the very conservative and limited choices of the EU. Modern signature schemes and other cryptography likely to offer better protection for the enormous personal data likely to be compiled under eIDAS are all prohibited<a>28</a>. This leaves it very vulnerable.</p>

<p>eIDAS data is ultimately collected in wallets, which will be government-backed and will use identities provided by corporations. This allows the possibility for either entity to illicitly collect personal data<a>29</a>. Though the current governments and selected corporations might be trustworthy, the same guarantee can’t be made for future controllers of those entities. Thus, the data and app model at the core of eIDAS is just a mortgage for future problems.</p>

<p>In other words, there are problems up and down the entire eIDAS stack, including identity creation, identity assignment, cryptographic protection, web-based security, and app design. Too much data is being collected in one place, it’s potentially available to too many people, and it’s too vulnerable.</p>

<p>The stories of Lentz and Carmille should have taught us the core importance of minimizing data and intrinsically protecting it from misuse.</p>

<p>eIDAS does not.</p>

<p>The problem is that the EU creating a digital identity without understanding modern theories for how to create safe identities that can benefit their users without making them vulnerable.</p>

<p>Identities need to minimize data correlation. Identities need to minimize data correlation. The EU’s original take on a unique identity shows how badly misguided they are on this criterion, and even now the decision is going to get punted to the member states. But there should never be a single identity that correlates your taxes, your transit through different countries, your rental of a bicycle, your usage of digital euros<a>30</a>,and whatever else gets jammed into the eIDAS framework. And that data shouldn’t last forever (and in fact doing so goes against the GDPR’s right to be forgotten<a>31</a>).</p>

<p>Identities need to minimize identification. That same person renting a bike should need to reveal nothing more than their ability to pay to rent and possibly replace the bicycle. A person buying an alcoholic beverage should only need to reveal their age. A person reporting a public-works issue, such as a pothole, should potentially reveal nothing. Ultmately identity is about managing the risk between two parties. The risk to individuals must be minimized by minimizing the identification data they’re required to share.</p>

<p>For eIDAS identities to successfully meet the human-focused goals of the EU, they need to reflect the power imbalance between the state and the individual, and in those situations where their needs are equal, or where the needs of the individual are greater, they need to maximize the power of the individual.</p>

<p>To go back to the example of an individual reporting a pothole, the risk that the state faces for a false report is low: they might waste resources if they schedule a non-existent public-works repair, but they are very large and can easily amortize that loss. In contrast, the risk that an individual faces is much greater. If their identity were revealed, they might be “outed” as a troublemaker or they might face retribution from a worker who had previously failed to fix that pothole. (Obviously, these repercussions would be even greater for a matter of more import, but the fact that they exist for even a small issue is notable.) As a result, despite the power imbalance where the state holds the most power, it must give the most protection to the individual in this situation, by not requiring identification data.</p>

<p>Certainly, there are technical solutions that can resolve some of the most extreme problems remaining in eIDAS. The state-mandated CAs need to be removed, identifiers must be required to be non-persistent and non-unique, cryptography must be expanded, and the creation of identifiers and wallets must be decentralized.</p>

<p>However, the philosophical issues are just as important. The minimization of data collection, data correlation, and personal identification must be incorporated into eIDAS as actual regulations or the very strongest of recommendations. eIDAS ultimately must say not just what things must be done for compliance, but what things must not be done to preserve the privacy of user data.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>In order to protect our human rights, we need to ensure that modern-day information systems protect our data in meaningful ways. As we learned <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/echoes-history/">through the lessons of Lentz and Carmille</a>, there are two paths before us.</p>

<p>On the one hand, we have the path of Jacobus Lentz. He maximized the information that he collected, he happily stored it all together, and he thought merely about the efficiency of its use. His information thus wasn’t protected against a regime change, and the Nazis used it to commit genocide against 75% of the Netherlands’ Jewish population.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have the path of René Carmille. He collected very similar information to Lentz, but he was aware of the sensitivity of some information, so he ensured that it couldn’t be correlated with other personally identifiable information. A third as many Jews died in France as The Netherlands (by percentage), and it seems likely that Carmille’s protection of personal records was a major factor.</p>

<p>Moving across the 20th and 21st centuries, we’ve unfortunately more frequently cleaved to the path of Lentz than Carmille. The Census Bureau turned over records of Japanese-Americans to President Roosevelt and thousands died and tens of thousands more were deeply scarred. Records of young DACA immigrants passed from President Obama to President Trump and their lives were thrown into grave uncertainty. The smaller stories of individual people whose lives were destroyed due to the theft or sharing of date (legal or not) are uncountable. Lentz remains ascendant; his lessons unlearned.</p>

<p>But the digital frontier offers a new opportunity to do things right. We can ensure that identities are controlled by people and used to benefit those people and society as a whole. We just have to do so before it’s too late.</p>

<p>The biggest danger and the biggest opportunity in the current day remains eIDAS. With the release of a provisional agreement,it might already be too far along to prevent its ratification in that form. But either now or afterward we must take the opportunity to legislatively minimize the data collected and correlated for identities.</p>

<p>We must give individuals the ability to control their personal identity as much as is possible in a shared society.</p>

<p>The widely-adopted XML schema for marking up books of all kinds is now presented for public review prior to its submission to the members of OASIS as a candidate for OASIS Standard.</p> 


<p>OASIS and the DocBook TC [1] are pleased to announce that The DocBook Schema Version 5.2 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>DocBook is a schema (available in languages including RELAX NG, SGML and XML DTDs, and W3C XML Schema) that is particularly well suited to books and papers about computer hardware and software.</p>



<p>Because it is a large and robust schema, and because its main structures correspond to the general notion of what constitutes a “book,” DocBook has been adopted by a large and growing community of authors writing books of all kinds. DocBook is supported “out of the box” by a number of commercial tools, and there is rapidly expanding support for it in a number of free software environments. These features have combined to make DocBook a generally easy to understand, widely useful, and very popular schema. Dozens of organizations are using DocBook for millions of pages of documentation, in various print and online formats, worldwide.</p>



<p>The TC received four Statements of Use from from Norm Tovey-Walsh, XML Press, the SUSE documentation team, and Jira Kosek. [3].</p>



<p>The candidate specification and related files are available here:</p>



<p>The DocBook Schema Version 5.2<br>Committee Specification 01<br>19 July 2023</p>

<p>Public Review Period</p>



<p>The 60-day public review starts 20 November 2023 at 00:00 UTC and ends 18 January 2024 at 23:59 UTC.</p>



<p>This is an open invitation to comment. OASIS solicits feedback from potential users, developers and others, whether OASIS members or not, for the sake of improving the interoperability and quality of its technical work.</p>



<p>Comments may be submitted to the TC by any person through the use of the OASIS TC Comment Facility as explained in the instructions located via the button labeled “Send A Comment” at the top of the TC public home page, or directly at:</p>

<p>All comments submitted to OASIS are subject to the OASIS Feedback License, which ensures that the feedback you provide carries the same obligations at least as the obligations of the TC members. In connection with this public review of “DocBook V5.2,” we call your attention to the OASIS IPR Policy [4] applicable especially [5] to the work of this technical committee. All members of the TC/OP should be familiar with this document, which may create obligations regarding the disclosure and availability of a member’s patent, copyright, trademark and license rights that read on an approved OASIS specification.</p>



<p>OASIS invites any persons who know of any such claims to disclose these if they may be essential to the implementation of the above specification, so that notice of them may be posted to the notice page for this TC’s work.</p>

    Navigating Identity in the Digital Age 



 Back Story 



<p>Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Joins UNDP in Pioneering Digital Infrastructure Drive</p>



<p>The United Nations Development Program has launched an ambitious initiative, the “50-in-5” campaign, to boost the digital public infrastructure (DPI) across the globe. This strategic move, strongly supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, aims to see 50 countries develop and scale at least one DPI component by 2028. These components include digital payments, ID, and data exchange systems that are integral to achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.</p>



<p>A cohort of 11 nations, including technological front-runners like Estonia and emerging economies like Bangladesh, have stepped forward as the first movers in this groundbreaking journey. The Gates Foundation’s involvement underscores its ongoing commitment to DPI, highlighted by a $200 million fund established in September 2022. Melinda French Gates has emphasized the transformative potential of mobile devices in furthering digital identities, which are central to DPI’s expansion.</p>



<p>India’s Aadhaar, the world’s largest biometric ID system, is poised to play a significant role in this global narrative. Recognized at the G20 Summit in New Delhi, Aadhaar could serve as a blueprint for countries in Africa and Asia to roll out their digital identity technologies. With such a robust backing and a clear target, the “50-in-5” campaign is set to embark on a path that could reshape how nations and their citizens interact with technology and governance.</p>



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity vs. UNDP’s Digital Public Infrastructure</p>



<p>In the digital era, the quest for a secure and efficient identity management system has led to the emergence of two distinct philosophies: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and the United Nations Development Program’s (UNDP) digital public infrastructure (DPI) approach as recently endorsed by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): A User-Centric Model</p>



<p>SSI is a user-centric model that grants individuals complete control over their digital identities. Unlike traditional identity systems that rely on centralized authorities, SSI is built on blockchain technology, allowing for a decentralized and autonomous structure. Users can manage their identities without intermediary oversight, deciding when and to whom they reveal their information​<a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/self-sovereign-identity/#:~:text=Time%20to%20read%3A%209%20minutes,a%20passport%20or%20driver%E2%80%99s%20license"></a>​​<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/22/2811#:~:text=2.2.%20Self,and%20manage%20their%20digital%20identities"></a>​​<a href="https://www.identity.com/self-sovereign-identity/#:~:text=Verifiable%20credentials%20and%20decentralized%20identifiers,known%20as%20a%20blockchain%20network"></a>​. Christopher Allen’s principles of SSI emphasize that control over personal data is fundamental, positioning users not merely as subjects within digital realms but as their sovereigns​<a href="https://blockchainhub.net/blog/blog/self-sovereign-identity-vs-data/#:~:text=Principles%20of%20Self,important%20principles%20include%20the"></a>​. This system is geared towards a future where identity verification is both secure and private, with verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers ensuring accessibility across the globe at any time​<a href="https://www.identity.com/self-sovereign-identity/#:~:text=Verifiable%20credentials%20and%20decentralized%20identifiers,known%20as%20a%20blockchain%20network"></a>​​<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/eidas-observatory/ssi-and-eidas-vision-how-they-are-connected-share-your-views.html#:~:text=Self,groups%20have%20raised%20their"></a>​.</p>



<p>UNDP’s Digital Public Infrastructure: A Collaborative Framework</p>



<p>The UNDP’s DPI initiative, on the other hand, encompasses a network of digital components like payments, ID, and data exchange systems. This infrastructure is designed to aid countries in achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. With the Gates Foundation’s backing, the “50-in-5” campaign aims to implement DPI components in 50 countries by 2028​<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/gates-foundation-backs-un-campaign-to-accelerate-digital-infrastructure/"></a>​. Unlike SSI, the DPI approach involves a more collaborative framework, possibly relying on centralized or semi-centralized systems that can be adopted at a national scale. The focus here is on interoperability and inclusiveness, aiming for a safe and universally accessible digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>The Core Differences</p>



<p>The key difference between SSI and DPI lies in the locus of control and the approach to decentralization. SSI is about empowering the individual as the sole owner of their identity, with blockchain technology ensuring that control remains with the user​<a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/self-sovereign-identity/#:~:text=Time%20to%20read%3A%209%20minutes,a%20passport%20or%20driver%E2%80%99s%20license"></a>​​<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/22/2811#:~:text=2.2.%20Self,and%20manage%20their%20digital%20identities"></a>​​<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/eidas-observatory/ssi-and-eidas-vision-how-they-are-connected-share-your-views.html#:~:text=Self,groups%20have%20raised%20their"></a>​. DPI, while it may utilize some decentralized features, is more about creating a common digital infrastructure that can be shared among nations and governed by a collective of stakeholders, including governments and international organizations​<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/gates-foundation-backs-un-campaign-to-accelerate-digital-infrastructure/"></a>​.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while both SSI and DPI aim to address the challenges of identity in the digital age, they offer different paths forward. SSI is a bottom-up approach that starts with individual autonomy, whereas DPI represents a top-down strategy that focuses on creating a shared digital environment. As the digital landscape evolves, the interaction between these two models will likely shape the future of digital identity governance.</p>

<p>The U.S. government has embraced FIDO authentication, and is now looking for further guidance around how to implement this technology into the government’s existing PIV-centric ecosystem used to manage enterprise access for government employees and contractors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To provide this guidance, the FIDO Alliance published a paper, “FIDO Alliance Guidance for U.S. Government Agency Deployment of FIDO Authentication.”</p>



 
 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-fido-alliance-guidance-for-u-s-government-agency-deployment-of-fido-authentication/">Read the paper</a> 
 



 



<p>This resource is the first output of a new committee formed by the FIDO Alliance’s Board of Directors at the request of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The Committee, whose goal is to improve and accelerate adoption of FIDO technology within federal agencies, includes representatives from CISA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the General Services Administration (GSA), the Department of Defense, in addition to other FIDO Alliance members.</p>



<p>The Committee is aligned with the government’s efforts to modernize identity to counter threats, and encourages agencies to advance their Zero Trust Architecture journeys by implementing identity capabilities that support both FIDO and PKI-based phishing-resistant MFA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also provides guidance on implementation of FIDO credentials within the federal digital identity ecosystem in order to meet immediate priorities defined in OMB 22-09, Federal Zero Trust Strategy and advance cybersecurity outcomes by enabling future phases of Federal Zero Trust Architecture efforts.</p>



<p>Alternative options for phishing-resistant authentication are necessary in the federal workforce, for example, for individuals who are not PIV eligible, or to quickly enable access for new employees who are waiting for their PIV to be issued, or those individuals who work remotely and don’t need access to federal facilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This document highlights areas where FIDO offers the best value to address U.S. Government use cases as an enhancement of existing infrastructure, while minimizing rework as agencies advance their zero trust strategies with phishing-resistant authentication tied to enterprise identity as the foundation.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance will host a webinar, “Deploying FIDO Authentication in U.S. Government Agencies,” covering the essential information in this white paper on November 28, 2023 at 1:00 PM ET / 11:00 AM PT. To register for the webinar, <a href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/4419611/509DCD451A69E91608E646994220EE55">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Organizations from Around the World Come Together to Define the Defending Against Disinformation Common Data Model (DAD-CDM)</p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 16 November 2023 – OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, launched the <a href="https://github.com/DAD-CDM">DAD-CDM</a> project, an open source initiative to develop data exchange&nbsp;standards for normalizing and sharing disinformation and influence campaigns. DAD-CDM will serve as a valuable resource, particularly in the identification and alerting of AI-empowered attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“DAD-CDM won’t try to define disinformation. Instead, the standard will offer a framework for assessing both technical and non-technical aspects of disinformation campaigns. This will alert influence operation (IO)-fighting teams worldwide and give them the means to communicate their analyses using a standardized language. The ultimate decision on classifying an attack as disinformation rests with analysts,” said Jean-Philippe Salles of Filigran, co-chair of the DAD-CDM Project Governing Board (PGB).</p>



<p>In the context of IO campaigns, AI-driven attacks often exhibit remarkable sophistication and adaptability. The use of AI as a tool can exacerbate the impact of these operations and is a growing concern. A common data model, such as DAD-CDM’s data exchange standards, will provide a structured and standardized approach for sharing critical information regarding these AI-empowered attacks, thus enabling early detection, rapid alerting, and improved response strategies. This will enable stakeholders, including governments and cybersecurity experts, to effectively identify, counter, and mitigate the influence of AI in propagating disinformation and interference campaigns, ultimately reinforcing our defenses against this evolving and pervasive challenge.</p>



<p>“In a world characterized by increasing global division exacerbated by the proliferation of IO campaigns including disinformation, misinformation, and FIMI, it becomes increasingly evident that a shared data model is imperative. Such a model would streamline the sharing and analysis of information concerning influence operations, allowing for a unified approach in response coordination and resource allocation,” said Dr. Georgianna Shea of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, co-chair of the DAD-CDM PGB. “The DAD-CDM, in the realm of influence operations, serves a purpose akin to what MITRE ATT&amp;CK accomplishes in the context of cyber-attacks. Both are indispensable instruments, essential for navigating the intricate and multifaceted terrain of contemporary threats, ensuring a more cohesive and effective response strategy.”</p>



<p>Building upon the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/standard/stix-version-2-1/">OASIS Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)</a> threat intelligence sharing standard, DAD-CDM will leverage models, protocols, and policies widely used today in the cybersecurity field. DAD-CDM will focus on manipulative behaviors and so will also expand on the DISARM Framework, which standardizes the codification of adversary behavior Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).</p>



<p>“The concept of ‘defending’ involves real-time action and strategic planning to confront the threat of disinformation, which poses a significant threat to peace, democracy, and critical policy areas like pandemics and climate change,” said Pablo Breuer, Ph.D., Chair, DISARM Foundation. “DAD-CDM offers several advantages, including faster alert sharing, easier response coordination, increased report sharing, and the ability to compare and contrast actor behavior over time. Together, we will create a stronger defense against the spread of disinformation and online harms and help safeguard the integrity of information worldwide.”</p>



<p>Leadership and funding for the project are provided by AdTechCares, Crisp Thinking Group, Cyabra, Debunk.org, DISARM Foundation, Filigran, Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Global Disinformation Index, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Limbik, Logically, MarvelousAI, and sFractal Consulting. Participation in the DAD-CDM Open Project is open to all interested parties. Contact <a href="mailto:join@oasis-open.org">join@oasis-open.org</a> for more information. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Support for the DAD-CDM OP<br><br>Cyabra<br>“Social media is the new attack surface and the fastest-growing arena for bad actors. Ten years after the creation of the ATT&amp;CK framework, which has helped guide the growth of the cybersecurity sector, Cyabra is excited to join OASIS Open and lead the emergence of the formal counter-disinformation industry.”<br>– Rafi Mendelsohn, VP Marketing, Cyabra</p>



<p>Debunk.org<br>“The creation of a common language and model through the DAD-CDM initiative is pivotal for professional FIMI defenders. It significantly enhances our efficiency in responding to FIMI attacks. As the Head of Debunk.org, I am proud to join this initiative that promises to unify and strengthen our efforts against the sophisticated FIMI attacks threatening our information landscape.”<br>– Viktoras Daukšas, Head of Debunk.org</p>



<p>DISARM Foundation<br>“To effectively identify and expose foreign manipulation before it negatively impacts our democracies, we need to quickly establish a comprehensive threat overview. STIX enables this by connecting the dots. For example, with STIX we will be able to assert, ‘Another community member already analyzed this inauthentic Facebook account and shared their report,’ or ‘These specific deceptive behaviors strongly resemble prior election interference campaigns by this nation-state.’ To address hybrid threats such as cyber-enabled influence (e.g., hack-and-leak) or influence-enabled cyber (e.g., clickbait) we need to model Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and Indicators of Manipulation (IOMs) in the same way. With STIX we will be able to do that.”<br>– Stephen H. Campbell, CTO, DISARM Foundation</p>



<p>Filigran<br>“OASIS Open’s DAD-CDM initiative is a pivotal step forward in addressing the growing challenges of online disinformation, particularly FIMI. At Filigran, we recognize that tackling this multifaceted problem requires collaboration and unified efforts. We’re proud to support a project that not only builds on the trusted foundation of the STIX cybersecurity standard but also fosters real-time, scalable defenses against AI-powered threats, ensuring a more secure and trustworthy digital environment for all.”<br>– Samuel Hassine, Co-founder &amp; CEO, Filigran</p>



<p>Limbik<br>“In the years Limbik has been leveraging cognitive AI against disinformation, we have seen incredible progress and ingenuity within the community. This new project is an extremely promising advancement, bringing the best technology, insights, and lessons learned together towards the vaunted whole-of-society response that is desperately needed. A common approach to disinformation that aligns academia, industry, government, and non-profits toward proactive resilience building and risk mitigation represents a huge advancement in an increasingly risky world.”<br>– Robert Schaul, VP Strategy, Limbik</p>



<p>Logically<br>“The sheer scale of the disinformation threat facing global society is vast and requires coordinated collaboration from a host of stakeholders if we are to limit the impact of bad actors who utilize disinformation campaigns to cause confusion, disruption and harm. We are delighted to be a part of the DAD-CDM project and look forward to working with our partners to detect disinformation campaigns earlier and improve our response strategies.”<br>– Lyric Jain, CEO, Logically</p>



<p>MarvelousAI<br>“In the pursuit of truth and transparency, we are excited to harness the collective power of open-source, guided by the STIX and TAXII standards, to illuminate the shadows cast by information influence operations.”<br>– Danielle Deibler, Co-founder and CEO, MarvelousAI</p>



<p>sFractal Consulting<br>“Standards are essential in countering disinformation influence campaigns because standards provide a common framework and guidelines for identifying, mitigating, and preventing disinformation. Standards promote sharing which helps level the playing field and ensures consistency in response strategies. Utilizing standards allows authorities, organizations, and individuals to better coordinate efforts, mitigate the spread of disinformation and safeguard the integrity of the information ecosystem.”<br>– Duncan Sparrell, Chief Cyber Curmudgeon, sFractal Consulting</p>

<p></p><p>Polygon is a decentralized blockchain network that allows for the permissionless exchange of value.</p><p><a href="https://polygonid.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Polygon ID</a>, part of the Polygon ecosystem, provides a Self-Sovereign Identity solution leveraging the power of Zero-Knowledge Proofs. It consists of a set of libraries, tools and ready-made applications that can be used to facilitate trusted, secure and privacy-preserving relationships between identity holders, issuers and verifiers.</p><p>Polygon ID is open-source and can be deployed to any EVM-compatible chain.&nbsp;</p><p>In our latest guest blog, Polygon ID protocol engineer, Oleksandr Brezhniev,  Technical Sales lead for the American region, Otto Mora and Digital Project Manager, Alex Rosales answer our questions about the company's new product release.</p><p>Your website states that Polygon ID is "The first identity solution that allows users to use zero-knowledge proofs&nbsp; generated from off-chain verifiable credentials to interact with smart contracts." What use cases do you envisage and what are the benefits of this approach?</p><p>Know Your Customer (KYC) is a key use case. We've seen multiple Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects moving in this direction, including Uniswap, which recently has implemented the possibility to allow only verified liquidity providers in the new version of their protocol. Also Centralized Finance (CeFi) apps (such as centralized exchanges, on-ramp services, etc.) can benefit from better user experiences coming from reusable verifications. No more passing KYC on each platform separately!</p><p>But also there's a range of use cases not related to KYC. For example:</p>  Decentralized Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) may allow voting only to their GitHub contributors.  Limit who can join a DAO based on belonging to a social group, like "Women in Tech."  Build communities to solve issues and fund local development projects.  Distribute tokens (airdrop) among “Active Steam players” to attract new users to a Web3 game.  <p>In regard to voting and airdrops there is an interesting use case, Sybil resistance. Based on a Proof-of-Uniqueness credential (for example, issued by an identity verification provider), a user can prove that they are unique without disclosing any personal information and can vote only once, no matter how many Ethereum addresses and Decentralized Identifiers the user has. Protection from Sybil attacks and bots is crucial for decision making and fair funds distribution.</p><p>Another problem this capability can solve is recovery of access to user accounts. For example, an <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Abstracted Account </a>(a new way to make Ethereum accounts more secure, with a better user experience) allows you to change the account “owner” if the new “owner” proves to be the same person, using credentials from a trusted KYC provider or from preselected, trusted friends.</p><p>To sum up, bringing off-chain data in the form of Verifiable Credentials on-chain improves security and compliance without sacrificing user privacy, reduces fraud, increases automation, improves user experience and opens new possibilities for Decentralized App (DApp) developers.</p><p>And with the recent implementation of on-chain issuer in the protocol, it's also possible to decouple on-chain data from the user's Ethereum address, and prove (on-chain and off-chain) for example that his balance is over some threshold without revealing the address and exact amount.</p><p>Your website also states that "Polygon ID meets W3C Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier (DID) standards." Why is this important and what business benefits does it deliver?</p><p>This statement signifies our alignment with key industry standards and protocols that relate to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, which is important to us because of:</p>  Interoperability and Compatibility: Conformity to the W3C standards for Verifiable Credentials (VC) and Decentralized Identifiers (DID) means that Polygon ID aims to work seamlessly with other platforms and systems that also adhere to these standards. It simplifies integration with existing tools and solutions on the market, increasing its utility and versatility.  Trust and Security: W3C VC and DID standards are designed to provide a secure and trustable way of handling identity and credentials in a decentralized and privacy-preserving manner. By aligning with these standards, Polygon ID can assure its users that their identity and credentials are handled in a secure and privacy-conscious way. This can be especially important in applications involving sensitive personal or financial data, such as in the finance and healthcare sectors.  Future-proofing : Many identity solutions, especially in the Web3 space, develop their own incompatible ways of representing identifiers and credentials. Being an early adopter and promoter of standards, combined with our novel privacy-preserving method to prove statements and do selective disclosure based on ZKPs, can give Polygon ID a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving decentralized identity space. It demonstrates our commitment to innovation and a future-proof approach to technology development. This can be appealing to both developers and businesses looking for long-term, stable solutions.  <p>Consequently, this positions us for greater adoption and brings us closer to fulfilling our vision of empowering individuals and giving them back control over their identities and personal data.</p><p>How does being a member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation help Polygon ID align to the W3C standards and related DIF specifications?&nbsp;</p><p>Through our membership in the DIF, the Polygon ID team can interact with various industry working groups that are very relevant to us:</p>  DIDComm: Our protocol utilizes a subset of DIDComm called iden3comm that was developed specifically for Iden3 / Polygon ID. In this working group we can contribute this technology and align with other members interested in DIDComm.  Claims and Credentials Working Group: allows the alignment of credentials and schema standards including “basic identity credentials” that we are currently creating with our Polygon ID Common Schemas initiative. Several of the KYC issuers in the Polygon ID ecosystem are also members of the DIF which will facilitate standardization.  Integration with the Universal Resolver: We believe in interoperability as promoted by Markus Sabadello and other DIF members. Through our support of the Universal Resolver for Polygon ID DID resolution we get closer to that objective.  <p>Also through our DIF membership we are able to support other events including hackathons, which helps us connect with startups and developers in the Decentralized Identity space.</p><p>Are you able to give us a sneak preview of your product roadmap?&nbsp;</p><p>After many years of research and consequent development of the<a href="https://docs.iden3.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> iden3 protocol</a> and a complete suite of tools to serve all actors in the “triangle of trust” (issuers, holders and verifiers), such as an <a href="https://devs.polygonid.com/docs/issuer/issuer-node-ui/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">issuer node</a>, the <a href="https://devs.polygonid.com/docs/wallet/wallet-overview/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">wallet sdk</a>, and the <a href="https://devs.polygonid.com/docs/verifier/verifier-overview/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">verifier sdk</a>, we finally launched the first production version of Polygon ID in February this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the launch, we have been gathering positive and constructive feedback from developers and companies implementing Polygon ID, which has enabled&nbsp; us to improve our tools and add new ones to make it easier for developers and end users.&nbsp;</p><p>Among the new tools we have already added to the Polygon ID suite:</p>  The <a href="https://devs.polygonid.com/docs/js-sdk/js-sdk-overview/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">js-sdk </a>design to build browser-based applications.&nbsp;  The <a href="https://schema-builder.polygonid.me/query-builder?ref=blog.identity.foundation">query builder</a> to make it easier for developers of applications to construct queries based on the zkQuery language.  The <a href="https://schema-builder.polygonid.me/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">schema builder</a> that helps issuers find existing schemas (hence achieving standardization and interoperability) or create new ones.  <p>Now that the suite of tools is mature, our next goal is to focus on growing the liquidity of credentials in the Polygon ID ecosystem. To achieve this, the new version (launched earlier this week) will make it easier, and will add new possibilities, to generate credentials:</p>  New <a href="https://marketplace.polygonid.me/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">credentials marketplace</a>: Makes it easy for you as a developer to select which type of credential to use, and which is the issuer that issues the credential.  New on-chain issuer: Is a smart contract that allows the generation of on-chain credentials. The sources of information can be:  On-chain: you will be able to generate credentials based on public data already available on-chain. This will allow you for example to generate a credential that proves how many tokens you own without having to reveal your address.  Off-chain: you will be able to generate on-chain credentials based on off-chain documents:&nbsp; The client application will take the off-chain document and transform it into a verifiable credential that will remain in the user’s identity wallet. Additionally, a zero knowledge proof will be sent to the on-chain issuer to certify this. For example, you will be able to create a credential based on your identity card or on a PDF issued by the government.    Improvements in the Issuer Node: Improving the Issuer Node, making it easier to install and use  Available in Cloud Marketplaces such as Google Cloud Marketplace (GCM) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace  Possibility to store revocation trees on-chain.  Possibility to use a DID with Ethereum addresses: this will allow the issuer to use naming services and have cheaper state transitions.    <p>It is important to highlight that Polygon ID is open source, which enables developers to propose improvements and audit the code.</p><p>During the next months, we plan to launch exciting new projects (some of them currently in the research phase) that we believe can be a breakthrough for the space.

<p>First public review for Version 1.3 - ends December 8th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Virtual I/O Device (VIRTIO) TC are pleased to announce that Virtual I/O Device (VIRTIO) Version 1.3 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>Specification Overview</p>



<p>This document describes the specifications of the ‘virtio’ family of devices. These devices are found in virtual environments, yet by design they look like physical devices to the guest within the virtual machine – and this document treats them as such. This similarity allows the guest to use standard drivers and discovery mechanisms. The purpose of virtio and this specification is that virtual environments and guests should have a straightforward, efficient, standard and extensible mechanism for virtual devices, rather than boutique per-environment or per-OS mechanisms.</p>

<p>This article was originally published as an advance reading for <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/events/#rwot-12-cologne-2023">RWOT12 in Köln, Germany</a> on August 9, 2023. It has been slightly edited for this reprint.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ABSTRACT: Self-sovereign identity represents an innovative new architecture for identity management. But, we must ensure that it avoids the pitfalls of previous identity systems. During World War II, two identity pioneers, the Dutch Jacobus L. Lentz and the French René Carmille, took different approaches toward the collection and recording of personally identifiable data. As a result, 75% of Dutch Jews fell victim to the Holocaust versus 23% of the Jews in France. Our foundational work on self-sovereign identity today could have similar repercussions down the road, so it’s imperative that we design this foundation responsibly with diligence and foresight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a></a></p>

<p>On January 26, 2020, on the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz during World War II, Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands offered a historic apology for how the country had failed its Jewish citizens during that War, which resulted in over 100,000 of them being deported and murdered by the Nazis. He acknowledged that one of the problems was the Netherlands’ civil service, stating: “When state authority became a threat, our public institutions failed in their duty as guardians of justice and security. To be sure, within the government too there was resistance on an individual level. But too many Dutch officials simply did as they were told by the occupying forces.”<a>1</a></p>

<p>A similar acknowledgement had been offered almost 25 years earlier by President Jacques Chirac of France, who stated that “the criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French, by the French state”.<a>2</a> In France, some 76,000 French and foreign Jews were deported by the Nazis, but it was from a larger population that also had a larger demographic of Jewish peoples.</p>

<p>When distilled down to the bare and heartless statistics, the difference between the countries is stark: in the Netherlands, 75% of Jews tragically lost their lives, compared to 23% in France. The difference lies in how each country dealt with identity: what they were willing to record and what they were not. Since regimes inevitably change, since data inevitably changes hands from one person to another, this type of consideration is crucial.</p>

<p>These harsh lessons also remain central to the new technologies of digital identity. That includes both self-sovereign identity, an ideology to reclaim human dignity and authority in the digital world and an emerging suite of applications designed to enable that movement, and other new digital-identity systems. We must heed the grave lessons of history as we look forward, to ensure that digital identity technology of all types is never used in a similar genocide.</p>

 Impeccable Identity: Lentz’s Tragic Legacy 

<p></p>

<p>The story of identity in the Netherlands during World War II is still writ on the landscape of Amsterdam today, at the National Holocaust Names Monument, where Prime Minister Rutte gave his famous speech in 2020, and a few blocks away at the intersection of Plantage Kerklaan and Plantage Middenlaan, where the municipal building that held the records of the region’s population once lay.</p>

<p>Today, there’s nothing special about the structure that once housed the records building, other than a somber plaque affixed to a wall. It reads, “27 Maart 1943: Vernieling Bevolkingsregister”. March 27, 1943: Destruction of the population register. Therein lies the crux of the story of how the Netherlands recorded too much identity information, and how they made one last attempt to destroy it after the Nazis gained control of the country.</p>

<p>That story begins, as Prime Minister Rutte acknowledged, in the Dutch Civil Service, which the Nazis recognized as “Germanic” in its orderly thoroughness. So much so that they left the cadres of Dutch civil servants alone to run things, with Germanic leadership installed above them. In particular, the story begins with one operational functionary by the name of Jacobus L. Lentz.</p>

<p>In 1932, Lentz was appointed the head of the National Inspectorate of Population Registers in The Netherlands. This was a critical post in the 1930s because of the Great Depression: the Inspectorate ensured that all citizens had equitable access to basic services. Thanks to its efficiency, the small nation fared better than even the greatest European powers during the 1930s, helping to keep its citizens out of the poverty that was blanketing the globe. Looking to ensure that this happy efficiency was maintained and even bettered, the Dutch government tasked Lentz with promoting yet greater order by bringing consistency and uniformity to population registers throughout the country.</p>

<p>Lentz was thus instrumental in what followed. By 1936, a decree required that every resident in the Netherlands must have a personal identity card, one copy to be carried on their person and a duplicate to be filed in the civil archives. These archives also contained a cornucopia of personally identifying information, including gender, race, ethnicity, occupation, residence, familial relations, and religion. They were centralized in a single office in each officially recognized region of the Netherlands, all of which used the same systems so that the data was interoperable, ensuring that Lentz’s data was useful in civil governance and planning.</p>

<p>Lentz meticulously rationalized, standardized, and organized the Netherlands records held in that building at the intersection of Plantage Kerklaan and Plantage Middenlaan. Thanks to him, the comprehensive efficiency of the archives, which even incorporated special filing cabinets of his own patented design aimed at expediting searches and cross-checks, made it possible for the Netherlands to provide amply and justly for its citizens during the depths of the greatest economic crisis in modern world history. This aligned with Lentz’s vision of creating “the paper man.”<a>3</a> His work was recognized at the highest level by a royal award bestowed on him by no less a figure than nation’s queen.</p>

<p>The thoroughness and accessibility of the centralized registries throughout the Netherlands made them high-priority targets for capture by the Nazi invaders following their occupation of the Netherlands in May 1940. The Nazis understood their immense value in accelerating the hunt for Jews and other “undesirables”. Lentz himself was recognized as an especially valuable local asset. No sooner did the Dutch government capitulate than occupation authorities asked him to create a comprehensive national personal identity card that was extremely difficult to alter or forge. For Lentz, this, in fact, had been a pet project for years, one his superiors had consistently resisted as being “un-Dutch.” Now he was being asked to do it! He tackled the project with remarkable enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Soon, Lentz had cards that could be compared against the corresponding files in a central civil registry, which he had redesigned for accessory and access. Even if a card was forged, the registry was thus a backup. By September 1941, these cards and files included a thorough census of Dutch Jews, each of whom now carried a card emblazoned with a large letter J.</p>

<p>On the night of March 27-28, 1943, resistance operatives, some of whose names are incribed on that plaque, disguised themselves as local police officers, and, in a daring operation attempted to burn down the registry and the files it housed. Brilliantly planned and executed though it was, the attack fell short of achieving its objective. To be sure, some 800,000 identity cards fell victim to the flames and flood, but, that destruction only amounted to 15 percent of the registry’s records. It was soon back in business, and the Jewish genocide ramped up.</p>

<p>Lentz was arrested by Netherlands police in May 1945 for his collaboration with the Nazis and eventually sentenced to three years in prison. But it was far too late. This perfection of record keeping, this creation of a “paper man” who could be cross-referenced through a closely held certificate and a central registry, was core to the high rate of murder of the Netherlands’ Jews, which Prime Minister Rutte apologized for on that cold winter day in 2020.</p>

<p>This dark chapter should serve as a stark warning for our work on self-sovereign identity — as should the fact that things can be very different, as evidenced by a similar situation in France with a very different conclusion.</p>

 Subversive Systems: Carmille’s Quiet Resistance 

<p>In France, the story instead begins with René Carmille, an engineer, a World War I officer, and a spy for France’s Deuxième Bureau during the first World War. His own move toward the registration of identity came not because of the Great Depression, but instead the needs of the military.</p>

<p>Carmille’s work was founded on early punch-card technology, something that had also been used in The Netherlands, but was more central to Carmille’s work in France. By 1935, he was developing a registry for the French army that was to be used for conscription and mobilization. Carmille proposed a twelve-digit personal registration number as the core of this registry (which later became 13 digits after the occupation and division of France). This ID could be used to determine a person’s date of birth and place of birth, as well as a “complete personal profile”<a>4</a>, which included details on professional skills and well as other attributes.</p>

<p>By 1940, the Nazis were attempting to produce censuses of the Jews in France, but they were facing notable obstacles. Prime among them was the fact that the government had not polled on the question of religion since 1872 and had no interest in doing so now. There also weren’t sufficient electronic tabulators to catalogue the results from France’s immense population: France instead depended on Remington typewriters or even pen and paper for much of their tabulation.</p>

<p>Enter René Carmille. In November 1940, he created France’s “Demographic Service in Vichy”, opened offices on both sides of the occupation border running down the middle of France, contracted for 36 million Francs worth of tabulating machines, and announced plans for a new census of French citizens. He would replace the “anarchic” methodology that France had previously used to record census data with something more modern; afterward, French citizens would have to carry “uniform identity cards”, which linked to precise details on vocational expertise. Carmille’s new census would also reverse France’s long-standing omission of religious data by including data in “column 11” that would require participating Jews to not only report their own religion, but also that of their grandparents. Like Lentz, Carmille ultimately had his own version of a paper man, saying: “We are no longer dealing with general censuses, but we are really following individuals.”<a>5</a></p>

<p>It appeared to be exactly what the Nazis were seeking.</p>

<p>If Carmille had ever properly tabulated this data, the results likely would have been similar to those in the Netherlands: identity turned to discrimination and ultimately genocide. But, that didn’t happen. Instead, Carmille purposefully programmed his machines to never punch data for column 11 and hid more than 100,000 punched cards of Jews in his office. Call it an early form of data minimization and selective disclosure<a>6</a>. Carmille ensured that the personal data most likely to harm people was not made available to the people most likely to use it for harm.</p>

<p>There is some disagreement about Carmille’s role in the Vichy government and what damage he might have done there. However, the historical data seems to support him continuing to be a counter-intelligence officer, and that he purposefully sabotaged the census of the Jews while simultaneously using his data collection appartus to compile a listing of 800,000 French soldiers ready to rise up against the German occupation, 300,000 of them who were ready for near instaneous mobilization. Which was exactly what happened: on December 5, 1942, French troops captured the French National Statistics Service office in Algiers and used Carmille’s data to mobilize thousands of French troops.</p>

<p>René Carmille was arrested by the Nazis in February 1944, interrogated by a Nazi torturer, and sent to Dachau, where he died in January 1945. Though his work may have saved the lives of tens or even hundreds of thousands of Jews in France, it required sacrifice.</p>

<p>Once we collect identity data, its use is almost inevitable: pushing against that tide is the work of giants.</p>

 Two Models, One Truth 

<p>Self-sovereign identity has a dual nature.</p>

<p>On one hand, there exists a clear need for more defined identity. This was the main focus for self-sovereign identity when it was first discussed at <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/events/#rwot-2-id2020-2016">RWOT2</a> and <a href="https://id2020.org/">ID2020</a> in 2016. Then, one of our primary use cases was the stateless refugee who could be denied access to government services. It echoed (albeit with better foresight) the challenge that Jacobus Lentz faced with migration in the 1930s, when he put together a system to make sure all Dutch could have access to civic support during the Great Depression.</p>

<p>Conversely, there’s a call for minimizing identity data. This asks a crucial question that’s of both historical and ethical importance: What is the minimum identifying data access necessary to give you the right to be able to do things without unduly impinging on your privacy, dignity, and entitlement to respect? It builds on the truth the René Carmille discovered as he purposefully excluded religious information from his census: personal information can be dangerous, damaging, and even deadly.</p>

<p>Often, we share our personal details and other identity, erring on the side of oversharing, grounded in our current trust toward the data collector. The contrasting approaches of Lentz and Carmille demonstrate why that isn’t sufficient: the regime can always change. The intended use of data can be easily misinterpreted or manipulated. Lentz’s Great Depression data could be used by the Nazis to genocide Dutch Jews; and what the Nazis thought was their French Census Data could be used by Lentz to raise an army. And this isn’ just a historic concern: under Trump’s administration, there were similar attempts to repurpose the voluntary registrations of “Dreamers” from the previous administration, threatening residents who illegally entered the country as children with deportation.</p>

<p>Ultimately, data will be used to the fullest extent that it can be and it may be used for the worst purposes possible, entirely at odds with the original purpose of the collection. As architects of the next generation of self-sovereign identity systems, we must prioritize user empowerment, enabling each individual to fully control their identity. We have to think about strategies of data minimization and selective disclosure. We have to consider what data needs to be collected, and what does not. We do not want to make a new paper (electronic) man.</p>

<p>We must instead remember the past when identity was weaponized and six million and more died as a result. But we need to operationalize that remembrance by transforming it from reflection into a vision for the present and the future. Call it remembering forward. Call it foremembrance.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>The time for action is now. The dreams of self-sovereign identity that were first imagined at RWOT2 and ID2020 have been made realities by standards such as DIDs<a>7</a> and Verifiable Credentials<a>8</a>. Numerous companies have emerged to support these standards, while governments are beginning to adopt them. Simultaneously, the European Union is in the process of rolling out eIDAS<a>9</a> as an ecosystem of electronic identity. We are at a tipping point where the standards for future identity will be set in the days, months, and scant years ahead.</p>

<p>At this crossroads, we could go the way of recording too much information. We could create great honeypots of data for use or abuse by future regimes, or even by criminals. By recording our gender, our sexual orientation, our religion, our political affiliation, or even just our favorite books, movies, and songs, we could open ourselves up to future discrimination or worse. This would be the way of Lentz.</p>

<p>But there’s another path, one that normalizes the minimization of information. As self-sovereign identity designers, we must ask if we are protecting our users; we can do so by following <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">the original goals of self-sovereign identity</a>, by allowing the person represented by an identity to decide what information goes out. Simultaneously, we can do our best to influence the design of eIDAS and other more centralized systems to similarly adopt rules of data minimization and selective disclosure. This would be the way of Carmille.</p>

<p>We are a crucial crossroads in the design of digital identity. When the next history books are written, we must be Carmille, not Lentz.</p>

<p>Elastos’ groundbreaking <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastic-consensus-technical-overview/">Elastic Consensus</a> incorporates three core technologies: Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW), Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS), and Proof of Integrity (PoI). To celebrate our robust blockchain framework, recent partnership with <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/asset/elastos">Staking Rewards</a>, and the Elastos Growth team’s participation at the <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/summit">Staking Summit</a>, we have collaborated with <a href="https://www.morfyus.com/">Morfyus</a>—a blockchain-based social network and job platform—to commission three unique, limited edition Elastic Consensus NFTs. Additionally, we’ve infused these NFTs with special utility features! To recap, Elastos’ Elastic Consensus is a revolutionary blend of three synergistic mechanisms:</p>
 
  Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW): Leverages the hash power of Bitcoins miners to help secure the Elastos main chain at no extra cost. 
  Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS):&nbsp; Allows stakeholders to lock ELA and gain voting rights, based on which BPoS nodes work with Bitcoin miners to validate transactions. 
  Proof of Integrity (PoI): Establishes a democratic governance model, with community-elected council members validating Elastos’ sidechains and governance proposals. 
 
<p>The transition from DPoS to BPoS this year amplified the network’s security and participatory governance, making it a great opportunity to <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/now-is-a-good-time-to-be-a-validator-with-elastos-elastic-consensus/">become a validator</a> with Elastos’ Elastic Consensus, aligning with the ethos of blockchain democracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Celebrate with Elastic Consensus NFTs! 
<p>To celebrate, were created three distinct Elastic Consensus NFTs, each representing a pillar of our consensus mechanism and granting specific utilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Launch Date: LIVE!</p>
<p>Scarcity: 264 NFTs in total, 88 total of each.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A roundup of the most commonly asked questions on our Discord and Forum. If you have questions for the team please ask them on our <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Forum</a>. </p>  General FAQ <p></p> What is Ceramic? <p>Ceramic is a shared data network for managing verifiable data at scale, providing the trust of a blockchain with the flexibility of an event streaming system. Thousands of developers use it to manage reputation data, store attestations, log user activity, and build novel data infrastructure. Ceramic frees developers from the constraints of traditional data infrastructure, enabling them to tap into a shared data ecosystem and network effects, so they can focus on bringing their unique vision to life. </p> What is ComposeDB <p>ComposeDB, built on Ceramic, is a decentralized graph database that uses GraphQL to offer developers a familiar interface for interacting with data stored on Ceramic. This enables seamless data model publication, discovery, and reuse, fostering a composable data ecosystem.</p> What is the difference between Ceramic and ComposeDB? <p>ComposeDB provides a graph structure for interacting with data on the Ceramic network (i.e. native indexing). The nodes in the graph are ‘accounts’ or ‘documents’, each possessing a globally unique ID, while ‘edges’ are queryable relationships.You can read more about these concepts in our <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/core-concepts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">docs</a>.</p> Why did we choose GraphQL for ComposeDB? <p>We achieve interoperability with a wide ecosystem of existing programing environments by allowing GraphQL queries over JSON documents.</p> What is the difference between Ceramic and The Graph? <p>The Graph is a service indexing and querying data on L1 and L2 blockchains. You do not write data to The Graph, you write data to the blockchain and then query it with The Graph.</p><p>Ceramic is more like a decentralized version of a traditional database (like Postgres or MongoDB). It’s optimized for writes and speed. It provides its own built-in indexing and querying functionality (via ComposeDB).</p><p>The Graph is good for querying large amounts of data from blockchains. Ceramic is good for storing, managing and querying large amounts of data.</p> What makes Ceramic a better choice than alternatives?  What’s the difference between Ceramic and a traditional blockchain? <p>Unlike financial asset blockchains that rely on slow and unscalable synchronous global state changes, Ceramic uses fast, asynchronous, parallel transaction processing and eventual consistency to enable the scale and throughput needed by large data applications. </p><p>Current blockchain protocols cannot scale to support the level of processing needed for data applications, for the simple fact that there are so many data events occurring all day, every day, in every application. That’s why Ceramic’s data consensus properties can be treated differently than value consensus properties, like those you’d find on Bitcoin or an L2. Ceramic supports data that changes (i.e. mutable) with fast, decentralized, high-volume transaction processing.</p> What’s the difference between using Ceramic to store and query data and storing the data on the blockchain? <p>Ceramic shares many similarities with a blockchain, while simultaneously offering features that optimize for low-cost mutable data at scale, thus underlining key differences. Below are some similarities and differences:</p><p>Accounts: Ceramic uses the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/dids/introduction?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Decentralized Identifier</a> standard for user accounts (DID PKH and Key DID are supported in production). Similar to blockchains, they require no centralized party or registry. Additionally, both PKH DIDs and Key DIDs ultimately rely on public key infrastructure (PKH DIDs enable blockchain accounts to sign, authorize, and authenticate transactions, while Key DIDs expand cryptographic public keys into a DID document).</p><p>Signing Transactions: data in Ceramic (or streams) support <a href="https://chainagnostic.org/CAIPs/caip-74?ref=blog.ceramic.network">CACAO</a> (Chain Agnostic Capability Object), which enables the ability for one account to authorize another account to construct signatures over limited data on their behalf. Therefore, unlike manually signing individual transactions on a blockchain, Ceramic allows accounts to cryptographically authorize multiple writes in a given window, which is ideal for settings in which a database would be used to support user data that’s meant to change over time. These transactions also occur at no cost to individual users, which is yet another key difference between writing data to Ceramic vs. a blockchain.</p><p>Immutability: streams in Ceramic are organized into immutable event logs, with each commit representing an unchangeable, tamper-evident snapshot of a piece of data. Similar to how blockchains act as an immutable ledger revealing a history of the deterministic outputs of accounts transacting with other accounts and smart contracts, event logs in Ceramic give developers insight into both the immutable <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/data-provenance-composedb-as-an-authenticated-database/">data provenance</a> and lineage of data relevant to their users.</p><p>Querying: while developers can leverage libraries like <a href="https://web3js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web3.js</a> to read past transaction history or actively listen to transactions across accounts and contracts, blockchains (like Ethereum) do not offer native network support for querying or indexing blockchain data. This should come as no surprise - they are not designed to do this.Conversely, Ceramic is specifically designed to provide simple structure and open access to data events as they occur in the network, while simultaneously offering credibly decentralized qualities. </p><p>Ceramic’s underlying data structure (a self-certifying event log) also allows for endless database “flavors” to be built on top to further improve the developer experience. ComposeDB, for example, offers native GraphQL support, automatically splits read/write load capability, and allows developers to index on data “families” (or model instance documents related to preexisting schema definitions) across the network.</p> How much does it cost to use Ceramic Network? <p>At the moment, the only costs associated with building on Ceramic are the costs of running a Ceramic node on the cloud provider of your choice. The protocol doesn’t charge a direct fee nor are there any ecxplicit costs to store and load data from the network. This fee structure is subject to change as the Ceramic community may decide to support crypto-economic incentives and rewards.</p> Which blockchains does Ceramic support? <p>The standard use of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/122?ref=blog.ceramic.network">SIWX</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">CACAO</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DID:PKH</a>&nbsp;allows anyone to implement support for another blockchain or account type to authenticate and authorize writes to the Ceramic Network. Additionally a few standard interfaces enables you to implement an auth and verification library that allows anyone to use it with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did/tree/main/packages/did-session?ref=blog.ceramic.network"><code>did-session</code></a>, the primary library to use DID based accounts with Ceramic. There is just a few steps you have to take, outlined <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/dids/guides/add-chain-support?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p> Does Ceramic have a native token? <p>Ceramic does not currently have a native token.</p>  Technical FAQ <p></p> Do I have to run a node if I want to use ComposeDB? <p>It depends on your use case. If you just want to play around to learn and understand ComposeDB, it is not necessary to run a node. You can use our <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/sandbox/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Sandbox</a> or Wheel (which can run in memory). For development purposes, you can either use a third party node operator, such as <a href="http://hirenodes.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">hirenodes.io</a>, or run your own node (follow our guide <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/nodes?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>).</p> Is running a node a public, permission-less thing or does one need to sign up for it? <p>Running a node is permissionless! However, to anchor commits to mainnet, it is necessary to register your node’s DID with the Ceramic Anchor Service.</p> What are the benefits to running a node? <p>You have control over performance and costs of your own data without relying on others.</p> What operating system do I need to run a Ceramic node? <p>Currently, Ceramic nodes use Node.js, so any system that can run Node.js may be used. Ceramic nodes are most often run on Linux servers but have also been run on MacOS.To run on Windows we recommend using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux).</p> Is there an official RPC that can be used directly for Ceramic? <p>When used in a Web3 context, an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) node consists of a server that generally runs a protocol’s client software. An RPC endpoint is the network location that an application can access to perform requests (for example, dApp retrieving blockchain data for its users).The Ceramic Network does not currently offer hosted RPC node-running (and corresponding community endpoints) as a service. Instead, for both decentralization and performance purposes, we encourage developers to either <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-server/running-in-the-cloud?ref=blog.ceramic.network">run their own node</a> or work with a node-running service (such as <a href="https://hirenodes.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Hirenodes</a>) to set up performant and available endpoints for their applications.</p> What is a DID? <p>DID stands for Decentralized Identifier which is a W3 standard. Whenever a document is updated, it is signed by the user's DID, so that the ownership and provenance of all writes is verifiable.</p> What’s the “admin DID” for? <p>It’s the identity required on the “server” side of the ComposeDB to set up a composite for your node, which instructs your node which Models it should index. You can write data into your Ceramic node with any DID, but the admin DID is the only one able to change the set of Models used by the node.</p> What’s the difference between the “node DID” and the “admin DID”? <p>The Node DID is used for anchoring and the Admin DID is used to deploy composites.</p> Can I use an Ethereum address as a DID? <p>Yes you can! You can use Ethereum as well as Solana addresses via the <code>did:pkh</code> DID method. Check this <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/dids/authorization?ref=blog.ceramic.network">link</a> for details.</p> How do you run queries on ComposeDB? <p>ComposeDB is a graph database because the documents within it can reference other documents and form a graph, using GraphQL to query that relationship graph. You should reference supported <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/api/sdl/scalars?ref=blog.ceramic.network">scalars</a>.</p> Who can modify the data? <p>Each document in ComposeDB is represented by a Ceramic stream that has a single DID that is the controller. The controller DID is the only one allowed to write data into that stream and updates to the stream must be signed by the controller DID’s private key.</p> Is the data on Ceramic Network public or private? <p>All the data on Ceramic (including ComposeDB) is public by default. One can encrypt the data before putting it onto the network. You can follow the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/tutorial-encrypted-data-on-composedb/">Encrypted Data Tutorial</a> tutorial for one possible method and you can also utilize the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/lit-protocol-and-ceramic-integration-tutorial-storing-encrypted-data-on-composedb/">integration between Ceramic and Lit protocol</a>.</p> Can data be deleted on Ceramic Network? <p>All data written to Ceramic are signed payloads that are organized in the core data structure (a self-certifying event log) that the protocol relies on. </p><p>This structure relies on <a href="https://ipld.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">IPLD</a> content addressing to form an immutable log (on top of which applications, or databases like ComposeDB, can be built). Ceramic nodes also encompass several layers of the <a href="https://libp2p.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">libp2p</a> stack to help communicate stream updates in the network.</p><p>It’s important to understand how the services described above play an important role in answering the question of whether data on Ceramic can be deleted. While developers can pin streams on their node to prevent Ceramic’s default garbage collection behavior (and unpin, or discontinue indexing on models if using ComposeDB), data in its raw format may still be accessible within the IPFS network (though, if not pinned by any Ceramic nodes, it will effectively be “deleted” from the Ceramic network).</p> Do I need my private key to create a composite on ComposeDB? <p>Yes! While creating a composite, you sign some bytes with your private key. The signature becomes part of the composite. Don’t worry, private keys are not leaked through composites. We encourage making composites public.</p> Can you transfer the ownership of a stream on Ceramic Network? <p>Ceramic uses a DID as the controller of the stream. This means that if you use a DID that can be transferred you can transfer ownership by transferring the DID. Most of the time you will not need to transfer ownership, but rather sign a CACAO to grant some device or service the capabilities that you wish to delegate.</p> How can I incorporate ComposeDB into my dApp? <p>We have a starter application <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/launching-create-ceramic-app/">here</a>.</p> What is a CACAO? <p><a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/74?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Chain Agnostic Capability Object</a></p>  Company FAQ <p></p> What is the relationship between 3Box Labs and Ceramic? <p>While 3Box Labs is the original inventor of the Ceramic Network and have been integral to bootstrapping the Ceramic ecosystem, we're committed to migrating Ceramic to an independently-governed foundation and stepping back to play a reduced role over time. In a way, 3Box Labs is just like any other contributor to an early stage protocol.</p> What is the corporate structure of 3Box Labs? <p>3Box Labs is a US corporation registered in Delaware with employees and contractors located across the US and Europe.</p> How will Ceramic be governed? <p>Ceramic is already 100% open source, peer-to-peer software and anyone can participate in the network by simply running a Ceramic node. Formal governance of the network will progressively decentralize over time, eventually exiting to the community and a standalone foundation.</p>  💡  Have a question that’s not here?

<p>Canada’s trusted digital ID leader, the DIACC, releases its Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) Trust Registries Final Recommendation V1.0, signalling it’s ready for inclusion in their <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/">Certification Program</a>.</p>



<p>Why is the PCTF Trust Registries component important?</p>



<p>A Trust Registry is a critical component of the new and emerging decentralized digital identity architecture, playing a crucial role in establishing and maintaining trust in digital identity ecosystems, especially regarding identity verification and authentication. The Trust Registries component provides conformance criteria for the development and certification of Governance Requirements (business structure, ecosystem scope, governance processes, policies, and standards), Trust Registry Operations (technology &amp; infrastructure management and technical services), and Registration and Certification Management (certification/verification/trustmark services, registration, suspension, and revocation processes), to ensure that a Trust Registry is, in fact, trustworthy.</p>



<p>What problems does the PCTF Trust Registries component solve?</p>



<p>Digital identity ecosystems and their associated Trust Registries use a Trust Framework (such as the PCTF) to define how ecosystem actors like Issuers, Verifiers, Holders, and Digital Wallets should or must operate to be considered trustworthy. As an essential requirement in the decentralized identity architecture, with its interconnection with many Holders, Digital Wallets, Issuers, Verifiers, and other Trust Registries, ecosystems must strive for interoperability (locally, regionally, and internationally). Adherence to standards and frameworks must be a prioritized goal for ecosystem governance organizations, which is reflected in many of the criteria of the Trust Registries component.</p>



<p>Who does the PCTF Trust Registries component help?</p>



<p>The PCTF Trust Registries component is a valuable resource for entities to use as guidance to develop their Trust Registries. Entities with Trust Registries currently in use can leverage the conformance criteria as a risk management tool to ensure their registry is as robust as possible. Having an organization’s Trust Registry certified through DIACC’s <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/">Voila Verified Certification Program</a> sends a clear market signal that the certified Trust Registry is reliable, secure, and can be used confidently.</p>

<p>The importance of trust in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to dominate the headlines — whether it’s the challenges of managing intellectual property or the tendency of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to produce errors or “hallucinations.” Only a few days ago we saw Elon Musk enter this field with xAI’s Grok and in an interview with Lex Fridman he highlighted the importance of receiving responses you can trust when interacting with AI&nbsp;products</p><p>“…it (LLM) unfortunately hallucinates most when you least want it to hallucinate. When you’re asking the important and difficult questions that’s where it tends to be confidently wrong. So we’re really trying hard to say how do we be as grounded as possible so you can count on the results?”</p><p>The truth, however, is an elusive concept, especially if attempted to be captured by a single organization/product. A better approach is through connectivity and transparency achieved by leveraging multiple open source technologies. Turing Award winner Dr. Bob Metcalfe explained this idea,&nbsp;saying,</p><p>“… through connectivity, decentralized knowledge graphs, blockchains and AI are converging — and it’s an important convergence, because it is going to help us with one of the biggest problems we have nowadays, which is the&nbsp;truth.”</p><p>OriginTrail has been, since inception, committed to fighting one of truth’s greatest arch-nemesis — misinformation. It continues on this mission in the age of AI, where the misinformation problem is growing exponentially. The growing challenges, however, also offer a growing field of opportunities, which are being unlocked with OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) used as foundation for verifiable web.</p><p>The key building blocks of the verifiable web have become available with the V6 of the OriginTrail DKG which enabled some of the most notable achievements of the Turing phase which were showcased on the Decentralized Knowledge Graph conference (DKGcon) in early October and which to date produced around two million AI-ready Knowledge Assets.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ekG1Bl-tCjc?si=Vu_nPLJ7MfdpPl4f&amp;t=622">DKGcon - Decentralized Knowledge Graph Conference</a></p><p>The Turing phase achievements also showed how the OriginTrail DKG acts as an enabler, rather than a competitor to the AI systems created by Microsoft, Google and xAI. Through the ChatDKG framework initiative we have seen the first version of <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/af4b5a7a-040b-47d2-9ac6-cf073967c51a">Microsoft Copilot</a>, integrations with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLofzKfAOLY">GoogleAI</a> and xAI enablement already being researched as a part of the Metcalfe&nbsp;phase.</p>Enabler, not a competitor of the likes of Microsoft, Google,&nbsp;xAI. Metcalfe phase — growing knowledge by a&nbsp;100.000x <p><a href="https://youtube.com/live/8kw7Y3PauHI?feature=share">Metcalfe phase - fighting misinformation with decentralized AI</a></p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/ecosystem/roadmap">The Metcalfe phase of the updated roadmap</a> pursues an ambitious goal of creating the world’s largest verifiable web for AI consisting of 100 billion Knowledge Assets, bringing a 100.000x scalability increase. As the name of the phase suggests, it will seek to produce network effects across the OriginTrail DKG and use novel techniques to pursue autonomous DKG growth based on the genesis knowledge foundation being created by <a href="https://origintrail.io/ecosystem/landscape">organizations and individuals alike.</a> The genesis part of the Metcalfe’s phase also introduces knowledge mining and knowledge signaling capabilities to drive constant growth of the Verifiable Web.</p><p>Following the Genesis stage and the transition to an AI-native V8, further capabilities will become available in the Convergence stage. By leveraging the advancements in AI and the DKG, we will unlock autonomous knowledge mining which in turn leads to an autonomous DKG. At that stage, new knowledge gets added to the DKG with very limited human involvement. Services such as AI agents will be performing knowledge inferencing directly on the DKG to find any “blind spots” in the knowledge they can fill as well as search for new knowledge and bring it to the DKG in accordance with knowledge signaling.</p> First steps into the Metcalfe phase start&nbsp;today <p>The Metcalfe phase activities are already on the way and today, two important updates become available in their beta versions:</p>  <a href="https://world.origintrail.io/">OriginTrail World</a> — the first version of the platform that will combine all relevant knowledge about OriginTrail technology and how to use it, including integration guidelines with other products on the&nbsp;market.  <a href="https://twitter.com/ChatDKG">ChatDKG on X</a> — the beta version of ChatDKG running on X platform that you can use to prompt and receive responses based on the knowledge that is available in the DKG. The first version is currently ring-fenced on knowledge available in the OriginTrail World platform, and the demo dataset of the chatAnalyst.ai product covering Tesla’s SEC filings and quarterly reports. ChatDKG on X starts by supporting 100 prompts daily and also comes with a possibility to subscribe for the first version of Knowledge Mining — all the details are available directly on the ChatDKG&nbsp;links.  <p>Go ahead, tweet a question and tag @ChatDKG on X to test it&nbsp;out.</p>This is just the beginning of the exciting journey.

<p>The OASIS Board of Directors are integral to the organization's success. Read our Q&amp;A to gain a better sense of who they are and why they serve the OASIS community.</p> 


<p>Meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anishkarmarkar/">Anish Karmarkar, Ph.D.</a>, an accomplished software professional whose career spans over two decades in the computer software industry. Anish’s active involvement in diverse Working Groups, Technical Committees, and Expert Groups serves as a testament to his unwavering commitment to advancing innovation.</p>



<p>What can you tell us about your current role?<br>I’m a Senior Director in the Standards Strategy and Architecture team that reports directly to the Chief Corporate Architect at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/standards/">Oracle</a>. We are responsible for overseeing our participation in technical standards and standards setting organizations across all business units and geographies. This involves coordinating with internal stakeholders in business units and working with developers, executives, and legal and policy professionals to create and execute coherent strategies.</p>



<p>My work also involves getting directly engaged in standards activities of strategic interests and representing Oracle in standards setting organizations at the managerial, governance, oversight, policy, and technical level. We serve as a point of contact for standards related matters and communication.</p>



<p>What inspired you to join the OASIS Board of Directors?<br>OASIS has a very important role to play in the standards and open source ecosystem and to that end it is important to have a strong, capable, and experienced Board of Directors to oversee it. I believe my experience and passion for standards and standards setting organizations allows me to contribute to OASIS’ continued success.</p>



<p>Additionally, my team at Oracle is very supportive of me taking this role, as Oracle values industry-driven consensus standards and has been a supporter of OASIS for decades, going back to the days of ODF, SAML, and XACML. OASIS standards are important to their products and to their customers. Oracle continues to participate in various cloud- and security-related Technical Committees (TC) such as <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=csaf">CSAF</a> and <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=virtio">VIRTIO</a>.</p>



<p>What has been your involvement at OASIS?<br>I became involved in OASIS during the heydays of XML standards. Along with <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> and <a href="https://www.omg.org/">OMG</a>, this is where I cut my standards-teeth. I always liked the openness, the transparency, the people involved in OASIS, and the attitude of enabling everyone to bring their ideas forward. OASIS always had the principle of letting a thousand flowers bloom and allowing the market to decide what is adopted and what can achieve success.</p>



<p>I’ve been actively engaged in a technical capacity in OASIS since 2003. I’ve been a contributor to eleven different OASIS TCs, editor of several OASIS specifications, and co-chair of three TCs. I did some work on the Service Component Architecture (SCA) under the Open Composite Services Architecture (Open CSA) Member Section and was a member of the Open CSA’s Steering Committee. I also played a role in facilitating the transfer of work from an organization called Web Services Interoperability (<a href="http://ws-i.org/">WS-I</a>). It involved transferring their specifications, IPR, and funds to OASIS for future development and maintenance. This was overseen by the OASIS WS-I Member Section and I served on its Steering Committee.</p>



<p>What types of skills/expertise do you bring to the OASIS Board?<br>More than 25 years ago I was involved in implementing standards from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Computing_Environment">OSF/DCE</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pthreads">POSIX pthreads</a>. Since then, I have been involved with standards development and implementation in a technical, managerial, governance, policy, and leadership capacity. In 2022, ANSI named me a recipient of the <a href="https://www.ansi.org/standards-news/all-news/2022/08/8-10-22-ansi-announces-recipients-of-the-2022-leadership-and-service-awards">Meritorious Service Award</a> in recognition of my record of significant contribution to voluntary standards. My experiences and perspectives as a contributor, author, editor, chair, member of various boards, and executive and leadership positions at different standards-setting organizations give me valuable expertise crucial for serving on the OASIS Board of Directors. As OASIS builds on its successes and charts its future for its fourth decade in the ever-changing world of IT, I hope my broad experience and perspective in standards along with my skills in collaboration strategies, enterprise software development, and architecture can contribute to the organization’s endeavors.</p>



<p>How do you hope to make an impact as a board member during your term?<br>I hope to leverage my experiences from other SSOs/SDOs in implementing general best practices to make OASIS an even better organization. I think OASIS is truly in a unique place because it bridges both open source and open standards. As a member of the OASIS Board Governance, Finance, and Process Committees I hope to have an impact on the organization by advocating for changes that I think would make OASIS a better place for collaborations on standards and open source.</p>



<p>The current Board, I’m glad to say, brings different perspectives and representatives to the table. From large companies to SMEs to start-ups, academia to industry, and from North America to Europe, we bring much-needed diverse experiences and points of view. I believe this brings together a complementary set of skills needed for fiduciary and strategic oversight of an organization like OASIS.</p>



<p>What excites you about OASIS and why are you passionate about its mission?<br>OASIS has the right processes in place and the right IPR policies, including the much-preferred royalty-free option. OASIS is a flexible SDO with light-weight processes that places minimal constraints on its TCs. OASIS allows ideas to flourish and lets implementers and industry decide what makes sense. If it gains traction it thrives, else it withers. That’s how it is supposed to work. There is no top-down planning or architecture that is imposed. We are fortunate to have an Executive Director, Francis Beland, who brings a wealth of diverse experiences. With Francis at the helm, we are presented with exciting opportunities to forge ahead and gain traction in new and different areas.</p>



<p>OASIS and its community are open, welcoming, and transparent—key aspects for successful collaborations. If you want standards with Open Source implementations it is important that the community and standards be open, transparent, and have no-cost and readily available specifications. At every stage in OASIS processes, specifications are freely and readily available with the ability for the public to comment. In addition, all the technical discussions, issues, and progress are made publicly. It is also important to point out that the entry point for initiating projects at OASIS is low and one can go from chartering a new TC to finalizing the standard in a short time, assuming that there is consensus in the community.</p>



<p>What are some reasons why companies, organizations, and individuals should bring their projects to OASIS?<br>Participating in OASIS offers a multitude of benefits. OASIS has pathways to get an OASIS standard to be an <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">ISO</a>, <a href="https://www.iec.ch/homepage">IEC</a>, or an <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx">ITU</a> standard, which is particularly valuable if you want regulations to be based on international standards. OASIS is an approved ISO/IEC JTC 1 PAS submitter organization, which means it has met all the criteria set by JTC 1. This allows OASIS to submit its standards to JTC 1 for approval by its members. Once approved, the standards get the ISO and IEC imprimatur.</p>



<p>If you look at the World Trade Organization (WTO)’s <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tbt_e/tbt_e.htm">Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement</a>, it encourages international standards as a basis for regulation—that means the big “I” standards: ISO, IEC, and ITU . OASIS has the ability to make its standards an ISO standard, an IEC standard, and/or an ITU standard, making this a significant advantage of participating in OASIS activities.</p>



<p>As a thirty-year-old organization there is a lot to talk about. From ebXML, ODF, UBL, DocBook, XACML, and SAML, to the various current security-related standards and projects, OASIS is a mature and proven organization that allows both open standards and open source to work well together. This is not easy if you think about the agreements that you need to have in place, for example, to deal with IPR issues. OASIS allows one to do that through Open Projects. Add to that the openness, transparency, royalty-free IPR and lightweight developer friendly processes and you have an organization that should be on everyone’s list for collaboration.</p>



<p>Do you have an impact story regarding your work in open source or open standards, or work that you’ve done at OASIS?<br>While I’ve been on the OASIS Board since 2021, I got involved in OASIS in 2003 working on various XML-based Web services standards (WS-RM, WS-RX, WS-TX, WSRF and WSN). Around 2006 I got involved in the Service Component Architecture effort (SCA-Assembly, SCA-Policy, SCA-BPEL, SCA-J, and SCA-Bindings) including the related OpenCSA Member Section. I was also involved in bringing Web Services Interoperability work to OASIS and was involved in the WS-I BRSP work and its associated WS-I Member Section and its Steering Committee. In 2012, I was one of the proposers for the CAMP TC, which was an early attempt to bring standards to cloud computing. I ended being its main editor and later its chair.</p>



<p>What trends or changes do you see in the industry that are most exciting? <br>Globally, various jurisdictions are worried about their citizens’ data and their location. There are concerns around security, privacy, and data locality. There is a possibility of fragmentation of approaches taken around the world. Standards can help address this and OASIS can position itself as a leader in this space. I think Francis Beland has some great ideas regarding OASIS’ future. There is a need for standards in several verticals, OASIS should target some of them; perhaps health care and health informatics could be a start. Globally we have a lot of challenges with respect to climate change and issues around ESG (environmental, social &amp; governance) and AI. Several technologies could play a role in this space. For example, ensuring that supply chains adhere to specific ESG related standards is just one example among many.</p>



<p>Can you tell us about a role model you’ve had in your career?<br>There are far too many to list here and I’m afraid I’m going to miss mentioning someone. But all of them have taught me to become more curious. Some of them have taught me how to take the “forest view” and look at things strategically, especially as it applies to my role as a Board member. They have also taught me how to collaborate better, transforming it to a win-win situation, and more importantly how to make the world slightly better every day.</p>



<p>Best piece of advice that you’ve received so far?<br>It is always a group effort and one can achieve anything if they are willing to give the credit to someone else. As someone who focuses on collaboration, this advice has served me well.</p>



<p>What’s a fun fact about you?<br>I like to run and cross-country ski. I’ve run three marathons (so far) and several half-marathons. I find that running gives me time and space to relax and think. I like training for a race more than the actual race. My long weekend runs are just about unwinding, endorphins, and the pleasure of being outside being physically active after being in front of a screen all the time. One other fun fact about me is that I play a percussion instrument called the tabla, which is used in Indian classical music. I’m not very good at it, but it is great fun to listen and play it.</p>

<p>Initial considerations for an electronic patient record (EPR) began around 2005, and the <a href="https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/de/home/gesetze-und-bewilligungen/gesetzgebung/gesetzgebung-mensch-gesundheit/gesetzgebung-elektronisches-patientendossier.html">Federal Act on the Electronic Patient Record</a> (EPDG in German) entered into force on April 15, 2023. Often criticized as «PDF graveyard», in mid-2023 the EPR only holds around 20,000 records, or 2 permille of the population, for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>To improve this unsatisfactory situation, the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) conducted a <a href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/de/consultation-procedures/ended/2023#https://fedlex.data.admin.ch/eli/dl/proj/2022/97/cons_1">consultation</a> on a comprehensive revision of the EPDG from June to October 2023. Due to the political processes, an update of the EPDG is not expected until 2028 at the earliest.</p>
<p>Alongside many other organizations, DIDAS also submitted a statement as part of this consultation, the most important points of which are listed below:</p>
 
 Person centric in order to grant every citizen access to her or his complete health data 
 Technology neutrality in order to take into account future wallet-based solutions 
 Openness and standards to ensure the highest possible level of interoperability 
 Immediate measures to generate benefits before 2028

 Optimize the page for generating access keys in the DID web service. 
 Resolve the issue in the DID web service where the Issuer is incorrectly displayed when importing VCs. 
 Fix the issue in the DID web service where the imported Identity Root is not displayed on the import/export page. 
 Address compatibility issues in getting the browser name, as some browsers show undefined names in the user activities list. 
 Continue importing UI/UX designs to update the front-end implementation of the DID web service. 
 Update deployment in staging and production environments. 
 
<p>Essentials</p>
 
 Resolve the issue with NTF trading not being possible on OpenSea. 
 Update the integration of kyc-me. 
 Accumulated bug fixes. 
 Test and release version 3.0.13 of Web3Essentials. 
 
<p>Kyc-me</p>
 
 Resolve the issue where the kyc-me app icon is not displayed when logging in using the Web3Essentials wallet or DID web service. 
 Fix the issue where there is no pop-up prompt when the scanned identity document photo is placed too far or too close, preventing further verification steps. 
 The kyc-me service backend has added an interface to clear users’ cached data, supporting front-end clearance of cached user data through API calls. 
 Increase the OCR return parameter Confidence value to 0.93 to filter out some cases where individuals are incorrectly identified as non-document holders (though the final tests still occasionally result in incorrect identifications). 
 Update the kyc-me test environment for further testing and verification. 
 Optimize the kyc-me code implementation based on testing suggestions. 
 Begin assessing kyc-me support for Desktop Browsers. 
 
<p>Carrier</p>

<p>In a significant milestone for the digital asset community, <a href="https://ela.city/home">Elacity</a> has officially released its much-anticipated whitepaper “The Access Economy in Web3”, marking a new chapter in the management and monetisation of non-financial digital assets. This release not only demonstrates Elacity’s innovative approach to digital rights management but also highlights its strategic incorporation of <a href="https://elastos.info/manifesto/">Elastos technology.</a></p>
<p>Elacity Founder Sash stated, “In 2018, I created a basic graphic that stated ‘Elacity – peer-to-peer digital marketplace’. First came our NFT marketplace supporting art markets, and for over the last year and a half, we’ve been engineering our upcoming access economy innovation, setting the stage to revolutionise how digital rights and assets are managed online using Elastos SmartWeb technology. This is completely custom-built and a framework which can be expanded to grow markets for all types of digital assets in the years ahead. I appreciate everyone who has believed in our team and been with us to date. Our upcoming MVP will be released in December, and it will open a new door for supporting online user-owned markets. We will continue to expand business models, digital assets, and integrate partners to drive markets. I encourage everyone to understand what we’ve engineered and what’s to come”.</p>
<p>At its heart, Elacity’s Access Economy mission is to revolutionise how digital assets are accessed, traded, and monetised. The fundamental question they address is: How can we ensure the security, scarcity, and value of digital assets in an increasingly digital world? By reimagining digital assets like audio, video or software as secure, tradable, and exclusive ‘Digital Capsules’, Elacity answers this by providing creators and asset owners with unprecedented control and monetisation opportunities, powered by Elastos’ SmartWeb technology.</p>
<p>The whitepaper provides a comprehensive view of Elacity’s Access Economy Protocol (AEP). The whitepaper is more than a technical document; it’s a blueprint for a new digital economy where access equates to ownership and every creator or asset owner is empowered to participate in a fair, global marketplace.</p>
<p>As we celebrate this significant release, we invite you to delve deeper into the Elacity ecosystem by reading the whitepaper. Whether you’re a content creator, a digital asset owner, or someone interested in the future of digital rights management, this whitepaper offers valuable insights into a world where digital asset management is secure, equitable, and user-centric.

<p>Those are a little too Ayn Randy for me. So I tried just “Empowered individuals,” and got <a href="https://www.bing.com/images/create/individual-empowerment-and-agency-on-a-scale-we27ve/654ffe8b1f794fb8b5819f691333d40e?FORM=GUH2CR">this</a>—</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bing.com/images/create/individual-empowerment-and-agency-on-a-scale-we27ve/654ffe8b1f794fb8b5819f691333d40e?FORM=GUH2CR"></a></p>
<p>—which is almost the ulta-woke opposite of the first one.</p>
<p>But never mind that. Let’s talk about individual empowerment with AI help. Here’s my personal punch list:</p>
 
 Health. Make sense of all my health data. Suck it in from every medical care provider I’ve ever had, and help me make decisions bases on it. Also help me share it on an as-needed basis with my current providers. 
 Finances. Pull in and help me make sense of my holdings, obligations, recurring payments, incomes, whatever. Match my orders and shipments from Amazon and other retailers with the cryptic entries (always in ALL CAPS) on my credit card bills. I want to run every receipt I collect through a scanner that does OCR for my AI, which will know what receipt is for what, where it goes in the books it helps me keep, and yearly helps me work through my taxes. The list can go on. 
 Property. What have I got? I want to point my phone camera at everything that a good AI can possibly recognize, and make sense of all that too. Know all the books on my shelves by reading their spines. Know my furniture, the stuff in my basement. Help me keep records of my car’s history after I give it the VIN number I photographed under the windshield, and run all the records I’ve kept in the glove box through the same scanner I mentioned above. Whatever. Why not? 
 Correspondence. I have half a million emails here, going back to 1995. (Wish it went back farther.) Lots of texts too, in lots of systems. Help me do a better job of looking back though those than my various clients do. Help me cross-reference those with events I attended and other stuff I may be relevant to some current inquiry. 
 Contacts. Who do I have in my various directories? How many entries are wrong in one way or another? Go through and correct them, AI helper, based on whatever clever new algorithm works for that. 
 Calendar. Tell me where I was on a given day, what I was doing, and who I was with. Knowing all that other personal data (above) will help too. 
 Business relationships. Look into all my subscriptions and help me <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2021/05/25/solving-subscriptions/">fight the fuckery</a> behind nearly all of them. Make better sense of all the loyalty programs I’m involved with, and help me unfuck those too, since most of them are about entrapment rather than real loyalty. 
 Other involvements. What associations do I belong to? How deeply am I involved with any or all of them? Can we drop some? Add some? Have some insights into how those are going, or should go? 
 Travel. I have 1.6 million miles with United Airlines alone. Where did I go? When? Why ? What did I pay? Are there ways to improve my relationships with airlines and other entities (e.g. car rental agencies, Uber/Lyft, AirBnB, cruise lines)? 
 
<p>Our lives are packed with too much data for our mere human minds alone to fully comprehend and put to use. AI is perfect for that. So bring it on.</p>
<p>And don’t bet that any of the bigs, including OpenAI, to give you anything on the punch list above*. They’re too big, too centralized, too stuck in a mainframe paradigm. They look for what only they can do for you, rather than what you can do for yourself—or do better with your own damn AI.</p>
<p>Personal AI today is where personal computing was fifty years ago. We don’t yet have the Apple II, the Osborne, the TRS-80, the Commodore PET, much less the IBM&nbsp; PC or the Macintosh. We just have big companies with big everything,&nbsp; with hooks for developers. And soon an app store (also announced in Sam Altman’s keynote).</p>
<p>Real personal AI is a huge greenfield. Going there is also, to switch metaphors, a blue ocean strategy. <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2020/10/26/blue/">Wrote about that here</a>.</p>
 
<p>*Except by pouring all that data into their LLM. Not yours.</p>

Lissi GmbH founders Adrian Doerk, Helge Michael and Sebastian Bickerle (from left to&nbsp;right) Frankfurt am Main, November 13th,&nbsp;2023 <p>[Press release also <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/eidas-2-0-mit-lissi-neosfer-ausgr%C3%BCndung-setzt-auf-digitale-identit%C3%A4t-mit-europ%C3%A4ischen-id-wallets-ae045d14211f">available in&nbsp;German</a>]</p><p>Lissi, known as a pioneer in identity wallets and verifiable credentials, announces its establishment as an independent startup, supported by investments from neosfer, 9.5 Ventures and the managing directors. The spin-off is also a milestone for neosfer, which launched Lissi in 2019. For Commerzbank’s innovation unit, it is the first spin-off of a self-developed project.</p><p>With its Lissi software platform, Lissi offers a comprehensive range of solutions designed to issue, store and verify verifiable credentials and thus enable trustworthy interactions with identity wallets according to European standards. The European Union has recently <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_5651">welcomed a final agreement of the eIDAS 2.0 regulation</a> to introduce European Digital Identity Wallets (EUDI) across the European Union. This opens up a whole new market for Lissi. The company’s vision is to become the leading software provider for trusted interactions between organisations and EUDI-Wallet users. The focus is on offering software for interaction with EUDI-Wallets and extensive functions that go beyond the standard protocols proposed by the European&nbsp;Union.</p>Lissi GmbH&nbsp;logo<p>The founders Helge Michael, Sebastian Bickerle and Adrian Doerk explain: “We are proud to make a decisive contribution to strengthening trust in our increasingly digital society. The path to the future is already lined with promising collaborations, including municipal use cases with the cities of Cologne, Leipzig and Dresden as well as various use cases with major banks such as Commerzbank AG and ING Deutschland. These early adopters will benefit from improved process efficiency, reduced paperwork and higher data quality, resulting in significant time and cost savings.”</p><p>Kai Werner and Matthias Lais, Managing Directors of neosfer: “The spin-off is proof of the entrepreneurial innovation strength that is realised in the neosfer innovation unit. The spin-off of Lissi is a major milestone for us. It confirms how important it is to give new ideas and approaches space and structure for their development. We are delighted that our innovation unit has succeeded in doing just that.” The close collaboration with neosfer as one of the main investors will continue in the future. The founders are also supported by the venture capital firm 9.5 Ventures, which firmly believes that the management will revolutionise the design of trust-based digital interactions in personal and business processes.</p><p>Since its foundation as part of neosfer in 2019, Lissi has initiated and led the IDunion research project, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action. This is a community of 70 partners and over 350 individual contributors, including well-known companies such as Bundesdruckerei, Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Bahn and DATEV e.G. Lissi has already implemented 35 pilot projects and received the prestigious Handelsblatt Diamond Award, which emphasises its commitment to the further development of digital&nbsp;trust.</p><p>We invite the press to engage with the future of digital identity in Europe and offer our perspective to complement your stories and encourage interested organisations to explore the potential of ID-Wallets together with&nbsp;Lissi.</p><p>For more information, please visit our website <a href="http://www.lissi.id/">www.lissi.id</a><br>For press enquiries please contact: info@lissi.id</p> About neosfer <p><a href="https://neosfer.de/">neosfer</a> is the early-stage investor and innovation unit of Commerzbank Group.

Die Ausgründung ist auch ein Meilenstein für neosfer, in dessen Rahmen Lissi im Jahr 2019 startete. Für die Innovationseinheit der Commerzbank handelt es sich um die erste Ausgründung eines selbst entwickelten Projekts.</p><p>Lissi bietet mit seiner Lissi Software-Plattform ein umfassendes Lösungsangebot, das darauf ausgelegt ist, verifizierbare Nachweise auszustellen, zu speichern und zu verifizieren und damit vertrauenswürdige Interaktionen mit Identitäts-Wallets nach Europäischen Standards zu ermöglichen. Die Europäische Union hat kürzlich eine <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_5651">Einigung über die eIDAS 2.0-Verordnung</a> zur Einführung von Europäischen digitalen Identitäts-Wallets (EUDI) in der gesamten Europäischen Union verabschiedet.

Der Weg in die Zukunft ist bereits von vielversprechenden Kooperationen gesäumt, darunter kommunale Anwendungsfälle mit den Städten Köln, Leipzig und Dresden sowie diverse Anwendungsfälle mit der Commerzbank AG und der ING Deutschland. Diese Early Adopters werden von verbesserter Prozesseffizienz, geringerem Papieraufwand und höherer Datenqualität profitieren, was zu erheblichen Zeit- und Kosteneinsparungen führt.”</p><p>Kai Werner und Matthias Lais, Geschäftsführer von neosfer: „Die Ausgründung ist ein Beleg für die unternehmerische Innovationskraft, die in der Innovationseinheit neosfer realisiert wird. Für uns ist die Ausgründung von Lissi ein großer Meilenstein. Sie bestätigt, wie wichtig es ist, neuen Ideen und Ansätzen Raum und Struktur für ihre Entwicklung zu geben. Wir freuen uns sehr, dass genau dies im Rahmen unserer Innovationseinheit gelungen ist.” Auch in Zukunft wird die enge Zusammenarbeit mit neosfer als einem der Hauptinvestoren fortgesetzt. Unterstützt werden die Gründer zudem von der Venture Capital Firma 9.5 Ventures, die fest daran glaubt, dass das Management die Gestaltung vertrauensbasierter digitaler Interaktionen in persönlichen und geschäftlichen Prozessen revolutionieren wird.</p><p>Seit seiner Gründung als Teil von neosfer im Jahr 2019 hat Lissi das IDunion Forschungsprojekt, welches durch das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz gefördert wird, initiiert und leitet es seitdem.

We must hold both ideas at the same time as we think about what we, and our kids, need to know about AI, its negatives and positives.</p><p>A tools and weapons approach is a useful rubric for thinking about what guidance about the power and opportunity afforded by AI — broadly, what media literacy — we all&nbsp;need.</p><p>Here’s what I believe we need to consider in making media literacy effective for young&nbsp;people.</p> The Underlying Tenets of <a href="https://namle.net/resources/media-literacy-defined/">Media Literacy</a> Still Hold&nbsp;True <p>I created and currently produce two media literacy series for PBS KIDS — <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/search-it-up">Search It Up</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa8HWWMcQEGQ_wCRS1ybsZ-xPYsQd4G9y">Ruff Ruffman: Humble Media Genius</a> — as part of my 25 years producing digital content for public media at GBH in Boston. We are using new episodes to showcase what AI is and what it can do, including how kids are using it to make art and text. I’m also working with my colleagues at the Berkman Klein Center on several media literacy initiatives around generative artificial intelligence.</p><p>Adults are excited, intrigued, amused, or are wringing their hands in equal measure around the growth of advanced computing and tools that can generate original text, images, audio, or video — loosely called generative AI. But what does this really mean in the context of&nbsp;kids?</p><p>In talking to young people, I get a sense that they need as much support in understanding AI as we adults do. And maybe they now need a tad more as generative AI further blends into their technology-rich lives.</p><p>They still need to know how media is made, that they themselves can make media, and that it has a purpose — even if it’s AI-assisted.</p><p>So, let’s start with some context: What do these three have in common?<br>The government.<br>An everyday person.<br>Elon&nbsp;Musk.</p><p>The answer is that they are the most common responses I’ve found in talking to 5th graders about who is responsible for what they find on the internet. There’s a similar range of replies when these 10-year-olds are asked who fact-checks the internet. Popular answers here include the government, no-one, and the ubiquitous Mr.&nbsp;Musk.</p><p>These kids are often called “digital natives” — born long after the demise of rotary phones, dial-up, Blockbuster, Myspace, and waiting for a letter in the mail. They are deemed native as if they are somehow born with an ability to reset the router or to attach PDFs to emails. I think they are not. Fish are surrounded by water but may be able to tell you little about it. Our young people need to learn, or be shown, how to stay safe online and how to benefit from the many opportunities access to boundless information affords.</p>Ruff Ruffman: Humble Media Genius. Image courtesy of&nbsp;GBH.<p>It’s worth noting that AI is not new. It’s in many of the tools that have been in our hands for a while. For instance, Siri uses predictions to complete a text — and has been trying to break up my marriage long before it was fashionable for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-transcript.html">more advanced AI</a> to do so. (“I’m in the woods with Natalie,” I texted my wife when she was out of town. My English accent and flaws in Siri’s speech recognition had turned our dog, Nellie, with whom I was enjoying a woodland adventure, into Natalie, my daughter’s twentysomething math coach, with whom I was&nbsp;not.)</p><p>Kids are already using AI every day if they’re online or on their phones. What do they actually know about it? The following responses are from 10-year-olds:</p><p>“It’s really smart, it’s so smart it can go to websites in its memory chip; it can take all the information and put it inside its brain.”<br>OK, that’s a little robot overlord-y, but it’s&nbsp;close.</p><p>“It’s not good the first time, it learns as it plays.”<br>That’s pretty much exactly how AI has beaten grandmasters in <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ais-victories-in-go-inspire-better-human-game-playing/">Go</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-ibms-deep-blue-beat-world-champion-chess-player-garry-kasparov">Chess</a>, and <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ibm-watson-the-inside-story-of-how-the-jeopardy-winning-supercomputer-was-born-and-what-it-wants-to-do-next/">Jeopardy</a>.</p><p>“The AI is making the picture, and the AI is coded by humans.”<br>That’s a pretty accurate view of generative art, although it bypasses issues of intellectual property. And of course, these new images based on real people are now pretty convincing. I still can’t believe that the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/movies/keanu-reeves-deepfake-account-is-so-good-it-has-fans-wondering-if-its-really-the-actor">deepfakes of Keanu</a> are not Keanu. But maybe I don’t want to believe they’re&nbsp;fake.</p><p>As I share this now, it’s worth noting that we sometimes deliberately share fake information just as willingly as if we know it to be true. This is one of the confounding challenges around stemming more harmful misinformation and disinformation.</p>Image by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@unreal_keanu">@unreal_keanu</a> via&nbsp;TikTok.<p>“If it can tell you are sick with a disease of some sort and can tell you about it before it gets too serious by noticing unusual things that don’t always happen on a daily basis.”<br>This is a great encapsulation of the medical world’s hope for AI, with already-proven success in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.370.6521.1144">protein&nbsp;folding</a>.</p><p>“The world is full with AI’s and no one can be really sure.”<br>No, we cannot. And so, we should still consider how to help kids thrive in a world where ideas of provenance, authorship, intention, bias, and even why we share information with each other, are increasingly fuzzy.</p> We Can Use AI as a Tool to Challenge Disinformation <p>There is a belief that AI could weaponize phishing to be more targeted and more plausible. Conversely, reverse image search, an AI-assisted tool, let me investigate a suspicious friend request from someone who looked like a Danish sea captain and was, it transpired, a Danish sea captain — at least the pictures used were. His affable images, I discovered, had been misappropriated and used as a siren call all over the world<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6339769/Australian-woman-58-duped-10-000-scam-fraudster-pretend-Danish-captain.html"> in phishing&nbsp;attacks</a>.</p> We Should Avoid Exacerbating Inequalities <p>If we are not vigilant, new technologies can have a tendency to exacerbate existing digital divides by, for example, creating a heavy reliance on expensive devices or tools. The current generation of generative AI tools relies, at minimum, on having an internet-connected device. Although the mechanics for data sent as cellular data, wi-fi, or Bluetooth are perhaps similar, their differences can be huge for those with limited means, limited data plans, or low bandwidth connectivity. Unless we think intentionally about ensuring equitable access, many children will be under-equipped to use new AI technologies.</p> We Must Think Creatively about the Medium of Media&nbsp;Literacy <p>School-based media literacy may provide some of the answers to helping kids learn more, but the presence of <a href="https://medialiteracynow.org/impact/">formal instruction varies by state</a>, from none to some. The demands on the school day and the multiplicity of technologies can make integrating media literacy instruction challenging for any educator. We must understand the needs of teachers as we develop in-classroom supports and scaffold them with professional development materials as&nbsp;needed.</p><p>That said, we know media literacy messaging works well when it’s either baked into media that kids are already consuming or is standalone content that they gravitate to, whether that’s through video, social media, or digital games. For example, we use both of these approaches at GBH; our episodes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa8HWWMcQEGRhqI2vfh30TPvRO1m4FLWS">Molly of Denali</a> often model positive uses of media and technology.</p>Molly of Denali. Images courtesy of&nbsp;GBH. Future Proofing Media Literacy Education Is&nbsp;Key <p>The usage of generative AI is moving swiftly, with over 5<a href="https://www.futurepedia.io/">,000 tools</a> now claiming to have AI support and with many being integrated into tools and software kids are already using. Being strategic about what kinds of media literacy to address is&nbsp;key.</p><p>This is especially true for those of us making media about technology, professional video, or a high quality media literacy game. These can take months to produce, if we even find the funding to begin with. Our resulting work often has a long tail of use, so for both of these reasons we must be careful to future-proof what we provide, and to not overly focus on one single tool. The Ruff Ruffman: Humble Media Genius videos have been viewed over 100 million times, so getting the message right, with as much timelessness as possible, is important.</p><p>And as a new generation of AI tools become intertwined with what our kids interact with — in their searches, in the algorithms that suggest what to listen to or, more importantly perhaps, what friends see their posts, and in the work they do at school — we should take stock and assess whether we’re headed into stormy seas or wide open blue oceans. (That Danish sea captain clearly has left his mark on me.) We should provide media literacy that kids want to engage with; it can’t feel like just another civics&nbsp;lesson.</p> We Can Learn from the Past to Inform Our&nbsp;Future <p>There is very little research yet about generative AI, and so we in public media, and many of our colleagues across academia, are trying to conduct it. As a stop-gap, we’re leaning on studies of related technology: for example, how kids interact with chatbots can be informed by 10 years’ study into how they interact with digital voice assistants like Siri; these in turn often look back at prior research into <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00008/full">Human Computer Interaction</a>.</p><p>How we have evolved to use other digital tools can help us consider how we might use AI. For example, many of us have grown to trust Wikipedia but perhaps wouldn’t use it for a crucial medical diagnosis. And when was the last time you crossed-checked Google Maps directions with a paper map before trusting your computer-proposed itinerary? In other words, we decide the trust we place in every new tool we&nbsp;use.</p><p>Generative AI is in many ways exciting, new and challenging, and I believe we can and must equip young people with the critical thinking skills to help them use AI effectively.</p><p>This essay is part of the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/generative-futures/home">Co-Designing Generative Futures series</a>, a collection of multidisciplinary and transnational reflections and speculations about the transformative shifts brought on by generative artificial intelligence.

Despite the hype, these systems are not completely new. The 1940s <a href="https://sanketp.medium.com/language-models-the-beginnings-8824df2eacc0">marked</a> initial forays into language models. What is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSRN_3pkTsc&amp;t=3137s">new</a> is how these systems — which are “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSRN_3pkTsc&amp;t=3137s">more ‘auto-complete’ than ‘search engine</a>’” — are being promoted: they are being made available to the broader&nbsp;public.</p><p>How do different users perceive these systems? Preliminary <a href="https://www.ideo.com/journal/will-ai-interfere-with-relationships-gen-z-thinks-so">research from IDEO</a> sought out the perspectives of twelve participants ages 13 to 21 in the U.S. around the ways generative AI may impact social connection (among other themes). The company first distilled key sentiments associated with these systems based on large quantities of social media posts and then presented participants with AI-driven hypothetical <a href="https://www.ideo.com/journal/is-gen-z-ready-to-embrace-ai-its-complicated">products</a>, such as “Build a FrAInd: Your ideal bestie come to life, based on celebs and influencers you love” and “New AI, New Me: An avatar trained on your preferences that has experiences for you.” Participants had varying levels of familiarity with generative AI and diverse life experiences (e.g., some participants were in school and others not, some had international backgrounds, etc.). When asked for their thoughts on these products, they emphasized that relationships are all “about you learning as you go,” that humans must “<a href="https://www.ideo.com/journal/will-ai-interfere-with-relationships-gen-z-thinks-so">remain at the&nbsp;helm</a>.”</p><p>In IDEO’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/publication/2021/youth-participation-in-a-digital-world">youth-focused</a> research, respondents also voiced concern around&nbsp;trust.</p><blockquote>In the context of human-to-human connection, an important question arises: How will generative AI, such as LLMs, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUCUNvu8QUg">influence the trust we have in other&nbsp;people</a>?</blockquote><p>A study from a Stanford and Cornell research team <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2208839120">demonstrated</a> that when asked to discern whether online dating, professional, and lodging profiles were generated by an LLM or a human, participants only selected the correct answer about half of the time. Whereas participants could sometimes identify specific markers of text generated by LLMs (i.e. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpE40jwMilU">synthetic text</a>) such as repetitive wording, they also pointed to cues such as grammatical mistakes or long words, which, in the study’s data, were more representative of language written by a human. Additional features that participants used to discern human-written text, including first-person pronouns or references to family, were equally present in both synthetic and human-written profiles. Rather than interpreting results as evidence of machine “<a href="https://techwontsave.us/episode/163_chatgpt_is_not_intelligent_w_emily_m_bender">intelligence,</a>” the Cornell and Stanford team suggested that individuals may use flawed heuristics to detect synthetic text.</p><p>The authors <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2208839120">proposed</a> that such heuristics may be indicative of human vulnerability: “People are unprepared for their encounters with language-generating AI technologies, and the heuristics developed through&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. social contexts are dysfunctional when applied to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. AI language systems.” Concerningly, individuals are <a href="https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/44537255/Ischen2020_Chapter_PrivacyConcernsInChatbotIntera.pdf">more likely</a> to share personal information and follow recommendations by nonhuman entities that they view as “human,” raising key privacy questions. At the same time — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUCUNvu8QUg&amp;t=1632s">at least in the short term</a> — they may begin to distrust those who they think are using synthetic text in their communication.</p><p>Issues of bias are also central given that systems such as LLMs absorb and amplify the biases in training data. Against the backdrop of the race towards ever larger LLMs, as outlined in Bender and colleagues’ ground-breaking paper “<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?</a>,” the wider web is not representative of the ways that different people view the world. A number of factors impact 1) who has access to the Internet, 2) who feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and worldviews online, 3) who is represented in the parts of the Internet chosen for the training data, and 4) how the basic filtering applied to training data produces more distortion.</p><p>For instance, per the second factor, whereas user-generated content sites (e.g., Reddit) portray themselves as welcoming platforms, structural elements (e.g., moderation practices) may make these sites less accessible to underrepresented communities. Harassment on X (formerly Twitter), for example, is <a href="https://medium.com/@agua.carbonica/twitter-wants-you-to-know-that-youre-still-sol-if-you-get-a-death-threat-unless-you-re-a5cce316b706">experienced</a> by “a wide range of overlapping groups including domestic abuse victims, sex workers, trans people, queer people, immigrants, medical patients (by their providers), neurodivergent people, and visibly or vocally disabled people.” As the authors of “Stochastic Parrots” point out, there are selected subgroups that can more easily contribute data, which produces a systemic pattern that exacerbates inclusion and diversity. In turn, this pattern initiates and perpetuates a feedback loop that diminishes the impact of data from underrepresented communities and <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/2e855f9489df0712b4bd8ea9e2848c5a-Abstract.html#:~:text=We%20propose%20a%20Process%20for,predetermined%20set%20of%20target%20values.">privileges</a> hegemonic viewpoints.</p><p>Automated facial recognition software is another example.

How can we <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/2126417">counter the generative AI hype</a> and educate individuals to be critical consumers of these systems — with the understanding that, as Dr. Rumman Chowdhury has pointed out, AI <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/the-recast/2023/07/14/bias-ai-rumman-chowdhury-twitter-00106412">“is not inherently neutral, trustworthy, nor beneficial</a>”? While acknowledging this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRFaow12xo0&amp;t=980s">nuanced landscape</a>, how do we develop regulations that emphasize <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445918">accountability</a> on the part of the companies that develop and deploy generative AI (especially through a lens of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g0l8iDyCSw&amp;t=3096s">algorithmic justice</a> as described by Deborah Raji); <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/172454/great-ai-hallucination-chatgpt">transparency</a> (e.g., the knowledge that one has encountered synthetic media and an understanding of how the system was trained; e.g., “<a href="https://www.consentfultech.io/">consentful tech</a>”); and the <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_artificial_intelligence_companies_on_data_worker_labor_conditions_-_091323pdf1.pdf">prevention of exploitative labor</a>?</p><p>Returning to social connection and human-to-human communication, when we use language, we do so for a given purpose — to ask another person a question, explain an idea to someone, or just to socialize.

Referents, actual things and ideas in the world around us, like tulips or compassion, are needed to produce meaning. This meaning is unable to be learned from form alone. Given that LLMs are trained on form, these systems do not necessarily learn “meaning,” but instead some “<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.463.pdf">reflection of meaning into the linguistic form</a>.” As Dr. Bender <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html">notes</a>, language is relational by its very&nbsp;nature.</p><p>Moving forward, it is essential that we preserve the sanctity of genuine human-to-human connection, with its conflicts, its awkwardness, and its spaces for cultivating relationships built on consistent trust, belonging, and mattering to those in one’s&nbsp;life.</p><p>Are you interested in continuing the conversation around social connection?

<p>As a social scientist who views online phenomena through the lenses of trust, safety, security, privacy, and transparency, I seek to understand the potential for misuse and abuse in this current environment of giddy euphoria related to Generative AI (GenAI). Below, I briefly discuss some forms of victimization that the makers and regulators of these tools must consider, and suggest ways to reduce the frequency and impact of potential harms that may emerge and proliferate.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@googledeepmind?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Google DeepMind</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>.<p>If you’ve spent any meaningful amount of time on social media, you’ve likely been exposed not only to harassment, but also to the presence of bots that spam or otherwise annoy you with irrelevant or intrusive content. GenAI allows for the automatic creation of harassing or threatening messages, emails, posts, or comments on a wide variety of platforms and interfaces, and systematizes their rapid spread. In addition, given that malicious social media users have employed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666953/twitch-sues-alleged-hate-raiders-harassment-streamers">thousands of bots to flood online spaces with hateful content</a>, it is reasonable to assume that GenAI can facilitate this at an even greater scale. Indeed, since GenAI bots can converse and interact in more natural ways than traditional bots, responding to the problem may be much more challenging than using typical content moderation methods.</p><p>Imagine this occurring in the comment thread of your latest Instagram post, or among the community of friends you’ve carefully built in your Twitch or Discord channel, or on your recent LinkedIn post seeking new employment opportunities. Imagine a flood of bots when you’re trying to seek a romantic partner on a dating app. Recently, an AI chatbot was created to identify the type of women a person is interested in and then initiate flirtatious conversation with them <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cupidbots-dating-app-ai-harassment">until they agree to a date or share their phone number</a>. Another chatbot has been accused of pursuing prospective romantic partners when they were clearly not interested, even <a href="https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/tech/ai-program-replika-accused-of-sexual-harassment.html">becoming sexually aggressive and harassing</a>. One can easily envision the problematic possibilities when these technologies are combined, refined, and exploited.</p><p>Relatedly, I am very concerned about the dissemination and amplification of hate speech, given the ability of GenAI to be used to create and propagate text, memes, deepfakes, and related harmful content that targets specific members of marginalized groups or attacks the group as a&nbsp;whole.</p><blockquote>Even if the hate speech is created by human users, accounts created by GenAI can increase the visibility, reach, and virality of existing problematic content by fostering large upswings in engagement for those posts through high volumes of likes, shares, and comments.</blockquote><p>It is not clear how proficient platforms are in detecting unnatural behavior of this ilk, and malicious users can easily program frequencies and delays to mimic typical human activity.</p><p>Many of us are familiar with how deepfakes have been used over the last decade to compromise the integrity of the information landscape through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/technology/artificial-intelligence-training-deepfake.html">disinformation campaigns</a> and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/12/1018222/deepfake-revenge-porn-coming-ban/">image-based sexual violence</a>. GenAI technologies not only greatly assist in the creation of deepfakes, but also can intersect with sextortion, catfishing, doxing, stalking, threats, and identity theft. Imagine this: A malicious individual creates a new account on a dating app. An unsuspecting user is then fooled into believing they are talking with a real person in their town, even though the chat conversation is facilitated by GenAI. Soon, the unsuspecting user begins candidly sharing personal information as they build a strong emotional bond with the fake account. When the malicious individual begins to send nude photo and video content to deepen intimacy, the unsuspecting user is unable to discern that it is manufactured. After responding in kind with genuine, private, sexual photos, extortion and threats ensue. Even after the victim responds to the demands, the malicious individual still shares the victim’s private information publicly on other message boards. It’s reasonable to expect new iterations of GenAI tools that can live-search the Internet and integrate queried information, organize it, connect it with other sources, and build a detailed dossier about a person. This would contribute to additional privacy violations, stalking, and threats against the unsuspecting user, as well as fraudulent activity (e.g., counterfeit documents, wide-scale phishing attacks) and identity&nbsp;theft.</p><p>Given how many forms of abuse can be aided and abetted by GenAI, an essential question surfaces: What can be done here to mitigate risk and&nbsp;harm?</p><p>Initiatives that might be considered low-hanging fruit often involve education of end users to augment their ability to recognize GenAI creations as synthetic and to interpret and react to them accordingly. This can occur in part through <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-spot-generative-ai-text-chatgpt/">improved detection algorithms</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/microsoft-pledges-to-watermark-ai-generated-images-and-videos/">labeling/watermarking</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CommunityNotes/status/1663609484051111936?s=20">notifications/warnings</a>, and in-app or in-platform educational content of a compelling nature (e.g., when TikTok asked top influencers to create short videos that <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/helping-users-manage-their-screen-time">encourage users to take breaks from screentime</a> or <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/create-kindness-on-tiktok">teach viewers how to counter online bullying</a>).</p><p>Outside of these platform-centric efforts, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/campus/teaching-ai-literacy-how-begin">media literacy education</a> in schools must also require instruction in the use (and possible misuse) of GenAI tools, given their growing adoption among young people. Other theoretically simple solutions involve the ability for creators to easily attach Do Not Train flags to certain pieces of output that should not end up as training data in large language models (LLMs) (e.g., Adobe’s <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/">Content Authenticity Initiative</a> is advocating for this on an industry-wide level (h/t <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/nfreitas">Nathan Freitas</a>)). New, elegant, privacy-forward solutions to quickly and consistently verify authentic users — their identity, their voice, their persona in photo and video (and, subsequently, remove non-human users) — must be developed and deployed. To be sure, though, protections must be in place so that human users (especially those historically marginalized) are not algorithmically misclassified because of existing biases in training datasets.</p><p>Can tech companies that provide GenAI models to their user base also reasonably mandate rule compliance? That is, can the tool itself (and the messaging that surrounds it) be crafted in a way that deters misuse and promotes prosocial or at least neutral output? Can it be presented to users with both excitement and cautions? Can clear examples of appropriate and inappropriate use be provided? Since being logged-in is likely required, can the platform remind the users that logs are kept to facilitate investigations should policy violations occur? And can gentle reminders and prompts periodically jog the memory of users that appropriate use is expected? All of this seems especially important if the tool is provided seamlessly and naturally within the in-app experience on hugely popular platforms (e.g., <a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/13266788358932-What-is-My-AI-on-Snapchat-and-how-do-I-use-it-">My AI</a> on Snapchat was rolled out to 750 million monthly users and <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/early-insights-on-my-ai">fielded 10 billion messages from over 150 million users within two&nbsp;months</a>).</p><p>Employees at all levels within AI research and development firms must operate within an ethos where “do no harm” is core to what they build. To be sure, tech workers are learning on the fly in this brave new world, and some must now retrofit solutions that ground human dignity, privacy, security, and the mitigation of bias into their products and services. It is critical. Not only will this reduce the incidence of various risks and harms, but it can contribute to further adoption and growth of their models as the signal to noise ratio of accurate, objective, and prosocial content creation improves.</p><p>Partnerships between academia and tech companies continue to hold promise to identify solutions to technological problems, and more initiatives focused on GenAI issues should be supported and promoted. Can researchers gain increased access to publicly available data mined via platform APIs to identify historical and current behavioral clues — as well as anonymized account data (date of creation, average frequency of engagement, relevant components of the social network graph) that readily point to synthetic users? Might they somehow obtain anonymized access not just of adult users but also minors (those 17 years of age and younger) given their comparatively greater vulnerability to the internalization and externalization of harm? And <a href="https://eber.uek.krakow.pl/index.php/eber/article/view/2113/852">what can be learned from the financial and pharmaceutical sectors</a> when it comes to government involvement and regulation to prevent ethical violations, biases and discriminatory practices, economic disparities, and other outcomes of misuse with GenAI? For instance, can risk profiles be established for all AI applications with baselines for rigor of assessment, mitigation of weaponization and exploitation, and processes for recovery? Those with the highest scores would likely gain the most market share, and keeping those scores would motivate quality control and constant refinement.</p><blockquote>Finally, we cannot keep moving ahead at breakneck speed without carefully designed regulatory frameworks for GenAI that establish standards and legal parameters and that set in place sanctions for those entities that transgress.</blockquote><p>This includes clearly describing and prohibiting (and designing prevention mechanisms for) edge cases where victimization will likely result. Moreover, proper governance requires detailed protocols for <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-us-government-should-regulate-ai/">audits, licensing, international collaboration, and non-negotiable safety practices</a> for public LLMs. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/">The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a> from the US Office of Science and Technology Policy is a good start with great macro-level intentions, but it reads more like a strong suggestion rather than a directive with applied specificity. With regard to data privacy and security in general, the US has failed to keep pace with the comprehensive, forward thinking efforts of other countries. Urgency is needed so this does not happen yet again with GenAI, so that we can grow in confidence that its positives do measurably outweigh its negatives.</p><p>This essay is part of the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/generative-futures/home">Co-Designing Generative Futures series</a>, a collection of multidisciplinary and transnational reflections and speculations about the transformative shifts brought on by generative artificial intelligence.

<p>DIF is honoured to host the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), one of China’s leading scientific research institutes, founded in 1957, as the founding member of the DIF China Special Interest Group (SIG).&nbsp;</p><p>Decentralized technologies are being actively developed in China, with more than 300 blockchain projects launched across the country in 2022, covering multiple industries and fields.</p><p>The Special Interest Group will be chaired by Xie Jiagui, Chief Engineer at CAICT’s Institute for Industrial Internet &amp; Internet of Things (pictured above), who is engaged in research and development of network identification, blockchain technology systems, and big data technology.</p><p>We asked Mr Xie and Chiye Sun, Global Partnership Manager &amp; Blockchain Researcher at CAICT about the organization’s Xinghuo Astron project, and their plans for the DIF China SIG.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the goals of the DIF China SIG is to promote and advocate for the adoption and implementation of DIF specifications and technologies in China. Why do you see this as an important outcome?&nbsp;</p><p>Identity verification is the foundation of the digital economy and innovation. By promoting and adopting DIF technologies and related W3C standards in China, it provides a more secure and decentralized identity verification method, which can provide a more reliable and efficient infrastructure for the digital economy and promote the development and innovation of the digital industry. DIF’s identity verification and data management tools can help China's digital industry provide more efficient and convenient public services, enhance digital capabilities and governance levels.</p><p>DIF technologies and W3C standards can also promote consistency in identity verification and data exchange between different systems, reduce adaptation costs, and improve system interoperability and efficiency.</p><p>Finally, implementing these technologies and standards can help protect users' personal privacy, enhance data security and credibility, reduce reliance on centralized identity providers through decentralized authentication and authorization mechanisms, and enhance users' control over their identity and personal data.</p><p>CAICT’s customers and partners include chipmakers, device vendors, operators and system suppliers. Do you envisage organizations such as these participating in the China SIG?&nbsp;</p><p>It is hard to say for certain who will participate in the SIG. We think DID-related and blockchain-related Chinese enterprises would love to join this SIG. We can also ask universities, research institutes and other government-related institutions to join. We will also promote the DIF China SIG in different Chinese Web3 communities, like Alliance for Blockchain Industry (ABI), which contains more than 600 members, Z-Park and DID Alliance (DIDA).</p><p>We are also very much looking forward to hosting international level participants, learning from each other, communicating together, and hope to generate technical ideas, business pilots and governance cooperation.</p><p>It sounds as though the W3C DID (Decentralized Identifier) standard is core to your research and development work in the areas of industrial internet and blockchain. For example, the Xinghuo Astron project, a native DID network around the world built on the Xinghuo Blockchain Infrastructure &amp; Facility (Xinghuo BIF), aims to provide blockchain networks with identifier services, realizing interconnectivity across regions and industries. Why did you choose the W3C DID standard for Xinghuo?</p><p>We registered Xinghuo’s own DID method called BID(did:bid), which follows W3C DID standards. Regarding the technical standard for identifiers, we think it is better to follow a global standard format for interoperability and collaboration globally. DID is a new type of identifier that is user generated, without the need for a centralized entity, permanent, cryptographically verified and universally resolvable. It is in line with the evolution trend of cyberspace towards self sovereignty management.</p><p>Use cases for Xinghuo Astron include verifying certificates of origin in cross border trade between China and Malaysia and enabling traceability of carbon emissions data for manufacturers exporting to the EU. How do you envisage the DIF China SIG advancing international collaboration and adoption around these and other use cases?&nbsp;</p><p>One of our goals for the DIF China SIG is to promote and advocate for the adoption and implementation of DIF standards and technologies in China. Apart from that, we would like to construct a platform that provides communication and cooperation opportunities between China and other countries.</p><p>Planned activities for the SIG include organizing conferences and events, demonstrating W3C / DIF technical standards, lectures, training sessions and promoting projects such as Xinghuo Astron project as well as DIF projects. This sounds like an ambitious agenda! Do you plan to promote the SIG and its activities to an international audience? What language(s) will be used during SIG meetings?&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, we would like to promote the DIF China SIG to an international audience. CAICT also involves related work in G20, APEC, Belt and Road Initiative and other international cooperation mechanisms. We could try to introduce DIF and DIF China SIG to these mechanisms when appropriate.</p><p>Regarding language, routine meetings and activities will use Mandarin if no English speaking participant comes to join, or we could translate some bullet points for them. When it comes to some international level discussion and cooperation, we can switch to English.</p><p></p><p></p>

<p>Cinq mois après son inauguration le 6 juin 2023, le campus unlimitrust de SICPA rejoint les sept technopôles du canton de Vaud, sous l’égide d’Innovaud. Le campus unlimitrust a pour vocation d’accélérer la création de technologies et de solutions contribuant à l’émergence d’une véritable économie de la confiance à l’échelle mondiale. Le 8 novembre, une célébration a eu lieu en présence d’Isabelle Moret, conseillère d’Etat du Département de l’économie, de l’innovation, de l’emploi et du patrimoine du canton de Vaud.</p>
Le 8 novembre 2023, unlimitrust campus a officiellement rejoint les 7 autres technopoles vaudois! A cette occasion, le campus unlimitrust a eu l’honneur de recevoir la conseillère d’Etat, Mme Moret, cheffe du DEIEP.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Le campus unlimitrust s’inscrit dans une volonté de créer un monde plus sûr et plus fiable en facilitant l’émergence de concepts et de projets innovants qui répondent aux nouveaux défis de notre société, grâce aux technologies de la confiance. Pour cela, il encourage les collaborations entre des entreprises expertes du domaine, mais aussi des start-ups, des chercheurs et des institutions académiques telles que l’EPFL.</p>
<p>Adjacent au siège historique de SICPA à Prilly, le campus unlimitrust offre une infrastructure de 30’000 mètres carrés constitués d’espaces collaboratifs, de bureaux, de laboratoires et de services communs. Animé par l’Economy of Trust Foundation, une initiative de SICPA visant à promouvoir le concept d’économie de la confiance, le campus rassemble une communauté internationale d’entreprises et d’institutions publiques et privées de toutes tailles. Par exemple, les entreprises Approach Cyber, Visium et Cyberion, intervenant dans les domaines de la cybersécurité et de l’intelligence artificielle. L’objectif est de stimuler l’innovation dans les domaines numériques et physiques afin de renforcer la souveraineté des institutions et la confiance des citoyens dans leurs interactions entre eux et des entités privées ou publiques, là où la confiance est primordiale.</p>
<p>« SICPA est née il y a bientôt 100 ans ici, dans le canton de Vaud. Je me réjouis que les solutions innovantes qui y naissent, notamment dans le domaine de la confiance, et les valeurs d’excellence auxquelles nous sommes attachés, trouvent dans ce campus un écrin qui permet de les valoriser et de les porter au-delà de nos frontières, » explique Philippe Amon, Président et Administrateur délégué de SICPA.</p>
<p>Le canton de Vaud par le biais du Service de la promotion de l’économie et de l’innovation (SPEI), Innovaud, ainsi que de la Fondation EPFL Innovation Park (EIP), jouent un rôle de premier plan dans le domaine de l’innovation en Suisse et à l’échelle mondiale. Ils sont déjà activement impliqués dans la dynamique générale du campus unlimitrust. Plusieurs start-ups ont déjà rejoint le campus, et certaines d’entre elles sont accueillies au cœur du Trust Village, une structure d’incubation soutenue par les autorités cantonales et SICPA, opérée par l’EPFL Innovation Park (EIP) et gérée par la Trust Valley.</p>
Unlimitrust campus devient le 8ème technopôle du canton de Vaud et d’Innovaud. Célébration du 8 novembre 2023 en présence de M. Gaudin, Mme Moret et M. Barbey.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>De ce fait, Innovaud se félicite d’accueillir le campus unlimitrust au sein de la famille des technopôles vaudois, qui en compte désormais huit avec l’Agropôle, les ateliers de Renens, le Biopôle, l’EPFL Innovation Park, swiss aeropole, le Technopôle de Sainte-Croix et Y-PARC. « Chacun des technopôles œuvre dans un domaine technologique d’une importance fondamentale pour le tissu économique vaudois et l’attractivité du canton à l’échelle internationale. Le campus unlimitrust renforce l’écosystème d’innovation de notre région dans le domaine de la sécurité et de la confiance », explique Patrick Barbey, directeur d’Innovaud.</p>

<p>Elastos BPoS consensus mechanism revolutionises staking! 2023 saw the advent of Elastos’ BPoS (Bonded Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism, enabling node operators to customise their staking duration and offering greater flexibility to delegators. As a result, this upgrade doubled the number of validators on Elastos in just a <a href="https://elastos.info/bpos-validators-calculator/">few weeks.</a>&nbsp;We’re now excited to share that Staking Rewards, our strategic partner, has added a dedicated Elastos dashboard for BPoS data and insights. Take a look <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/asset/elastos">here!</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Bonus <a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/bpos-validator-incentive-program/">incentives</a> from the Elastos Foundation and low operational costs create an ideal opportunity to <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/now-is-a-good-time-to-be-a-validator-with-elastos-elastic-consensus/">join our </a>validator and staking community today. <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/">Staking Rewards</a> is instrumental in sharing this information with prospective validators, including investors looking for assets with ROI. As an extension of our collaborative efforts, the Elastos Growth Team will be present at the Staking Rewards <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/summit">Staking Summit</a> event in Turkey on November 10th, where the team will connect with attendees and showcase the unique features of Elastos’ validator system, along with the opportunities for earning ELA it offers. Follow our <a href="https://twitter.com/ElastosInfo">Twitter</a> for updates!<br>
</p>
<p>“We are excited to bring Elastos staking data onto Stakingrewards.com. With its distinct PoW/PoS model, Elastos has a unique position in the industry and we are looking forward to driving adoption for ELA staking in the ecosystem and beyond.” Mirko, Staking Rewards CEO<br>
</p>
<p>“We have recently introduced a new consensus mechanism for Elastos and now the details of our blockchain validators are on Staking Rewards we feel like Elastos has arrived! We look forward to welcoming further node operators to share our Web3 journey. For only 2000 ELA there is an opportunity for node operators to earn pre-halving rewards, including bonuses, at a very reasonable cost – ELA scarcity is part of the economics and locking them for consensus security offers a safe haven for on-chain holders wishing to support us. Staking Rewards adds visibility to the project so we can share what we’re working towards. Elastos has been building for over five years so is here for the long run, and with the next bull run taking shape, it presents an opportunity to join a maturing community with resilient technology as the Web3 story charges onwards.” Fakhul, Elastos Head of Growth</p>
 What’s next? 
<p>Building upon this momentum, Elastos recently partnered with <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/alibaba-cloud-partners-with-elastos-to-spur-adoption-of-open-source-tech/">Alibaba Cloud</a> and <a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/elastos-and-tencent-cloud/">Tencent Cloud</a>. These collaborations bolster our SmartWebs resilience with cloud infrastructure and advance DID identity solutions with KYC and verifiable credentials support for privacy-preserving compliance. These partnerships have reinforced Elastos’ standing in secure digital identity verification and enhanced validator confidence in the ecosystem, making today a <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/now-is-a-good-time-to-be-a-validator-with-elastos-elastic-consensus/">great time to be a validator</a>.</p>
<p>Next, Elastos is looking to launch an <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals/653fd5d3fbb7240084a0d51c">ecosystem accelerator campaign</a>&nbsp;to foster project development across various Web3 applications like DeFi, SocialFi, and NFTs. The campaign will leverage Elastos’ core technologies, including <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/carrier/intro/">Carrier</a> for communications, <a href="https://elastos.dev/start/dids/">EID</a> for identity, <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/hive/intro/">Hive</a> for storage, and <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/sidechains/esc/">Elastos Smart Chain </a>for EVM support. Separately, ecosystem project <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/HcwgIge/elacity-2-pager-pdf">Elacity</a> is advancing DRM technology on Elastos, supporting the development of Elastos’ Runtime technology, an execution environment to support playback of encrypted content like video and music using tradable NFT rights.</p>
<p>Explore the <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/asset/elastos">Elastos Staking Rewards Dashboard</a> today and take control of your digital life—identity, finances, and content. With Elastos, it’s possible.</p>

<p>In today’s retail environment, consumers and logistics are constantly evolving. Wondering how these evolutions will affect your in-store shopping experience? Join us as we chat with Omni Talk to discuss retail technology innovations, how they will change the physical store environment, and what’s on the horizon for omnichannel commerce.&nbsp;</p> <p>Key takeaways:&nbsp;</p>     <p>The future of retail lies in technology and innovation. The episode emphasizes the importance of retailers embracing technological advancements to stay competitive. From computer vision and robots in back rooms to smart carts and curbside pickup, retailers need to adapt their operations and design to meet the changing needs and preferences of consumers.</p>     <p>Curbside pickup is a significant trend that is here to stay. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of curbside pickup, and it has quickly become a popular choice for consumers seeking convenience and contactless retail experiences. Retailers are redesigning parking lots and experimenting with autonomous robot vending machines to cater to the demand for curbside pickup.</p>     <p>Data and integration are crucial for optimizing the customer experience. The use of 2D barcodes and the collection of data attached to them can provide valuable insights into customer behaviors and preferences. Retailers who effectively utilize this data and integrate it into their systems will have a competitive advantage. Additionally, the integration of video commerce and retail media networks presents opportunities for retailers to maintain control over their video content and ensure commerce flows through their platforms.</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p>Our website - <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with guests:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswaltonretail/">Follow Chris Walton on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-lineage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Data provenance</a>, typically used within the broader context of data lineage, refers to the source or first occurrence of a given piece of data. As a concept, data provenance (together with data lineage) is positioned to provide validity and encourage confidence related to the <a href="https://www.nnlm.gov/guides/data-glossary/data-provenance?ref=blog.ceramic.network#:~:text=Definition,to%20where%20it%20is%20presently">origin of data</a>, whether or not data has mutated since its creation, and who the original publisher is, among other important details. </p><p>From tracking the origin of scientific studies to big banks complying with financial regulations, data provenance plays an integral role in supporting the authenticity and integrity of data.</p> Databases and Data Provenance <p>When it comes to databases, you can start to imagine how critical data provenance is when organizing and tracking files in a data warehouse or citing references from within a curated database. For consumer applications (take social media platforms such as Twitter, for example) that build entire advertising business models around the engagement derived from user-generated content, the claim of unaltered authorship (apart from account hacks) of a given Tweet is a guarantee made by the platform to its users and investors—trust cannot be built without it.</p><p>With the implications of data provenance in mind, organizations that rely on centrally controlled data stores within the context of consumer applications are constantly evolving security protocols and authentication measures to safeguard both their users and business from attacks that could result in data leaks, data alterations, data wipes, and more. However, so long as potential attack vectors and adequate user authentication are accounted for, these organizations benefit from inherent assurances related to the authenticity of incoming writes and mutations—after all, their servers are the agents performing these edit actions.</p> Data Provenance in Peer-to-Peer Protocols <p>But what about peer-to-peer data protocols and the applications built on them? How do topics such as cryptographic hashing, digital signatures, user authentication, and data origin verifiability in decentralized software coincide with data provenance and data lineage?</p><p>This article is meant to provide an initial exploration of how and where these topics converge and build a specific understanding of the overlap between these ideas and the technical architecture, challenges, qualities, and general functionality of ComposeDB on Ceramic. ComposeDB, built on Ceramic, is a decentralized graph database that uses GraphQL to offer developers a familiar interface for interacting with data stored on Ceramic.</p><p>The following article sections will set out to help accomplish the goals outlined above.</p> Smart Contract-Supported Blockchains <p>Blockchains that contain qualities analogous to a distributed state machine (such as those compatible with the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a>) operate based on a specific set of rules that determine how the machine state changes from block to block. In viewing these systems as traversable open ledgers of data, accounts (both smart contract accounts and those that are externally owned) generate histories of transactions such as token transfers and smart contract interactions, all of which are publicly consumable without the need for permission.</p><p>What does this mean in the context of data provenance? Given the viability of public-key infrastructure, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">externally owned accounts</a> prevent bad actors from broadcasting fake transactions because the sender’s identity (public access) is publicly available to verify. When it comes to the transactions themselves (both account-to-account and account-to-contract), the resulting data that’s publicly stored (once processed) includes information about both who acted, as well as their signature.</p><p>Transaction verifiability, in this context, relies on a block finalization process that requires validator nodes to consume multiple transactions, verify them, and include them in a block<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">.</a> Given the deterministic nature of transactions, participating nodes can correctly compute the state for themselves, therefore eventually reaching a consistent state about the transactions.</p><p>While there are plenty of nuances and levels of depth we could explore related to the architecture of these systems, the following are the most relevant features related to data provenance:</p>  The verifiable origin of each transaction represents the data we care about related to provenance  Transactions are performed by externally owned accounts and contract accounts, both of which attach information about the transaction itself and who initiated it  Externally owned accounts rely on cryptographic key pairs   ComposeDB vs. Smart Contract-Supported Blockchains <p>There is plenty to talk about when comparing ComposeDB (and the Ceramic Network more broadly) to chains like Ethereum; however, for this post, we’ll focus on how these qualities relate to data provenance.</p><p>Controlling Accounts</p><p>Ceramic uses the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/accounts/decentralized-identifiers?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Decentralized Identifier</a> standard for user accounts (DID PKH and Key DID are supported in production). Similar to blockchains, they require no centralized party or registry. Additionally, both PKH DIDs and Key DIDs ultimately rely on public key infrastructure (PKH DIDs enable blockchain accounts to sign, authorize, and authenticate transactions, while Key DIDs expand cryptographic public keys into a DID document).</p><p>Sign in With Ethereum (SIWE)</p><p>Like chains such as Ethereum, Ceramic supports authenticated <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-client/user-sessions?ref=blog.ceramic.network">user sessions</a> with SIWE. The user experience then diverges slightly when it comes to signing transactions (outlined below).</p><p>Signing Transactions</p><p>While externally-owned accounts must manually sign individual transactions on chains like Ethereum (both when interacting with a smart contract or sending direct transfers), data in Ceramic (or <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/streams/streams-index?ref=blog.ceramic.network">streams</a>) are written by authenticated accounts during a timebound session, offering a familiar, Web2-like experience. The root account (your blockchain wallet if using Ceramic’s SIWE capability, for example) generates a temporary child account for each application environment with tightly-scoped permissions, which then persists for a short period in the user’s browser. For developers familiar with using JWTs in Node.js to authenticate users, this flow should sound familiar.</p><p>This capability is ideal for a protocol meant to support mutable data with verifiable origin, thus allowing for multiple writes to happen over a cryptographically authorized period (and with a signature attached to each event that can be validated) without impeding the user’s experience by requiring manual signs for each write.</p><p>Consensus</p><p>Ceramic relies on event streams that offer a limited consensus model that makes it possible for a given stream to allow <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/streams/consensus?ref=blog.ceramic.network">multiple parallel histories</a> while ensuring any two parties consuming the same events for a stream will arrive at the same state. What this means is that all streams and their corresponding tips (latest events within their event logs) are not known by all participants at any given point in time.</p><p>However, a mechanism known as the Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) is responsible for batching transactions across the network into a Merkle tree and regularly publishing its root in a single transaction to Ethereum. Therefore, Ceramic does offer a consensus on the global ordering of Ceramic transactions.</p><p>Immutability</p><p>Just as smart contracts provide a deterministic structure that dictates how users can interact with them (while guaranteeing they will not change once deployed), <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/core-concepts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB schemas</a> are also immutable, offering guarantees around the types of data a given model can store. When users write data using these definitions, each resulting model instance document can forever only be altered by accounts that created it (or grant limited permission to another account to do so), and can only make changes that conform to the schema’s definition.</p><p>Finally, every stream is comprised of an event log of one or more commits, thus making it easy for developers to extract not only the provenance of the stream’s data, based on the cryptographic signature of the account that created it, but also the stream’s data lineage by traversing through the commit history to observe how the data mutated over time.</p><p>Publicly Verifiable</p><p>Similar to networks like Ethereum, the Ceramic Network is public by default, allowing any participating nodes to read any data on any stream. While the values of the data may be plaintext or encrypted, contingent on the objectives of the applications using them, anyone can verify the cryptographic signatures that accompany the individual event logs (explained above).</p> Centralized Databases <p>The broad assumption I’ll line up for this comparison is that a traditional “Web2” platform uses a sandboxed database to store, retrieve, and write data on behalf of its users. Apart from the intricate architecture strategies used to accomplish this at scale with high performance, most of these systems rely on the assurances that their servers alone have sole authority to perform writes. Individual user accounts can be hacked into via brute force or socially engineered attacks, but as long as the application’s servers are not compromised, the data integrity remains intact (though requiring participants to trust a single point of failure).</p> ComposeDB vs. Centralized Databases <p>If this article set out to compare ComposeDB to traditional databases in the context of functionality and performance, we’d likely discuss a higher degree of similarities rather than differences; however, when comparing ComposeDB to the paradigm of a “traditional” database setup, in the context of data provenance, we find that the inverse holds true based on much of what was discussed in the previous section.</p><p>Embedded Cryptographic Proof</p><p>As previously discussed, all valid events in Ceramic include a required DAGJWS signature derived from the stream’s controlling account. While it’s possible (though logically unwise) that an application using a centralized database could fabricate data related to the accounts of its users, event streams in Ceramic are at all times controlled by the account that created the stream. Even if a Ceramic account accidentally delegates temporary write access to a malicious application that then authors inaccurate data on the controller’s behalf, the controlling account never loses admin access and can revert or overwrite those changes.</p><p>Public Verifiability</p><p>Unlike Ceramic, the origin of data (along with most accompanying information) is not accessible by design when using a centralized database, at least not in a permissionless way. The integrity of the data within a “traditional” database must therefore be assumed based on other factors requiring trust between the application’s users and the business itself. This architecture is what enables many of the business models these applications use that ultimately have free reign over how they leverage or sell user data.</p><p>Conversely, business models like advertising can be (and are currently being) built on Ceramic data, which flips this paradigm on its head. Individual users have the option to encrypt data they write to the network and have an array of tools at their disposal to enable programmatic or selective read access based on conditions they define. Businesses that want to access this data can therefore work directly with the users themselves to define the conditions under which their data can be accessed, putting the sovereignty of that data into individual users’ hands.</p><p>Timestamping and Anchoring</p><p>While in a private, sandboxed database, development teams can implement a variety of methods to timestamp entries, those teams don’t have to worry about trusting other data providers in a public network to be competent and non-malicious. Conversely, data in Ceramic leverages the <a href="https://chainagnostic.org/CAIPs/caip-168?ref=blog.ceramic.network">IPLD Timestamp Proof</a> specification which involves frequent publishing of the root of a Merkle tree to the blockchain with the sets of IPLD content identifiers as the tree’s leaves which represent Ceramic data. While the underlying data structure (event log) of each stream will preserve the ordering of its events with specific events pointing to the prior one in the stream, the anchoring process allows developers to use event timestamping in a decentralized, trustless way.</p> Verifiable Credentials <p><a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.5.x/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Verifiable credentials</a> under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">W3C</a> definition unlock the ability for verifiable claims to be issued across a virtually limitless set of contexts, with the guarantee that they can later be universally verified in a cryptographically secure way. This standard relies on several key features (below are only a few of them):</p>  Verifiable Data Registry: A publicly available repository of the verifiable credential schemas one might choose to create instances of  Decentralized Identifiers: Verifiable credentials rely on DIDs to both identify the subject of a claim, as well as the cryptographic proof created by the issuer  Core Data Model: These credentials follow a standard data model that ensures that the credential’s body (made up of one or more claims about a given entity) is inherently tamper-evident, given the fact that the issuer generates a cryptographic proof that guarantees both the values of the claims themselves and the issuer’s identity  <p>For example, an online education platform may choose to make multiple claims about a student’s performance and degree of completion related to a specific student and a specific course they are taking, all of which could be wrapped up into one verifiable credential. While multiple proof formats could be derived (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ethereum-eip712-signature-2021-spec/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EIP712 Signature</a> vs. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-jose-cose/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">JWTs</a>), the provenance of the credential is explicit.</p><p>However, unlike blockchains and databases, verifiable credentials are not storage networks themselves and therefore can be saved and later retrieved for verification purposes in a wide variety of ways.</p> ComposeDB vs. Verifiable Credentials (and other claim formats) <p>I mentioned earlier that schema definitions (once deployed to the Ceramic network) offer immutable and publicly available data formats that enforce constraints for all subsequent instances. For example, anyone using ComposeDB can deploy a model definition to assert an individual’s course completion and progress, and similarly, any participants can create document instances within that model’s family. Given the cryptographic signatures and immutable model instance controller identity (that’s automatically attached to each Ceramic stream commit discussed above), you can start to see how the qualities verifiable credentials are set out to provide, like tamper-evident claims and credential provenance, are inherent to ComposeDB.</p><p>Tamper-Proof</p><p>Like a verifiable credential, each commit within a given Ceramic stream is immutable once broadcasted to the network. Within the context of a model instance document within ComposeDB, while the values within the document are designed to be mutated over time, each commit is publicly readable, tamper-evident, and cryptographically signed.</p><p>Inherent Origin</p><p>We’ve discussed this extensively above—each event provides publicly-verifiable guarantees about the identity of the controlling account.</p><p>Publicly Available</p><p>Unlike verifiable credentials that offer just a standard, ComposeDB allows developers to both define claim standards (using schema definitions), as well as public availability for those instances to be read and confirmed by other network participants. ComposeDB is therefore also a public schema registry in itself.</p> Trustworthiness <p>In addition to the specific comparisons to other data storage options and verifiable claim standards, what qualities does ComposeDB offer that enable anyone to audit, verify, and prove the origin of data it contains? While parts of this section may be slightly redundant with the first half of this article, we’ll take this opportunity to tie these concepts together in a more general sense.</p> Auditable, Verifiable, and Provable <p>For trust to be equitably built in a peer-to-peer network, the barrier to entry to be able to run audits must be sufficiently low, concerning both cost and complexity. This holds especially true when auditing and validating the origin of data within the network. Here are a few considerations and trade-offs related to ComposeDB’s auditability.</p><p>No Cost Barrier With Open Access to Audit</p><p>Developers building applications on ComposeDB do not need to worry about cost-per-transaction fees related to the read/write activity their users perform. They will, however, need to architect an adequate production node configuration (that should be built around the volume a given application currently has and how it expects to grow over time), which will have separate network-agnostic costs.</p><p>This also holds for auditors (or new applications who want to audit data on Ceramic before building applications on that data). Any actor can spin up a node without express network permissions, discover streams representing data relevant to their business goals, and begin to index and read them. Whether an organization chooses to build on ComposeDB or directly on its underlying network (Ceramic), as long as developers understand the architecture of <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/protocol/streams/event-log/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">event logs</a> (and specifically how to extract information like cryptographic signatures and controlling accounts), they will have fully transparent insight into the provenance of a given Ceramic dataset.</p><p>Trade-Off: Stream Discoverability</p><p>While fantastic interfaces, such as <a href="https://scan.s3.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">s3.xyz</a>, have been built to improve data and model discoverability within the Ceramic Network, one challenge Ceramic faces as it continues to grow is how to further enable developers to discover (and build on) existing data. More specifically, while it’s easy to explain to developers the hypothetical benefits of data composability and user ownership in the context of an open data network (such as the data provenance-related qualities we’ve discussed in this post), showing it in action is a more difficult feat.</p> Structured <p>The Ceramic Network also exists in an existing, non-conforming territory that does not fit neatly into the on- or off-chain realm. Just as the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) mentions on its <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/core--concepts/onchain-vs-offchain?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Onchain vs. Offchain</a> page, a “verifiable data ledger” category of decentralized storage infrastructure is becoming increasingly appealing to development teams who want to gain the benefits of both credible decentralization and maximum performance, especially when dealing with data that’s meant to mutate over time.</p><p>As we discussed above, here’s a refresher on key insights into ComposeDB’s structure, and how these impact the provenance of its data.</p><p>Ceramic Event Logs</p><p>Ceramic relies on a core data structure called an <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/protocol/streams/event-log/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">event log</a>, which combines cryptographic proofs (to ensure immutability and enable authentication via DID methods) and <a href="https://ipld.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">IPLD</a> for hash-linked data. All events on the network rely on this underlying data structure, so whether developers are building directly on Ceramic or using ComposeDB, teams always have access to the self-certifying log that they can verify, audit, and use to validate provenance.</p><p>ComposeDB Schema Immutability</p><p>Developers building on ComposeDB also benefit from the assurances that schema definitions provide, based on the fact that they cannot be altered once deployed. While this may be an issue for some teams who might need regular schema evolution, other teams leverage this quality as a means to ensure constant structure around the data they build on. This feature therefore provides a benefit to teams who care strongly about both data provenance and lineage - more specifically, the origin (provenance) can be derived from the underlying data structure, while the history of changes (lineage) must conform to the immutable schema definition, and is always available when accessing the commit history.</p><p>A Decentralized Data Ledger</p><p>Finally, <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/nodes?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic nodes</a> support the data on Ceramic and the protocol—providing applications access to the network. For <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-server/running-in-the-cloud?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB nodes</a>, this configuration includes an IPFS service to enable access to the underlying IPLD blocks for event streams, a Ceramic component to enable HTTP API access and networking (among other purposes), and PostgreSQL (for indexing model instances in SQL and providing a read engine). All Ceramic events are regularly rolled into a Merkle tree and the root is published to the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>Within the context of data provenance, teams who wish to traverse these data artifacts back to their sources can use various tools to publicly observe these components in action (for example, the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x231055a0852d67c7107ad0d0dfeab60278fe6adc?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Anchor Service on Etherscan</a>), but must be familiar with Ceramic’s distributed architecture to understand what to look for and how these reveal the origins of data.</p><p>Trade-Off: Complexity</p><p>There’s no question that the distributed nature of the Ceramic Network can be complex to comprehend, at least at first. This is a common problem within P2P solutions that uphold user-data sovereignty and rely on consensus mechanisms, especially when optimizing for performance.</p><p>Trade-Off: Late Publishing Risks</p><p>As described on the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/streams/consensus?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Consensus</a> page in the Ceramic docs, all streams and their potential tips are not universally knowable in the form of a global state that’s available to all participants at any point in time. This setup does allow for individual participants to intentionally (or accidentally) withhold some events while publishing others, otherwise known as engaging in ‘selective publishing’. If you read into the specifics and the hypothetical scenario outlined in the docs, you’ll quickly learn that this type of late publishing attack is illogical in practice since streams can only have one controlling user, so that user would need to somehow be incentivized to attack their data.</p><p>What does this have to do with data provenance? While the origin of Ceramic streams (even in the hypothetical situation of a stream with two divergent and conflicting updates) is at all times publicly verifiable, the potential for this type of attack has more to do with the validity of that stream’s data lineage (which is more concerned with tracking the history of data over time).</p> Portable <p>Finally, another important notion to consider in the context of data provenance and P2P software is replication and sharing. Developers looking to build on this class of data network should not only be concerned with how to verify and extract the origin of data from the protocol but also need assurances that the data they care about will be available in the first place.</p><p>ComposeDB presumes that developers will want options around the replication and composability of the data streams they will build on.</p><p>Node Sync</p><p>You’ll see on the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-server/server-configurations?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Server Configurations</a> page that there’s an option to deploy a ComposeDB node with historical sync turned on. When configured to the ‘off’ position, a given node can still write data to a model definition that already exists in the network, but the node will simply only index model instance documents written by that node. Conversely, when toggled ‘on’, this setting will sync data from other nodes and write data to a canonical model definition (or many). The latter enables the ‘composability’ factor that development teams can benefit from—this is the mechanism that allows teams to build applications on shared, user-controlled data.</p><p>Recon (Ceramic Improvement Proposal)</p><p>There is an active improvement proposal underway, called <a href="https://cips.ceramic.network/CIPs/cip-124?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Recon</a>, to improve the efficiency of the network. In short, development related to this proposal aims to streamline the underlying process by which nodes sync data, offering benefits such as significantly lifting the load off of nodes that are uninterested in a given stream set.</p><p>Trade-Off: Data Availability Considerations</p><p>Of course, the question of data portability and replication necessitates conversation around the persistence and availability of information developers care about. In Ceramic terms, developers can provide instructions to their node to explicitly host commits for a specific stream (called pinning), improving resiliency against data loss. However, developers should know that if only one IPFS node is pinning a given stream and it disappears or gets corrupted, the data within that stream will be lost. Additionally, if only one node is responsible for pinning a stream and it goes offline, that stream won’t be available for other nodes to consume (which is why it’s best practice to have multiple IPFS nodes running in different environments pinning the same streams).</p>

<p>In a startling revelation, an anonymous hacker has claimed to have accessed the biometric digital ID numbers and other sensitive personal information of approximately 815 million Indian citizens. This breach is reported to be the largest in the history of India’s Aadhaar, the world’s most extensive biometric digital ID system. The Aadhaar system, which has been a cornerstone of India’s digital infrastructure, is used for everything from tax filings to accessing social services. The implications of such a breach are profound, touching on issues of privacy, security, and trust in digital systems.</p>



<p>The Magnitude of the Breach</p>



<p>Aadhaar, managed by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), has been both lauded for its inclusivity and criticized for potential privacy infringements. It uses biometric data such as fingerprints and iris scans, along with demographic information, to create a unique identity number for each citizen. With the scale of the reported breach, the personal data of more than half the population of India could be at risk. This could lead to widespread identity theft, unauthorized access to bank accounts, and fraud on an unprecedented scale.</p>



<p>The compromised data reportedly includes not just names and ID numbers, but also linked services and biometric data, exponentially magnifying the potential for misuse. This incident raises serious concerns about centralized databases and the mechanisms in place to protect such sensitive information.</p>



<p>Why This Could Not Happen with SSI</p>



<p>In the wake of this massive data breach, it’s crucial to understand why such an event would be highly unlikely with Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) systems. SSI is a user-centric model that enables individuals to own, control, and present their identity without relying on any centralized authority. It represents a transformative approach to personal data management and security in the digital era. Here’s why SSI systems offer a robust defense against the type of breach Aadhaar experienced:</p>



 
 Decentralization: Unlike Aadhaar, which relies on a centralized database, SSI is inherently decentralized. Personal data is stored on users’ devices or on distributed ledgers, ensuring that a single breach does not expose the information of millions. 



 User Control and Consent: SSI gives individuals control over their data. They consent to share specific information with entities they trust and for specified purposes. This reduces the amount of data that can be exposed in any interaction. 



 Minimal Disclosure: SSI is built on the principle of minimal disclosure, meaning that users only need to share the information that is absolutely necessary. For instance, a user can prove their age without revealing their birth date. 



 No Single Point of Failure: Because SSI does not depend on a central repository of data, it lacks a single point of failure. This makes large-scale breaches implausible as each individual’s data is siloed and protected through robust encryption. 



 Verifiable Credentials: SSI relies on cryptographic techniques and blockchain technology, where credentials can be verified without revealing any underlying personal data. Even if a data request is intercepted, the information remains secure. 



 Recovery and Revocation: In the SSI framework, users can recover their identities through independently established recovery networks, and they can revoke compromised credentials without affecting other aspects of their digital identity. 
 



<p>Looking Ahead: The Role of SSI in Safeguarding Identity</p>



<p>The alleged Aadhaar breach is a stark reminder of the risks associated with centralized identity management systems. It underscores the necessity of adopting more secure, privacy-preserving identity solutions like SSI. Nations and organizations around the world are exploring SSI as a viable alternative that empowers citizens while bolstering security.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while the Aadhaar breach exposes the vulnerabilities inherent in centralized identity systems, it also serves as a critical lesson for the global community. It highlights the urgency of transitioning to more resilient, decentralized identity models like SSI, where the principles of user control, privacy, and security are not just ideals, but foundational features. As digital identities become more pervasive in our daily lives, adopting SSI could well be the paradigm shift needed to safeguard the personal data of individuals around the globe.</p>

<p>Authors: Atul Tulshibagwale (<a href="https://sgnl.ai/">SGNL</a>), Apoorva Deshpande (<a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>), and Shayne Miel (<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/duo/index.html">Cisco Duo</a>).</p>
<p>A new draft of the Shared Signals Framework has been released for public review. Here’s how it is different from the previous version.</p>
<p>The OpenID Shared Signals Working Group (SSWG) has made important changes to the Shared Signals Framework (SSF) from the first implementer’s draft that was published in June 2021. The new draft <a href="https://openid.net/public-review-period-for-shared-signals-framework-specification/">entered</a> the 45-day public review period on October 13, 2023.</p>
 Changes Summary 
<p>The new draft is available for review <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0-02.html">here</a>. Here are the main areas of changes:</p>
 Specification Name 
<p>The draft is now called the “Shared Signals Framework” (SSF), instead of the previous name – “Shared Signals and Events Framework”.</p>
 Subjects 
 
 Top-level sub_id claim. The draft now complies with the SubIds recommendation of using sub_id as the subject name and places it at the top-level of the SET. Existing events continue to have the subject member within the event, but new event types need not have this subject 
 Format in complex subjects: The complex subject types now have the following field in them: 
 
 "format": "complex" 
 Transmitter Metadata 
 
 Well Known URL: The well-known URL of the Transmitter is now at 
 
 /.well-known/ssf-configuration 
<p>Instead of the previous location which was: /.well-known/sse-configuration</p>
 
 Spec Version: A Spec version field is now added to the Transmitter Configuration Metadata (TCM). This is set to the implementer’s draft spec version or the final spec version of the document that the Transmitter supports. 
 Authorization Scheme: An authorization scheme has been added to the TCM to specify how the Transmitter authorizes Receivers. 
 Optional jwks_url: jwks_url is now optional 
 
 Streams 
 
 Multi-Stream Support: The draft now supports multiple streams between the same Transmitter and Receiver. The API has been modified to support creating such streams. The draft still allows a Transmitter to support a single stream per Receiver. However, in either case (single-stream or multi-stream Transmitters), the stream needs to be created. Earlier, Receivers only needed to Update the stream configuration in order to establish communication. It is recommended that the endpoint_url is unique 
 Poll Delivery URL: The draft clarifies that the Transmitter must supply the endpoint_url field in the stream creation process. It also defines how the Transmitter can specify the poll URL. 
 Status Restriction: The stream status methods now do not allow subjects to be included in Stream Status methods. 
 Receiver Supplied Description: The Stream now includes a receiver supplied description 
 “Control Plane” Events Always Included: Clarified language the control plane events (Verification and Stream Updated) are always delivered in the stream regardless of the stream configuration 
 Events Delivered: The draft specifies that events_delivered is a subset (not necessarily a proper subset) of the intersection of events_supported and events_requested. Earlier, it was required to be the intersection. 
 Reason in Status: The stream status now includes an optional reason string 
 
 Stream Events 
 
 No Subjects in SSF “Control Plane” Events: The Stream Verification and Stream Updated events restrict the subject in these events to only reference the stream as a whole. 
 
 Security Considerations 
 
 Authorization: The draft no longer recommends using OAuth 2.0 or the client credentials grant flow 
 Audience: Events are no longer recommended to have the OAuth 2.0 Client ID as the audience 
 
 Feedback 
<p>We welcome your feedback on this draft. Please write to <a href="mailto:atul@sgnl.ai">Atul Tulshibagwale</a>, co-chair of the SSWG with your feedback before the review period ends on November 27, 2023.</p>

  <p>We are excited to share our final special episode of the Identity at the Center podcast from the FIDO Alliance Authenticate 2023 conference series!</p><p>We had the privilege of taking the stage as part of the opening keynote, joined by three incredible identity product managers: Mahendar Madhavan, Daniel Grube, and Christiaan Brand.</p><p>During the discussion, we got into the adoption of FIDO authentication, with a focus on passkeys. It was fascinating to hear valuable insights from our guests about their roles at their respective organizations and their firsthand experiences with implementing FIDO authentication. </p><p>But it wasn't all serious business! We also had some lighthearted banter, discussing our hobbies and sharing personal experiences like hiking Yosemite's half-dome. And of course, we couldn't resist asking our guests some fun questions, like which song Daniel would perform to go viral on TikTok and automatically enroll everyone in passkeys!</p><p>We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to Andrew Shikiar, Megan Shamas, and Adrian Loth for their invaluable help in bringing this show to the conference. It wouldn't have been possible without them!</p><p>Episode #244 is available now at idacpodcast.com and in your favorite podcast app.</p><p><a href="https://infosec.exchange/tags/iam">#iam</a> <a href="https://infosec.exchange/tags/podcast">#podcast</a> <a href="https://infosec.exchange/tags/idac">#idac</a> <a href="https://infosec.exchange/tags/authenticate2023">#authenticate2023</a></p>

<p>At the start of the Covid pandemic, a mutual aid group contacted us to ask for support to better understand student needs during the lockdown period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, they hoped to identify where, geographically, students were likely facing significant challenges (as determined by indicators including socioeconomic status, internet connectivity, and local COVID-19 infection rates). To achieve this objective, the team compiled publicly available health, census, and geospatial data using geographic information system (GIS) software. This analysis then enabled them to map out regions where students were most likely to require assistance in the form of food or internet vouchers.</p>



 Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to gather, manage, analyse and visualise spatial and geographic data&nbsp; 



<p>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a framework for gathering, managing, and analyzing spatial and geographic data. Essentially, GIS integrates multiple types of data, from geographical and topological data to statistical and qualitative information, into a unified system that allows for sophisticated spatial analysis and visualization.</p>



<p>While traditional data sets may contain location information (“attributes”) like zip codes or city names, GIS takes this a step further by including attributes about geographic areas. &nbsp;For example, a common use involves mapping the amount of flooding in a given location. These separate bits of&nbsp; information can then be layered on top of each other for displaying on maps or 3D models. The complexity of this data requires specialized data formats that can hold all the necessary layers, as well as software for collection, manipulation, analysis, and visualization.</p>



 What GIS can be used for in the social- and environmental-justice sectors 



<p>Earlier GIS systems were primarily used by specialized institutions because they required expensive, high-end hardware and software. However, advances in technology have made GIS more affordable and accessible, enabling it to be run even on consumer-grade computers and smartphones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The creation of cloud-based GIS solutions has also reduced the need for in-house servers and storage, thereby reducing the potential cost and complexity of deploying GIS technology. Additionally, drones and IoT sensors have made remote data collection more do-able at a lower budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those in the social and environmental justice sectors, this has meant increased access to technologies that can help them achieve their mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Land rights organisation Cadasta, for example, notes that GIS tools can “<a href="https://cadasta.org/sustainablefuture/">help communities gather digital data required for legal land claims</a> while also enabling real-time mapping and monitoring of critical assets such as biodiversity, forest cover, natural resources, and human settlements” Another organisation, Cultural Survival, has used <a href="https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/gis-and-long-range-economic-planning-indigenous">field-based participatory mapping techniques</a> combined with satellite imagery, aerial photographs, and GIS technology in order to explore economic development strategies for indigenous peoples and their territories in the Amazon Basin.&nbsp;</p>



 Potential risks to consider when using GIS technology to map and analyse information about vulnerable populations&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>With the democratization of these technologies also comes increased data collection on vulnerable populations – which means that organisations using or considering using this technology should do so only if they have considered the the risks involved, and taken steps to mitigate these risks (in some cases, a decision might need to be made to not use the technology at all). The list below is offered as a guide to some of the key areas to consider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Privacy and Security: One of the most immediate concerns around using GIS is the potential for the exposure of sensitive personal information. The geolocation capabilities in GIS data can expose details about individuals’ whereabouts and movements. Without rigorous security protocols, this data could be exposed, putting at risk those who may be already vulnerable. 



 Ethical Considerations: GIS technologies also raise ethical questions, particularly regarding the potential for misuse of information. Real-time tracking capabilities can limit personal privacy and freedom, especially when used without consent or adequate transparency. Additionally, if the data ends up in the wrong hands, information intended to be used to protect a resource <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/conservation-technology-9780198850243?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">can be used by poachers to easily locate it</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Discrimination: Another risk lies in the potential for GIS data to perpetuate or even exacerbate existing inequities. If GIS data collection methodologies or interpretation algorithms reflect societal biases, the technology can inadvertently contribute to systemic discrimination.&nbsp; 



 Digital Divide: While GIS technologies are becoming increasingly accessible, there is still a considerable gap in who has the resources and knowledge to leverage these tools effectively. This digital divide means that communities lacking the requisite technological infrastructure or training may be further marginalised, thereby failing to benefit from the advantages that GIS technologies can offer. 



 Environmental Impact: Lastly, the widespread adoption and use of GIS technologies contribute to the environmental footprint of the digital landscape. The energy-intensive nature of data centres required to process and store voluminous GIS data is a growing concern in the age of climate change. 
 



 Should your organisation use GIS technology?&nbsp; 



<p>Affordable advanced mapping and real-time monitoring capabilities can empower organisations in the social- and climate-justice sectors to track and visualize trends and allocate resources efficiently. However, it’s important to remember that with more advanced data collection and practices comes increased risks, particularly for the privacy, security, and well-being of already vulnerable populations. Ethical questions around consent and potential misuse of data need to be surfaced early. It will be crucial for organisations to take the time at the inception of any project that uses geospatial data to carefully assess potential risks and develop strategies for their mitigation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On October 26, we <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/llamada-comunitaria-sostener-ecosistema-de-informacion-saludable/" title="">gathered online</a> with over 20 organisers, activists and journalists from 9 countries in Latin America. We were inspired to hear from speakers Nathaly Espitia (Internews) and Maria Juliana (Universidad Icesi, Cali. Colombia) from <a href="https://noisradio.co/" title="">Colectivo Noís Radio</a>, Júlia Rocha from <a href="https://artigo19.org/" title="">Artigo 19</a>, and Ramiro Alvarez Ugarte from <a href="https://observatoriolegislativocele.com/" title="">CELE</a>, as well as from participants in the call, who joined us in an open discussion about challenges we’re facing in the information ecosystem in the region and opportunities we see for action. In this blog post we’re sharing some of the key takeaways from our conversation.&nbsp;</p>



 A healthy information ecosystem is one where people are able to listen and talk to each other 



<p>Our conversation started with learnings from Maria Juliana and Nathaly Espitia from <a href="https://noisradio.co/" title="">Noís Radio</a>, a collective from Cali (Colombia) that has been working since 2009 on producing live radio programs using voices, music, live sounds and performative actions. They shared that they don’t see themselves as a “traditional” radio station, but rather as a “medio de conversación” (or conversation medium) that creates spaces for conversation and listening, not just one-sided sharing of information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Noís Radio, the key to a healthy information ecosystem is that people are able to listen and talk to each other. This approach was echoed by other participants in the call: for Ramiro Ugarte from CELE, it is key that we think about how to generate more dialogue and conversations, because building spaces where people can have dialogue and connect face-to-face is key to combating polarisation and achieving a healthier information ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 Building trust is a slow-burning process (but it’s worth it!) 



<p>During the call, we talked about some of the factors that serve as a backdrop to our broken information system: the region is going through a period of heightened lack of trust in media and institutions, there is acute political polarisation in various countries, and citizens are dissatisfied with political systems and experiencing information overload.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To respond to this scenario, many participants spoke about the value of creating information initiatives that include processes designed to rebuild trust with people in our communities. For example, in their work, Noís Radio doesn’t approach communities with a fixed, previously defined project – instead, the collective invites people to join them in conversations and share what their needs are, then they work on establishing relationships of trust and “pass the microphone to people in their communities”. During the national strike in Colombia, in 2021, for example, Noís Radio was in Cali <a href="https://noisradio.co/pr-a-la-luna" title="">recording shows from “puntos de resistencia”</a> (resistance points) with social organisations, young people, artists, mothers and other protesters who trusted their microphones and shared their voices. (You can <a href="https://noisradio.co/pr-a-la-luna" title="">listen to the shows here</a>!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>When talking about their experience, Nathaly and Maria Juliana shared that, though the trust building process can be slow, it has proven to be essential, because it gives you an important foundation when you need to organise during a moment of crisis. Having already built trust with the people in their communities over time and having meaningfully involved people in their work in the past meant that Noís Radio were able to mobilise quickly in a difficult political context, generating important conversations within their communities.&nbsp;</p>



 The value of local information initiatives and fostering a sense of community 



<p>The sense that community-led efforts are fundamental to a stronger information ecosystem in the region was echoed by Júlia Rocha, who leads the Access to Information and Transparency team at Artigo 19 in Brazil. In her perspective, “local solutions are the ones that work the most”. In a region where the notion of public interest information has been often shaped by corporate interests, as phrased by Júlia, investing in local, independent, community-led communications is indispensable. Since 2020, her organisation has been supporting the work of popular communication initiatives throughout the country with the campaign #CompartilheInformação, which has given grants to groups providing trustworthy information about <a href="https://artigo19.org/2020/07/08/quinto-e-ultimo-webinar-da-campanha-compartilheinformacao-compartilhesaude-debate-popularizacao-dos-saberes-durante-a-pandemia/" title="">health</a>, <a href="https://artigo19.org/2022/11/07/conheca-os-20-grupos-apoiados-pela-campanha-compartilheinformacao-compartilhedemocracia/" title="">democracy and elections</a> and, soon, the environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brazilian journalism organisations <a href="https://www.agenciamural.org.br/" title="">Agência Mural</a> and <a href="https://enoisconteudo.com.br/" title="">Énois</a> (who also joined our call!) are also showing how valuable local initiatives can be for the information ecosystem. Seeing that people lack access to information at the local, city level, they argue that there needs to be more support to the “<a href="https://ssir.com.br/governo/a-urgencia-de-investir-nos-ecossistemas-locais-de-informacao" title="">development of local initiatives that contribute to reducing news deserts</a>”, which provides citizens with the information they need in order to “participate in public life from the territory where they live”. As <a href="https://ssir.com.br/governo/a-urgencia-de-investir-nos-ecossistemas-locais-de-informacao" title="">Izabela Moi and Nina Weingrill</a> put it: “quality local coverage creates and sustains the feeling of belonging to a community and opens spaces for action and citizen participation.“&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see this in the work of Noís Radio too, in their work to empower more independent voices in the information ecosystem. In our chat, Nathaly and Maria Juliana talked about the importance of creating initiatives that go beyond capital cities, as well as how crucial it is to support the work coming from indigenous communities, afro colombian communities and migrant communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the call, we also heard from <a href="https://baudoap.com/" title="">Agencia Baudó</a> in Colombia, who is doing “journalism that connects communities” by working with community storytellers that are not only providers of information, but also local leaders working in their communities for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/co/app/baudo-ap/id6460035443" title="">social transformation</a>. Another example shared is the work of <a href="https://www.mascomunidad.org.ar/" title="">+COMUNIDAD</a>, an argentinian “solutions journalism medium” that investigates, finds and tells stories of people and cities, solving their challenges and inspiring others to transform themselves.</p>



<p>Participants also talked about the importance of counterbalancing the lack of “official” data about certain topics, especially in regions that lack access to information about issues such as sexual and reproductive health and rights or the environment, with the production of community-driven data or initiatives that democratise access to information. To that end, we talked about initiatives like Artigo 19’s <a href="https://mapaabortolegal.org" title="">map made for Brazilian women to know where to access abortion care</a> in their states – information that had been previously unavailable.</p>



 Fighting harmful trends at a regional level and more support for&nbsp; sustained, long term alliances 



<p>We discussed some of the regional trends in information disorder and how civil society in the region is witnessing the same types of disinformation being shared in many countries. Research led by <a href="https://chequeado.com/" title="">Chequeado</a> (Argentina), <a href="https://www.lasillavacia.com/" title="">La Silla Vacía</a> (Colombia), <a href="https://lupa.uol.com.br/" title="">Lupa</a> (Brazil), <a href="https://www.agenciaocote.com/" title="">Ocote</a> (Guatemala) and <a href="https://ojo-publico.com/" title="">OjoPúblico</a> (Perú), for instance, has shown how <a href="https://chequeado.com/nota/desinformacion-de-genero-como-se-articulan-los-grupos-que-difunden-falsedades-sobre-el-tema-en-america-latina/" title="">groups are organising to spread falsehoods about gender-related issues in Latin America</a>. Recent investigative project <a href="https://www.elclip.org/mercenarios-digitales/" title="">Mercenarios Digitales</a>, led by a cross-border and collaborative media alliance, has gathered evidence on the impact of an international network of disinformation actors operating in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this context, participants shared that it is key to foster more multi-country spaces where civil society organisations, journalists and human rights defenders can work in an articulated manner to build a healthier information ecosystem. Similarly, participants also talked about how important it could be to have regional alliances that would allow them to foresee the types of disinformation and attacks that are emerging in the continent.</p>



 Join our next community call! 



<p>As we make our way through this multi-year project to contribute to a healthier information ecosystem, our team is in awe of the amazing work being done by journalists, communicators, civil society, community organisers and activists who are figuring out creative ways to make sure valuable information is reaching the people in their communities.</p>



<p>Our research for this project is just getting started and we’re looking forward to continuing working with many of you as we build this work. Our next community call is happening on November 23, at 9am Ciudad de México, 10am Bogotá, 12pm São Paulo. (For this call, the main language of communication will be Spanish!)</p>

<p>During the past years, FIDO has continued its expansion as an authentication standard among eIDAS compliant identification solutions across the EU. Back in 2020, FIDO was deployed as part of an eID scheme by the Czech domain register <a href="https://www.mojeid.cz/en/support/two-factor-authentication/">CZ.NIC’s identity provider MojeID</a>, and FIDO’s eID scheme was <a href="https://www.nic.cz/page/4180/cznic-received-accreditation-to-manage-a-qualified-electronic-identification-system-from-the-moi-cr/">recognized as LoA Substantial and High</a> by the Czech ministry of interior. The year after, the <a href="https://www.buypass.com/products/authentication/fido2-solution-for-strong-authentication">Norwegian trust service provider Buypass</a> deployed FIDO2 as an authentication standard for an eIDAS eID scheme of LoA Substantial and High; this solution has been accredited by the Norwegian digitalization agency and is now being rolled out in the Norwegian healthcare sector. In April 2023, the FIDO Alliance published a <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-using-fido-for-the-eudi-wallet/">white paper</a> that describes how FIDO can be used for the EUDI Wallet under the proposed eIDAS2 regulation. So FIDO is currently gaining momentum as an authentication standard in the EU.</p>



<p>On top of these success stories, the FIDO standards have recently been referenced by two of the most respected EU organizations within cybersecurity and standardization: ENISA (the EU Cybersecurity Agency) and ETSI (the European Telecommunications Standards Institute).</p>



<p>In July 2023, ENISA published the report “<a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/digital-identity-standards">Digital Identity Standards</a>”. The report provides a comprehensive overview of digital identity standards, standardization organizations, and authentication protocols. More specifically, the report describes the FIDO Alliance as “an open industry association launched in February 2013 whose stated mission is to develop and promote authentication standards that ‘help reduce the world’s over-reliance on passwords”. Furthermore, the ENISA report describes the FIDO standard suite FIDO2, FIDO U2F and FIDO UAF in technical detail. The ENISA report also explains the concepts of FIDO Authenticators, FIDO Metadata Service, assertions with Relying Parties, and the WebAuthn and CTAP2 APIs. ENISA concludes that the maturity of the FIDO standards is high. This ENISA report re-iterates and emphasizes the recommendation to use FIDO for two-factor authentication, which was published in 2022 in the joint publication “<a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/boosting-your-organisations-cyber-resilience">Boosting your Organisation’s Cyber Resilience</a>” issued in cooperation by EU-CERT and ENISA.</p>



<p>Next, ETSI published the technical report <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/119400_119499/119476/01.01.01_60/tr_119476v010101p.pdf">ETSI TR 119 476</a> called “Analysis of selective disclosure and zero-knowledge proofs applied to Electronic Attestation of Attributes”. The ETSI report analyzes cryptographic schemes for selective disclosure and their potential application for Electronic Attestation Attributes in line with the proposed <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0281">eIDAS2 regulation</a>. The purpose is to allow the users of the EUDI Wallets to select what attributes they want to share with a verifier. For example, a user may only want to disclose that she is over 18 years old at a restaurant, but no more personal information than that. The ETSI report includes a description of the VC-FIDO solution, which has been invented by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3taGxBdrRU">David Chadwick at the Kent University</a>. The ETSI report states:</p>



<p>“The VC-FIDO integration is based on the W3C WebAuthn protocol in the FIDO2 standard. The WebAuthn stack is extended with a W3C Verifiable Credentials enrollment protocol, resulting in a client that can enroll for multiple atomic short-lived W3C Verifiable Credentials based on W3C Credential templates. These atomic short-lived W3C Verifiable Credentials can then be (temporarily) stored in an EUDI Wallet, and be combined into a Verifiable Presentation that is presented to the relying party (verifier). Selective disclosure is achieved since the user can enroll for the atomic attributes it needs for a specific use case, and present only those atomic (Q)EAAs to a Relying Party.”</p>



<p>These prominent references in the ENISA and ETSI reports demonstrate that FIDO has achieved a firm position as a viable authentication standard for eIDAS2 and regulated use cases in the EU. It will be interesting to follow the continued development of the EUDI Wallet implementations and the related Large Scale Pilots – it is quite likely that FIDO will be deployed in such solutions across the EU.</p>

These projects are touted to control migration, bolstering a <a href="https://www.tni.org/en/publication/financing-border-wars">lucrative multi-billion-dollar border industrial complex</a>. Coupled with increasing international environmental destabilization, more and more people are ensnared in a growing and global surveillance dragnet. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/02/22/robotic-dogs-arizona-border-will-not-solve-migrant-crisis/">Thousands have already died</a>.

Through years of my travels from Palestine to Ukraine to Kenya to US/Mexico, the power of comparison shows me time and again how these spaces allow for frontier mentalities to take over, creating environments of silence and violence.</p><p>In this era of generative technologies, this work is underpinned by broader questions: Whose perspectives matter when talking about innovation, and whose priorities take precedence? What does critical representation and meaningful participation look like — representation that foregrounds people’s agency and does not contribute to the <a href="https://www.fmreview.org/photo-policy#:~:text=We%20have%20decided%20that%20we,correct%20way%20to%20do%20this">“poverty porn” that is so common in representations coming from spaces of forced migration</a>? And who gets to create narratives and generate stories that underpin the foundations of tools like GPT-4 and whatever else is coming&nbsp;next?</p>Clockwise from top left: High-tech refugee camp on Kos Island in Greece; surveillance tower in Arizona; two women cross the Ukraine-Poland border; memorial site in the Sonora desert; protest against new refugee camp on Samos; Calvin, a medical doctor, holds keys from his apartment in Ukraine after escaping across the Hungary border. Photos by Petra Molnar, 2021–2022.<p>Tools like generative AI are socially constructed by and with particular perspectives and value systems. They are a reflection of the so-called Global North and can encode and perpetuate biases and discrimination. In August of this year, to test out where generative AI systems are at, I ran a simple prompt through the Canva and Craiyon image generation software: “What does a refugee look&nbsp;like?”</p> What stories do these images tell? What perspectives do they&nbsp;hide? <p>It is telling that for generative AI, the concept of a “refugee” elicits either forlorn and emaciated faces of Black children or else portraits of doe-eyed and vaguely Middle Eastern people waiting to be rescued. When I sent these depictions to a colleague who is currently in a situation of displacement and identifies as a refugee, she laughed and said, “I sure as hell hope I don’t look like&nbsp;this.”</p><p>Generative AI is also inherently exploitative. Its training data are scraped and extracted often without the knowledge or consent of the people who created or are in the data. Menial tasks that allow the models to function fall on underpaid labor outside of North America and Europe. The benefits of this technology do not accrue equally, and generative AI looks to replicate the vast power differentials between those who benefit and those who are the subjects of high-risk technological experiments.</p> How can we think more intentionally about who will be impacted by generative AI and work collaboratively–and rapidly–with affected populations to build knowledge? <p>The production of any kind of knowledge is always a political act, especially since researchers often build entire careers on documenting the trauma of others, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jhuman/huq004">stealing stories” as they go along</a>. Being entrusted with other people’s stories is a deep privilege. Generating any type of knowledge is not without its pitfalls, and academia is in danger of falling into the same trap with generative AI research: creating knowledge in isolation from communities, failing to consider the expertise of those we’re purporting to learn from. How can researchers and storytellers limit the extractive nature of research and story collection? Given the power differentials involved, research and storytelling can and should be uncomfortable, and we must pay particular attention to why certain perspectives in the so-called Global North are given precedence while the <a href="https://datasociety.net/library/a-primer-on-ai-in-from-the-majority-world/">rest of the world continues to be silenced</a>. This is particularly pertinent when we are talking about a vast system of increasingly autonomous knowledge generation through&nbsp;AI.</p><p>The concept of story and knowledge stewardship may be helpful, a concept from Indigenous learnings which recognizes that the storyteller is not exempt from critical analysis of their own power and privilege over other people’s narratives and should instead hold space for stories to tell themselves. This type of framing continually places responsibility at the center (see for example the work of the Canadian <a href="https://fnigc.ca/">First Nations Information Governance Centre</a>). Storytelling and sharing is also a profound act of resistance to simplified and homogenized narratives, often common when there is a power differential between the researcher and their topic. Established methods of knowledge production are predicated on an outside expert parachuting in, extracting data, findings, and stories, using their westernized credentials to further their careers as the&nbsp;expert.</p><p>True commitment to participatory approaches requires ceding space, meaningfully redistributing resources, and supporting affected communities in telling their own stories. And real engagement with decolonial methodologies requires an iterative understanding of these framings, a re-framing process that is never complete. By decentering so-called Global North narratives and not tokenizing people with lived experience as research subjects or afterthoughts, researchers can create opportunities that recognize their privilege and access to resources — and then redistribute those resources through meaningful participation, creating an environment for people to tell their own stories. It is this commitment to participatory approaches that we need in generative AI research, especially as it meets up with border control technologies.</p><p>One small example is the <a href="https://www.migrationtechmonitor.com/">Migration and Technology Monitor</a> project at the York University’s <a href="https://refugeelab.ca/">Refugee Law Lab</a>, where I am Associate Director.&nbsp;, Migration and Technology Monitor is a platform and an archive with a focus on migration, technology, and human rights. Our recently launched <a href="https://www.migrationtechmonitor.com/2023fellows">fellowship program</a> aims to create opportunities for people with lived experience to meaningfully contribute to research, storytelling, policy, and advocacy conversations from the start, not as an afterthought. Among our aims is to generate a collaborative, intellectual, and advocacy community committed to border justice. We prioritize opportunities for participatory work, including the ability to pitch unique and relevant projects by affected communities themselves. Veronica Martinez, Nery Sataella, Simon Drotti, Rajendra Paudel, and Wael Qarssifi are part of our first cohort of fellows from mobile communities from Venezuela to Mexico to Uganda to Nepal to Malaysia. Our hope is that our fellowship creates a community which provides spaces of collaboration, care, and co-creation of knowledge. We are specifically sharing resources with people on the move who may not be able to benefit from funding and resources readily available in the EU and North America. People with lived experiences of migration must be in the driver’s seat when interrogating both the negative impacts of technology as well as the creative solutions that innovation can bring to the complex stories of human movement, such as using generative AI to compile resources for mobile communities.</p><p>Participatory methodologies that foreground lived experience as the starting place for generating knowledge inherently destabilize established power hierarchies of knowledge production. These approaches encourage researchers and tech designers to critically interrogate their own positionality and how much space their own so-called expertise takes up in the generation of knowledge at the expense of other realities. These framings and commitments are paramount, especially in context with fraught histories and vast power differentials–for example, where mobile populations are the abject and feared others and where generative AI models learn on these realities. Especially pertinent for scholars, technologists, and researchers who are themselves part of the so-called Rest of World, a re-imagination of expertise and knowledge must come from the ground up and any tools which are created must recognize and fight against these power differentials.</p><p>It is through participatory methodologies that we may come a step closer towards seeing a world in which many worlds fit, a phrase which as my BKC colleague Ashley Lee reminds us, comes from the Zapatista Indigenous resistance movement — a world where “nothing about us without us” moves beyond an old community organizer motto towards a real commitment to participation, story stewardship, and public scholarship which honors and foregrounds lived experience.</p><p>Thank you to Madeline McGee for her suggestions which greatly improved this piece and to Sam Hinds for her careful&nbsp;edits.</p><p>This essay is part of the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/generative-futures/home">Co-Designing Generative Futures series</a>, a collection of multidisciplinary and transnational reflections and speculations about the transformative shifts brought on by generative artificial intelligence.

 A Real-Time Experiment to Regulate Generative AI Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christianlue?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Christian Lue</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>.<p>The public release of ChatGPT in November 2022 represents a significant breakthrough in generative AI — systems that craft synthetic content based on patterns learned from extensive datasets. This development has heightened concerns about AI’s impact on individuals and society at large. In the brief period since this breakthrough, there has been a surge in lawsuits pertaining to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/arts/sarah-silverman-lawsuit-openai-meta.html">copyright</a> and <a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/microsoft-and-openai-sued-for-3bn-in-privacy-complaint/">privacy</a> violations, as well as<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australian-mayor-readies-worlds-first-defamation-lawsuit-over-chatgpt-content-2023-04-05/"> defamation</a>. One lawyer learned a hard lesson about the dangers of AI “hallucination” after citing seemingly genuine but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html">bogus</a> judicial precedents generated by ChatGPT in a legal brief submitted to court. There are even reports that such systems have been implicated in an individual’s decision to commit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkadgm/man-dies-by-suicide-after-talking-with-ai-chatbot-widow-says">suicide</a>.</p><p>Given these concerns, there is a growing demand for regulatory action. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, addressed the US Congress in May and called upon legislators to&nbsp;act.</p><p>The EU has taken the lead in legislative endeavors. In April 2021, the European Commission proposed a Regulation on AI (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52021PC0206">AI Act</a>), marking the first step toward a comprehensive global legal framework on AI. This landmark legislation aims to foster a human-centric AI, directing its development in a way that respects human dignity, safeguards fundamental rights, and guarantees the security and trustworthiness of AI&nbsp;systems.</p><blockquote>The agile innovation process that permeates the software world, where distributed technologies are frequently released in early stages and iteratively refined based on usage data, necessitates a regulatory system that is designed to learn and&nbsp;adapt.</blockquote><p>The proposed AI Act adopts a risk-based approach, categorizing AI systems into three main risk levels: unacceptable risk, high risk, and limited risk. This classification depends on the potential risk posed to health, safety, and fundamental rights. Certain AI systems such as those that generate “trustworthiness” scores, akin to the Chinese Social Credit System, are considered to present unacceptable risks and are completely prohibited. AI systems used in hiring processes and welfare benefit decisions fall into the high-risk category and are subject to stringent obligations. These include conducting a conformity assessment and adhering to certain data quality and transparency requirements. Meanwhile, chatbots and deepfakes are considered limited risk, subject to relatively minimal transparency requirements.</p><p>Shortly after the proposal was drafted, and after the release of ChatGPT, it became clear that the Commission’s draft contained a significant hole: it did not address general purpose AI or “foundational models” like Open AI’s GPT-n series, which underpins ChatGPT. Fortunately, due to the EU’s multistage legislative process, the release of ChatGPT occurred while the European Parliament was deliberating on the AI Act. This provided a timely opportunity to include new provisions specifically targeting foundational models and generative AI.</p><p>Under an <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2023-0236_EN.pdf">amendment</a> adopted by the European Parliament in June, providers of foundational models would be required to identify and reduce risks to health, safety, and fundamental rights through proper design and testing before placing their models on the market. They must also implement measures to ensure appropriate levels of performance and adopt strategies to minimize energy and resource usage. Moreover, these AI systems must be registered in an EU database, with details on their capabilities, foreseeable risks, and measures taken to mitigate these risks, including an account of risks that remain unaddressed. The amendment would impose additional obligations on foundational models employed in generative AI. These obligations include transparency requirements, ensuring users are aware that content is machine generated, and implementing adequate safeguards against the generation of unlawful content. Providers must also publish a detailed summary of copyrighted content used to train their&nbsp;systems.</p><p>While the final version of the AI Act will be determined by the trilogue among the European Commission, European Parliament, and European Council, its current form already marks an ambitious and real-time attempt to regulate generative AI, highlighting the challenges of regulating a rapidly evolving&nbsp;target.</p><p>On this occasion, the EU’s legislative process kept pace with the latest advancements before the laws were set in stone. However, it raises the question: how often can we count on such fortunate timing, and what proactive measures should be&nbsp;taken?</p><p>We must embed flexibility into such laws. Indeed, the EU has taken some steps in this direction, granting the Commission the authority to adapt the law by adding new use cases into the risk categories. Yet, considering previous experiences with the Commission’s implementation of delegated acts, it’s debatable whether such mechanisms alone can keep up with the rapid pace of AI development.</p><p>The agile innovation process that permeates the software world, where distributed technologies are frequently released in early stages and iteratively refined based on usage data, necessitates a regulatory system that is designed to learn and&nbsp;adapt.</p><p>It is important to embrace a variety of techniques for adaptive regulation, such as regulatory experimentation through pilot projects and embedding systematic and periodic review and revision mechanisms into legislation. Adaptive regulation further necessitates openness to a diversity of approaches across jurisdictions. It encourages learning from one another, which implies that the EU should resist its inclination to solely dictate global standards for AI regulation, and instead regard its efforts as contributions to a collective pool of learning resources.</p><blockquote>While adaptive regulation does come with its own costs, clinging to static regulation designed for a hardware world with fully-formed products manufactured in centralized facilities, could potentially prove to be even more costly in the face of rapidly advancing technology.</blockquote><p>Simultaneously, the amendment has significantly broadened the Act’s scope. While the Commission’s draft focused on mitigating harms to health, safety, and fundamental rights, the European Parliament’s version extends these concerns to include democracy, the rule of law, and environmental protection. Consequently, providers of high-risk AI systems and foundational models are required to manage risks associated with all these areas. However, this raises concerns that the Act might transform into a catch-all regulation with diluted impact, thereby creating a considerable burden on providers to translate these broad goals into concrete guardrails.</p><p>This amendment has exacerbated existing concerns that these broad requirements and accompanying compliance costs might stifle innovation. In an open <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wrtxfvcD9FwfNfWGDL37Q6Nd8wBKXCkn/view">letter</a> to EU authorities, over 150 executives from companies including Siemens, Airbus, Deutsche Telekom, and Renault criticized the AI Act for its potential to “undermine Europe’s competitiveness and technological autonomy.” One of the significant concerns raised by these companies relates to the legislation’s strict requirements aimed at generative AI systems and foundational models. The letter equates the importance of generative AI with the invention of the internet, considering its potential to shape not only the economy but also culture and politics. The signatories caution that the compliance costs and risks embedded in the AI Act could “result in highly innovative companies relocating their operations overseas, investors retracting their capital from the development of European foundational models, and European AI in general.”</p><p>OpenAI has already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/25/23737116/openai-ai-regulation-eu-ai-act-cease-operating">warned</a> about potentially exiting the EU if the conditions of the AI Act prove too restrictive. There are also indications that even major players are cautious when rolling out their latest services. The launch of Google Bard was delayed in the EU by two months due to compliance concerns with the General Data Protection Regulation. However, it was ultimately introduced with improved <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3702768/google-bard-launches-in-eu-overcoming-data-privacy-concerns-in-the-region.html">privacy</a> safeguards, highlighting the EU’s role in shaping global data policies of such organizations.</p><p>For its part, the EU contends that the AI Act is designed to stimulate AI innovation and underscores key enabling measures included in the Act. These encompass regulatory sandboxes, which serve as test beds for AI experimentation and development, an industry-led process for defining standards that assist with compliance, and safe harbors for AI research.</p><p>Of course, the concerns from the industry about the AI Act’s impact on innovation, as well as the EU’s responses to these matters, represent an essential part of balancing the inevitable trade-offs inherent in regulating any emerging technology, and time will tell which direction the pendulum swings. During the trilogue negotiations, it is likely that the European Council will push back on some of the amendments from the Parliament. Indeed, there is merit in carefully weighing the benefits of introducing broad objectives such as democracy and the rule of law without concrete measures in place to support these goals. One might argue that efforts are better spent strengthening the safeguards for fundamental rights, which is crucial for safeguarding both democracy and the rule of law. Numerous civil society organizations have already emphasized the need for incorporating fundamental rights impact assessments and empowering individuals and public interest organizations to file complaints and seek redress for harms inflicted by&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Moreover, it would be beneficial to concentrate on tangible guardrails, such as facilitating researchers’ access to foundational models, data, and parameters. This approach is likely to be more effective in promoting accountability, democracy, and the rule of law compared to a general requirement to conduct risk assessments based on such broad concepts.</p><p>Regardless of the final form of the text, the AI Act is poised to significantly shape AI development and the regulatory landscape in the EU and beyond.

 Global Collaboration Creates Ethical Generative AI <p>Though the underlying technology was based on years of AI research by many individuals and organizations, the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in November of 2022 captured the collective imagination in an extraordinary way. The release started an ongoing conversation about the potential of the technology to improve our lives, and to harm them. In the public consciousness, AI has remained confusing, overwhelming, and a bit scary — even its name can seem imprecise and distracting. And with generative AI, phrases like “hallucination” and “job replacement” only foment more fear. Yet beneath the hype, doomerism, and techno-utopianism sits the fundamental question of what kind of societies we want to live in — and what choices we should make to realize&nbsp;them.</p><p>One month after the release of ChatGPT, a group of collaborators — the Nordic Centre at BI Norwegian Business School, the Institute for Technology and Society of Rio de Janeiro, the Technical University of Munich, and the Berkman Klein Center — decided it was time to discuss the implications of generative AI. We knew that if generative AI were to realize its true pro-social potential and to have its harms mitigated, then cross-sector, cross-disciplinary, and cross-national conversation was needed. Many in our community had already begun to explore use cases, governance, accountability, and the systems’ social impact broadly. It was time to rebuild bridges weakened by the COVID pandemic&nbsp;era.</p>Sabelo Mhlambi and Jenn Louie at “Co-Designing Generative Futures: A Global Conversation about AI,” May&nbsp;2023.<p>In May 2023, the Berkman Klein Center hosted “Co-Designing Generative Futures: A Global Conversation about AI” in Cambridge, USA, bringing together colleagues old and new with backgrounds from academia, civil society, government, and industry, from over two dozen countries and all of the continents other than Antarctica. We discussed the need for access to data for research purposes and the need for real&nbsp;study.</p><p>At the same time, many emphasized that policymakers do not have the time; they need to act now. Action and study need to happen in parallel.</p>Samson Esayas at “Co-Designing Generative Futures: A Global Conversation about AI,” May&nbsp;2023.<blockquote>Today we introduce the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/generative-futures/home">Co-Designing Generative Futures series</a>, a collection of multidisciplinary, transnational reflections and speculations about the transformative shifts brought on by generative artificial intelligence, as seen by members of the Berkman Klein Center community.</blockquote><p>In the first set of essays, <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-eu-ai-act-e73e1a35a843">Samson Esayas</a> addresses the potential implications of policy, speculating on the role the European Union’s AI Act may play in the governance and development of generative technologies. And <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/building-knowledge-about-generative-ai-with-mobile-populations-806c80e899b1">Petra Molnar</a> challenges us to consider the potential impact of generative AI on the surveillance of borders and of migrants, urging us to engage displaced people using participatory methods to understand their perspectives and protect their&nbsp;safety.</p><p>The second installment addresses how generative AI challenges fundamental concerns about our experiences of being human. <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/preserving-social-connections-against-the-backdrop-of-generative-ai-abcaebd45c3d">Alexa Hasse</a> examines how generative AI tools might change trust in our human social relationships. <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/thinking-through-generative-ai-harms-among-users-on-online-platforms-79cf9b2af49a">Sameer Hinduja</a> offers a deep dive into the sobering potential of generative AI tools to perpetuate online harassment at massive scale. And <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/you-know-for-kids-47731a0a72f8">Bill Shribman</a> brings the perspective of a children’s media producer as he explores how media literacy education may need to shift in light of advancements in AI technology.</p>Maroussia Lévesque and Petra Molnar at “Co-Designing Generative Futures: A Global Conversation about AI,” May&nbsp;2023.<p>As members of our community continue to study generative AI, both the urgency and the need for deeper consideration persist. Policymakers are moving quickly towards substantial legislation in multiple regions across the world. The technology keeps improving. Technology innovators are finding new applications for generative AI, and we likely have only scratched the surface of what is to come. Researchers are publishing new findings about concerns regarding bias, data privacy, data ownership, disinformation, and vast inequities across regions and communities. And they urgently need more access to data. Looking forward, the necessity for continued collaboration across sectoral, national, and disciplinary boundaries seems all the more critical.</p><p>As Senior Director of Programs and Strategy at the Berkman Klein Center, I am committed to sustaining co-design efforts. We welcome fresh perspectives and opportunities for engagement from around the globe, and from new sectors and stakeholders.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/co-designing-shared-futures-3d15f9883773">Co-Designing Shared Futures</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>TORONTO, OCTOBER 31st, 2023 — There is a public trust gap in adopting digital trust capabilities that governments must close together with the private sector to amplify Canadian priorities in the global digital economy, according to a new report from DIACC.</p>



<p>Digital trust tools help verify a person or organization’s identity to enhance privacy, security, and transparency using people-centred design to operate digital credentials, digital wallets, networks, and modern authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report, Committed to Building Trust Together, found no strong call to action from the public to advance digital trust even though Canadians are increasingly frustrated by online scams and identity theft, among other high-profile security and data breaches that affect them. The lack of vocal public demand for digital trust is partly due to a need for education about what it is and, most importantly, how it can benefit and improve their lives.</p>



<p>“Hesitancy is often rooted in data privacy, security, and potential misuse of personal information concerns. People should rightly be concerned because there are often no easily understood rules around where their personal data lives, who owns it, or how others use it,” said Joni Brennan, president of the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC). “In today’s digital world, trust remains at a premium, and the importance of identity verification is at an all-time high.”</p>



<p>Digital trust capabilities are critical — and long overdue — to support a secure and inclusive digital economy and society. From more efficient business tasks that save millions of dollars to getting the proper health records and making it easier to buy a house or board a plane, privacy and personal data control are potent tools that can help safely confirm a person’s identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report follows two Public Trust Forum sessions that brought together members from academia, non-profit organizations, private sector companies and provincial and territorial governments. Participants spoke in-depth about the challenges, opportunities, and considerations for creating the conditions to enable made-in-Canada solutions.</p>



<p>Public Trust Forum participants reached a consensus on the following key takeaways:</p>



 
 There will never be a universal consensus on acceptance of digital trust capabilities. Universal acceptance should not be the goal. 



 Use of government-issued digital credentials must be voluntary. People must have the choice to opt-out, as they can opt-out in the private sector. 



 There’s no strong call to action from the public to advance digital trust. There is a need for education about digital trust and, most importantly, how it can benefit and improve people’s lives. 



 An effective communications strategy should focus on real-life success stories in different use cases. That means practical examples of how digital trust capabilities improve service delivery, such as in the aviation and financial sectors. 



 Though it’s been around for a long time, the term “digital identity” may hinder the public’s understanding. 



 Terms such as “verify,” “authenticate,” or “credentials” may make it easier for those who are unsure about new technologies to see the benefits. 



 DON’T abandon the term “digital identity.” It’s a profession and a globally recognized definition; its use will depend on the audience and situation. 



 Jurisdictionally, with Canadian news removed from popular social media platforms, there may be a vacuum to spread mis and disinformation regarding digital modernization. 
 



<p>DIACC made five recommendations that all organizations should prioritize to inform public dialogue and build trust.</p>



 
 Don’t wait for a universal public consensus on adopting digital trust capabilities because it will never come. Commit and message that public adoption is voluntary. Individuals may choose to use digital trust services or not. 



 Make significant public education investments at municipal, provincial and federal levels and the private sector to inform the public about well-designed capabilities. Focus on easy use cases (i.e., digital parking or bus passes, obtaining a business licence). 



 Reduce the temperature by moving public messaging away from the confusing term “digital identity” in certain situations. Terms like “verify,” “authenticate,” and “credential” are more easily understood. 



 Communicate public safety importance as scenarios where digital services reduce response pressure and help get resources faster to those in need. Pandemic-related personal safety concerns accelerated the demand for modern digital services. 



 Break transformation down into manageable outcomes rather than trying to boil the ocean with a national or universal strategy. 
 



<p>“The bottom line is that organizations and governments must prioritize transparency, robust data protection measures, and ethical data usage while actively engaging with the public to address concerns and ensure that digital trust capabilities are developed and implemented to protect and enhance individual privacy and security and support organizations’ operational needs,” Brennan said. “Establishing safe and convenient use of digital ID services means establishing trust. People must have confidence and control over their identity data, and on the flip side, they must have evidence that their privacy, security and choices are secured.”</p>



<p>“Citizens and residents vocalize their frustrations with services that aren’t’ modernized, and they’re looking to governments and the private sector to lead the way in the global digital economy collaboratively,” said Giselle D’Paiva, Partner, Government &amp; Public Sector, Deloitte.</p>



<p>“Trust is local, and designing made-in-Canada solutions for digital access and verification will help build consumer confidence, trust, and broad adoption,” said Neil Butters, VP of Product, Interac Verified.</p>



<p>“Securing digital trust for the supply chain and global digital economy depends on local and international leadership and collaboration to advance frameworks and standards that ensure broad benefits,” said Don Cuthbertson, Chief Executive Officer of Portage CyberTech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re working to help the public understand that global standards increase trust, reduce fraud and make it safer and more convenient for our customers to transact,” said Marie Jordan, Senior Director at VISA, Global Standards and Industry Engagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DIACC will reconvene the Public Trust Forum at intervals to review what’s transpired since the last forum, address critical thematic developments, and continue public literacy research to pinpoint how perception evolves among the public.</p>

We’ll also get into general tips. Like <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/radiating-confidence-at-change-org-9fbbe9f4fc2f">our first post</a>, we’ve pulled out the key questions you can ask yourself to help you&nbsp;prepare.</p> Running your&nbsp;session <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_12RxeZrt3k2PIqiKn3bi97od6bBxifBPIOR8VrXwlI/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">Speaking and Facilitation: Tips &amp; Tricks: Part 3</a>&nbsp;(slides)</p><p>Start as you mean to go on, as they say. In order to create a positive atmosphere, be an enlarged version of yourself. If you’re funny, make people laugh. If you’re not, at least try to put people at their ease as best you can! That can be as simple as smiling&nbsp;:)</p> At the start of your&nbsp;session cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>There may be someone in the room in which you’re going to be running your session immediately before you. If the event planners did their job well, however, you will have at least a few minutes to get set up. If you feel like you’re rushing, just ask everyone to get acquainted with the person next to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Even if there’s a tech person on hand, don’t assume that everything is set up to your liking. Check the remotes. Check that the fonts on the slides you sent through look correct. Check the microphone works. Check everything. Twice.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Aristotle famously said that we become brave by acting like a brave person. If you smile, everyone assumes that you are confident and are enjoying the experience. Smiling is particularly infectious, so smile away at people as they arrive. Just not in a scary&nbsp;way.</p><p>Some questions to reflect&nbsp;on:</p>  What can you do to get set up or prepared even before you enter the&nbsp;room?  Have you got a backup copy of your slide deck? Could you run the session without&nbsp;them?  What kind of questions can you ask people as they arrive which will make them feel&nbsp;welcome?  What’s the worst that can&nbsp;happen?  If you’ve used a link shortener, have you checked it isn’t blocked on the event&nbsp;wifi?   During your&nbsp;session <p>Sessions at events can be a rollercoaster of emotions and energy, both for the whoever is leading the session (you!) and the audience/participants.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Preparation is important, but so is delivery, so make sure people and ideas have time to ‘breathe’. Mix up the pace of the session to keep it interesting. Even if you practise, it’s easy to run over due to people arriving late, a question derailing your flow, or just you being over-enthusiastic about a particular section. Keep track of timings using your watch, phone, or presenter display. Bonus points for vibrating alarms,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Questions to think&nbsp;about:</p>  Have you left enough time for questions?  Can you think of questions you are expecting to get and can prepare&nbsp;for?  Are there easy analogies you can use from everyday&nbsp;life?  Did you know that audience members with a ‘concentration face’ can also look like them frowning?  When people read they tend to use a monotone voice — have you practised modulating your voice (making it go up and down, faster and slower) to make it more interesting to listen&nbsp;to?  cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers At the end of your&nbsp;session <p>Just because you’ve informed your audience of the link to the slide deck once doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t do it again. Especially as they’ve now seen how good it is. Ensure it’s on the screen at the end of your session for a good&nbsp;while.</p><p>Questions to prepare you for the&nbsp;end:</p>  Can you make the link to your slides and agenda as easy to access as possible by ensuring there are no ambiguous characters (e.g. l vs&nbsp;1)?  Do you want to add your social media details to these resources as well? Which&nbsp;one(s)?  Are there particular ‘rabbit holes’ that people tend to want to go down with the topic of your&nbsp;session?   Recovering from&nbsp;sessions <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sz0OT0mp-_YWuy2AB4Jr125rf5lgPbVkxDuwcjXJLEw/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">Speaking and Facilitation: Tips &amp; Tricks: Part 4</a>&nbsp;(slides)</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Congratulations! Your session is over and it’s time to relax a little. Instead of flopping into a heap in the corner or hitting the bar, take steps to look after yourself. Spending time outside, following-up with interesting people, and eating/drinking the right things are all ways to refresh your mind, body, and&nbsp;soul!</p><p>Don’t forget to take a moment to breathe and ask yourself these questions while you’re preparing:</p>  Are there spaces outside you can be by yourself for a while? (especially if you’re an introvert)  Can you take food and drink into the room you’re running your&nbsp;session?  What are you going to reward yourself&nbsp;with?  How can you make it so that people who missed your session can almost feel like they participated?  Is it worth putting your out of office autoresponder on during the&nbsp;event?

It helps everyone have a better time. Ask questions! Sometimes you’ve got all of the answers and you’re bestowing your wisdom. More often, you’re exploring an area, sharing your experience, and asking questions for your colleagues to grapple with along with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Remember nothing is irrelevant and you should share openly. The things that you find boring and mundane such as how you set something up or the problems you had recruiting someone to do X can be fascinating and gold dust to other people. So mention them! You can go into more detail in the Q&amp;A if&nbsp;asked.</p><p>People aren’t coming to your session because you’re a huge rockstar and they want to bask in your glory. Or maybe they are.

<p>In the latest Elastos Bi-Weekly Update, significant progress has been made across different areas of the project. On the <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/mainchain/intro/">Elastos Main Chain</a>, the core teams have completed the development and testing phases for changing the BPoS voting consensus mechanisms via pledging. This development is expected to bring about greater flexibility and enhanced security to the voting system. Additionally, advancements in Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof verification are enabling more secure transactions and there have been direct network recovery features undergoing refinements through BPoS consensus logic, helping make the system more resilient. While the Elastos BTC Layer 2 solution is still under research,&nbsp; check out the <a href="https://blockchain.elastos.io/">Main Chain explorer</a> which has also seen an update that enhances data visualization, and a new <a href="https://blockchain.elastos.io/calculator">tool calculating staking rights and rewards</a> which has just been introduced.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/sidechains/intro/">Elastos Smart Chain (ESC)</a>, significant strides have been made in incentivising developer involvement. A new developer incentive mechanism has been implemented, and it’s currently in the testing and verification stage. In terms of transaction costs, there is an ongoing debate about adjusting the gas fees. While a consensus hasn’t been reached, it remains an important point of discussion for making Elastos more rewarding to stakeholders. A preliminary plan is in place that aims to redistribute block rewards to miners, contract developers, and the CR treasury through an adjusted gas fee mechanism.</p>
<p>For the ESC/EID intersection, SPV synchronisation stability has been notably improved, leading to a more consistent block generation speed for sidechains. Issues of unstable block generation due to node failures in the broadcasting mechanism have been effectively addressed, adding another layer of reliability to the network.</p>
<p>In the area of <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/dids/intro/">Decentralised Identifier (DID)</a> Web Service and <a href="https://kyc-me.io/">KYC-me</a>, there are plans for significant upgrades by the end of the year. These are aimed at integrating with KYC-me, which is extending its support for multiple eKYC providers. User experience enhancements are actively being worked on, following the trend of continuous improvement seen in the DID Web Service.</p>
<p>This comprehensive series of updates reflects Elastos’ commitment to advancing both its core infrastructure in blockchain technology and decentralised identity solutions.

<p>UBL v2.4 ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that Universal Business Language Version 2.4 from the OASIS Universal Business Language TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>UBL is the leading interchange format for business documents. It is designed to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes. The European Commission has declared UBL officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations, and in 2015 UBL was approved as ISO/IEC 19845:2015.</p>



<p>Specifically, UBL provides:<br>– A suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business documents.<br>– A library of schemas for reusable data components such as Address, Item, and Payment, the common data elements of everyday business documents.<br>– A set of schemas for common business documents such as Order, Despatch Advice, and Invoice that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation contexts.</p>



<p>UBL v2.4 is a minor revision to v2.3 that preserves backwards compatibility with previous v2.# versions. It adds new document types, bringing the total number of UBL business documents to 93.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>

<p>In April 2023, the OpenID Foundation announced the 2023 Kim Cameron Award recipients. Today we’re pleased for the award recipients to share their experiences.</p>
<p>The goal of the awards is to increase representation from young people’s who’ve demonstrated an interest in subjects consistent with best practices and identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-henderson-76171a68/">Isaac Henderson</a><br>Senior Security Researcher at the University of Stuttgart IAT/Fraunhofer IAO</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am humbled and honored to express my gratitude to the OpenID Foundation for bestowing upon me the prestigious Kim Cameron Award. Through this, I had an opportunity to attend the Identiverse Conference in Las Vegas. In this blog post, I will take you through the highlights of my Identiverse experience and share my heartfelt appreciation for the recognition that has fueled my commitment to the world of digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Identiverse Conference has established itself as a global hub for identity professionals, and technologists. The core of Identiverse lies in its power-packed keynotes and parallel sessions. Visionaries from diverse industries took the stage to discuss the rapidly evolving landscape of digital identity. Each presentation was a mosaic of ideas, woven together to form a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. From discussions about Decentralized identity, secured authentication, and Zero Trust Architectures to the exploration of advancements in AI-driven security solutions, the keynotes painted a vivid picture of the possibilities awaiting us. And notably, deep dive sessions on Passkeys, Microsoft EntraID, and SPIFFE-based distributed workload for Zero Trust Architectures, Open ID sessions on OIX and GAIN were thought-provoking. These insights were not only intellectually stimulating but also profoundly impactful in shaping my perspective on the future of identity. Due to the many interesting sessions offered parallelly sometimes it was even tough to decide which one to attend. Also, I was able to witness how ideas originated in Identiverse sessions and later turned into standards in identity space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The expo floor at Identiverse resembled a technological theme park. Booths showcased an array of cutting-edge solutions, each aiming to redefine how we perceive and manage digital identity. From secured authentication solutions, and passkey implementations to decentralized identity platforms, the expo was a testament to the relentless innovation in the identity space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kim Cameron Award paved the way to grow my knowledge in identity space and also allowed me to connect with a community of identity professionals. And also enabled me to meet OpenID Foundation members and also get to know the different working groups in person. This further encourages me to actively participate in the Foundation’s work and contribute to different Open-Source/ R&amp;D initiatives in the identity space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelle-a-sellung/">Rachelle Sellung</a><br>Senior Scientist Researcher in the Identity Management Competence Team at Fraunhofer IAO</p>
<p>After winning the Kim Cameron Award this year, I had the honor to join and present my work at the EIC 2023 this year. It was a great opportunity to present my work on User Experience Best and Worst Practices for Digital Wallets. I was pleasantly surprised at how many people were interested in hearing my talk. I received an overwhelming amount of positive and constructive feedback. It was valuable to receive this quality feedback from such a wide range of experts in the field of identity. In addition, I had the opportunity to reconnect and build new connections in this space of identity.</p>
<p>From those connections, I am working with OIX in the Global Interoperability working group and will have the opportunity to present at their IdentityTrust Conference 2023- Building Trust in Identity Event on the 28th&nbsp;of September.&nbsp; In addition, I was able have some interesting and rewarding conversations with the Women in Identity group and am finding more ways to be more involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amir-sharif-341a2b37/">Amir Sharif</a><br>Researcher in the Security &amp; Trust Research Unit of the Cybersecurity Center of Fondazione Bruno Kessler</p>
<p>When I learned that I had been chosen to be awarded the prestigious Kim Cameron Award from the OpenID Foundation, I felt a mixture of gratitude, excitement, and humility. Although I never met Kim Cameron in person, his impact and influence in the area of digital identification were well-known. The honor of being associated with his name was genuinely beyond words.</p>
<p>My digital identity path began with a strong interest in identity management protocols, which led me to become immersed in its subtle nuances. Over the course of more than 5 years, my passion prompted me to investigate the finer points of identity protocols with a focus on OAuth and OpenID Connect Standards, honing in on the design and security analysis of these solutions.</p>
<p>Stepping into the world of European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) 2023, facilitated by the Kim Cameron Award, was a transformative experience. The event brings together some of the brightest minds and industry experts in the field of Digital Identity and Cybersecurity. Throughout the event, I had the opportunity to attend several thought-provoking sessions and participate in enlightening discussions. Engaging with the élite of digital identity, I witnessed the pivotal shift towards a user-centric approach, ripe for exponential growth under the stimuli arriving from different perspectives including those of initiatives and foundations, such as the Open Wallet Foundation and the Kantara initiative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of my highlights was the session I presented with Giada Sciarretta and Francesco Antonio Marino about the “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5325/2">Past, Present, and Future of the Italian Digital Identity Ecosystem</a>”. It is the output of a fantastic collaboration between the Center for Cybersecurity of Fondazione Bruno Kessler – FBK and the Italian Government Printing Office and Mint.&nbsp; At the time of writing, we are working on the Italian Technical Specification for Verifiable Credential Issuance and Presentation in the context of the European Digital Identity Wallet.&nbsp; This is exciting and there is still much to do in this fascinating journey.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most essential effect of attending EIC is the ability to physically reach out to many like-minded persons outside of academia who are interested in the difficulties of security and privacy in IAM. It left me not only with a bounty of fresh insights, new relationships, and a renewed feeling of purpose but also inspired me to contribute even more to the development of digital identity. I am grateful to the OpenID Foundation for this fantastic opportunity and forward to working with the identity community.</p>
<p><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlieharrysmith/">Charlie Smith</a><br>Doctoral Student at the Oxford Internet Institute</p>
<p>Attending Identiverse has been hugely beneficial for my research. As a political philosopher studying digital identity, a vital part of the job involves ensuring that my theorising remains grounded in the practical reality of our industry. By far the best way to do this is attending events like Identiverse—but without the OIDF’s support I would never have been able to fly to Las Vegas from the UK for a conference. I am therefore deeply grateful to the Foundation for its generous funding and mentorship via the Kim Cameron Award. Without the OIDF I would simply not have been able to broaden my network beyond the European context as effectively. The Award has added massive value to my doctoral degree.</p>
<p>This year I met many experts I’d only ever interviewed virtually before, allowing me to put faces to names and form far more meaningful connections. This has already resulted in several useful collaborations that will massively benefit my research and generate public value. Additionally, the access that Award winners get as a result of their association with the OIDF has opened numerous new doors to me. I hope these connections will only deepen throughout my career. Finally, the educational content of the conference has been essential for remaining up to date on developing industry trends and expert knowledge. Overall, I would encourage any academic interested in identity to make use of this fabulous resource.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Foundation also thanks our conference partners, the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC)</a> and <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a>, as award recipients receive complimentary access to these important industry events as part of their award. Awardees will participate in Foundation events at the respective conferences as well as introduced to the identity domain experts and industry leaders at the conferences while being welcomed by our colleagues in other industry organizations.</p><p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2023-kim-cameron-award-experiences/">2023 OpenID Foundation Kim Cameron Award Recipients Share Their Experiences</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>In this byline Andrew looks at the rise of generative AI and the increase in the threat of phishing, making attacks almost undetectable. For Andrew, AI-based malware tools such as FraudGPT are generating sophisticated phishing campaigns. Instead of simply detecting phishing emails, businesses need to rethink security, with a focus on eliminating passwords. He believes that passwordless authentication, such as passkeys, offers better protection, making credentials invulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>FIDO study shows: passwords to be replaced by better alternatives in the next few years<br>A study conducted by the FIDO Alliance (Fast IDentity Online) and LastPass shows that passwords in companies will largely be replaced by secure alternatives in the next few years. According to the survey, most IT executives believe that by 2028, less than 25 percent of logins will be through passwords. Already, 95 percent of respondents are using passwordless alternatives such as passkeys to increase security. The majority of IT managers plan to manage passkeys via third-party password managers.</p>

<p>Email teams being challenged with high cart abandonment rates should push back — the real problem is not bad personalization or copy, but passwords. People are fed up with them. And their behavior reflects it, judging by the 2023 Online Authentication Barometer, a global study by the Fido Alliance, conducted by Sapio Research. U.S. consumers abandon a purchase and stop accessing an online service because they can’t remember their passwords 4.76 times per day on average, up from 3.71 in 2022 — a 28.30% increase.</p>

<p>In the fight against a growing number of text-, phone-, and email-based phishing scams, speakers at the FIDO Alliance’s Authenticate Conference in California this week made a case for passwordless security options like the passkey over the oft-hacked password. “Any enterprise that’s using passwords or legacy forms of MFA is taking a gamble they will eventually lose,” Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the industry group known as the FIDO Alliance, told attendees.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce the <a href="https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/integrations/storage/ceramic-example?ref=blog.ceramic.network">integration of Lit Protocol and Ceramic</a>, enabling developers to store encrypted data on ComposeDB. This integration allows developers to build applications that provide users with more control over their data and privacy.</p> What is Lit Protocol? <p>Lit Protocol is a decentralized key management system that allows users to encrypt their data and control who has access to it. Lit Protocol’s access control system gives users granular control over who can access and use their data.</p><p>Along with flexible access control features, Lit also offers tooling around <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Secure_multi-party_computation?ref=spark.litprotocol.com">multi-party computation (MPC)</a>. MPC enables secure reading and writing of data between blockchains and off-chain platforms, such as programmable signing that allows developers to build distributed serverless functions that have event listening capabilities to create specific triggers for executing programmatic signing, and much more.</p> Why integrate Lit Protocol and Ceramic Network? <p>The integration between Lit Protocol and Ceramic allows developers to build applications that provide users with more control over their data and privacy.</p><p>The Ceramic protocol is built on decentralized event streams, where user accounts (enabled by decentralized identifiers, or&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/accounts/decentralized-identifiers?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DIDs</a>) cryptographically sign data events and submit them to the network. These events are stored in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) using the IPLD protocol, and organized into readable streams. Each stream is flexible enough to store many types of content. Therefore, Ceramic is home to a diversity of different data use cases such as user profiles, posts, relations to other entities and more.</p><p>Due to Ceramic's open readability, any participating node can read from any stream in the network. Therefore, encrypting data using Lit Protocol and saving it on Ceramic is a common (and necessary) integration for many teams.</p> A Peek Under the Hood <p>Given Ceramic’s architecture, Lit Protocol’s access control capabilities allow developers to gate access to content based on highly flexible conditions. For instance, developers may want to allow their users the ability to grant read access to all addresses that hold a specific NFT or ERC20 asset. With Lit Protocol, developers allow their users to assign <a href="https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/sdk/access-control/intro?ref=blog.ceramic.network">access control conditions</a> that are associated with the encrypted object when generated. The Lit nodes confirm those conditions have been satisfied using the user’s wallet signature when they request access. This offers a seamless user flow for the end user, whereas (without Lit Protocol) users might otherwise be required to manually decrypt or re-encode their encrypted data for other users they want to grant access to.</p> How to Use Lit Protocol to Encrypt Messages and Save Them to Ceramic <p>To use Lit Protocol to encrypt messages and save them to Ceramic using ComposeDB, you can follow the tutorial <a href="https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/integrations/storage/ceramic-example?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>. This tutorial uses a message board example application to show you how to create encrypted messages using Lit Protocol and save message instances to the Ceramic Network using ComposeDB.</p> In the tutorial, you’ll learn how to:   Create ComposeDB schemas and deploy those models on a local Ceramic node  Authenticate users on Ceramic to allow them to author their own documents  Encrypt data with Lit Protocol and write mutation queries to save the encrypted data to ComposeDB using GraphQL  Decrypt data using Lit Protocol based on specific access control logic   What do you need to get started? <p>As outlined in the <a href="https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/integrations/storage/ceramic-example?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tutorial</a>, the only dependencies you’ll need are:</p>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?ref=blog.ceramic.network">MetaMask Chrome Extension</a>  Node v16   Want to Learn More about Building on Ceramic?  <br>Build an AI Chatbot on Ceramic <p>Build an AI-powered Chatbot and save message history to ComposeDB by following this&nbsp;<a href="https://learnweb3.io/lessons/build-an-ai-chatbot-on-compose-db-and-the-ceramic-network?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Tutorial</a>.</p> How to Use and Store Composable Attestations with Ceramic and Ethereum Attestation Service <p>Walk through a <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tutorial</a> on how to generate attestations (using Ethereum Attestation Service) and store them on ComposeDB.</p> ComposeDB API Sandbox <p>Use the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/sandbox?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB API Sandbox</a> to test example queries on a real dataset.</p> Create a Social App on ComposeDB <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/EthDenver2023Demo?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Social App ComposeDB Starter</a> will help you get started building your own social app.</p><p>Let us know what you think about our integration with Lit Protocol on the <a href="https://www.notion.so/ba4a098b06e3437082430c5217bf501f?pvs=21&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Forum</a>!</p>

  <p>By Santiago Lyon, Head of Advocacy and Education, CAI</p><p>We are thrilled to announce that industry-leading camera manufacturer Leica is officially launching the new M11-P camera — the world’s first camera with Content Credentials built-in. </p><p>This is a significant milestone for the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) and the future of photojournalism: It will usher in a powerful new way for photojournalists and creatives to combat misinformation and bring authenticity to their work and consumers, while pioneering widespread adoption of Content Credentials.&nbsp; </p><p>With manipulated content and misinformation more on the rise than ever, trust in the digital ecosystem has never been more critical. We are entering a new era of creativity, where generative AI is expanding access to powerful new workflows and unleashing our most imaginative ideas. The Leica M11-P launch will advance the CAI’s goal of empowering photographers everywhere to attach Content Credentials to their images at the point of capture, creating a chain of authenticity from camera to cloud and enabling photographers to maintain a degree of control over their art, story and context.</p>

  <p>Leica has implemented the global <a href="https://c2pa.org/">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity</a> (C2PA) standard in the M11-P camera so that each image is captured with secure metadata. This means it carries information such as camera make and model, as well as content-specific information including who captured an image and when, and how they did so.

<p>With the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decentralized-identity-foundation-dif-hackathon-tickets-727930769527?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF Hackathon</a> starting on October 26, DIF caught up with Toby Bolton, Founder of .zkdid™ who is looking to collaborate on his innovative use case for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and other DIF work items.&nbsp;</p><p>What is .zkdid?&nbsp;</p><p>.zkdid is an acronym for Zero Knowledge Decentralized Identity. It’s a Decentralized Domain Name System (dDNS) protocol intended to empower the public. It’s also a registered trademark, it’s the name of the project, intended as a mark-of-trust and is a prospective Web3 top-level domain (like .com).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose is to establish a “.zkdid” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Zero Knowledge</a> (ZK) decentralized identity protocol for Web3 that is compliant with government <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Know Your Customer</a> (KYC) requirements.</p><p>Each address with the .zkdid extension is a unique identifier in the form of a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Non-Fungible Token</a> (NFT) which is resistant to duplication. The goal is to use these identifiers to create a ZK<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_personhood?ref=blog.identity.foundation#:~:text=The%20term%20is%20used%20in,to%20an%20investment%20of%20resources."> Proof of personhood</a> registry and NFT-gated community that is<a href="https://members.delphidigital.io/learn/sybil-resistance?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Sybil resistant</a>. Sybil resistance mechanisms aim to ensure that each participant in a network has a unique and singular identity.</p><p>This creates the basis for a secure, publicly owned/governed, decentralized, zero-knowledge<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Domain Name System</a> (DNS).&nbsp;</p><p>How did the .zkdid initiative come into being, and why are you doing it?&nbsp;</p><p>First and foremost, I worry about the future of my daughters, and how these novel identity technologies could possibly erode human rights and privacy if not deployed with due diligence and care. So I wanted to find the solution to such problems. I’ve been aware for quite a while that identity is a great use case for blockchain. Then zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) became a hot topic. That’s when I got onto the .zkdid path.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea for .zkdid initially came from an online chat where we were discussing the<a href="https://ens.domains/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Ethereum Name Service</a> (ENS). The question I had was, “what is the top-level domain of Web3?”, which sparked quite a debate.&nbsp;</p><p>I believed the top-level domain for Web3 would likely be an identity protocol, and possibly even .zkdid.</p><p>The aim is to connect the public to an identity layer that is not centrally controlled. The details of this decentralized governance identity protocol are still being researched.&nbsp;</p><p>How will .zkdid be different?&nbsp;</p><p>There are quite a few blockchain name services. I wanted to improve on what I had found. ENS is likely the best known dDNS protocol but uses tokenomics for its governance and can be owned anonymously which in my opinion doesn’t work for a proof of personhood protocol. In my view I’m developing an alternative. What I’m building is also an alternative to other proof-of-personhood protocols in the market like<a href="https://worldcoin.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Worldcoin</a> and<a href="https://proofofhumanity.id/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Proof of Humanity</a>.</p><p>The point of .zkdid is to create a decentralized DNS layer, one that is publicly owned by a not for profit foundation, which does not rely on tokenomics that can manipulate leadership of the protocol. These are areas I saw in other protocols that I believe need improving.</p><p>With .zkdid, the identity is the token. Your .zkdid domain name will enable you to prove who you are in the Web3 digital domain without needing to reveal any personal information about yourself. Each person is one token. You are the token.&nbsp;</p><p>How do you see this coexisting with current Identity and DNS systems?</p><p>DNS (Domain Name System) is one of the most widely used internet protocols, most of us use it daily and it’s possible that one day .zkdid can connect the Identity industry to a publicly owned dDNS protocol.</p><p>When I registered .zkdid, I knew it was important that it was secured from every dDNS registrar. Once I registered the domain name, I submitted a Trademark application in the United Kingdom, which was promptly published.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.icann.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">ICANN</a> do not govern decentralized DNS domain names, so a strategy is needed to protect them. However, I understand ICANN are looking into blockchain technologies and it would be a pleasure to have them involved in the project. We are also inline to become a Web3 Domain Alliance (W3DA) member, it’s an important initiative that intends to act as a foundation to inhibit possible dDNS collisions. We need to bring people together. No one should be excluded, .zkdid is meant to be a public good after all.&nbsp;</p><p>What are the next steps for the project?&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, I’ve been collaborating with a <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/essif-train-by-fraunhofer-gesellschaft/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">team at the Fraunhofer Institute</a> that is looking to use the traditional DNS system to create a trust registry of all humans and IoT devices. My vision is to use dDNS and for the public to be issued a .zkdid identifier through the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/discover-eidas?ref=blog.identity.foundation">eIDAS</a> initiative. This means if you are a European citizen, your .zkdid identifier could be connected to your government issued identity.</p><p>This was not the initial objective but as things progressed I learned the only way to achieve our ambitious goal is to integrate with government initiatives like eIDAS.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve now managed to build a great team of enthusiastic developers to work with me on this concept during the<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decentralized-identity-foundation-dif-hackathon-tickets-727930769527?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> DIF Hackathon</a>. To work within the Hackathon rules this first step is likely going to take advantage of the Open Source<a href="https://iden3.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Iden3</a> toolkit. I’m going to suggest we use that, plus relevant DIF work items such as the Universal Resolver, BBS Signature Scheme, DIDComm and Sidetree Protocol. We need to focus on making it multi-chain and interoperable.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m really pleased that Polygon ID is one of the sponsors of the Hackathon, because it was the PolygonID/Iden3 wallet that was the original inspiration for this project. When I first encountered PolygonID I thought it was impressive, very abstract but really clever technology.</p><p>During the Hackathon we will develop this concept into an initial functioning prototype. If the people who join me for the Hackathon subsequently want to team up to form a .zkdid Working Group at DIF to develop the specification, that would be brilliant.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m looking for team members who are pro freedom and human rights, who understand the importance behind decentralized technologies, and have an optimistic and balanced outlook.&nbsp;</p><p>Why have you chosen DIF to host this initiative?&nbsp;</p><p>The opportunity came out of the blue. When I first joined the DIF I was introduced to Andor Kesselman, who chairs the Technical Steering Committee. Andor said “You’ve got a great vision, now let’s start from the beginning.” He asked me to strip down the concept to the basics needed to commence a DIF working group.&nbsp;</p><p>And stripping it back to the bare bones we find a zero-knowledge decentralized DNS system. I always intended .zkdid to be a global mark of trust and an open standard that works with any kind of wallet, identity network and protocol. Now I’m in the DIF, I’ve got an opportunity to be part of the process of defining the specification that may actually become a standard.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like I've been thrown out of the frying pan into the fire, which is a bit overwhelming but exactly what I needed!&nbsp;</p><p>What should people do if they are interested in getting involved?&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, please provide feedback on the idea by contacting Toby on Slack, or via email at <a href="mailto:id@zkdid.io">id@zkdid.io</a> .&nbsp;</p><p>The next step is to join forces with Toby to participate in the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decentralized-identity-foundation-dif-hackathon-tickets-727930769527?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF Hackathon</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, please let Toby know if you are interested in working with him to establish a new .zkdid Working Group at DIF.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By Francis Beland, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>Quantum computing &amp; technologies present unique challenges that are not addressed by classical computing standards.</p>



<p>The development of open standards for quantum technologies is crucial for ensuring the interoperability, security, and reliability of quantum computing systems and facilitating collaboration and innovation across the quantum computing ecosystem.</p>



<p>One of the key challenges in developing open standards for quantum technologies is that quantum computing fundamentally differs from classical computing. Quantum computing relies on the principles of quantum mechanics, which allow for the creation of superposition states and entanglement, enabling quantum computers to perform certain types of computations much faster than classical computers. However, this also means that quantum computing systems require different hardware, software, and communication protocols than classical computing systems.</p>



<p>To address these challenges, standards bodies should and are working to develop standards for quantum technologies. For example, the Quantum Industry Consortium and the Quantum Economic Development Consortium, are working to develop standards and best practices for the quantum industry. But are those standards ‘open’, or should they be?</p>



<p>In addition to developing standards for quantum computing, it is also important to develop open standards for other quantum technologies, such as quantum cryptography and quantum sensing. These technologies also present unique challenges that require new standards and best practices to ensure their reliability and security.</p>



<p>Overall, the development of open standards for quantum technologies is crucial for ensuring the growth and success of this exciting and rapidly evolving field, and will play a critical role in enabling the development and adoption of quantum technologies in a wide range of industries and applications.</p>

<p>Our recent partnership with the Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (<a href="https://cipesa.org/" title="">CIPESA</a>) offers a lens into the workings of an organisation that is taking proactive steps to strengthen their internal practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based in Uganda, CIPESA&nbsp; focuses on decision-making that facilitates the use of ICT in support of good governance, human rights and livelihoods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within the framework of our 6-month Matchbox partnership, CIPESA had three main priorities:</p>



 
 Strengthening their digital communications and documentation infrastructure through guidance on implementation of self-hosted tools that enable autonomy and ownership. 



 Support in platform implementation through guidance on user testing, roll-out and maintenance plans design. 



 Capacity building around responsible data management and organisational security. 
 



 What we discovered 



<p>Our assessment of CIPESA’s current landscape of tools revealed a diverse technological framework consisting in a mix of tools, from conventional email and word processing to collaborative platforms, incorporating a blend of cloud-based and localised storage.</p>



<p>We also looked at CIPESA’s security frameworks and practices, which encompass multifaceted strategies, realised through a mix of practices and tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CIPESA are cognisant of research ethics and data handling and were interested in strengthening their <a href="https://responsibledata.io/" title="">Responsible Data Management</a> and data handling practices to further ensure protection of data subjects and sensitive data. They were also interested in strengthening the security of their websites, email, and social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>



 Introducing contextual risk assessments, self-hosted tools, and Responsible Data frameworks&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Recognising the importance of keeping internal communications private, we suggested a shift to a self hosted video conferencing tool (<a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/" title="">Big Blue Button</a>). This platform would also provide resilience against potential restrictions and avoid over-reliance on a third party platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To further streamline CIPESA’s communication with its networks, CIPESA also looked at the adoption of a tool that would foster tailored communications with its large network of stakeholders. One of the platforms we recommended was <a href="https://suitecrm.com/" title="">SuiteCRM</a>, which is open source and can be self-hosted, which aligns with CIPESA values. It also has core features that the organisation&nbsp; is looking for, including creating groups of key stakeholders and setting up consistent targeted communications with them through the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also recommended a thorough contextual risk assessment, to offer clarity on pressing security concerns and ensure that a consistent internal policy is adopted to mitigate these risks. This would also aid in the implementation of tools and practices that will strengthen internal security&nbsp; – such as the adoption of <a href="https://1password.com/" title="">1password</a> for password management.&nbsp;</p>



 Aligning data management with organisational values&nbsp; 



<p>CIPESA wanted to ensure alignment of data management practices with both organisational values and regional data protection regulations. Drawing from resources like The Engine Room’s <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">Becoming RAD!</a> guide, we provided guidance about data storage duration, disposal methods, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CIPESA’s work environment relies on various tools and platforms, from cloud based tools to physical files. Amidst this diversity of platforms, the importance of data responsibility –&nbsp; the principle that information collected and generated should be handled responsibly with care and include ownership of organizational data on platforms. This value highlights the importance of self-hosted platforms and also choosing platforms aligned with this principle.</p>



<p>Our assessment helped identify areas and recommended steps to enhance both efficiency and security. CIPESA’s approach, which involves a mix of password protection, two-factor authentication, and data encryption, stands out as a model for organisations looking to navigate the digital space safely.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“The Engine Room’s Matchbox program has been instrumental in helping us identify and address various questions regarding how we handle and manage the data we collect. It has also reaffirmed the need to enhance internal practices especially in an evershifting digital terrain and in a growing community of practice when it comes to the work that we do in advancing digital rights and governance in Africa”</p></blockquote>

 Part 2: Building the workflow and&nbsp;platform CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>In our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/using-open-recognition-to-map-real-world-skills-and-attributes-1c1109c1b871">previous post</a>, we outlined a different way to do recognition. It’s a way which democratises the means of credentialing, and values each human as a part of community networks. Go and read that first, if you haven’t&nbsp;already.</p> Context <p>The original plan for Part 2 of this series was to show a real-world example of completing the last three steps of a 10-step process,&nbsp;namely:</p>  Come up with the metadata for Open Badges based on your&nbsp;skills  Create badges using an online&nbsp;platform  Ask contacts to endorse your&nbsp;badges  <p>However, after several conversations with badging platforms, we’re still a little early for that. Although they have plans for adopting <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2023/03/16/verifiable-credentials-and-open-badges-3-0-whats-changed/">v3 of the Open Badges standard</a>, most are not currently planning to use it in the way we’re discussing in this series of&nbsp;posts.</p> Workflow <p>We see a need for a platform that aids individuals in identifying their skills and attributes, supported by their networks and communities. Mapping these attributes against relevant skills taxonomies can make them visible and endorsable, turning them into a form of ‘currency’.</p><p>One of the people we spoke to asked how we would build the system we envisage. We’ve come up with the following workflow (v0.1) to show how that might work technically, and below that there are wireframes showing a basic user&nbsp;journey.</p><p>One important thing to note is that by creating a standardised workflow, even the most introverted person with the smallest network can still find value in the approach.</p><p>A default process, customisable for endorsements, can boost user confidence, as not all are comfortable seeking endorsements.</p> Platform <p>The basic wireframes below show the first part of the workflow and how the individual would get&nbsp;started.</p><p>(Note: in this example we’re providing basic wireframes for the simplest version of the workflow)</p> User onboarding <p>Users sign up, answer three questions, and provide contact details for feedback. Once done, the system emails the contacts for their&nbsp;input.</p> Feedback <p>Contacts are asked to answer three questions similar to those posed to the&nbsp;user.</p> Synthesised Results <p>Users review their results, synthesised by AI. They then map their attributes against skills taxonomies of their&nbsp;choice.</p> Request for Endorsement <p>The next step is for the user to choose which of their attributes they’d like to have endorsed. They can then personalise an endorsement request to their contacts.</p><p>The system then emails contacts again, asking if they’re willing to endorse those specific attributes.</p><p>If they consent, then they are asked which attributes they would like to&nbsp;endorse.</p><p>They can also optionally choose to provide written or multimedia evidence.</p> Verified Profile <p>Users complete their verified profile, which can include any evidence provided by their contacts.</p><p>This verified profile can be shared online and updated over time. This includes the attributes, endorsements, and evidence it contains.</p> Conclusion <p>The possibilities for this kind of approach are far-reaching, as it brings a human-centric approach to credentialing. As you can see by comparing the flowchart and the wireframes, although there are some reasonably-complex things happening behind the scenes, what is presented to the user is relatively simple and straightforward.</p><p>In this post, we’ve outlined the benefits to end users. But there are also benefits to endorsers (who could themselves earn a badges). Perhaps that’s the subject for another blog&nbsp;post…</p><p>We would like someone to build this workflow.

<p>The demand for recycled content and sustainable business practices continues to grow rapidly. Join us as we chat with Jeremy Douglas, Director of Partnerships at Delterra, to learn more about reducing plastic waste, creating enhanced waste streams, and utilizing standards to track plastics throughout the supply chain.</p> <p>Key takeaways:&nbsp;</p>     <p>Traceability and transparency are crucial in the global effort to address plastic pollution and promote a circular economy. Delterra is focusing on establishing traceability for recycled plastic from collection to sale. By ensuring accurate measurement and preventing double counting, traceability can boost confidence in using recycled materials and support brands in tracking the origin of recycled plastic in their products.</p>     <p>Consumer pressure and advocacy have played a significant role in driving change in the waste and recycling systems. This has pushed brands to take action and seek alternatives, such as using more recycled materials. With consumers and stakeholders informed, companies are motivated to improve their plastic footprints and adopt more sustainable practices.</p>     <p>A global plastics agreement is being negotiated among 175 countries to address plastic pollution effectively. The agreement aims to create a binding document or instrument to end plastic pollution, similar to the structure of the climate change agreement. Themes such as eliminating unnecessary plastics and considering the impact on the informal sector are being discussed.&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p>Our website - <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1 US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with guests:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremydouglas/?originalSubdomain=ca">Follow Jeremy Douglas on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p>If you’re well-versed or new to Web3 and considering a valuable contribution, Elastos offers a unique opportunity. The project not only presents a novel approach to blockchain consensus but also provides strong financial incentives for participating as a validator. By coupling Bitcoin’s security, community governance, and a DAO Council’s integrity, Elastos has created a validator ecosystem ripe for efficiency and scalability. Here’s what you stand to gain by joining this innovative network as an Elastos Consensus BPOS Validator!</p><p>The Currency: ELA<br>$ELA is the universal asset within Elastos, underpinned by a deflationary model. The currency has a current circulating supply of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/elastos">21,364,394</a> ELA with an issuance cap set at 28,219,999 by 2108. ELA comes from the Elastos Mainchain, a blockchain merged mined by Bitcoin. The next issuance halving is due in December 2025, supporting an increased potential for earning more ELA now rather than later.</p><p></p><p>The Incentives for Elastos Consensus BPOS Validators<br>Becoming as a BPOS validator means working with Bitcoin miners to validate transactions on the Elastos Mainchain, with distinct advantages. A full step-by-step guide can be found <a href="https://elastos.dev/nodes/requirements/">here</a>.</p>  APY: Up to 27% APY without BPOS staking incentives program added (see below). Validator Calculator available &nbsp;<a href="https://elastos.info/bpos-validators-calculator/">here</a>.  Low Entry Barrier: A 2,000 ELA pledge and a $6/month node maintenance fee are all it takes to start.  Revenue: Active BPOS validators are directly rewarded with 25% of the block rewards.  Yield: Calculated on the staking amount and pledge time, favouring both new and existing validators.  Staking Rights: 36 nodes are randomly selected every 36 blocks, ensuring equal opportunities for all.  Rewards Distribution: Automatically handled by Elastos’ mainchain.  <p>“Setting it up according to the guide was quick and easy. I’m hosting it on a Contabo BOS at $6/month. It’s been running flawlessly since the beginning of BPOS. Rewards are distributed instantly, and on top of that, I regularly receive early rewards from the Elastos Foundation”. – <a href="https://twitter.com/iggispopis/status/1714224962729370068">Iggis Popis</a>, BPOS Validator</p><p>Staking Rights<br>In Elastos’ BPoS system, participants stake ELA tokens for periods of time using the Essentials Wallet and receive equity tokens to vote on validators. This allows stakers to also earn ELA rewards. Higher yields are found with nodes with fewer votes, and periodic re-voting is necessary once pledge times expire to continue earning rewards, helping revolve validator nodes. A full step-by-step guide can be found <a href="https://elastos.info/tutorial/bpos-staking-and-voting-guide/">here</a>.</p>  ELA Staking Duration: 10 to 1000 days.  Equity Tokens: One staked ELA = One equity token for voting.  Reward Calculation: Proportional to ELA amount and time.  Pledge Time: Fixed but extendable, within node expiration limits.  Real-time Adjustment: Benefits updated if pledge time extended.  Profit Sharing: Node owners 25%, Stakers 75%.  Special Nodes: 12 CR Council nodes are off-limits for voting.  Re-Voting: Required at the end of each pledge period.  <p>Special Staking Incentive Program<br>The Elastos Foundation (EF) has launched a <a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/bpos-validator-incentive-program/">program</a> allocating 1 million ELA for staking on community nodes, designed to aid nodes in attaining the 80,000 staking rights required for activation. This initiative further distributes staking profits to stakers and validator nodes monthly, enhancing your potential earnings.</p><p>Staking Rewards Partnership.<br>Elastos has teamed up with <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/">Staking Rewards</a> to highlight the advantages of our consensus system.&nbsp;The Elastos Growth Team will be present at the <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/summit">Staking Summit</a> in Turkey on November 10th. They aim to connect with attendees and showcase the unique features of Elastos’ validator system, as well as the opportunities it offers for earning ELA. Other speakers at the event will include Justin Sun, Founder of <a href="https://tron.network/">Tron</a>, and Anton Bukov, Co-founder of <a href="https://app.1inch.io/">1inch</a>.</p><p></p><p>The Power of Elastic Consensus<br>So how does everything work and come together? Elastos employs a threefold consensus mechanism. A comprehensive technical overview can be found <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastic-consensus-technical-overview/">here</a>.</p>  Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuXPoW): Leverages Bitcoin’s existing computational power to secure the Elastos mainchain.  Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS): Allows stakeholders to lock ELA assets and gain voting rights, based on which BPoS nodes work with Bitcoin miners to validate transactions.  Proof of Integrity (PoI): An additional governance layer for validating sidechains, from identity to smart contract chains, administered by a community-elected council using ELA for voting and collateral.  <p></p><p>Pioneering Innovation<br>Five years since its launch, Elastos has made <a href="https://elastos-wiki.netlify.app/">remarkable strides</a> in:</p>  Identity Management: Through Decentralized Identifiers with Zero/Knowledge Proofs (DID).  Data Storage: Enabled by HIVE, integrating IPFS and personal cloud hosting.  Networking: via Ethereum-compatible Smart Chain and decentralised ‘Carrier’ data and messaging communications.  Security: Using Runtime for secure execution environments for decentralised applications.  <p>Partnerships include <a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/elastos-and-tencent-cloud/">Tencent Cloud</a> and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/alibaba-cloud-partners-with-elastos-to-spur-adoption-of-open-source-tech/">Alibaba Cloud</a>, with ecosystem teams like <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/the-access-economy-decentralized-identity-digital-rights-and-ownership-in-the-age-of-web3/">Elacity</a> building a digital capsule marketplace for Web3 digital asset monetisation.</p><p>Become a Elastos Consensus BPOS Validator today!<br>The Elastos ecosystem offers not only consensus opportunities for validators and stakers but also possibilities beyond the Mainchain. Soon, stakers will be additionally able to mint BPoS NFTs, receipts which enable secondary markets and trading opportunities through smart contracts on the Elastos Smart Chain. <a href="https://twitter.com/ElastosInfo">Follow Elastos</a> to stay up to date!</p><p>Interested in becoming a validator?

  <p>ABSTRACT: Schnorr signatures have been a long time coming, but now that <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/1716919363729801494">they’re finally here</a>, they open up broad new cryptographic frontiers, including the improved privacy of signature aggregation and blind signatures, the improved power of threshold signatures and adapter signatures, and much more. This article explores some of those frontiers and also offers a simplified look at how Schnorr works.</p>
</blockquote>



 What’s Sigs Got To Do With It? 

<blockquote>
  <p>I was introduced to prime numbers in the third grade, when I “discovered” them accidentally, and a great teacher encouraged me to explore them further. Conversely, I learned about finite fields between my Junior and Senior years of High School, when I was offered the chance at taking a college course over the summer and had to find something that didn’t depend on Calculus, which I hadn’t yet taken.</p>

  <p>I didn’t know it at the time, but I was delving into the mathematical foundations of two powerful signature systems: RSA and Schnorr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the  world of digital communication, a pressing question often arises: how can we trust and authenticate digital messages? The answer is to use digital signatures.</p>

<p>Digital signatures function similarly to a seal of authenticity on a physical document, but for digital content. They assure the recipient of the message’s integrity and the sender’s authenticity. There are many methods for signatures, with RSA and Schnorr being the best known. They mostly rely on public-key cryptography: a signer uses his private key for a signature, which can then be verified with a public key.</p>

 The Schnorr Legacy 

<blockquote>
  <p>I discovered RSA, which secures its signatures using prime numbers, in college. But it was when I later encountered Schnorr, built on finite fields, that I met the first cryptography that I truly fell in love with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Claus-Peter Schnorr introduced Schnorr signatures in the early 1990s. They were not the first digital signature, but they had a strong mathematical foundation:&nbsp;they were provably secure under specific assumptions. They were invented later that other systems like RSA, but they provided a number of new benefits including:</p>

 
   Compactness —&nbsp;Schnorr signatures are small, even when there are multiple signers. 
   Signature Aggregation — Multiple signatures can be aggregated together and look exactly like a single signature. 
   Faster Verification — Because of their small size (and the fact that aggregating multisigs doesn’t increase that size), Schnorr signatures can be verified quickly. 
   Threshold Signatures — Multisignatures requiring a certain quorum of participants are possible. 
   Blind Signatures — Signatures can be made while hiding the content. 
   Adapter Signatures — Signatures can be hidden by other values. 
 

 Beyond the Fields We Know 

<blockquote>
  <p>Beyond all of their new benefits, I fell in love with Schnorr signatures because they were elegant. The aggregation of signatures was done with simple mathematical operations. You added two signatures together and they were aggregated! Or, you could subtract any signature from an aggregate sum! But perhaps I shouldn’t say “simple” mathematical operations: Schnorr signatures depend on finite field math.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think of finite fields as domains where numbers play by a unique set of rules. Each field is constrained to only contain certain numbers, usually defined by the letter <code>p</code>. The field then defines basic mathematical operations such as addition and multiplication such that if the operands are within the finite field, then the result of an operation on those operands will also lie within the finite field.</p>

<p>As it happens, the elliptic curves used for most modern cryptography are defined over finite fields. The finite fields act as a modulo to the curve, ensuring that the results of all operations on the curve fall within the field.</p>

 
   Bitcoin’s <code>secp256k1</code> works within the bounds of:
     
       <code>[ p = 2^{256} - 2^{32} - 977 ]</code> 
     
   
   Curve25519, popular in key exchanges, operates around:
     
       <code>[ p = 2^{255} - 19 ]</code> 
     
   
 

 Schnorr like an Eagle 

<blockquote>
  <p>When I was working as CTO of Certicom, I contacted the holders of the Schnorr patent about licensing it, but they wanted impossible terms. I assume it was the same for others who tried to use the cryptography at the time.</p>

  <p>Those patent restrictions ultimately held back Schnorr signatures from broader acceptance until their expiration in 2008. Even afterward, there wasn’t a quick move to Schnorr, despite its advantages, because ECDSA was mature, while there wasn’t yet any good code for Schnorr. I sometimes wonder where we might be today if Bitcoin had mined its Genesis block four or five years after the expiration of the Schnorr patents, rather than a scant 11 months later.</p>

  <p>When I was working at Blockstream, following the expiration of the Schnorr patent, I pestered our engineers about Schnorr. I was happy to then be at the conference where the MuSig multiple-signature system was first rolled out, using Schnorr and a multi-stage signing system that addressed some of the challenges of the powerful signature technology. The security was quickly broken, but that was just a first step, before the release of next-generation Schnorr systems such as MuSig 2 and FROST.</p>

  <p>It’s taken a few decades, but due to their simplicity and robustness, we are at last in a future where Schnorr signatures are possible. We can at last implement the many possibilities that I couldn’t even imagine when I first met finite fields, in that summer class years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a new technology, Schnorr has pitfalls and “footguns” that even now might not be fully understood. They need to carefully reviewed before the technology can be safely used.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest challenges of Schnorr have included:</p>

 
   Naive Aggregation:
 Merging signatures without verification is risky. Combining known good signatures with an adversary’s signature can actually nullify a signature as a whole because of the additive nature of Schnorr signatures. Advanced measures can prevent such issues. 
   Replay Attacks:
 Without unique transaction data, a valid signature can be maliciously reused. The solution? Incorporate distinct transaction information within signatures. 
   Malleability:
 An adversary might slightly alter a good signature while maintaining its validity. Contemporary protocols ensure signatures are consistent and resistant to changes. 
 

<p>Today, two major solutions address the challenges of Schnorr signatures, allowing users to take advantage of their many features:</p>

 
   MuSig2: A scheme focusing on multi-signatures. It addresses the issue of naive aggregation by ensuring individual participants cannot manipulate the combined public key. It only requires two rounds of communication to be completed between the parties. However, it restricts itself to N-of-N signatures, disallowing threshold schemes (except perhaps in a variant that creates a Merkle tree of MuSigs). Major advantages includes accountability and  key generation being noninteractive. 
   FROST: A versatile Schnorr threshold signature strategy, allowing a quorum to sign without revealing which members did so, increasing privacy and efficiency. It however, requires the completion of three rounds of communication by the parties before use. Major advantages include the ability to use Shamir protocols for refreshing shares, repairing lost shares, and enrollment and disenrollment of participants. The <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/">Zcash Foundation implementation of FROST</a> has recently received a successful <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2023/10/23/public-report-zcash-frost-security-assessment/">security assessment</a>. Their <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/frost.html">Understanding FROST article</a> is also a nice, brief overview of the technology. 
 

 Schnorr in a Nutshell (8 Bits) 

<p>The following examples offer a layman’s explanation of Schnorr and its operations using an 8-bit model, which is to say an imaginary finite field that ranges from 0 to 255. This sort of finite field is easily managed by applying a modulo to all the operations. In this example, addition and subtraction operations would be finalized by applying “modulo 256”, ensuring that the result remains within the field.</p>

<p>Obviously, practical cryptographic applications work with much larger numbers, which helps to ensure their security, but these small numbers can make examples much easier to read and understand.</p>

 Generating Public Keys 

<p>For any signature, the first requirement is generating a public key from a secret private key. Here’s a simplified 8-bit example:</p>

 
   Private Key: Start with a private key, for example, Alice’s private key is <code>50</code>. 
   Constant: Multiply it by a constant number, say <code>5</code>. 
   Public Key: The result, (<code>50 x 5 = 250</code>), becomes Alice’s public key. 
 

<p>Seems straightforward, right? The catch is that the mathematical definitions of the actual finite fields and the operations used by Schnorr ensure that division is almost impossible: if someone only has the public key (<code>250</code>) and the constant (<code>5</code>), working backwards to figure out our private key is more challenging than the reverse because of this special math.</p>

<p>This difficulty to reverse is what makes this cryptography “asymmetric”, which is crucial for security. It’s like baking a cake; once you have the final product, it’s very difficult to determine the exact ingredients and their quantities.</p>

 Creating Signatures 

<p>Imagine Alice wants to send Bob a secure message. Here’s how she would do it using the Schnorr signature system:</p>

 
   Private Key: Alice has a secret number, which she never shares with anyone. Let’s say this number is <code>50</code>. 
   Message: Alice has a message. It could be anything, from a simple greeting to a bank transaction. In the digital world, this message can be represented as a number. 
   Random Figure: Alice picks a random number for each new message she wants to sign. Let’s say she picks <code>20</code> for this particular message. 
   Signature Calculation: She then uses her private key, the random number, and her message to do some special math, which creates a unique signature for that message. In our 8-bit example, this math might lead to a signature like <code>150</code>. This signature is unique to the message and Alice’s private key; even a small change in the message would produce a vastly different signature. 
   Sending: Alice sends her message and the signature (<code>150</code>) to Bob, but keeps her private key and random number secret. 
 

 Verifying Signatures 

<p>Now, let’s say Bob receives Alice’s message and the signature she produced. To be certain that it’s truly from Alice and hasn’t been tampered with, he needs to verify the signature:</p>

 
   Public Key: Everyone knows Alice’s public key (like a public email address). In our example, this is <code>250</code>. Alice would’ve previously derived this public key from her private key using some more special math and made it publicly available. 
   Verification: Using the signature Alice sent (<code>150</code>), her public key (<code>250</code>), and the original message, Bob does his own math. (Though a private key can’t be easily calculated from a public key, it is easy to determine that a signature matches a known public key using Schnorr’s special math.) If Bob’s calculations match the signature Alice sent, then he knows two things for sure: the message truly came from Alice (because she’s the only one with the private key that matches the public key that Bob tested against); and the message hasn’t been tampered with (because the signature matched perfectly). 
   Outcome: Since Bob’s math using the public key and the message matched Alice’s signature, he’s assured of the message’s legitimacy. 
 

<p>In a nutshell, Alice uses her private key to “stamp” a message, and Bob uses her public key to verify that “stamp.” The beauty of Schnorr signatures is that these calculations are simple (compared to other digital signature methods), yet remain secure, making them a favorite in many cryptographic applications.</p>

 Creating Sequential Multisigs 

<p>Imagine a scenario where endorsements need to be made in a particular order, much like a relay race where one athlete passes the baton to the next. This is a simple form of multisignature that any signature system is likely to support.</p>

 
   Initial Endorsement: Alice wants to sign a document, let’s say a declaration. She does her special math with her private key and the message to produce a signature, which for simplicity, we’ll say is <code>150</code>. 
   Subsequent Endorsement: Bob, having seen Alice’s endorsement, decides he wants to endorse her action. He takes Alice’s signed declaration and adds his signature to it. Bob’s endorsement, perhaps, produces a signature of <code>75</code>. 
   Sequential Result: Now, the document carries both signatures, <code>150</code> from Alice followed by <code>75</code> from Bob, indicating a clear sequence: first Alice, then Bob. 
 

 Creating Aggregate Multisigs 

<p>However, Schnorr signatures can be much more powerful than most traditional signature systems. They allow for aggregate signatures, where parties can sign in any order they want and jointly endorse a message.</p>

 
   Individual Signatures: Alice and Bob both want to co-sign a document. Alice, with her special math and private key, creates a signature, say <code>150</code>. Bob, independently, generates his signature, which might be <code>75</code>. 
   Aggregation: Using Schnorr’s unique properties, these two signatures can be combined. Instead of appending one after the other, Schnorr adds the two together, possibly producing a single value of <code>225</code>. 
   Aggregate Result: The document now has one composite signature, <code>225</code>. Anyone verifying this knows both Alice and Bob endorsed it, but there’s no distinction about who signed first. 
 

 Creating Threshold Signatures 

<p>In scenarios where a group decision is required, threshold signatures (or quorum signature aggregation) shines. It allows a subset of a larger group to sign a document, indicating a collective endorsement.</p>

 
   Group Dynamics: Imagine a council of five members. For some decisions, the endorsement of all members isn’t necessary. Instead, only a majority, say three members, is sufficient. 
   Individual Signatures: Three members, Alice, Bob, and Carol decide to endorse a statement. Their signatures might be <code>150</code>, <code>75</code>, and <code>30</code> respectively. 
   Aggregation: With Schnorr, these signatures can be aggregated into a single composite signature, possibly <code>255</code>. 
   Collective Result: This single signature, <code>255</code>, stands testament that a quorum of the council endorsed the statement. Verifiers don’t necessarily know which three members endorsed it, only that at least three did. 
 

 Advanced Schnorr Techniques 

<p>Because of the power of Schnorr, there are even more possibilities:</p>

 
   Blind Signatures:
Vital for preserving privacy. Bob wants Alice’s signature without revealing the message (let’s say <code>50</code>). By altering it slightly, like by adding <code>5</code>, he disguises it. Alice then signs this modified message (<code>55</code>), and Bob later extracts the initial signature. 
   Key Aggregation:
Combines multiple public keys into one. With Alice’s key at <code>250</code> and Bob’s at <code>5</code>, the combined key might be <code>255</code>. 
   Adapter Signatures:
This combines secret communication with validation. Alice holds a confidential number, say <code>20</code>. Bob communicates with her, and as she signs, she discloses her secret as part of the signature. 
 

<p>Even this just skims thes surface of possibilities. Further complexities include the use of hashes, commitments, challenges, and more complex threshold schemes.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Schnorr is an incredibly powerful toolbox. Techniques such as signature aggregation, collective multisigs, blind signatures, key aggregation, and adapter signatures demonstrate the flexibility of Schnorr while maintaining its ease of use and efficiency as well as the integrity and authenticity of the messages. The result is a wide variety of endorsement dynamics that will support many different use cases.</p>

<p>Now that MuSig and FROST are increasingly mature, these many dynamics and use cases, which have been waiting in the wings for more than 20 years, can finally be a reality.</p>

<p>I believe that it’s truly a cryptographic revolution, as important as many of the ones that have come before.</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>You would have heard digital wallets mentioned almost every week, if not every day, over the past couple of years. They formed part of the discussion on this&nbsp;<a href="https://lnkd.in/eXsn7Pb2">International Panel</a>&nbsp;I participated in very early one morning last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As conversations build on each other and as we increasingly use banking apps, Apple Pay or Google Pay when shopping, you might ask yourself how hard can it be when I see how many apps I have on my smartphone? Right there, is a challenge around scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most phone apps have a 1:1 relationship with the job they do – an app for our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anz.co.nz/banking-with-anz/ways-to-bank/gomoney/">bank</a>, our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newworld.co.nz/app">supermarket,</a>&nbsp;our<a href="https://kiwiaccess.co.nz/">&nbsp;photo ID,</a><a href="https://covid19.govt.nz/testing-and-isolation/contact-tracing/nz-covid-tracer-app/">contact tracing</a>&nbsp;and so on. We don’t carry 50 wallets each with one physical credential in each of them. That’s why the digital equivalent seems a bit ridiculous! This cannot scale to deliver you a great consumer experience for a future where for many people, their interactions will be mostly digital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another challenge is around security, data protection and privacy. How secure is the binding between you and your smartphone and the apps and wallets contained within it? That starts with high quality digital identification but extends into managing situations like coercion, or how to nullify the features on the phone if it’s lost or stolen. These problems can be complex, expensive and time consuming to mitigate against, meaning that developing and operating a commercially viable universally trusted digital wallet will not be for the faint-hearted (global platforms excepted but with the related considerations they may bring).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consequently, alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://www.daon.com/products/verifly/">specifically purposed</a>&nbsp;private sector wallets we may see the public sector in some jurisdictions<a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/france-germany-launch-works-on-eu-digital-wallet-in-paris/">&nbsp;taking a role in aspects of their development</a>&nbsp;– be it interoperable open standards and code libraries or a completely built digital wallet – for its people. This&nbsp;<a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-trust/showcase/">demo</a>&nbsp;from global thought leaders the Province of British Columbia peeks into the possible future (you need to download the BC Wallet app from the App Store or Google Play and read the privacy notice and terms &amp; conditions).&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an aside, Digital Identity NZ was amongst the first associate sponsors of the&nbsp;<a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">Open Wallet Foundation</a>, the only sponsor in this part of the world, to promote OWF’s outputs in Aotearoa for adoption as we travel the world. While not the only approach, the fact that the state often holds the authoritative identity data (e.g. date and place of birth, citizenship etc) and commercial viability of digital wallets could be a lower priority by considering it a public good, the state may be best placed to provision these high trust cryptographically protected attributes onto a smartphone’s private or public sector developed digital wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless, it will have to be trusted by us and by relying parties to be useful across a wide range of online transactions transcending our daily lives. Of course to maintain trust and integrity, the system will have to be architected in a way that after the authoritative attributes are provisioned to the smartphone’s digital wallet, the issuer doesn’t see or know where they are used. So where the state is the issuer, its responsibility ends there except for the rare instances of revoking or restoring compromised attributes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might ask why you should care? You should care because in return for having determination over your personal data in a digital wallet on your smartphone you will have to use it thoughtfully.&nbsp;Since your smartphone’s digital wallet will hold the attributes and you decide when and to whom you release them, there will be very few parties to hold responsible if things go wrong.

<p>Before the Internet as we know it came into existence, there was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)</a>, a project funded by the <a href="https://www.defense.gov/">United States Department of Defense</a>. Conceived in the late 1960s, ARPANET was designed to provide a system for researchers and military personnel to share information easily. At this time, computing resources were expensive and siloed. Researchers often had to physically go to the machine’s location to perform computations. Therefore, a set of rules that allowed different types of computers to communicate was developed was initially developed called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Control_Protocol_(ARPANET)#Network_Control_Program">Network Control Protocol (NCP)</a>, later to be superseded by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP protocol suite</a> in 1983. This was a key innovation for military and research institutions, as it demonstrated that a network of multiple, interconnected computers could effectively communicate, optimising resource utilisation and enhancing productivity. As technological advancements in networking continued beyond the early 80’s, various institutions and individuals worldwide played crucial roles in shaping the Internet’s development. Rong Chen’s experience provides an insightful perspective on this collaborative effort and the milestones that followed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>‘I worked as an intern with another person at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/">National Center for Supercomputing Applications</a>&nbsp;(NCSA) in 1987 at the&nbsp;<a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois</a> to implement data rendering algorithms on the SUN Workstations while the data came from two Cray Supercomputers a few hundred yards away. Two other fellow students worked on implementing the first TCP/IP ever for IBM PCs at the same time. It was planned to interconnect 6 supercomputers in 5 universities’ supercomputer centers in the US at the time of 1987. I had heard that the <a href="https://home.cern/">European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)</a> joined the scientific research network later. And Tim Berners-Lee worked at the CERN and invented the WWW web in 1989 on top of the network that we had built. <a href="https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/mosaic">Mosaic</a> from NCSA came later in the early 1990s as the first useable internet browser product inspired by Tim’s work.‘ – Rong Chen, Elastos Founder</p>
<p>Less than a decade before the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp">Dot-Com Bubble</a> of the ’90s, Rong Chen’s 1987 internship at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) offers a fascinating glimpse into a crucial period into the transformative era of the internet. Rong’s work on optimising communication between computers designed for very different kinds of tasks laid the groundwork for interoperability across divergent systems. The standardisation later of TCP/IP for IBM PCs was a seminal step in mainstreaming internet access. This development set the stage for Tim Berners-Lee’s 1989 invention of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WWW/">World Wide Web</a>, which revolutionised data organisation, allowing pages from different server locations to be linked together and explored in one universal environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The foundational networking by Rong Chen and colleagues enabled subsequent developments like the Mosaic browser, a user-friendly platform that evolved the Internet’s reach from academic and military circles into consumer households. But Mosaic was just the start; it inspired the creation of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Netscape-Communications-Corp">Netscape</a> in 1994, one of the first commercial web browsers. Netscape’s success demonstrated the internet’s economic potential and spurred the “browser wars,” such as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/internet-explorer">Microsoft’s Internet Explorer</a> which was instrumental in embedding the Internet into the fabric of everyday life, driving global markets and commercial opportunities. Being inside the exponential growth phase of a company like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> at this time tells an exciting story full of innovative milestones, filled with lessons and warnings in architectural principles.</p>
<p>‘I worked at Microsoft from June 1992 to April 2000. I was with the multimedia framework team for 6 months, Then joined the multimedia operating system team around the end of 1992. The multimedia OS team merged with the MS Research OS team in 1993. The Research OS became the Interactive TV set-top-box OS in 1994, and became part of the Advanced Consumer Technology Division’. – Rong Chen</p>
<p>At its core, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">Operating System</a> manages hardware resources, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> and memory, to maximise the utility of the physical hardware. However, it also manages internet connectivity for external communication and data exchange, disk storage for data integrity and efficient retrieval, and identity management for authentication and system security. These functionalities are integrated, not isolated. A failure or inefficiency in one could have a domino effect across the system, underscoring the essential role of the OS in harmonising hardware and software.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Early advancements in OS design have been catalysts for innovations defining subsequent generations of internet technologies. In 1995, a few months before Microsoft pivoted away from private Internet technologies, Rong Chen joined the Internet Explorer team as its 10th member. Microsoft’s embrace of open internet standards wasn’t just a policy shift; it recognised an industry trend favouring open ecosystems over exclusive standards for widespread adoption. Rong Chen and teams work on OS resource management, connectivity, and security—across different contexts from multimedia frameworks to specialised consumer technologies—put Microsoft in a position to innovate rapidly. But they were not confined to one niche; they were exposed to a cross-pollination of ideas. This made them a hub of innovation.</p>
<p>Rong’s passion would see him transition to the OLE Automation team, which simplified the integration of different software components, such as embedding a Microsoft Excel graph into a Microsoft Word document. This technology formed half of the programming paradigm architecture that all Microsoft projects would subsequently have to follow, shaping the foundational architecture of Microsoft’s OS software. The other half of the Microsoft programming paradigm architecture was the OLE “New Technology” team, providing the essential framework to enable efficient communication within Windows OS. These two Microsoft teams merged to form the COM Core team, which became essential in developing early versions of <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/">.NET</a>—a framework setting the stage for future Windows versions and enabling various application types.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, a pivotal moment arose when Microsoft decided to shut down the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/component-object-model--com--portal">COM</a> Core team and narrow their focus and invest in one particular software development approach. Rong disagreed with this single-track focus. He believed that both should co-exist and be developed in parallel, as each has its unique advantages and use cases. His rationale also included security considerations; specifically&nbsp;arguing that the OS should ensure a secure environment to protect user data from third-party apps.</p>
<p>“Due to the fact that Microsoft decided to dissolve the COM Core (C/C++) team and embrace only the C# intermediate bytecode framework, I believed that both should be supported and working in parallel. 3rd-party apps must be sandboxed in their own computing execution environment so that they cannot abuse the 1st-party user’s data, the operating system, as the 2nd party, is responsible for providing such a secure computing environment. So I resigned in April 2000 to build my own C++ version network operating system <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos</a>.” – Rong Chen</p>
<p>What Rong articulated around 2000 aligned closely with what we now recognise as the principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a>. His move from Microsoft to found <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos</a>, a Network OS platform, emphasises the catalytic power of divergent visions for spawning new initiatives. But divergent visions don’t emerge in isolation; they often stem from user demands for new capabilities. In the case of Microsoft and similar entities, a centralised structure, once established, became the path of least resistance for subsequent advancements. This approach enabled effective commercialisation during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> era, regardless of inherent limitations. Economies of scale in data centres and cloud services not only attracted more users but also contributed to the emergence and increasing value of platforms like Facebook and Google.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, such architecture generated a growth feedback loop but also increased critical setbacks. Systems like identity management and social media that initially fuel growth also introduce security vulnerabilities, censorship issues, and biases. The growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and complex AI algorithms intensify these vulnerabilities, expanding the number of avenues for potential attacks. This segues naturally into the principles Rong advocated, fostering a new internet or network OS cycle that safeguards first-party user data from third-party abuse.</p>
<p>In Part 2, we’ll explore Elastos in-depth, the vision that prompted Rong to leave Microsoft. This decentralised network OS introduces a paradigm shift in internet ownership, addressing current Web 2.0 limitations and forming the foundation for a third-generation web, or Web3. These principles find their expression in the Elastos SmartWeb concept, which encompasses sandboxing, peer-to-peer communication between these sandboxes, and the trust-based, decentralised features intrinsic to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">blockchain</a> technology.</p>

 Digital identity application developed by Elia Group and Energy Web, which will support interactions between flexible assets and the grid, adopted as a new project by OpenWallet Foundation <p>Together, Elia Group and Energy Web have developed an application which can be seamlessly integrated into digital wallets, making it easily adoptable by a wide range of companies</p><p>Brussels, Berlin, Zug, Switzerland — October 23, 2023 — The OpenWallet Foundation (OWF) has officially adopted a digital identity application which was developed by Elia Group and Energy Web as a new project. The application, which can be used to securely transfer identity information between different parties (including details about their flexible assets), can be easily integrated into digital wallet technology. Digital wallets are set to become commonplace; indeed, the European Union aims to provide all its citizens with access to a digital ID solution by&nbsp;2030.</p><p>Flexible consumption demands secure identification<br>Our energy systems are becoming increasingly decentralised, driven by the rise in renewable energy sources and electrical assets. Flexible assets such as heat pumps and electric vehicles will enable consumers to adapt their energy use in line with the needs of the system: consumers will be able to charge these when affordable green electricity is available, store it for later use, and (in the case of electric vehicles and home batteries) feed it back into the grid when needed. In so doing, consumers will help to keep the grid in balance and will support the integration of renewable energy into the system, so accelerating the energy transition.</p><p>Secure and efficient methods will be required to safely integrate electrical assets into the system and allow them to interact with the grid in a trusted manner. Extensive information exchange will need to take place, with data relating to personal details, technical specifications, contracts and charging tariffs being swapped between individuals, assets, and companies. Digital wallets, which are on the verge of becoming commonplace across Europe, are expected to be key enablers of this data exchange.</p><p>Elia Group and Energy Web have been collaborating on projects related to the integration of electrical assets into electricity systems for a number of&nbsp;years.</p><p>A digital wallet for every citizen<br>In line with its digital goals for Europe, the European Commission is working towards ensuring that all of its citizens will be able to use a personal digital wallet. One technology that can facilitate the design of these digital wallets is self-sovereign identity (SSI), a highly secure approach that enables identity-related information to be safely verified and exchanged between different parties.</p><p>SSI systems typically involve three core&nbsp;roles:</p>  the holder, who manages data related to their identity by storing it in their digital&nbsp;wallet;  the issuer, who is responsible for issuing the holder with identity-related data, often in the form of ‘verifiable credentials’;  the verifier, or party which requires access to identity-related data.  <p>Recognising the potential power of SSI, Elia Group and Energy Web began collaborating on the design of a digital identity application based on a pre-existing specification: the verifiable credential application programming interface (VC API) specification. Their software enables signed identity documents (stored on digital wallets as verifiable credentials) to be exchanged between an individual’s digital wallet and a third party. Elia Group and Energy Web chose to design their application based on a pre-existing specification that is familiar to a majority of companies. This means their solution can be easily integrated into a wide range of existing IT frameworks as companies design different digital wallets. Elia Group and Energy Web’s aim is to encourage energy companies, particularly small- and medium-sized energy companies, to adopt&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>“To ensure network security and stability, the integration of renewable energy sources into our energy systems will require household and industrial flexibility to be activated. SSI will be an important tool for creating a registry of decentralised and flexible assets that will allow us to monitor the state of the network and steer these decentralised assets.” Kris Laermans, Innovation at Elia&nbsp;Group</blockquote><p>OWF adopts Elia Group and Energy Web’s innovative solution as a new project<br>Once the application was ready, Elia Group and EnergyWeb approached OWF, an organisation which promotes the implementation and use of open, secure and interoperable digital wallet technology. The OWF then adopted the application as an OWF project, making it the fourth time such a solution has been accepted by the organisation since its formation in February 2023. This will help the application to be widely used by companies as they design digital&nbsp;wallets.</p><blockquote>“This collaborative effort between Elia Group, Energy Web, and the OpenWallet Foundation represents a significant step toward revolutionising the digital wallet landscape. By officially accepting this project, OWF is empowering the future of secure and interoperable digital wallets. Together, we’re advancing technology that will not only benefit the energy sector but also drive innovation beyond its boundaries, setting the stage for a more interconnected and secure digital world.” John Henderson, Senior Solution Architect at Energy&nbsp;Web</blockquote><p>GitHub documentation, which includes the code for the project, can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/energywebfoundation/vc-api-owf">here</a>.</p><p>Elia Group<br>Elia Group is an international energy company that comprises two transmission system operators.

     Check out the recently published GTIN Management Guideline for construction products!

             <p>Products in the construction sector have very specific and intricate characteristics. It is a sector that is too large, with information that is too fragmented and, above all, with little process digitalisation. But this is about to change, thanks to the first official GS1 document on Construction.</p>

<p>It is a document that results from the work done by the GTIN Management Rules under the supervision of the Swedish GS1 User Group Construction and the GS1 GSMP. A tool that simplifies the language and makes this topic more easily understandable for the community, through specific examples for the construction sector, under the GTIN Management Standard.</p>

<p>The GTIN Management Guideline for Construction Products is designed to help industry make consistent decisions on the unique identification of construction products in open supply chains and comply with the General GTIN Management Standard. In general, costs are minimised when all stakeholders throughout the life cycle of a product adhere to the GTIN Management Standard. Furthermore, this could simplify CO2 footprint calculations, trace products and their content to simplify the circular economy, reuse, recovery as well as compliance with different green building certification schemes.</p>

<p>The OpenID Connect Working Group recommends the approval of Errata corrections to the following specifications:</p>
 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0-33.html">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</a>&nbsp;– Defines the core OpenID Connect functionality: authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 and the use of Claims to communicate information about the End-User

<p>An Errata version of a specification incorporates corrections identified after the Final Specification was published. This would be the second set of errata corrections for Core, Discovery, and Dynamic Client Registration and the first Back-Channel Logout. This note starts the 45 day public review period for the specification drafts in accordance with the OpenID Foundation IPR policies and procedures. This review period will end on Tuesday, December 5, 2023. Unless issues are identified during the review that the working group believes must be addressed by revising the drafts, this review period will be followed by a seven day voting period during which OpenID Foundation members will vote on whether to approve these drafts as OpenID Errata Specifications. For the convenience of members who have completed their reviews by then, voting will actually open a week early on Wednesday, November 29, 2023, with the voting period still ending on Wednesday, December 13, 2023.

<p>A new working group has been accepted by the OpenID Foundation (OIDF) <a href="https://openid.net/specs-council/">Specs Council</a> that will focus on increasing interoperability of authorization systems. The new working group, called&nbsp; Authorization Exchange (AuthZEN), resulted from a series of conversations at the two most recent Identiverse conferences. After this year’s event, it was recognized that there was considerable interest in authorization as a topic, but that several constraints existed that were limiting widespread adoption of industry best practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AuthZEN will focus on specific areas of interoperability by documenting common authorization patterns, define standard mechanisms, protocols and formats for communication between authorization components, and recommend best practices for developing secure applications.</p>
<p>AuthZEN will hold weekly meetings on Tuesdays at 9am PT via Zoom with the following link: <a href="https://zoom.us/j/92150123981?pwd=YnhuSXNxU2w4Z3VGc3lrUjRNSTBUZz09">https://zoom.us/j/92150123981?pwd=YnhuSXNxU2w4Z3VGc3lrUjRNSTBUZz09</a>. The first AuthZEN Working Group meeting will be Tuesday, October 24, 2023. Co-chairs for the working group will be confirmed at the first meeting.</p>
<p>Those new to the OpenID Foundation and interested in participating in the AuthZEN WG, will need to complete a <a href="https://openid.net/intellectual-property/openid-foundation-contribution-agreements/">Contribution Agreement</a>. Please note that you do not need to be a member of the Foundation to participate in working groups but <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/benefits-members/">membership is encouraged and appreciated</a>.</p>

 Background: Co-leadership 



<p>At the end of this year, The Engine Room’s Executive Director, Julia Keseru, will be leaving after being at the organisation for the last eight years. The Engine Room’s Board of Directors is excited to announce that going forward The Engine Room will formally adopt a model of co-leadership based on the learnings and work of the current leadership team.&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a title="">Read letters from the board and from Julia </a>  



 <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/learning-from-co-leadership/" title="">Read more about The Engine Room’s experience with co-leadership</a>. 
 



<p>The Engine Room is a non-profit organisation with a distributed global team of experienced and committed activists, researchers, technologists and community organisers. Working alongside frontline organisations, we use the power of technology, data and research to advance our vision. We build evidence, strengthen capacity, and connect movements.&nbsp; Learn more about us and our work at <a href="http://www.theengineroom.org" title="">theengineroom.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Co-leadership looks different for every leader and every organisation. While the norm is still the single-leader model — whether in a corporate setting or small local NGOs — we believe that for The Engine Room, a shared-leadership approach can be more responsive to context, leverage the skills and capacities of individuals, and result in a more resilient organisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a formal process, The Engine Room’s Board of Directors has offered one of the co-ED positions to Paola Mosso, a Deputy Director at TER. Paola has been with The Engine Room for eight years. She is embedded in various local and global activist communities and has deep expertise in digital ecosystems, online infrastructures, emerging and justice-focused technologies and feminist approaches to digital resilience. She brings a journalistic eye to how we talk about our work and is an integrator of approaches when it comes to creating local change. She is deeply committed to the co-leadership model and championed its implementation at TER.</p>



 Role Description 



<p>The Engine Room is soliciting applications for a Co-Executive Director. If you apply, we will want to engage with you as a person and hear your vision as it connects to our mission and our defining measures of success. For us this is more important than a list of characteristics and skills. In addition to our core mission and current work, a few key issues are important to our future:</p>



 
 The intersection of research and social justice is important to us. TER is looking to shift its approach to research so that it is tied more closely to its community work and honouring a strong local point of view.&nbsp; 



 Our latest approach to fundraising is working for us. We are committed to balancing project-specific, fee-for-service funds and grants, program funding, and unrestricted support for the organisation. 



 It is&nbsp; fundamentally important for us to align organisational development with shared leadership, and to document&nbsp; and share the learning that comes with this approach, for both ourselves and our partners.&nbsp; 
 



<p>To grow and thrive, it is critical that the new co-ED possess these qualities:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Brings academic-level research skills, and writes and thinks beyond disciplinary silos. 



 Experience and connections for business development, and capacity for fundraising. 



 Defining fields of interest and experience, such as&nbsp; environmental justice or emerging technologies. Relevant experience can be as a social activist, writer, researcher, campaigner, or networker in the given area. 



 Experience in any capacity with social justice and community building in the majority world. 



 Experience working with or for US-based nonprofits. 
 



<p>At The Engine Room, we prioritise care, well-being, flexible collaboration and clear communication. We look for colleagues who bring:</p>



 
 A constructive and opportunistic approach to confronting challenges and building strategies for the future. 



 A commitment to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C17CtaYtoLbdBg3MUFBC5QEc4KtYN3EqsZTbl13WG0I/edit" title="">our values</a> of making space, thinking critically and acting intentionally, embracing complexity, and holding everyone high. 



 A readiness to experiment, especially as we navigate journeys of shared leadership, and adapting the ways our teams collaborate and define areas of interest. 
 



 Please apply via <a href="https://engineroom.hrpartner.io/jobs/co-executive-director-qjjam" title="">this application form</a> (incl. CV and cover letter). Applications close 28 November 2023, midnight EST

<p>A letter from The Engine Room’s Board, and a message from our Executive Director, Julia </p>



 



<p>Letter from the TER Board </p>



<p>October 18, 2023</p>



<p>Dear Friends, Partners, and Supporters of The Engine Room,</p>



<p>Today we are announcing that Julia Keseru is leaving The Engine Room at the end of this year. We are deeply grateful to Julia for the work she has done and the legacy she built during her tenure. With Julia’s leadership The Engine Room expanded its services and support portfolio, attracted diverse funding and partnerships, and deepened its impact in multiple regions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Julia joined the team in 2015 and has been our Executive Director since 2018. You can read more about the reasons for her transition and what she is going to do next in her letter below. We thank Julia for her passion and investment that helped The Engine Room grow into what it is today, and we wish her the best in her future endeavours. While she will be greatly missed, we are eager to see what she does next!</p>



<p>Moving forward, we are excited to announce that TER will formally adopt a model of co-leadership based on the learnings and work of the current leadership team, who have cultivated a shared leadership approach since Julia’s health crisis two years ago. This started when we brought in Gillian Williams as our Interim Executive Director during Julia’s medical leave. As Julia eased back into work, Gillian and Julia developed a model for sharing leadership. Together with co-Deputy Directors Paola Mosso and Laura Guzmán, they formed a committed, diverse, thoughtful senior leadership team who dug deep into feminist and shared leadership. They’ve written about it in a recent <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/learning-from-co-leadership/" title="">blog</a>.</p>



<p>We have spent time reflecting on co-leadership and the future of the field, and engaged in developing the core tenets of what we are looking for in leadership for the organisation. Over the summer we created a process of candidate recruitment, interviewing, and selection. We were excited when Paola expressed interest in co-leading The Engine Room, and she formally interviewed with us through this process. We are pleased to announce that we have selected her as one of the two co-Executive Directors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paola has been with The Engine Room for eight years. She is embedded in various local and global activist communities and has deep expertise in digital ecosystems, online infrastructures, emerging technologies and justice-focused technologies. Please join us in congratulating her for this new role and wishing her the best!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today we are also announcing our formal search for the co-Executive Director. You can learn more about it in the <a title="">posting here</a>. We’re excited about this search, and look forward to hearing from all of you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Best regards,</p>



<p>Ivan Sigal, Chair <br>Elizabeth Lindsey <br>Maria Baron<br>Elizabeth Eagen<br>Isabela Fernandes</p>



 



<p>Message from our ED, Julia </p>



<p>Eight years ago I joined a team that I admired from afar but didn’t know deeply – the one thing I was certain of was that The Engine Room was doing things very differently than others. Under Alix Dunn’s visionary and compassionate leadership, I found myself in a completely distributed global team that was functional and fun to be a part of. From the first moment I knew that this was going to be a long-term relationship and that I came across something rare and magical: a team that makes me motivated and happy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a few years, I found myself at the&nbsp; wheel of the same team. Leading an organisation like TER was a dream come true for me. And little did I know how transformative the past five years were going to be.</p>



<p>Two years into my tenure the pandemic hit and while The Engine Room weathered the storm of the global health crisis, it was not without scars – my own personal ones included. My daughter was only one when I became ED and I learned the hard way how difficult it is to be an involved parent and a responsible leader at the same time. Then two years ago I was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer and had to step out of the work to go through a series of invasive treatments and surgeries. I am happy to report that my health is in great shape right now, but the past two years have dramatically changed my perspective on life.</p>



<p>Most importantly, I realised that I care deeply about how people exist in the world as physical entities – what our true bodily boundaries are, how we can meaningfully coexist with each other in ways that uphold our dignity, and how we create systems that support autonomy and integrity. As I dove deeper into corporeal philosophy, bioethics, bodily integrity and cyberfeminism, I developed a tremendous appetite to learn new things, venture into new arenas and experiment with new ideas and ways of being and working. I also learned that I have meaningful things to say about how our bodies exist in a digital era – things that significantly build on The Engine Room’s legacy but that might go beyond its mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this period I also fully comprehended that time is precious and our existence on this planet is very short – which led me to my decision to transition out of The Engine Room by the end of the year, and pursue my dreams in different avenues. I feel incredibly proud of the things we have achieved in the past decade, bittersweet about saying goodbye to this team, and massively inspired by the potential and resilience of The Engine Room as an institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while I know I contributed to that potential in significant ways, I am also deeply aware that individuals alone can never make long-lasting change. The Engine Room is a rare gem because of the collaboration, dedication and diverse viewpoints that make up our DNA – thinking in communities and ecosystems is ingrained in our work and makes us who we are today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I consider myself extremely lucky to have been able to work with the smart, sweet and thoughtful individuals who made up The Engine Room and I owe special thanks to Alix, Anneke, Zara, Laura, Paola and Gillian for their brilliance, comradery, compassion, ethics and comedic timing. I found tremendous intellectual and emotional inspiration in these women and I wish every leader had the opportunity to share the joys and burdens of leadership with such partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I feel calm, proud and relieved to be able to leave the organisation in the fantastic hands of Paola and her co-leader to come. Continuing the co-leadership model is something I believe is right for TER and for the field.&nbsp; Paola and I joined The Engine Room almost the same time and we worked together in many different variations. We supported organisations with their tech platforms, designed myriad projects together and raised funds successfully. We organised events and facilitated conversations and co-wrote proposals, strategies and hundreds of other documents. Most importantly, we spent quality time together in random Airbnbs, airports and trains, talking and talking and talking endlessly about the world we want to live in, the work that needs to happen to get there, and all the things in life that motivate us to get up each day with passion and diligence.</p>



<p>In the past eight years I got to know Paola as a thoughtful, creative, value-driven and incredibly visionary person, someone whose thinking is both inspiring and grounding in my own work. I am beyond excited to see where she and the team are going next, and routing for their success all along the way.</p>



<p>And what will I do next? Like I said before, I am in an experimental mode and very much enjoying it. Next year I will dedicate my time to pursue the DataBody Integrity – my research oriented fellowship at the Mozilla Foundation that allows me to dig deeper into the politics of bodies in the digital era. Besides that, I am trying to support more organisations in my home country, Hungary, flex my coaching muscles, and grab every opportunity to have fun with my family and explore the world. When we get closer I’ll share more about my work! </p>

<p>In the midst of the city of Vancouver, a company stands, unwavering and bold. Lions Gate Digital. The sun rises, casting a golden light on the future they aim to shape. They have a <a href="https://lionsgate.io/prospectus/">prospectus</a>. It’s not just any piece of paper. It’s a promise. A commitment. $2.2 million USD from 10,000 shares. Tokenized. A Security Token Offering (STO). Each share a beacon for what’s coming.</p>



<p>The landscape of the digital world is vast, sometimes treacherous. Yet, this company does not waver. They’ve seen the horizon, the potential of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). It’s the future, and they aim to harness it. An army is forming, not of soldiers, but of believers. Believers in a decentralized world. The Lions Gate Digital Army.</p>



<p>Self-sovereign. The word resonates. It speaks of independence, of control. In a world overflowing with data, with information, one’s identity is paramount. And to control it, to truly own it, is power.</p>



<p>The enlistment is open. To join is to believe. To see the potential, the vision. The company seeks pioneers, adventurers. Those willing to embark on this digital journey. For they know the path won’t always be easy, but it will be worth it.</p>



<p>With the dawn, there’s hope. The company’s vision, their mission, is clear. They’re not merely introducing a STO. They’re inviting the world to see what they see, to dream what they dream.</p>



<p>In the end, it’s more than just an investment. It’s a movement. A call to arms in a digital age. The Lions Gate Digital Army. The future is theirs to shape, and they’re inviting all to join.</p>



<p>To the brave, to the visionaries: the prospectus is ready. The future awaits.</p>

 Insights into WAO’s coaching techniques for effective presentations and workshops <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of our work is collaborating with organisations that are passionate about making a positive impact in the world. Earlier this year, we had the opportunity to work with Change.org to support them with workshop design and presentation development. In this post we’ll share some of the techniques we used to help, so you can use them in your organisation, too!</p>change.org logo<p><a href="https://change.org">Change.org</a> is a global platform that empowers people to create change in their communities and beyond. Their mission is to build a world where no one is powerless and where creating change is a part of everyday life. With this mission, it’s no wonder that they wanted the workshops and presentations of their 2023 offsite to empower&nbsp;people.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<blockquote>At Change, we have a unique opportunity to give a more powerful voice to hundreds of millions of people in order to build more participatory and responsive democracies. We want to live up to our mission and incorporate these principles into everything that we do so that we can create tools and resources that are authentic for people using our platform. We know that being involved in digital activism takes courage, intention and planning, many of the soft skills that we hope to strengthen internally amongst our Product Team. — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamjessklein/">Jess Klein</a>, Director of&nbsp;Design</blockquote><p>We’ve created slide decks for <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16jvdbbTHuRtbA72seHwrI48tckcgyvxHhf00sHTQvLs/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">creating</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MIVsO5kaMiN8bhSwdF9vYMliC5klFKzl63jCpzil_y0/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">preparing</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_12RxeZrt3k2PIqiKn3bi97od6bBxifBPIOR8VrXwlI/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">running</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sz0OT0mp-_YWuy2AB4Jr125rf5lgPbVkxDuwcjXJLEw/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">recovering from</a> sessions as well as one for <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17R7OWgy-8Cme_EphWHrlLu0eKf9QtgC8r0BGU2WqrbU/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">general tips</a>. This post gives just a brief overview of each section and pulls out the key questions you will want to ask yourself. If you’d prefer to see these tips all at once <a href="https://bit.ly/3VZE1Ju">check out our monster slide&nbsp;deck</a>!</p> Creating your session&nbsp;plan <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16jvdbbTHuRtbA72seHwrI48tckcgyvxHhf00sHTQvLs/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">Speaking and Facilitation: Tips &amp; Tricks: Part&nbsp;1</a></p><p>No-one likes a boring speaker or workshop. So your aim should be to create a session that is participatory, so that you can co-design solutions and outputs with others. “Participatory” means that a workshop invites input. Instead of “presenting” information, the facilitator asks participants to help solve problems.</p><p>Using participatory practices leads to better solutions, more inspiration and more collaboration. Creation isn’t passive, and “participatory” does not mean formless. A structure we like to use in workshops can be summarised as “Future, Present, Past”. You say what you’re going to do (future), do what you’re going to do (present) and then say what you did&nbsp;(past).</p><p>Here’s a list of questions to ask yourself when you are creating your session&nbsp;plan:</p>  How do you want people to feel in your&nbsp;session?  What outputs do you want and why do these outputs matter to&nbsp;others?  How can you ensure that everyone is able to contribute equally?  How can you use your presentation or introduction to get people thinking?  What can people DO that will help you move your work&nbsp;forward?  What instructions can you give that guide the conversations and help your participants produce valuable insights?  How can you time-box share outs so that each group gets a chance to&nbsp;share?  How will you model this reflective activity for your participants?  What can people do to stay involved with you and your&nbsp;work?   Create your slide&nbsp;deck <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MIVsO5kaMiN8bhSwdF9vYMliC5klFKzl63jCpzil_y0/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">Speaking and Facilitation: Tips &amp; Tricks: Part&nbsp;2</a></p><p>Even in a participatory session, you’ll want to have some visual guidance. This will help people remember the reason they’re there and what problems they should be trying to solve. What you put on your screen isn’t there to prompt you but rather to prompt your audience.</p><p>Use stories, anecdotes, and analogies to bring your talk to life. Keep things visual as a picture paints a thousand words (and makes it easier for you to remember what you wanted to&nbsp;say!)</p><p>Question to think about for good deck of&nbsp;slides:</p>  What is essential for people to understand about your problem area so that they can contribute solutions?  How can your slide deck serve your colleagues after the&nbsp;session?  What questions do you want the audience to ask after you’re done presenting?  cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO Promote your&nbsp;session <p>Now that you’ve spent so much time crafting your session, now you need to get people to attend. The more minds, the merrier! The best collaborative sessions include diverse perspectives to ensure that solutions and ideas speak to the broadest range of&nbsp;people.</p><p>You’ll want to tell people about your session, so that you get lots of input and lots of output. Don’t be afraid to promote your excellent planning!</p><p>Questions to consider:</p>  Who are your&nbsp;allies?  Can you summarise the context, need and outcome in just 3&nbsp;bullets?  How can your entire organisation or sector benefit from the outputs of your&nbsp;session?   Run a mini pre-mortem cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>There are some things we can control and some things that we can’t. Thinking about what could go wrong in advance is a good way to prepare yourself for different eventualities. Some things we can prevent, whereas some things we can only mitigate. For example, we might be able to prevent the session running over, but we would only be able to mitigate a problem with the room we’re scheduled to be&nbsp;in.</p><p>Running a mini ‘pre-mortem’ creates a psychologically-safe space to take a look at your session and inherent risks. All you do is imagine it’s after the session is over and imagine that the session was a failure. The job of the pre-mortem is to identify in advance why that might&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Questions to help you create backup&nbsp;plans:</p>  What will you do if your slides are corrupt or there’s no paper in the&nbsp;room?  Who can you call on to help remove / calm down someone who is exhibiting (sustained) problematic behaviours?  How can you structure your slide deck to make sections skippable?   Take care of&nbsp;yourself <p>Every session needs at least one leader, and that’s you! So take care of yourself so you can help lead everyone through the&nbsp;session.</p><p>What that looks like in practice can depend on specific circumstances, but in general means a calm, well-rested person, with a plan and the resources to carry it out. If you’re part of a team running the session, then you should encourage them to be calm and well-rested, too.</p><p>Help yourself find&nbsp;calm:</p>  Are there particular things (e.g. coffee, energy drinks) that you know you should avoid directly before the session because of the effect they have on&nbsp;you?  How long will each part of the session take, realistically?  Do you need to factor in transition time?  cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO Next steps… <p>In this post we’ve talked about planning, preparing, and promoting your session, as well as thinking about what could go wrong, and looking after yourself. What resonates with you? What do you need to work on in particular?</p><p>In our next post, we’ll talk about running and recovering from your session. We’ll also give you some general tips for a kick-ass workshop or presentation.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/radiating-confidence-at-change-org-9fbbe9f4fc2f">Radiating Confidence at Change.org</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 10:30-11:10 am – Breakout Session 1 
<p>Classroom 107, Mullen Communications Center<br>
Engaging GenZ with Voice and Choice to Promote Digital Literacy</p>
<p>“The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report lists Technology Use as one of their top 10 skills for 2025. Across industries, skills in visual design, digital storytelling, and video production are in high demand, as digital communication dominates the mainstream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To begin this session, we will introduce Generation Z and explain their needs and expectations for the classroom environment. Driven by sense of purpose, Gen Z students will connect with learning experiences that emphasize creativity, voice, equity, and utility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will present an assignment that engages students in course content while developing their digital literacy in preparation for the professional demands that lie ahead. While traditional essays and discussion forums can be perceived as irrelevant and impersonal, this authentic assignment capitalizes on students’ impetus to create something that has real-world meaning.</p>
<p>All participants will receive a prompt and rubric, which includes a list of potential, student-created digital artifacts and corresponding instructions. We’ll discuss considerations for implementation, including ways to customize the assignment to meet the needs of virtually all instructional modalities and course delivery formats. Instructors can also tailor the list of options to leverage available institutional technology and resources without bearing responsibility for learning, teaching, and supporting new software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the heart of this assignment, we’ll discuss how giving students “voice and choice” bolsters their resilience and empowers them to persevere through challenges. Research is conclusive that student investment and performance skyrocket when they are given agency in determining how to demonstrate proficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The session will conclude with a hands-on activity in which participants use the provided rubric to evaluate real student work samples. We will finish with a question-and-answer session and scannable QR code that leads to downloadable materials and a cited list of the research that informed this presentation.”</p>

Meet Your Students’ Needs – Expanding Your Digital Catalog with a Course Sharing Network</p>
<p>Innovations like course sharing have been instrumental in meeting student needs and helping institutions achieve their strategic goals. Broadly speaking, course sharing offers institutions a low-risk way to help students access the courses they need when they need them while maintaining the integrity of learning outcomes and the student experience. Acadeum enables students and institutions to succeed with a platform and digital network that expands course catalogs, locates just-in-time solutions, and connects like-minded schools and learners to workforce-aligned and market-competitive courses. In addition, consortial course sharing makes for a more seamless student experience that bolsters retention and completion rates and better prepares learners with the skills required to succeed.</p>
<p>Through the Acadeum network, like-minded colleges and universities can access and share high-quality digital courses to support student success and boost academic innovation.</p>
 
 Attract new student populations by delivering in-demand courses and programs, conveniently and affordably. 
 Update or expand existing programs with new content from like-minded partners. 
 Meet student needs with workforce-aligned courses that offer credit as well as hands-on skills. 
 Ensure students have the courses they need when they need them to maintain velocity to completion. 
 
<p>Hear from a panel of institutional leaders on how they are using course sharing to:</p>
 
  Offer learners opportunities to regain academic standing and overcome barriers to completion 
  Eliminate transfer hassles and increase scheduling flexibility 
  Ensure athletic eligibility 
  Support instructional resourcing needs

<p>Classroom 107, Mullen Communications Center<br>
Skip The Hidden Messages: The Importance of Feedback in Online Learning</p>
<p>As in any learning environment, feedback impacts the learning experience. Yet many times instructors and facilitators fall short on providing meaningful feedback to learners. This session will cover key points of providing effective feedback to students in an online setting by taking a closer look at feedback methods and delivery. Feedback shouldn’t be a hidden message!</p>

HyFlex: Creating Opportunities for Success as a Community College</p>
<p>After the pandemic, Ocean County College was looking to create more flexibility for students in how they receive their education. In the summer of 2022, the college launched its first set of fully HyFlex courses allowing students to choose on any given day whether they came to class in person or logged in remotely to the live class session. Data was collected over the course of the 2022-2023 Academic year to see how students performed and to see if there were any advantages students perceived to using the modality. Many positive outcomes were discovered. This session will go over the results from the qualitative and quantitative data as well as walk participants through the process of implementing HyFlex classes in a community college setting.</p>
<p>Presenters:<br>

 1:10 – 1:50 pm – Breakout Session 3 
<p>Classroom 107, Mullen Communications Center<br>
Crafting Campus Connections with Oral History and Adobe Premiere Rush</p>
<p>This presentation discusses how student-created videos using Adobe Premiere Rush contribute to campus connectivity—we will provide examples that demonstrate the community-building nature of the assignment in a post-pandemic era and conclude with a reflection on how the final project submissions (which were donated to the university’s archives) used a new technology to create inspiring content that benefitted not only students, but also members of the Seton Hall University community in the present moment and, as we will explain, future community members as well. In our ever-changing technological world, collaborative projects between college students, faculty, and staff must ensure individuals from different backgrounds can work together to benefit their university communities. The disconnects that exist between these groups, however, present challenges for determining what productive collaborations and connections might look like. An oral history assignment used at Seton Hall University in Spring 2023 reflects one such innovative approach. First we will discuss how oral history presents a unique and engaging way for students to learn about history from those who have lived it and then we outline the assignment itself. Finally the audience will see how the creation of an oral history using Adobe Premiere Rush was the ideal way for students to practice several skills including various research techniques (reading primary and secondary sources), interpersonal communication (interviewing), and video creation (Adobe Premiere Rush).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Using Bite-sized Videos to Layer Nurse Practitioner Content</p>
<p>Educators are constantly exploring innovative strategies to assist students in retaining salient course material. Educational research has established that students need to refocus in under a minute, their attentiveness diminishes throughout a class, and they focus more effectively when student-centered pedagogies are integrated (Blake, 2023). Specifically, Gen Z nursing graduate students have shorter attention spans and, as digital natives (Prensky, 2001), expect to learn through a variety of modalities (Chicca &amp; Shellenbarger, 2018; Singh &amp; Dangmei, 2016). Today’s nurse practitioner students are digitally grounded and often prefer information in bite-sized chunks. To address this need, the presenters created a series of health assessment bite-sized videos highlighting important lecture content to reinforce nurse practitioner student course content. The presenters found this tailored approach can effectively engage nurse practitioner students and leverage the most important content for retention beyond the didactic classroom. This presentation will emphasize the process used in developing and refining the videos with a look forward to adapting the format to other subject areas.</p>

 2:00 – 2:40 pm – Breakout Session 4<br>
Preparing to Teach Online: From Learner to Teacher 
<p>Learning and teaching in the online environment often look very different than in face-to-face classrooms. For novice instructors, understanding how students experience the online classroom can feel like a daunting task. Through the Online Teaching Certificate (OTC) Program offered by Rutgers Teaching and Learning with Technology, instructors take on the role of online students for themselves. As they learn about key principles of online pedagogy and instructional technology usage, they also build empathy for their students, reflecting on their own experiences, challenges, and discoveries as online learners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this workshop, we will provide an overview of the design of the OTC program, highlighting one course in detail. We will demonstrate how the structure and content of this course, Universal Design and Accessibility for Online Teaching, facilitates both skill-building and metacognitive reflection about participants’ experiences as online learners. Attendees will focus on key challenges related to online learning contexts as well as strategies supporting online student success.</p>

Making Art with Embedded Poetry from Human and ChatGPT Sources</p>
<p>I published a book in 2011 titled “3D Haiku and Tanka” in Apple Books which explored how writing poetry in 3D space was different from traditional ways of writing on flat 2D surfaces. When 3D printing strategies became available, now it was possible to make 3D real world models of assembled poetic lines which also contained audio buttons that could be pressed for a line of poetry to be read aloud. The appearance of laser cutters made possible the use of multicolored acrylic sheets cut into patterns such as squares, rectangles and pentagons and held together with wood veneer and nuts and bolts. The text of poems are laser cut into the acrylic sheets with QR codes placed nearby for reading by patrons who may be blind or visually impaired. The appearance of ChatGPT now permits the possibility of asking ChatGPT to write poetry in Haiku or Tanka format and include the selected poetry in the mixed media art piece. An example of a Tanka poem made from asking ChatGPT follows.</p>
<p>Silent algorithms,<br>
AI ponders the unknown,<br>
Unraveling truths,<br>
The quest for understanding,<br>
Guided by digital minds.</p>
<p>This raises questions about copyright as ChatGPT utilizes what is available in its captured database to write poetry so any art I make with ChatGPT-inspired poetry pays credit to ChatGPT when its generated poetry is used in an art piece and in that way can be viewed as a virtual collaborator and listed as so in the information describing the art piece.</p>

Maintaining a Competitive Edge While Meeting Student and Workforce Demand</p>
<p>Mirco-credentialing, or stackable certificates, has been cited repeatedly as one of the biggest trends to inspire academic innovation in higher education. Workforce-aligned programs allow institutions to:</p>
 
 Be highly responsive to changing professional trends 
 Deliver work-based learning experiences that are industry relevant 
 Keep up with the rapidly changing nature of the world today 
 
<p>Institutions can now leverage the Acadeum network specifically to promote credit recognition, reach new audiences, and provide industry-aligned skills to students making them workforce ready. You’ll learn how Southeastern University is approaching industry designed content to help expedite skills based learning that can stack into a degree program for learners to continue to advance along the education-career continuum.</p>

<p>To begin this session, we will introduce Generation Z and explain their needs and expectations for the classroom environment. Driven by sense of purpose, Gen Z students will connect with learning experiences that emphasize creativity, voice, equity, and utility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will present an assignment that engages students in course content while developing their digital literacy in preparation for the professional demands that lie ahead. While traditional essays and discussion forums can be perceived as irrelevant and impersonal, this authentic assignment capitalizes on students’ impetus to create something that has real-world meaning.</p>
<p>All participants will receive a prompt and rubric, which includes a list of potential, student-created digital artifacts and corresponding instructions. We’ll discuss considerations for implementation, including ways to customize the assignment to meet the needs of virtually all instructional modalities and course delivery formats. Instructors can also tailor the list of options to leverage available institutional technology and resources without bearing responsibility for learning, teaching, and supporting new software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the heart of this assignment, we’ll discuss how giving students “voice and choice” bolsters their resilience and empowers them to persevere through challenges. Research is conclusive that student investment and performance skyrocket when they are given agency in determining how to demonstrate proficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The session will conclude with a hands-on activity in which participants use the provided rubric to evaluate real student work samples. We will finish with a question-and-answer session and scannable QR code that leads to downloadable materials and a cited list of the research that informed this presentation.”</p>

Skip The Hidden Messages: The Importance of Feedback in Online Learning</p>
<p>As in any learning environment, feedback impacts the learning experience. Yet many times instructors and facilitators fall short on providing meaningful feedback to learners. This session will cover key points of providing effective feedback to students in an online setting by taking a closer look at feedback methods and delivery. Feedback shouldn’t be a hidden message!</p>

HyFlex: Creating Opportunities for Success as a Community College</p>
<p>After the pandemic, Ocean County College was looking to create more flexibility for students in how they receive their education. In the summer of 2022, the college launched its first set of fully HyFlex courses allowing students to choose on any given day whether they came to class in person or logged in remotely to the live class session. Data was collected over the course of the 2022-2023 Academic year to see how students performed and to see if there were any advantages students perceived to using the modality. Many positive outcomes were discovered. This session will go over the results from the qualitative and quantitative data as well as walk participants through the process of implementing HyFlex classes in a community college setting.</p>

Crafting Campus Connections with Oral History and Adobe Premiere Rush</p>
<p>This presentation discusses how student-created videos using Adobe Premiere Rush contribute to campus connectivity—we will provide examples that demonstrate the community-building nature of the assignment in a post-pandemic era and conclude with a reflection on how the final project submissions (which were donated to the university’s archives) used a new technology to create inspiring content that benefitted not only students, but also members of the Seton Hall University community in the present moment and, as we will explain, future community members as well. In our ever-changing technological world, collaborative projects between college students, faculty, and staff must ensure individuals from different backgrounds can work together to benefit their university communities. The disconnects that exist between these groups, however, present challenges for determining what productive collaborations and connections might look like. An oral history assignment used at Seton Hall University in Spring 2023 reflects one such innovative approach. First we will discuss how oral history presents a unique and engaging way for students to learn about history from those who have lived it and then we outline the assignment itself. Finally the audience will see how the creation of an oral history using Adobe Premiere Rush was the ideal way for students to practice several skills including various research techniques (reading primary and secondary sources), interpersonal communication (interviewing), and video creation (Adobe Premiere Rush).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Using Bite-sized Videos to Layer Nurse Practitioner Content</p>
<p>Educators are constantly exploring innovative strategies to assist students in retaining salient course material. Educational research has established that students need to refocus in under a minute, their attentiveness diminishes throughout a class, and they focus more effectively when student-centered pedagogies are integrated (Blake, 2023). Specifically, Gen Z nursing graduate students have shorter attention spans and, as digital natives (Prensky, 2001), expect to learn through a variety of modalities (Chicca &amp; Shellenbarger, 2018; Singh &amp; Dangmei, 2016). Today’s nurse practitioner students are digitally grounded and often prefer information in bite-sized chunks. To address this need, the presenters created a series of health assessment bite-sized videos highlighting important lecture content to reinforce nurse practitioner student course content. The presenters found this tailored approach can effectively engage nurse practitioner students and leverage the most important content for retention beyond the didactic classroom. This presentation will emphasize the process used in developing and refining the videos with a look forward to adapting the format to other subject areas.</p>

Preparing to Teach Online: From Learner to Teacher 
<p>Learning and teaching in the online environment often look very different than in face-to-face classrooms. For novice instructors, understanding how students experience the online classroom can feel like a daunting task. Through the Online Teaching Certificate (OTC) Program offered by Rutgers Teaching and Learning with Technology, instructors take on the role of online students for themselves. As they learn about key principles of online pedagogy and instructional technology usage, they also build empathy for their students, reflecting on their own experiences, challenges, and discoveries as online learners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this workshop, we will provide an overview of the design of the OTC program, highlighting one course in detail. We will demonstrate how the structure and content of this course, Universal Design and Accessibility for Online Teaching, facilitates both skill-building and metacognitive reflection about participants’ experiences as online learners. Attendees will focus on key challenges related to online learning contexts as well as strategies supporting online student success.</p>

Making Art with Embedded Poetry from Human and ChatGPT Sources</p>
<p>I published a book in 2011 titled “3D Haiku and Tanka” in Apple Books which explored how writing poetry in 3D space was different from traditional ways of writing on flat 2D surfaces. When 3D printing strategies became available, now it was possible to make 3D real world models of assembled poetic lines which also contained audio buttons that could be pressed for a line of poetry to be read aloud. The appearance of laser cutters made possible the use of multicolored acrylic sheets cut into patterns such as squares, rectangles and pentagons and held together with wood veneer and nuts and bolts. The text of poems are laser cut into the acrylic sheets with QR codes placed nearby for reading by patrons who may be blind or visually impaired. The appearance of ChatGPT now permits the possibility of asking ChatGPT to write poetry in Haiku or Tanka format and include the selected poetry in the mixed media art piece. An example of a Tanka poem made from asking ChatGPT follows.</p>
<p>Silent algorithms,<br>
AI ponders the unknown,<br>
Unraveling truths,<br>
The quest for understanding,<br>
Guided by digital minds.</p>
<p>This raises questions about copyright as ChatGPT utilizes what is available in its captured database to write poetry so any art I make with ChatGPT-inspired poetry pays credit to ChatGPT when its generated poetry is used in an art piece and in that way can be viewed as a virtual collaborator and listed as so in the information describing the art piece.</p>

<p>Ceramic recently launched a new course on LearnWeb3, a leading platform for Web3 education. The course, ‘<a href="https://learnweb3.io/lessons/build-an-ai-chatbot-on-compose-db-and-the-ceramic-network?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Build an AI Chatbot on ComposeDB and the Ceramic Network,</a>’ will teach developers how to build powerful and scalable AI chatbots using Ceramic’s decentralized data infrastructure.</p><p>AI chatbots are becoming increasingly popular in a variety of industries, from customer service to healthcare to education. However, building and maintaining AI chatbots can be complex and expensive, especially for small businesses and startups. Ceramic's new course aims to make AI chatbots more accessible to developers of all skill levels.</p><p>If you've used AI chatbots like <a href="https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Agent GPT</a>, you've probably noticed that they're more efficient and effective when they have the relevant context for your conversation. This is because the chatbot is able to factor in previous messages, as well as other relevant information when generating its response. Ceramic gives developers a new way to build applications, and in this example chatbots, by storing data in a reusable format. Ceramic allows developers to benefit from the data that other developers have already created—overcoming the cold-start problem of populating applications with data.</p> What Will You Learn? <p>The course covers the following:</p>  What is Ceramic and how does it work?  What is ComposeDB and how does it make it easier to build applications on Ceramic?  Setting up your node and brief context on different node configurations  Data modeling corresponding to an AI-chatbot use case  Authenticating users  Conversing with the chatbot  How to use filters to efficiently read data from your node  How to write mutations  How to stream AI responses to your frontend UI   What Do You Need to Get Started? <p>You can sign up for an account on the <a href="http://learnweb3.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">LearnWeb3.io</a> website (with a blockchain wallet or email address) and follow along in the <a href="https://learnweb3.io/lessons/build-an-ai-chatbot-on-compose-db-and-the-ceramic-network?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tutorial’s link</a> to gain points for answering quiz questions and completing the tutorial.</p><p>As outlined in the tutorial, the only dependencies you’ll need are:</p>  MetaMask Chrome Extension  Node v16  An OpenAI API key   Want to Learn More about Building on Ceramic? <p>While this course on LearnWeb3 describes a specific use case for ComposeDB, there are other developer examples and tools that you might find helpful as you build on Ceramic:</p> How to Use and Store Composable Attestations with Ceramic and EAS <p>Walk through a <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tutorial</a> on how to generate Attestations (using Ethereum Attestation Service) and store them on ComposeDB.</p> ComposeDB API Sandbox <p>Use the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/sandbox?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB API Sandbox</a> to test example queries on a real dataset.</p> Learn How to Encrypt and Decrypt Data on ComposeDB <p>Visit the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/tutorial-encrypted-data-on-composedb/">tutorial</a> for one methodology you can use to encrypt data and decrypt data on ComposeDB.</p> Create a Social App on ComposeDB <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/EthDenver2023Demo?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Social App ComposeDB Starter</a> will help you get started building your own social app.</p><p>Let us know what you think on the <a href="https://www.notion.so/ba4a098b06e3437082430c5217bf501f?pvs=21&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Forum</a>!</p>

<p>Revised OASIS Standard now available</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OSLC Open Project are pleased to announce the approval and publication of OSLC Change Management Version 3.0 Errata 01.</p>



<p>This document incorporates Approved Errata for the OASIS Standard “OSLC Change Management Version 3.0.” The specific changes are listed in Appendix C of Part 1, at&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/cm/v3.0/errata01/os/change-mgt-spec.html#errata">https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/cm/v3.0/errata01/os/change-mgt-spec.html#errata</a>.</p>



<p>The nine currently published Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) specifications, along with several informative Project Notes, collectively define a core set of services and domain vocabularies for lifecycle management including requirement, change and quality management.</p>



<p>This specification defines the OSLC Change Management domain, a RESTful web services interface for the management of product change requests, activities, tasks and relationships between those and related resources such as requirements, test cases, or architectural resources. To support these scenarios, this specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.</p>

   Online violence against women in politics in Latin America is becoming more and more frequent, affecting women’s right to participate in democracy. In countries such as Colombia, Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile and many others, female politicians are attacked on social media platforms in attempts to undermine their political legitimacy, for reasons associated with their gender.

<p>Online violence against women in politics in Latin America is becoming <a href="https://elpais.com/planeta-futuro/2021-08-10/el-momento-de-erradicar-la-violencia-contra-las-mujeres-en-politica-es-ahora.html" title="">more and more frequent</a>, affecting women’s right to participate in democracy.

<p>A growing number of initiatives have been undertaken to fight against this concerning trend. This blog post (which is by no means an exhaustive list!) lists just a few examples of the inspiring work being done in the region.</p>



<p>At the end, we’ve included a list of initiatives offering hands-on emergency digital security support in the region as well.&nbsp;</p>



 



 Bolivia&nbsp; 



<p>Cielito Saravia from <a href="https://internetbolivia.org/" title="">Internet Bolivia</a> wrote <a href="https://internetbolivia.org/publicacion/mujeres-libres-en-politica-guia-para-combatir-el-acoso-y-la-violencia-politica-digital-avp/" title="">this guide</a> to help women in politics identify harassment and political violence online and to strengthen their defence capabilities against digital attacks. Internet Bolivia also has an <a href="https://sosdigital.internetbolivia.org/guia/" title="">interactive guide to support</a> women who are suffering tech facilitated gender based violence, and a guide focusing on <a href="https://sosdigital.internetbolivia.org/publicaci-n/guia-de-seguridad-digital-para-mujeres-en-el-ejercicio-politico-publico/" title="">digital security for women politicians in office</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Chile 



<p>In Chile, where <a href="https://laneta.cl/primer-informe-de-mujer-y-politica-en-twitter-el-67-de-las-candidatas-recibieron-mensajes-violentos-durante-la-campana/" title="">67% of women candidates receive violent messages</a> during campaigns, <a href="https://toma-partido.fes.de/" title="">#TomaPartido</a> published a <a href="https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/chile/19251-20220914.pdf" title="">digital security guide</a>, written by <a href="https://pazpena.com/" title="">Paz Peña</a>, that takes a feminist approach for people and organisations facing digital political violence. The guide offers information about some of the most common attacks as well as practical steps for improving digital security. It’s available in <a href="https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/chile/19251-20220914.pdf" title="">Spanish</a> and <a href="https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/chile/19535-20221220.pdf" title="">Portuguese</a>.</p>



 Colombia&nbsp; 



<p>In Colombia, where <a href="https://efeminista.com/colombia-ley-violencia-politica-mujeres/" title="">recent legislation was created</a> to fight political violence against women, Fundación Karisma has been doing research to <a href="https://web.karisma.org.co/las-violencias-digitales-pueden-disuadir-a-las-mujeres-de-postularse-a-cargos-publicos/" title="">define digital violence against women politicians </a>in the country and understand its consequences for their work and life. In <a href="https://web.karisma.org.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Resumen-Ejecutivo-Acoso-Soledad-y-Desprestigio-Agosto_2023.pdf" title="">this publication</a>, they offer recommendations for political movements on how to navigate digital violence against women in politics.</p>



 Brazil 



 
 The initiative <a href="https://azmina.com.br/reportagens/como-acontece-violencia-politica-de-genero-exemplos/" title="">MonitorA</a>, from <a href="https://azmina.com.br/" title="">Azmina</a> and <a href="https://internetlab.org.br/" title="">InternetLab</a>, looks at the different forms that gendered political violence takes in the country to keep women and trans people out of politics. In its mapping of misogyny and online attacks against women in politics, MonitorA has found staggering evidence: in the first week of electoral campaigning in 2022, <a href="https://azmina.com.br/reportagens/monitora-2022-misoginia-ofensas-candidatas/" title="">almost 4.5k attacks or insults were directed at women candidates on Twitter</a>.&nbsp; 
 



 
 The project coLAB at Universidade Federal Fluminense created the <a href="https://colab-uff.github.io/ddoslab/project/report-gender-violence" title="">Mapa da Violência Política de Gênero em Plataformas Digitais</a>, highlighting the intensity, type and various forms of political gendered violence on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. 
 



 
 Since 2020, <a href="https://www.institutomariellefranco.org/en" title="">Instituto Marielle Franco</a> has been researching and monitoring <a href="https://www.violenciapolitica.org/" title="">political violence in Brazil</a>, and showing how gendered and racialised it is. They have mapped 8 types of political violence suffered by over 140 Black women candidates in the country, and their work has consistently shown that whether Black women are elected or not they remain unprotected against these forms of violence. Through “<a href="https://www.naoseremosinterrompidas.org/" title="">Não Seremos Interrompidas</a>”, they’ve been advocating for local authorities to act against political violence that has kept Black women and LGBTQIA+ from accessing and safely occupying political power.&nbsp; 
 



 
 <a href="https://internetlab.org.br/pt/noticias/como-enfrentar-a-violencia-politica-de-genero/" title="">InternetLab and Redes Cordiais</a> published a guide to help women candidates who face gendered political violence. <a href="https://mulheresnegrasdecidem.org/" title="">Mulheres Negras Decidem</a>, a movement working to strengthen Brazil’s democracy by supporting Black women in politics, wrote a <a href="https://mulheresnegrasdecidem.org/guia-de-cuidados-digitais/" title="">Digital Care Guide</a> to support activists and politicians and Coalizão Direitos na Rede and <a href="https://codingrights.org/en/" title="">Coding Rights</a> published this mini <a href="https://www.marialab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/eleicoesinternet-2.pdf" title="">digital protection guide for elections</a>. 
 



 Central America and&nbsp;the Dominican Republic 



<p><a href="https://www.ipandetec.org/proyectos/" title="">Ipandetec</a>, an organisation working in Central America and the Dominican Republic has done research monitoring online gender based violence against women in politics in <a href="https://www.ipandetec.org/investigacion/" title="">Panama, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica</a>. They also run <a href="https://www.segurasenlinea.ca/" title="">Seguras En Línea</a>, a project aiming to mitigate digital gender violence in Central America and the Dominican Republic.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.acceso.or.cr/" title="">Fundación Acceso</a> is working in Central America to promote digital security and holistic protection for organisations and people defending human rights. With <a href="https://www.acceso.or.cr/publicaciones/" title="">Observatorio Centroamericano de Seguridad Digital</a>, they’ve been analysing digital security incidents of human rights defenders and organisations in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, showing that violence against women human rights defenders is pervasive in the region.</p>



 Research covering Latin America&nbsp; 



<p>In 2022, the <a href="https://www.alianzaregional.net/" title="">Alianza Regional por la libre expresión e información</a> conducted an extensive qualitative study on online gender violence towards women with a public voice in Latin America and its impact on freedom of expression. They <a href="https://www.alianzaregional.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Informe_ViolenciaEnLinea-16Mar23.pdf" title="">gathered cases</a> from women in Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Colombia, Cuba, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, México, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela.</p>



 Support lines for digital security emergencies 



<p>If you need hands-on, emergency digital security support, there are a number of initiatives that can help you. Here are some of them:</p>



 
 <a href="https://acoso.online/" title="">Acoso.Online</a> has an online <a href="https://acoso.online/emergencia/" title="">emergency repository</a> sharing direct access to different materials with information on how to proceed in the face of gender based violence online. 



 Internet Bolivia has an <a href="https://sosdigital.internetbolivia.org/" title="">active support line</a> available for women, teenage girls, journalists, women in politics and activists, LGBTIQ+ persons who need support navigating gender based violence in digital spaces 



 Hiperderecho created <a href="https://hiperderecho.org/tecnoresistencias/" title="">Tecnoresistencias</a>, a space for women, dissent, diversity, and activists who resist gender violence on the internet. 



 <a href="https://vita-activa.org/" title="">Vita Activa</a> is a helpline providing online support and strategic solutions for women and LGBTIQ+ journalists, activists and gender, land and labour rights, and freedom of expression defenders. 



 <a href="https://mariadajuda.org/" title="">Maria D’Ajuda</a> is the first digital security helpline run by feminists in Brazil aimed at women, non-binary people, LGBTQIAP+ and organisations in Latin America. 



 <a href="https://luchadoras.mx/" title="">Luchadoras</a>, in Mexico, has a helpline to support people experiencing gender-based violence online. 



 Access Now’s <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/help/" title="">Digital Security Helpline</a> works with individuals and organisations around the world to keep them safe online.&nbsp;

<p>89% of IT leaders expect passwords will represent less than a quarter&nbsp;of their organization’s logins within five years or less</p>



<p>CARLSBAD, California and BOSTON, Massachusetts – October 16, 2023 – The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> and <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastpass.com%2F&amp;esheet=53518663&amp;newsitemid=20230809614908&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=LastPass&amp;index=1&amp;md5=77c9b141f704e56ec2c9543ec95bc3d7">LastPass</a> released the 2023 Workforce Authentication Report today, which gauges IT decision makers’ attitudes and plans for removing passwords in favor of easier and more secure passwordless authentication. The verdict? Businesses are actively moving to eradicate passwords from employees’ lives, with 89% of surveyed IT leaders expecting passwords to represent less than a quarter of their organization’s logins within five years or less.</p>



<p>Top findings from the 2023 Workforce Authentication Report:</p>



 
 Businesses are ready to embrace a passwordless future, with 92% having a plan to move to passwordless technology and 95% currently using a passwordless experience at their organization.&nbsp; 



 Businesses believe passkeys will help make them more secure: 92% believe passkeys will benefit their overall security posture, and 93% agree that passkeys will eventually help reduce the volume of unofficial (i.e., “Shadow IT”) applications. 



 However, many recognize that work still needs to be done: A majority of businesses surveyed are still using phishable authentication methods, such as passwords (76%) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) (43%) when it comes to authenticating users within their organization.&nbsp; 



 The majority recognize that this transition will take time and education: 55% of IT leaders surveyed feel they need more education on how passwordless technology works and/or how to deploy it, and 28% cited concerns that users may be resistant to change or using a new technology. 



 When making this transition, businesses made it clear they want to choose where they store passkeys, with 69% of IT leaders anticipating storing them in a third-party password manager.&nbsp; 
 



<p>“The move towards passwordless authentication has gained steam over the past few years as an increasing number of organizations have moved to eliminate the risk and liability of passwords as they are the source of the vast majority of data breaches,” said Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “Today’s report backs up this trend by illustrating that global IT leaders are rapidly aiming to reduce their reliance on legacy forms of authentication in favor of passkeys for user-friendly, phishing-resistant sign-ins.”</p>



<p>“These survey results demonstrate that businesses are excited about the prospect of a passwordless future, and all the benefits that future will bring. And the clear majority also recognize that a password manager plays an important role in that future,” said Mike Kosak, Senior Principal Intelligence Analyst at LastPass. “While the adoption of passwordless authentication will take some time and coaching, LastPass is proud to support forward-thinking leaders like these on that journey – ushering their organizations toward security that is stronger and more effortless than ever.”</p>

 Phishable authentication methods rely on knowledge-based factors or other factors that can be intercepted by a malicious party. Phishable authentication methods include passwords, one-time passwords (OTPs), and SMS OTPs. 
 



<p>About the FIDO Alliance<br>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance,&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3675645-1&amp;h=118128989&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fidoalliance.org%2F&amp;a=www.fidoalliance.org">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3675645-1&amp;h=1704427835&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ffidoalliance.org%2Fspecifications%2F&amp;a=standards">standards</a>&nbsp;for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords.

<p>Increased desire for biometrics and awareness of passkeys increases imperative on service providers to enable stronger, more user-friendly sign-ins</p>



<p>Summary of key findings:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Password usage without two-factor authentication (2FA) is still dominant across use cases – consumers enter a password manually nearly 4 times a day, or 1,280 times a year 



 But when given the option, users want other authentication methods – biometrics is both the preferred method for consumers to log-in and what they believe is most secure, while awareness of passkeys continues to grow 



 Online scams are becoming more frequent and more sophisticated, likely fuelled by AI – over half (54%) have seen an increase in suspicious messages and scams, while 52% believe they have become more sophisticated 



 The impact of legacy sign-in methods is getting worse – the majority of people are abandoning purchases and giving up accessing services online – this is 15% more likely than last year at nearly four times per month per person 
 



<p>October 16, 2023 – <a href="http://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> today publishes its third annual <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/barometer-2023/">Online Authentication Barometer</a>, which gathers insights into the state of online authentication in ten countries across the globe. New to the Barometer this year, FIDO Alliance has also begun tracking consumer perception of threats and scams online in a bid to understand anticipated threat levels globally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key findings&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2023 Online Authentication Barometer found that despite widespread usage of passwords lingering on, consumers want to use stronger, more user-friendly alternatives. Entering a password manually without any form of additional authentication was the most commonly used authentication method across the use cases tracked – including accessing work computers and accounts (37%), streaming services (25%), social media (26%), and smart home devices (17%). Consumers enter a password manually nearly four times a day on average, or around 1,280 times a year. The only exceptional scenario to this trend was financial services, where biometrics (33%) narrowly beat passwords (31%)* as the most used sign-in method.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is especially interesting considering biometrics’ rising popularity as an authentication method. When asked what authentication method people consider most secure and the method they most prefer using, biometrics ranked as favourite in both categories, rising around 5% in popularity since last year. This suggests that consumers want to use biometrics more but don’t currently have the opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This year’s Barometer data showed promising signs of shifting consumer attitudes and desire to use stronger authentication methods, with biometrics especially proving popular. That said, high password usage without 2FA worryingly reflects how little consumers are still being offered alternatives like biometrics, resulting in lingering usage,” commented Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CMO at FIDO Alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scams are getting more frequent and more sophisticated – likely fuelled by AI&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year’s Barometer also unearthed consumer perception of threats and scams online. 54% of people have noticed an increase in suspicious messages and scams online, while 52% believe these have become more sophisticated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Threats are seen to be active across several channels, but primarily email, SMS messages, social media, and fake phone or voicemails. The increased accessibility of generative AI tools is a likely driver of this rise in scams and phishing threats. Tools like FraudGPT and WormGPT, which have been created and shared on the dark web explicitly for use in cybercrime, have made crafting compelling social engineering attacks far simpler, more sophisticated, and easier to do at scale. Deepfake voice and video are also being used to bolster social engineering attacks, tricking people into thinking they are talking to a known trusted person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar added: “Phishing is still by far the most used and effective cyberattack technique, which means passwords are vulnerable regardless of their complexity. With highly accessible generative AI tools now offering bad actors the means to make more convincing and scalable attacks, it’s imperative consumers and service providers listen to consumers and start to look at non-phishable and frictionless solutions like passkeys and on-device biometrics more readily available, rather than iterating on ultimately flawed legacy authentication like passwords and OTPs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys, which provide secure and convenient passwordless sign-ins to online services, have grown in consumer awareness despite still being live just over a year, rising from 39% in 2022 to 52% awareness today. The non-phishable authentication method has been publicly backed by many big players in the industry – <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-password/">Google recently announced that passkeys are now available for all its users</a> to move away from passwords and two-step verification, as has <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213305">Apple</a>, with other brands like PayPal also making these available to consumers in the last twelve months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impact of legacy sign-ins worsens for businesses and consumers&nbsp;</p>



<p>The negative impact caused by legacy user authentication was also revealed to be getting worse. 59% of people have given up accessing an online service&nbsp; and 43% have abandoned a purchase in the last 60 days, with the frequency of these instances rising year on year to nearly four times per month, per person, up by around 15% on last year. Poor online experiences are ultimately hitting businesses’ bottom lines and causing frustration among consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>70% of people have had to reset and recover passwords in the last two months because they’d forgotten them, further highlighting how inconvenient passwords are and their role as a primary barrier to a seamless online user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ENDS</p>



<p>Notes to editors:</p>



 
 Research for the FIDO Alliance’s Online Authentication Barometer was conducted by Sapio Research among 10,010 consumers across the UK, France, Germany, US, Australia, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, India and China. 



 *The answer option “Logging in via social sign-in” has been disregarded for the question specific to social media accounts, due to the answer option being included through an error&nbsp;

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee – APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Welcome</p>



<p>As we usher in the participants of Authenticate 2023, we aim to provide a snapshot of various corners of the globe. Today, we’re privileged to bring together our esteemed members—industry luminaries from Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Mainland China, Korea and Japan. Together, we’ll navigate the present landscape, confronting the challenges and celebrating the opportunities inherent in adopting phishing-resistant authentication methods across APAC.</p>



<p>Introducing Our Experts:</p>



<p>Khanit Phaton, Thailand: Senior Management Officer at ETDA</p>



<p>Karen Chang, Taiwan: VP at Egis Technology / Chair of FIDO Taiwan Forum</p>



<p>Simon Trac Do, Vietnam: CEO &amp; Founder at VinCSS</p>



<p>Henry Chai, Mainland China: CEO at Uni-ID Technology, Lenovo / Co-Chair of FCWG</p>



<p>Jaebeom Kim, South Korea: Principal Researcher at TTA / Sub-Group Leader of FKWG</p>



<p>Masao Kubo, Japan: Manager, Product Design Department at NTT DOCOMO</p>



<p>Crafting an inclusive approach to online authentication in Thailand</p>



<p>Joon: Given Thailand’s rich diversity in many aspects, how does this influence the approach to and adoption of new online authentication systems for its citizens?</p>



<p>Khanit: As online services have become primary channels and gained popularity among the Thai population, coupled with the increasing number of cybersecurity threats, it’s crucial for both the public and private sectors to address this issue. Secure authentication is a key consideration. Given our diversity in aspects like culture and socioeconomic status, it’s essential to adopt an approach that’s inclusive and accessible for all. We’re exploring various methods for authentication; for instance, the Thai government’s introduction of the ThaID digital ID system, which utilizes both facial and fingerprint recognition, ensuring robust accessibility for all citizens. Meanwhile, Fintech companies and banks are developing mobile banking apps tailored to a wide range of mobile devices, incorporating online face verification services.</p>



<p>Reflecting on Taiwan’s recent strides with FIDO</p>



<p>Joon: Taiwan has showcased impressive FIDO deployment cases in recent years. Karen, as the chair of the FIDO Taiwan Regional Engagement Forum, can you offer insights on this journey?</p>



<p>Karen: The FIDO Taiwan Regional Engagement Forum (FTF) was formed in 2021, with members spanning IC chip, device, software, system, and application services. As of August 2023, we boast over 25 members and 80 FIDO-certified products. The government’s role in adopting and promoting FIDO standards cannot be understated. The Ministry of Interior joined the FIDO Alliance in 2020 and launched the Taiwan FidO (TW FidO) service. By September 2023, TW FidO was integrated into more than 170 government department systems, encompassing a wide array of services. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) also emphasized the “Research and Development of Standardized Financial Mobile Identification Mechanisms” in the Financial Technology Development Roadmap released in 2020, known as “Financial FIDO”. This allows users to bind their mobile devices with physical financial cards, eliminating the need for traditional physical cards or account/password logins. Several financial institutions are currently piloting this Financial FIDO initiative. Established in August 2022, the Ministry of Digital Affairs (moda) joined the FIDO Alliance in January 2023. Moda has been actively promoting international digital trust standards, like FIDO User Authentication and W3C Decentralized Identifiers, to industries like e-commerce, telecom services, online gaming, semiconductors, and manufacturing, ensuring a seamless and secure authentication experience. In many Asian countries, directives or guidelines from public organizations play a pivotal role in positioning a nation at the forefront of technology adoption. Today, it’s FIDO’s moment. I believe the FTF is on the right trajectory, and FIDO’s popularity is set to soar.</p>



<p>Vietnam’s Path to Simpler and Stronger Online Authentication</p>



<p>Joon: With many members in Vietnam being relatively new to the FIDO Alliance, how do you assess Vietnam’s readiness and the challenges it faces in adopting simpler and stronger online authentication methods?</p>



<p>Simon: Vietnam, like other nations, grapples with an intensifying phishing crisis that poses significant risks to users, agencies, and organizations. Although there are initiatives in place, such as the Anti-Scam Center, which aims to counteract these threats promptly and take down scam sites, their effectiveness is somewhat curtailed due to manual operations and heavy reliance on user awareness. On a brighter note, an increasing number of Vietnamese entities are engaging in the FIDO Alliance’s drive to minimize password reliance. Leading the charge in this passwordless movement in Vietnam are tech frontrunners like VinCSS and MK Group.</p>



<p>Mainland China’s Digital Landscape: Balancing Scale and Security</p>



<p>Joon: Mainland China has one of the largest digital user bases in the world. What unique challenges does this present when considering the adoption of novel simpler and stronger online authentication methods?</p>



<p>Henry: Indeed, in Mainland China, the sheer size of our digital user base brings about unique considerations. For any new security technology to be deployed, there’s an imperative need to consider the diversity in device capabilities. This ensures an optimal user experience for all, especially during the earlier times, before 2019, when not all smartphones were FIDO-enabled. During that period, any deployment of FIDO had to ensure that every user, regardless of their device’s capabilities, had a viable authentication alternative. Additionally, while authentication is a foundational layer, its adoption must align with business returns. When weighed against traditional, albeit less robust, authentication methods such as SMS and OTP, the decision to transition to FIDO becomes multifaceted. In many cases, the end solution is a mix of methods, balancing compatibility with business benefits. Presently, over 90 banks in Mainland China have adopted FIDO technology, and we anticipate this number to grow across different sectors soon.</p>



<p>Discussing South Korea’s technological advancements</p>



<p>Joon: South Korea is renowned for its advanced technological infrastructure. Jaebeom, how does this influence the nation’s approach to adopting new online authentication methods?</p>



<p>Jaebeom: It’s imperative for our country to integrate new authentication methods to facilitate seamless online identity verification for the public. In this quest, the South Korean government and associated agencies prioritize two critical aspects:</p>



<p>Technical Standards and Service Guidelines: We aim for consistent user experiences across platforms, irrespective of the service providers involved. This demands clear technical standards and robust service operation guidelines.</p>



<p>Legal Framework: Many online services require a solid legal basis for identity verification. Thus, legislative amendments and continued dialogues across the private sector, government, and academia are essential to formulating appropriate legal frameworks. Even if it is time-consuming, this step is indispensable. While our focus leans towards new online authentication methods, it’s equally important to ensure stability in both legacy and new systems, guaranteeing that all citizens can access online identity verification without hitches.</p>



<p>Japan – On the rise and acceptance of passkeys</p>



<p>Joon: Given the unified efforts of the FIDO Alliance Japan Working Group and its members, Japan leads in passkey deployments. Kubo-san, can you discuss the current trend and acceptance of passkeys in Japan?</p>



<p>Kubo-san: This year, I’ve observed several RPs deploying synced passkeys. While some organizations have long supported FIDO technology and embraced synced passkeys, others began their FIDO journey with synced passkeys only in 2023. This dynamic suggests that the momentum for passkey deployment is only set to accelerate. From a user perspective, awareness of passkeys is gradually heightening in Japan. Tech enthusiasts frequently discuss passkeys on social media, and according to Google Trends, search queries related to passkeys have surged. We’re in the early stages of a passwordless era in Japan, and I eagerly anticipate the broader acceptance and deployment of passkeys.</p>



<p>Delving deeper into phishing-resistant solutions in Thailand</p>



<p>Joon: Khanit, how can Thailand ensure that its authentication strategy remains robust and beneficial for online users? Would adopting phishing-resistant authentication solutions be advantageous?</p>



<p>Khanit: To bolster online security, Thailand has undertaken multiple strategies. We’re raising awareness through collaborative efforts with global bodies like the FIDO Alliance and defining digital ID standards that embed secure identity proofing and authentication methods. This lays down a foundational benchmark for users and service providers alike. Additionally, we’ve amended the Electronic Transaction Act to clearly delineate the responsibilities of service providers in guaranteeing authentication security and quality. Undoubtedly, integrating phishing-resistant authentication solutions, which use cryptographic techniques over vulnerable methods like PINs or passwords, would be a strategic advantage. Such solutions inherently offer heightened protection against phishing threats and pose a more formidable challenge for attackers compared to conventional methods.</p>



<p>Discussing Taiwan’s firm stance on cybersecurity</p>



<p>Joon: Could you provide an overview of the cybersecurity landscape in Taiwan and identify any notable trends?</p>



<p>Karen: In Taiwan, the zero-trust network security approach has become a pivotal national strategy. The sixth “National Information Security Development Plan (2021-2024)” was announced in February 2021, advocating for the Zero-Trust Architecture across government agencies and industries. The Taiwanese government has mapped out a comprehensive plan for implementing the zero-trust architecture, piloting validation and deployment mechanisms in 2021-2022. Central to this plan are three core mechanisms: identity authentication, device authentication, and trust inference. We place a significant emphasis on multi-factor authentication mechanisms that leverage the FIDO2 standard, allowing passwordless logins using physical security keys or mobile apps. By the end of August 2023, 12 vendors had cleared the government’s Zero Trust Architecture Identity Authentication Compliance Program. All these vendors deploy FIDO-certified solutions for user authentication. In 2023, numerous government agencies and businesses adopted this zero-trust framework in collaboration with these vendors. By incorporating phishing-resistant user authentication mechanisms, like FIDO’s standards, we have enhanced the security of online services, spanning national critical infrastructure, government services, and key industries. Moreover, FIDO’s certification program fosters trust between service providers, vendors, users, and the general populace.</p>



<p>Reflecting on the importance of FIDO certifications in Korea</p>



<p>Joon: Over the years, FIDO’s certification programs have been instrumental in globally promoting standardized technology adoption. Jaebeom, given that Korea is seen as an early FIDO authentication adopter, can you share your observations?</p>



<p>Jaebeom: Authentication essentially certifies a product’s fitness for its intended purpose, which means it’s more about validating product quality than being a mere badge of honor. As new technologies emerge and mature, the relative importance of certification programs wanes. This is primarily due to the initial imperfections in technology specifications and the lack of testing tools and products during the nascent stages. Certification programs then play a crucial role in harmonizing standards, products, and policies while ironing out these issues. As technology matures, these initial challenges are naturally addressed through iterative processes, and certification programs fulfill their designated roles more organically.</p>



<p>Lessons from Early FIDO Adopters: Mainland China</p>



<p>Joon: Henry, as the Co-Chair of one of the very first regional working groups, what insights can you offer the audience regarding early FIDO adoption, ecosystem cultivation, and so on?</p>



<p>Henry: FIDO is a novel authentication technology with clear benefits in security and user experience, but it also requires consumer devices like smartphones to be compatible. It takes time for the whole ecosystem to gradually embrace FIDO and incorporate its capabilities. The FIDO China Working Group collaborated closely with domestic phone OEMs in Mainland China to promote the FIDO concept and accelerate its implementation on devices. Simultaneously, we worked with the FIDO Alliance to establish the world’s first accredited certification lab at CAICT, Mainland China.</p>



<p>Recap of the FIDO APAC Summit 2023 – Vietnam</p>



<p>Joon: Simon, you co-hosted the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/event/fido-apac-summit-2023/">FIDO APAC Summit 2023 in Vietnam</a> back in August successfully. Can you reflect on the event and share any insights or observations you took away from the experience?</p>



<p>Simon: The inaugural FIDO APAC Summit 2023 truly exceeded our organizing committee’s expectations. Drawing a diverse crowd with over 300 attendees spanning 12 countries, it was heartening to witness such a convergence of perspectives and expertise. With 29 eminent speakers from diverse sectors, the summit facilitated rich discussions, paving the way for meaningful collaborations. A particularly noteworthy highlight was Vietnam’s Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC) joining the ranks as the 10th government-level member of the FIDO Alliance, underscoring our collective dedication to elevating digital authentication standards. This resonated beyond the venue, with our summit receiving comprehensive media coverage across multiple prestigious platforms. Having proudly co-hosted this foundational event, VinCSS is eager to continue endorsing, supporting, and championing its future iterations, as we envisage it becoming a cornerstone event in the APAC digital landscape.</p>



<p>Envisioning the collective journey with FIDO in APAC</p>



<p>Joon: Looking at the broader APAC region’s push towards harmonized phishing-resistant online authentication, how do you view the role and contributions of FIDO Alliance members?</p>



<p>Kubo-san: For years, our collective aim has been to realize a phishing-resistant, passwordless world through FIDO. But achieving this vision is not a solitary endeavor. It requires collaboration with diverse stakeholders to foster a world where everyone recognizes and effortlessly uses passkeys. FIDO alliance members can spearhead this initiative by sharing their deployment experiences and persuading yet-to-adopt service providers. Additionally, a joint effort is required to amplify consumer awareness and understanding of passkeys. FIDO technology, especially passkeys, boasts a remarkable retention rate. Once users experience it, they appreciate its intuitive usability. Therefore, it’s imperative for us, as proponents of passkeys, to emphasize that FIDO isn’t just about phishing resistance—it’s also about enhancing user experience. And that’s not just a marketing spiel—it’s the reality.</p>



<p>Closing</p>



<p>To every attendee of Authenticate 2023 reading this, we extend our heartfelt gratitude for your dedication to making online authentication simpler and stronger. As we navigate this ever-evolving domain, we warmly encourage you to continue these conversations by connecting with the FIDO members featured in this dialogue, ensuring our collective discussions remain fruitful and dynamic.</p>

Nominations from those organisations involved in kaupapa Māori, civil liberties and business and service sectors are especially encouraged. We also encourage suggestions from young people within your organisations, as the viewpoint of young people is extremely essential and relevant to the work we perform. As an NZTech Association, Digital Identity NZ adopts its Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy which&nbsp;you can read&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6cd211649fd1d09c759c0112f&amp;id=747df7db4d&amp;e=de1fb60f09">here</a>.</p>

<p>Technologies often experience what is called an “adoption S-curve”,&nbsp; a <a href="https://www.stratechi.com/adoption-curves/">model</a> on how innovation spreads through a population over time.&nbsp; They struggle through an initial period of low adoption, gain traction as they resolve their primary challenges, and finally saturate the market. The steepness and length of the curve can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the technology and societal readiness. <a href="https://elastos.dev/">Elastos</a> represents a comprehensive attempt at decentralising not just financial transactions but the entire internet experience, from how we communicate to how we control our digital assets. It’s built to facilitate the creation of decentralised applications (dApps) that run on a network of peer-to-peer nodes rather than centralised servers.</p>
<p>When we each found out about Elastos, we were inspired to be a part of something meaningful. Individuals globally should have sovereignty over their data. Communication channels should be secure and free from unauthorised surveillance. Ownership and transfer of digital assets should be clear and indisputable and economic systems should fairly reward contribution and value generation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Converging external factors—ranging from technological advancements and data growth to economic inequalities and global interconnectedness—are amplifying the need for Elastos to enhance human agency, the capacity to make choices, and the ability to exercise control over one’s digital environment. Inflection points arise when a unique confluence of factors disrupt existing feedback loops or create new ones. This is not possible without perseverance to persist in actions that are aligned with achieving specific goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of everyone’s hard work over the past 5 years, Elastos is reaching a moment where we can show its vision in unison, and the world feels increasingly more ready for it, a breakthrough moment. As ecosystem teams and the community work hard to move us into this new paradigm, effective exchange of information is crucial. Official communication channels serve as the primary means of circulating accurate and timely information to both internal and external stakeholders. Managing official publications and socials allows for a unified messaging strategy that represents the brand identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a testament to our increasing technological power, 12 community-elected individuals under the <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/">Cyber Republic Council</a>—who operate on one of Elastos’ dedicated, decentralised identity blockchains with transparency and traceability—voted our team, Infinity, to represent Elastos’ communications and maintenance. You can read our on-chain proposal <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals/65174f5bfbb72400849f38df">here</a>&nbsp;and learn more about us and our goals. Starting today, we will provide professional publishing and maintenance across Elastos channels. We will represent the community; we come from the community; we understand the technology; and we are fully aware of the responsibility and professional representation Elastos needs. Here is our team;</p>
<p>Team Infinity</p>
 
 Team Lead: Ahmed, CRC Council Member and Elastos Guardian, oversees the entire operation, coordinates the team, and ensures alignment with strategic objectives. Also responsible for external communication and comprehensive proofreading. 
 Writer/Editor: Sash, CRC Council Member and CEO of Elacity writes and edits articles, collaborates on content strategy, and ensures SEO optimisation. 
 Graphic Designer: Napatr, Web3 Graphic and UI/X Designer creates visual elements that align with the Elastos brand, and content strategy. 
 Social Media Manager: Remedy, active since 2018, continues to manage and curate content across various social media platforms, including captioning and headline writing. 
 Technical Support Advisor: Mbutcho, CRC Council Member and Elastos Guardian, maintains the technical aspects of the Elastos.info website, ensuring it is functional, secure, and up-to-date. 
 
<p>We would like to thank all those who came before us for their high standard of work. These teams include CR News Team, CR Press Team, The Moderators, Info Team and Digerati; Elastos’ journey would not be the same without you. Infinity represents an unbounded or limitless quantity which can have a direction, positive or negative when discussing sequences or series. We will be transparent, educational, bold and collaborative. We are here to serve you, to work with ecosystem teams, to provide leadership and to listen to your feedback and support. Elastos is moving into the next phase of its adoption S-curve, it will be exciting, and our plan is to bring a new, refreshed approach to how we communicate and brand Elastos, starting now. Onwards. Upwards. Elastos!<br>
<br>
“Elastos SmartWeb has recently made significant progress, including a blockchain public chain, EVM-compatible sidechains, a W3C-compliant and EVM-compatible DID-specific sidechain, personal storage (Data Vault) required for network computers, decentralised public storage based on IPFS, personal micro-websites, and decentralised (Virtual Circuit) communication from person-to-person. In other words, Elastos SmartWeb has essentially completed the Internet computer vision. Thanks to the Elastos community and its dedicated developers.” — <a href="https://twitter.com/chen2rong2">Rong Chen</a>, Elastos Founder</p>

<p>New policy addresses how OASIS receives and responds to reported vulnerabilities</p> 


<p>Responsible investigation and reporting of known or potential software vulnerabilities is a crucial part of protecting systems and users from hacks and cyberattacks. While open standards are not typically sources of software vulnerabilities, we believe that OASIS should follow best industry practices and provide channels and processes for reporting and addressing possible flaws in the work of our technical communities.</p>



<p>In this spirit, the Board of Directors has approved and adopted the OASIS Vulnerability Handling &amp; Disclosure Policy (https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-vulnerability-handling-disclosure-policy/). The policy governs how OASIS committees and staff receive and address reports of potential flaws.</p>



<p>The companion Vulnerability Handling &amp; Disclosure Process (https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-vulnerability-handling-disclosure-process/) explains how the policy works in practice.</p>

 OriginTrail’s 1st DKG Conference brings together Internet, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain pioneers to harness trusted AI across industries DKGcon 2023: Fireside chat with Dr. Bob Metcalfe, Internet pioneer and Ethernet inventor, and Branimir Rakic, Co-Founder of the OriginTrail ecosystem, moderated by Ivan On Tech, Founder of Moralis&nbsp;Academy.<p><a href="https://dkgcon.origintrail.io/">The international DKGcon — Decentralized Knowledge Graph Conference</a> gathered pioneers in Internet and blockchain technologies, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI), in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on Monday, October 9, 2023. They discussed how to distinguish between credible and fictitious information and knowledge in the era of generative AI, and what is the role of new technologies in this (such as blockchain and decentralized knowledge graphs). They also discussed how these technologies will impact the economy and society in general in relation to&nbsp;AI.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekG1Bl-tCjc">DKGcon</a> the conference participants shared practical examples of how to create connected information and credible knowledge from fragmented data and how to connect this with generative AI for various purposes. They shed light on how these technologies are already changing the operations and businesses across various sectors — from supply chains, pharmaceuticals, construction, and consumer products, to education, media, and the metaverse.</p><p>The forefront of the conference was the open-source <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)</a> that has <a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Trace Labs</a> as core developers. Solutions based on OriginTrail DKG are breaking new ground in establishing digital trust, increasing transparency, optimizing business processes, enabling new ways of consumer interaction with products, as well as new ways of creating using advanced technologies such as blockchain, decentralized knowledge graphs, and&nbsp;AI.</p><p>The innovation, transformative nature, and effectiveness of the developed solutions are endorsed by global organizations such as the British Standards Institution, the World Federation of Hemophilia, GS1, the Supplier Compliance Audit Network (SCAN), and others. Together with Trace Labs, these organizations and other business partners, as well as members of the open-source OriginTrail community, also presented various solutions at the conference.</p><p>One of the distinguished speakers at DKGcon 2023 was Wes Levitt, Co-Chief Investment Officer at Alpha Transform Holdings, who shed light on the recently launched solution based on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ekG1Bl-tCjc?si=wTxohkIBe842BQ6e&amp;t=17820">OriginTrail Trusted Knowledge Foundation that brings trust to the financial industry</a>. This solution, called chatAnalyst.ai, is set to revolutionize how financial services companies can develop their business lines while eliminating the current AI solutions pitfalls by allowing financial businesses to access quality data with verifiable provenance.</p><p>While demoing the solution live Wes Levitt said, “If I’m an investment professional presenting to my investing committee I will get laughed out of the room if I say ‘I got the information out of a bot; don’t worry, for sure it’s correct’. My manager will expect me to have highly sourced content before making million-dollar investment decisions. In the case of chatAnalyst.ai we can see the source content of the answers provided by the chat interface. By going to the OriginTrail DKG Explorer we can easily explore the underlying documents and the on-chain activity of when it was stamped on blockchain which makes it immutable. Not only do we have the source content to confirm, but also the provenance of when it was put there. This solution will change the way financial analysts work immensely.”</p>Wes Levitt, Co-Chief Investment Officer at Alpha Transform Holdings, presenting chatAnalyst.ai, which is set to revolutionize how financial services companies can develop their business&nbsp;lines.<p>Another esteemed speaker at the conference was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ekG1Bl-tCjc?si=_SlnLKayp47M9ICa&amp;t=29311">Dr. Bob Metcalfe, Internet pioneer, and Ethernet inventor</a>, also the recipient of the Turing Award, often referred to as the Nobel Prize for Computing, who discussed: “The hunch is that a mixture of connectivity, decentralized knowledge graphs, and blockchains are converging. This convergence is important because it is going to help us with one of the biggest problems we have nowadays, which is the truth. All over the connectivity space people are having trouble deciding what is true. This is where the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) comes in; it feeds the truth to the AI systems we put on top of the&nbsp;DKG.”</p>Dr. Bob Metcalfe, Internet pioneer, Ethernet inventor, and the recipient of the Turing Award (Nobel Prize for Computing).<p>The day after the conference took on a more informal tone as all the speakers and conference attendees engaged in networking activities. Against the picturesque backdrop of the Ljubljana skyline, a special “proof-of-steak” picnic was organized, during which the esteemed guests were treated to a delectable culinary experience featuring dishes crafted from premium local ingredients.</p><p>At this gathering, participants had the unique opportunity to delve into the origin and background of products offered by a prominent Slovenian poultry producer, Perutnina Ptuj, and the Slovenian farm association, KZ Šaleška dolina. This exploration was made possible through the utilization of OriginTrail technology as the underlying framework. By simply scanning a QR code, attendees were able to unveil the narrative behind these products. They could literally “chat” with a product in a trusted manner, including ascertaining the farm of origin, exploring a variety of recipes for the meats, and discovering additional relevant information. This seamless and immersive experience was made possible by the integration of OriginTrail and GS1 Digital Link technologies, which have redefined the way consumers can interact with and gain insights into products.</p>New solution based on OriginTrail and GS1 Digital Link — users are chatting with a product in a trusted&nbsp;manner.<p>The topics discussed at the conference and the event itself garnered significant interest, even from the <a href="https://siol.net/posel-danes/novice/izobrazevanje-gradbenistvo-in-hrana-to-umetna-inteligenca-dela-ze-danes-617440#">Slovenian media</a>.</p><p>About OriginTrail</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by enabling a universe of AI-ready Knowledge Assets, allowing anyone to take part in trusted knowledge sharing.

             There are increasing efforts to promote and implement the use of UDI for medical devices in China, but the scale involved is challenging. 
     

 
             <p>In Shenzhen alone, three separate regulatory departments are involved (Shenzhen Administration for Market Regulation, Shenzhen Health Commission and Healthcare Security Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality).</p>

<p>Adding to the complexity in that in Shenzhen city there is a total of 1,549 medical device manufacturers (14,095 medical device SKUs), 75,975 medical device distributors and 5,780 healthcare providers. This means the medical device supervision and traceability chain is long and challenging. Shenzhen Administration for Market Regulation has established one data platform for UDI, collected data from two sources (suppliers and healthcare providers), in a project led by three departments.</p>

<p>Lovesh Harchandani from Dock presents their approach to anonymous credentials and dives in on the various predicates that can be proven in zero knowledge. In over 90 minutes of discussion, we cover what these cryptographic techniques are, how they enable several important use cases for digital identity credentials, and we stretch James Monaghan’s ability to keep up as interviewer by taking a look at the source code which makes it all possible! We show how various zero knowledge primitives we’ve built can be used in a modular fashion to solve real-world use cases. We cover privacy-preserving signature schemes, zero knowledge attribute equalities, range proofs, and verifiable encryption based on ZK-SNARKs, expressing arbitrary predicates as Circom programs and creating ZK proofs for them and blinded credentials (issuer is unaware of all attributes). For anyone interested in the technical underpinnings of this new frontier of digital identity, this episode is a must!<br></p>

<p>The Engine Room is among the initial cohort of 10 organisations that form the Global Network for Social Justice and Digital Resilience, an initiative supported by the Ford Foundation and <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/news-and-stories/news-and-press/news/ford-foundation-launches-first-global-south-network-to-strengthen-the-digital-resilience-of-civil-society/" title="publicly launched this week">publicly launched this week</a>. </p>







<p>The mission of the network is to ensure social justice organisations across the Global South can better leverage the benefits of technology while minimising its harms. Funding is provided for each member to work on strengthening their own tech capacity, as well as to provide technical support to civil society organisations in the contexts we work within.</p>



<p>We’re excited to be part of this initiative: In our work supporting organisations fighting for social justice around the world, we’ve seen that these groups need all the tools and support that they can get – especially from technical experts who also understand the contexts they’re working in, and who are dedicated to transferring technical capacities and knowledge. </p>



<p>A <a href="https://digitalresilience.network/" title="website built by network members">website built by network members</a> was launched alongside the official announcement – you can read more about the network (and <a href="https://digitalresilience.network/how-do-we-define-digital-resilience/">how we define digital resilience)</a> there, as well as stay up to date on our activities, news and reflections.  </p>



 What digital resilience means to us  



<p>For us, fostering digital resilience goes hand by hand with restructuring systems of oppression and promoting liberatory, justice-driven and sustainable technology ecosystems. </p>



<p>As our Deputy Director, Poala Mosso, <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/news-and-stories/news-and-press/news/ford-foundation-launches-first-global-south-network-to-strengthen-the-digital-resilience-of-civil-society/" title="">notes</a>: “Digital resilience holds equity at its core. It points to the ability of organisations to design digital ecosystems where everyone can participate in meaningful ways by keeping infrastructures human and environment-centered, safe, and adaptable to ever-changing contexts.”</p>

The impact, positive or otherwise, due to security vulnerabilities resonates across a spectrum far broader than one may intuit. While these best practices are borrowed during the development lifecycle, there needs to be a holistic framework for how security related concerns are dealt with.</p>

<p>Background</p>



<p>In the world of user-controlled digital credentials, one thing has become clear – it’s not a question of if these technologies will be adopted, but when. Decision-makers from both public and private sectors around the world are increasingly inclined to integrate digital credentials into their organisations and ecosystems.</p>



<p>Once the choice to adopt user-controlled digital credentials is set, a fresh challenge pops up: navigating the sea of standards and tech options out there. Diving into the technical details of specifications can be overwhelming, especially when trying to weigh business requirements and other contextual factors against the many options available. The mountain of documentation doesn’t help either. It’s all too easy to get swamped by the choices and feel lost. Plus, grasping the subtle differences and trade-offs between specifications can be quite the hurdle.</p>



<p>So, is there a solution to simplify the process of selecting credential exchange protocols? Can we make it easier for individuals to choose the right option based on their specific context and requirements?</p>



<p>The Credential Exchange Protocols Task Force</p>



<p>At the Internet Identity Workshop, IIW 36, held in April 2023, we called a session titled “Creating a Credential Exchange Protocols Comparison Matrix”.</p>



<p>The concept arose from the need to address a prevalent issue and the desire to develop something akin to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z4cYfjbbE-rABcfC-xab8miocKLomivYMUFibOh9BVo/edit#gid=1590639334">credential profile comparison matrix</a>, created by various contributors over the past year or so. The goal was to explore the possibility of achieving similar outcomes with credential exchange protocols. The session garnered significant interest, indicating a genuine commitment to advancing this effort.</p>



<p>To ensure a solid foundation for this initiative, we decided to find a home for it. The Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation emerged as the ideal host, thanks to its community of experts, its welcoming and open culture, and its alignment with our goals. This effort primarily aims to enrich documentation around ToIP Layer 3 Trust Tasks related to credential exchange, which are among the most discussed trust tasks today. For the vision of digital trust within the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP architecture</a> to be realised, we need to streamline the process for those building trust applications that rely on digital credential exchanges.</p>



<p>Consequently, a dedicated Task Force within the Technology Stack Working Group was founded: The Credential Exchange Protocols Task Force. This group convenes weekly with a shared goal of driving this crucial work forward.</p>



<p>What has the Task Force accomplished to-date?</p>



 
 Since forming the task force, we have created a first version of the comparison criteria for digital credential issuance and presentation protocols: 
 



CategoriesSub-categories1. Protocol Objective(s)A. Protocol Objective(s)2. Protocol GovernanceA. Specification Link and Versioning<br>B. Specification Status/Maturity<br>C. Specification Body<br>D. Open Source / Intellectual Property Rights3. FeaturesA. Architecture Model<br>B. Support for Additional Trust Tasks<br>C. Communications Context<br>D. Security<br>E. Privacy<br>F. Performance/Scalability Constraints<br>G. Initiation Mechanism(s)<br>H. Transport Mechanism(s)<br>I. Authentication<br>J. Identifiers Types Supported<br>K. Credential Formats Supports<br>L. Compliance to Data Privacy Laws<br>M. Static Endpoint Discovery Process<br>N. Dynamic Endpoint Support<br>O. Additional Features4. Use CasesA. Use Case Flexibility<br>B. Offline/Online Support<br>C. Designed for Mobile Device Use<br>D. Designed for Web Browser Use<br>E. Support for Cross-device Flows<br>F. Rigidity and Flexibility of Protocol5. AdoptionA. Technology Readiness Level (TRL)<br>B. Deployment Viability<br>C. Current Implementations<br>D. Education Requirements<br>E. Deployment Complexity<br>F. Implementation Standards



 
 The group has fully documented these four issuance protocols against the above comparison criteria: 
 



 
 ACDC 



 ISO 23220-3 



 Issue Credential v2 



 OpenID4VCI 
 



<p>Here’s a sneak peek at what the comparison matrix is looking like:</p>







<p>The first version of the documentation is available here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_KKQZmmNRnEME96fZCPbMW-TC9j0tQ-dVuk5zzKa8U8/edit#gid=1229620925">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_KKQZmmNRnEME96fZCPbMW-TC9j0tQ-dVuk5zzKa8U8/edit#gid=1229620925</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note that for the first version of the comparison matrix, we wanted to select a small number of protocols based on where the working group is seeing market demand. Since this effort is a lot of work, we also wanted to start small so that we could achieve a realistic version 1.</p>



<p>IIW 37</p>



<p>Because this effort was started by a session at the last <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a>, it made sense that we reconvene at IIW 37, this in October 10-12 at the Computer Science Museum in Mountain View, California.</p>



<p>During this event, we will call a session to provide an overview of the progress achieved so far. We will seek feedback from the community and implementers of digital credentialing infrastructure. This input is invaluable as it guides our task force toward the most beneficial direction for all stakeholders.</p>



<p>What are we working on next?</p>



 
 We will continue to refine the issuance protocols matrix. Our vision is to create a lightweight ‘cheat-sheet’ type of document, that will refer to further documentation underneath for anyone wishing to go deeper. 



 We will start working on documenting the presentation protocols against the same common set of criteria. 



 We want to start involving any architect or technical product owners that are decision makers or make recommendations on digital credential strategy, so that we can ensure that we’re creating a valuable document for them. 
 



<p>Want to get involved?</p>



<p>Our Task Force holds meetings every Wednesday at NA/EU: 09:00-10:00 ET / 15:00-16:00 CET. You can find the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Calendar+of+ToIP+Meetings/">calendar event here</a>. Please feel free to join our next meeting on October 18, 2023.</p>

<p>Founded in 2017 with a vision of empowering organizations and individuals with verified data, Dock has established itself as a pioneer in the <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identity?ref=blog.identity.foundation">decentralized identity</a> space. </p><p>Dock’s <a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Verifiable Credential platform</a> makes any data fraud-proof and instantly verifiable. It comprises the Certs API, the Certs no-code web app, an ID wallet, and a dedicated blockchain.</p><p>While the company’s decentralized identity solutions can be implemented for a variety of use cases, Dock is currently focused on identity verification, health and safety, finance, education, and workforce sectors.</p><p>Why Decentralized Identity Matters for Organizations and Individuals</p><p>In today's digital age, managing and safeguarding identity data is essential. For organizations, decentralized identity represents a transformative approach that enhances data security, improves compliance to data regulations, and reduces operational costs associated with traditional identity management by eliminating the manual verification of physical documents, which speeds up the verification process.<br></p><p>For individuals, decentralized identity enables people to move towards reclaiming control of their data, reducing the risks of data breaches, and simplifying their online interactions. </p><p>The State of Verifiable Credential Adoption<br></p><p>A <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Verifiable Credential</a> is a digital document that proves something about you, such as your identity, qualifications, or membership in a group. It's issued by a trusted source, like a school or government agency, and you can use it online to prove things about yourself. A variety of documents can be issued as Verifiable Credentials including educational certificates, driver’s licenses, passport, and professional licenses.<br></p><p>There is a global shift in the identity sector as private organizations and governments around the world are implementing digital identity initiatives. Examples include:<br></p>  <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/driving-licence/digital-driver-license?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Digital driver's license</a> projects (also known as mobile driver's licenses) are implemented in the US, Korea, UK, Australia, Denmark, and the Netherlands among others.  Electronic identification (eID) systems are becoming the standard in various parts of the world.  The total addressable market for reusable identity in 2026 is estimated to be somewhere between <a href="https://liminal.co/reports/market-opportunity-for-reusable-identity/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">$133B and $533B globally.</a> <br>  <p>These digital identity initiatives boost the demand for Verifiable Credentials because the technology enables users to prove their identity, qualifications, and claims securely in a privacy-preserving manner to efficiently access a variety of services and products. <br></p><p>How Verifiable Credentials Add Business Value</p><p>1. Reduced Organizational Costs<br><br>Merit Protocol is a platform that connects employers with financial service companies to enable employees to get better access to financial services. The company <a href="https://blog.dock.io/merit-protocol-and-dock-partnership/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">integrated Dock’s Verifiable Credential technology</a> to enable employers to issue fraud-proof credentials that can instantly verify employment history and income data. Alex Lyashok, Merit Protocol’s CEO and Co-Founder, anticipates that this will reduce the cost of the loan application process by up to ten times while preserving employees’ privacy.<br></p><p>In terms of reduced data storage expenses, when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlHBqssIMtM&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dock interviewed Marie Wallace</a>, the Managing Director and Digital Identity Lead at Accenture, she spoke about the benefits she experienced by using a decentralized data architecture with the implementation of IBM’s Digital Health Pass. Digital Health Pass was one of the biggest IBM projects she was involved in with the least number of issues, which she attributes to the decentralized data architecture. <br></p><p>Marie said, “We were issuing millions of these credentials and hundreds of millions of verifications, and our systems were super lightweight. You didn’t have these situations where you were concerned about servers going down or the internet glitching because that just never ever was an issue.” <br></p><p>2. Instant Credential Verification<br></p><p>Traditional verification processes often take days, weeks, or even months. In the US for example, thousands of <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2022/03/11/nurse-licenses?ref=blog.identity.foundation">nurses waited for months, often over 6 months</a> to get their nursing licenses after they completed their program as a result of delays in the verification and issuance processes. Verifiable Credentials enable healthcare employers to instantly verify credentials in seconds which can significantly speed up the hiring process.<br></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Hh9kq29bPSA?feature=shared&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dr. Wendy Charles from BurstIQ</a>, Dock’s customer, explained why she wishes more employers and training institutions would issue Verifiable Credentials. <br></p><p>She had to hire research staff with very specific qualifications and all of the resumes she looked at claimed these qualifications. Because there was no way she could really know if they had the right skills, sometimes she ended up hiring people that were ultimately unqualified. She said, “My greatest concern was that an unqualified person could harm their patients. If there were two candidates that had comparable presentations in their resumes and interviews, I would hire the one with verified credentials.” <br></p><p>3. Efficient Credential Issuance<br></p><p>SEVENmile, an entrepreneurial program in Australia that connects high school students with business owners to learn problem-solving techniques, used Dock to issue <a href="https://www.dock.io/use-case-sevenmile?ref=blog.identity.foundation">hundreds of digital graduation certificates</a> as Verifiable Credentials.<br></p><p>“At SEVENmile Ltd., we believe that the move to ownership of our personal data will help transform how the internet functions and how our data will be protected. We’re applying this philosophy by working with Dock to secure the credentials of students we train,” said Greg Twemlow, SEVENmile’s CEO.<br></p><p>4. Enhanced Privacy and Security With Fraud-Proof Credentials<br></p><p>Verifiable Credentials are designed to enhance privacy by giving individuals full control of their data. With decentralized identity, personal data is securely stored with the individual’s digital identity wallet rather than being scattered across multiple company databases. Users can choose who they share their identity with and to what extent. <br></p><p>Centralized databases are prime targets for hackers because they can access a large amount of user info at once. By decentralizing identity data, the "honeypot" effect is minimized, making large scale breaches less likely. <br></p><p>Gravity Training is a leading training provider of commercial work-at-height solutions in South Africa with international locations in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and India. The organization uses Dock to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1jUoQXNHFU&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">eliminate health and safety certificate fraud</a>. Fake health and safety certificates is a big problem in South Africa and creates a huge risk when companies hire unqualified people with high-risk construction work. <br></p><p>Before using Dock’s certification platform, the organization had to manually issue thousands of certificates, which took a lot of time and resources. Employers and inspectors had to contact the issuer directly to ensure the certificates were valid. With Dock, Gravity can now automate the issuance of thousands of fraud-proof certificates a year that can be instantly verified. <br></p><p>5. Enhanced Compliance<br></p><p>In an era where data privacy and security are essential, Verifiable Credentials can play a key part in an organization’s compliance toolbox, by providing a secure and standardized method for handling sensitive information.<br></p><p>While Verifiable Credentials alone don’t necessarily guarantee compliance, they can be used as a tool as part of a larger compliance program and it depends on how they’re implemented. For example, Verifiable Credentials makes it easier for BurstIQ to comply with data regulations including GDPR and HIPAA while <a href="https://www.dock.io/use-case-burst-iq?ref=blog.identity.foundation">making health data verifiable, secure, and portable</a>. <br></p><p>6. Interoperability<br></p><p>Interoperability ensures that our systems, services, and data can seamlessly connect and communicate with one another. In the context of credentials, this means that individuals, organizations, and institutions can exchange verified information and credentials across various platforms, applications, and systems without encountering compatibility issues. <br></p><p>Credentials that follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">W3C Verifiable Credential standard</a> are interoperable, which enhances efficiency, reduces friction, and unlocks new revenue streams for businesses. The international standard establishes a common language and framework for digital credentials.</p><p>Dock’s Involvement With DIF<br></p><p>Dock became a DIF member to support the important work of creating specifications that become standards. Different aspects of the technology are often changing and organizations are continuously collaborating to get alignment to enable more standardization in the industry. For example, there is a lack of standards around Zero-Knowledge Proof solutions and DIF is working towards aligning to BBS+ signatures as the format that is the most advanced towards standardization. <br></p><p>Dock CEO Nick Lambert said, “We joined the Decentralized Identity Foundation to be as closely aligned to international standards as possible as we implement solutions for a variety of use cases. Our membership helps us connect with a global network of experts. Together with DIF, we're driving innovation, setting global benchmarks, and ensuring the highest levels of data security for our clients.”</p>

<p>By Mark Haine &amp; Drummond Reed</p>



<p>This blog post is being published jointly by the ToIP Foundation and the OpenID Foundation because it addresses a key piece of the interoperability puzzle on which we collaborate to achieve our mutual missions. We hope it is an example of the increasing synergy we will need to achieve globally interoperable decentralized digital trust infrastructure.</p>



<p>A persistent goal of digital identity technology is to enable relying parties to reach the level of identity assurance they need to proceed with any specific interaction. Although there are many descriptions of “identity assurance levels”, such as the three levels defined in the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">NIST SP 800-63</a> series <a>(1)</a>, the goal itself is technology-independent, i.e., it remains the same no matter what technology is used to achieve it.</p>



<p>For the past three years, the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">eKYC &amp; IDA Working Group</a> at the<a href="https://openid.net/"> OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) has been working on a specification called OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance as an extension to<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html"> OpenID Connect</a>. This specification has had contributions from a wide range of countries and industries as well as multiple early implementations.</p>



<p>More recently, the verifiable credentials (VC) community has begun to discuss how digital wallets and VCs could convey the information necessary to achieve different levels of identity assurance. But they have not yet converged on the specifics.</p>



<p>Given the universal need for identity assurance, the underlying meaning of the terms we use should be the same regardless of the specific technology used to convey the assertions. That was exactly the conclusion reached by the OIDF<a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/"> eKYC &amp; IDA Working Group</a>. They decided to modularize the OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance draft, separating out the schema definition for an element called “verified_claims”. They realised that this JSON structure could be, in their words, “re-usable across many different contexts and application layer protocols including but not limited to OpenID Connect and Verifiable Credentials”. The separated schema definition will also be available to the newly formed <a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/">Digital Credential Protocols Working Group (DCP WG)</a>, that is working on OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance and OpenID for Verifiable Presentations drafts.</p>



<p>The new specification is called OpenID Identity Assurance Schema Definition. The schema it defines allows representation of the wide variety of semantics defined in different identity assurance standards such as NIST SP 800-63, ISO/IEC 29115, UK GPG45, and eIDAS. It includes a significant number of optional elements to allow for any depth of description (from minimised to very verbose) of the identity assurance level, process and evidence that underpin the digital identity in question.</p>



<p>This new specification reflects the advice of a recent white paper from the Open Identity Exchange (OIX) called<a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/networks/87/item.html?id=700"> Data Standards for Digital ID Interoperability</a>. Regarding international interoperability of higher assurance digital identity, it says:</p>



<p>“A single protocol independent data standard must be created. It must allow core ID information and evidence to be communicated consistently, regardless of the protocol used to securely exchange it (e.g.OIDC, Verifiable Credentials). The OIX view is that this should be based on the<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html#section-appendix.b"> OIDC for Identity Assurance</a> standard.”</p>



<p>The Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation welcomes this new specification and looks forward to reviewing and commenting because it fits perfectly into the goal of ToIP architecture: enabling universal interoperability of decentralized digital trust infrastructure, including digital wallets and VCs. Any standard that helps ToIP achieve this goal is a step in the right direction, especially one that addresses the real, quantifiable market need for faster, easier, stronger digital identity assurance.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the need for higher levels of identity assurance is a signal that a digital trust ecosystem is mature enough to need the governance tools and models such as the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/news/2022/02/01/the-toip-foundation-releases-its-first-official-governance-specifications/">ToIP Foundation has been developing</a> over the past three years. Policies that clearly specify the level of identity assurance required for a particular transaction—together with the digital wallets and credentials that can satisfy those policies—are the oil that can make the flow of commerce easier and faster for all participants.</p>



<p>The next step is for the OIDF to advance their suite of identity assurance specifications to the final approval stage. After this, market forces are expected to drive the development of a set of re-usable profiles of these standards that meet the needs of different digital trust ecosystems across many different industries and jurisdictions. At that point we should finally begin seeing the market traction for digital identity assurance, whether centralized, federated or decentralized, that has long been one of the holy grails of our industry.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In today’s digital age, a surprising portion of the world — <a href="https://2020.internethealthreport.org/slideshow-internet-health/#10">only half, according to Mozilla </a>— are considered to be online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, connectivity measures often only highlight basic access to the internet. Research has shown that <a href="https://a4ai.org/research/advancing-meaningful-connectivity-towards-active-and-participatory-digital-societies/">meaningful connectivity</a> – “a measure of whether someone can regularly access the internet on an appropriate device with sufficient data and a fast connection” – lags far behind official measures of internet connectivity. Urban internet users and men were found to be more likely to have access to meaningful connectivity, and those with access were found to have increased participation in online activities and political awareness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lack of meaningful connectivity is a hurdle faced by many civil society organisations globally, and from our work with a variety of organisations, we’ve noted a recurring challenge: the high cost of reliable internet and modern equipment. According to a <a href="https://connecthumanity.fund/digital-inequity-report/">survey by Connect Humanity and TechSoup</a>, while 95% of organisations recognise the internet’s importance, a substantial 78% feel limited by inadequate internet access and a lack of digital tools. This issue impedes many civil society organisations from <a href="https://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/are-barriers-to-digital-technology-preventing-civil-society-organisations-from-achieving-their-potential/">achieving their full potential</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of this, the pandemic exacerbated digital gaps, especially in areas like Latin America where marginalised groups, including Brazil’s indigenous communities, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-research-community-call-intersectional-approaches-to-data-and-digital-rights-advocacy/">were most affected</a>. A recent study by Derechos Digitales highlights how this lack of connectivity hinders access to fundamental rights like <a href="https://www.derechosdigitales.org/amazonia/">education, health, and freedom of speech</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognising these challenges fuels our commitment to helping to bridge the digital divide. We regularly interact with partners in regions with low connectivity and many times we find ourselves working from these regions as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we often resort to asynchronous work when working remotely, nothing can substitute a call when we need to discuss projects or share knowledge. For this reason, we’ve put together some guidance on what to do before and during calls that has helped us navigate these low connectivity issues over the years. We hope you find these useful and are open to hearing what else you’ve tried.</p>



 Tips for better calls in low connectivity situations  



 Before the Call 



 Make sure you have a good connection 



<p>Dealing with low internet connectivity can be frustrating, but there are several strategies you can try out before the call to increase your chances of having a successful call:</p>



<p>1. Check connection speed: Regularly test your internet connection speed using websites like www.speedtest.net. Ensure that your speed meets the minimum requirement of at least 8 Mbps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Adjust your router : Adjust your wifi router for better performance. Place it in the center of the room, on a table or shelf (not on the floor) to improve signal distribution. Keep the router away from electronic devices like televisions, telephones, and Bluetooth devices, as they can interfere with the signal.</p>



<p>3. Boost your wifi signal: Enhance your wifi router’s signal by wrapping the antenna with an empty aluminum can or empty Pringles container. The aluminum in the containers will help focus your wifi toward the selected direction, effectively boosting the strength of the signal. Cutting the top and bottom of the container allows for easy attachment to the antenna, boosting the signal’s range and strength.</p>



<p>4. Reboot your router: Reboot your router to prevent potential connectivity issues caused by continuous usage.</p>



<p>5. Optimise wifi Channel: Like radios, routers transmit your wifi connection over one of fourteen available channels which are determined by their frequency. Quite often, routers are preset to the same channel out the box which means many of your neighbors are also using the same one.&nbsp; To change the channel that your router uses, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/197268/how-to-find-the-best-wi-fi-channel-for-your-router-on-any-operating-system/">check for neighboring wifi networks</a> and switch your router’s wifi channel to one that isn’t being used by your neighbors. This reduces interference and can lead to a more stable connection.</p>



 Make sure your device is optimised 



<p>Sometimes connectivity issues are related to individual devices rather than the internet connection itself. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve device-related problems:</p>



<p>1. Check your Device Connection: Ensure that the device you are using to access the internet is <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/check-network-connection-status-of-wireless-devices-818268">properly connected to the wifi network</a> or Ethernet cable.</p>



<p>2. Update Software: Keep your devices, including computers and smartphones, up to date with the latest software and firmware updates. Updates often contain bug fixes and improvements that can enhance device performance and stability.</p>



<p>3. Clear Cache and Cookies: Over time, your devices’ cache and cookies can accumulate, slowing down internet performance. Regularly <a href="https://its.uiowa.edu/support/article/719">clear these temporary files</a> to optimise your browsing experience.</p>



<p>4. Optimise Device Settings: Adjust your device’s settings to prioritise internet performance. For example,when your internet connectivity is slow you can allocate more bandwidth to essential tasks by closing other apps that are using the internet.</p>



<p>5. Use a Backup Device: If your primary computer or device experiences issues, consider having a backup device that you can switch to temporarily while troubleshooting the problem.</p>



 During the call 



<p>1. Turn off video: Video generally requires more bandwidth than audio. In situations where your internet connection is low, it may be worth turning off your video to minimise the load on your internet connection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Optimise Device Usage: Limit the number of devices that are connected to your wifi. Temporarily disconnect devices that are not in use or that can go without a constant internet connection, such as smart TVs, tablets, and cell phones. This can free up bandwidth and improve overall connectivity.</p>



<p>3. Take shared notes: Using collaborative documents such as <a href="https://pad.riseup.net/">EtherPad</a> or Google Docs and keeping detailed notes as you go will make it easier for all call participants to follow the conversation, even if they get disconnected. Bonus: You can then share these same notes with others after the call!</p>



<p>4. Communicate more than usual: When cameras are off,&nbsp; you can’t see things like who enjoyed the joke, or simply who wants to speak. In those instances, we recommend making sure that people feel seen by <a href="https://www.trainingforchange.org/training_tools/low-bandwidth-strategies/">inviting them to share their thoughts and verbalizing what you’re seeing</a> on the screen or in the chat.&nbsp;</p>



 However&nbsp; 



<p>We firmly believe that the challenges of navigating poor connectivity and limited access to the internet should not solely fall on the shoulders of civil society. It’s unfair to expect social justice organisations to address these issues without support. In an ideal world, access to the internet would be considered a fundamental right, equitably available to all. However, until that vision becomes a reality, we are committed to sharing strategies and tips. We do this because we hold that every organisation, irrespective of its size or mission, deserves robust infrastructure. Such a foundation is essential for organisations to organise their daily work and operations effectively.</p>The post <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/ensuring-communication-for-social-justice-organisations-with-unstable-internet/">Ensuring Communication for Social Justice Organisations with Unstable Internet&nbsp;</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org">The Engine Room</a>.

 Highlights from Season 7 of The Tao of WAO&nbsp;podcast <p>We’ve recently wrapped the seventh season of our podcast where we explored the complex and ever-evolving world of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p>From ethical considerations and societal implications to the nuances of AI literacy, the season offered a comprehensive exploration that went beyond the technical jargon. Laura and Doug engaged in critical conversations that aimed to demystify this transformative technology, offering listeners a balanced perspective on its potential and pitfalls.</p><p>This blog post serves as a retrospective, highlighting key moments and insights from a season dedicated to understanding AI in all its dimensions.</p> Relevant links   <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/">Season overview&nbsp;page</a>  <a href="https://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:938068006/sounds.rss">RSS feed</a>  <a href="https://pod.link/1568662122">Pod.link</a> (provides links to subscribe via your favourite platform)   Episode 1 — Curiosity is&nbsp;Human <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e01-curiosity-is-human/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>We discuss concept of curiosity with guests Paul Ashcroft and Garrick Jones. The conversation explores the historical evolution of curiosity, its role in innovation, and its impact on emotional and physical well-being. The guests explore into how curiosity can be nurtured like a muscle and its significance in the age of AI and digital transformation.</p>  Paul Ashcroft: “Essentially you can hack your own biological system just by being curious.”  Garrick Jones: “It’s fascinating how I think the curious and the innovative were relegated to the ninth level of hell, which is the worst hell in Dante’s Inferno. And because they want to mess with the structures.”   Episode 2 – Credentials &amp;&nbsp;AI <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e02-credentials-ai/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Tim Riches and Omid Mufeed join us to discuss the evolution and future of Navigatr, a platform focused on skills recognition through Open Badges. They highlight the role of AI in simplifying the badge creation process and its potential to personalise learning pathways. The platform aims to bridge the gap between skills and employment opportunities, offering a live jobs feed linked to&nbsp;badges.</p>  Omid Mufeed: “Why can’t we have the technologies that tell us what to learn next to change our&nbsp;lives?”  Tim Riches: “It’d be great if you could just kind of switch the app on wherever you were…and it could start to show you things which just got you interested first and got you engaged in learning and then started to open up opportunities for&nbsp;work.”   Episode 3 — Cognitive Liberty <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e03-cognitive-liberty/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Laura and Doug tackle the ethical and societal implications of AI. They discuss its potential as a ‘thought partner’ in decision-making, the concept of cognitive liberty, and the risks of AI entrenching existing power structures.</p>  Laura Hilliger: “How do we ensure that people keep cognitive liberty if they’re being manipulated by these algorithms or by&nbsp;AI?”  Doug Belshaw: “Our democratic and civic infrastructure is being replaced by decision-making tools which are beholden to a small&nbsp;elite.”   Episode 4 — Public Service and&nbsp;AI <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e04-public-ai/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Matt Jukes comes on the podcast to discuss his career journey, which spans various roles in the public sector, including his current (at the time) position at the Office for National Statistics. He talks about the challenges of digital transformation in the public sector, emphasising the importance of user needs and data. Matt also shares his views on leadership, AI, the role of blogging, and the need for a supportive culture to drive&nbsp;change.</p>  Matt Jukes: “Ministers particularly are fascinated with [AI] and are pushing departments and and digital teams and their policy people across every corner of government to to see how it can be&nbsp;used.   Episode 5 — Workforce development <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e05-workforce-development/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Prof. Krystal Rawls joins to advocate the importance of community involvement in technology adoption, particularly in bridging the digital divide. She emphasises that solving community issues is not just about providing devices but also about removing the fear of innovation and technology. Krystal argues for a more holistic, respectful approach to community needs, advocating for the use of AI and other technologies as tools for empowerment. She also touches on the ethical considerations of technology adoption, stressing the need to respect different cultures and perspectives.</p>  Krystal Rawls: “And so from my lens, things as simple as right, I have to train people on how to use this technology. How about I provide you with some prompts of AI and a training in AI and let you go and learn for yourself and interrogate for yourself the things that you need to know. And so I can be used in some really innovative ways to help close the digital&nbsp;divide.”   Episode 6 — AI&nbsp;Literacy <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e06-ai-literacy/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Doug and Laura wrap up the season by exploring the complexities of AI literacy, and emphasising the need for critical thinking and mentorship when interacting with AI tools. They discuss the limitations of AI, likening it to a “competent intern,” and discuss the ethical and societal implications of AI’s lack of transparency and potential for bias. The conversation also touches on the need for collective decision-making in AI governance and the importance of understanding the data on which AI models are&nbsp;trained.</p>  Doug Belshaw: “It’s interesting because one of the things that people have said is that it means that everybody gets a tutor now, but. Everyone doesn’t get a tutor as much as a research assistant.”  Laura Hilliger: “You know, when the when the printing press was was invented, it’s the time between the printing press being invented and like the masses being able to read because there is huge cultural and societal shift during like during these kind of in-between times. And I feel like with tech, we’ve been in that in-between time for 20, 30 years and with AI moving faster and faster, it feels like being web literate, information literate, media literate, tech literate, AI literate, anything that puts the literacy on it is, you know, is a it’s a moving target.&nbsp;Right?”   Next season <p>We’ve already begun recording Season 7 and are in the planning stages of Season 8, which will focused on Shaping a Media Literate Society: Exploring the Future Landscape of Media and Information Literacy.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shaping-media-literate-society-exploring-future-landscape/">Read more about Season 8&nbsp;here</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/a-deep-dive-into-the-ethics-literacy-and-application-of-ai-8536e1814017">A Deep Dive into the Ethics, Literacy, and Application of AI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>                <p>This lecture took place on 18 October 2023. </p>
<p>There is a growing unease about technology and its impact on our lives. Tech giants have grown too powerful. Our privacy is undermined. Social media is hurting our kids. Creators are not getting paid fairly. Disinformation and polarization are the norm.</p>
<p>While the solutions to these problems are largely human, (perhaps ironically) a new set of technologies can help to put us back on course: Blockchains, which enable individuals and businesses to move and store value, automate complex business processes are the first digital medium for value. AI is pushing the boundary of human and machine capability.  The Internet of Things connects everyday objects, robots and even self-driving cars to the web, forming an intelligent network for our connected world.  Augmented and virtual realities, extends our 2D web into a spatial web.</p>
<p>In this webinar, Alex Tapscott, author of the new book “Web3: Charting the Internet’s Next Economic and Cultural Frontier” explains how these technologies are not separate but related.  The Web is entering a new era and with it bringing a new internet and a new platform for the other technologies of a new digital age.   In much the same way as the term “Internet” has expanded from its original narrow inter-networking technical definition to describe an era that included many technologies, business models and social behaviors, so too is the term Web3 evolving to describe the next era with these technologies playing the defining role.</p>

<p>This article describes the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/post-mortem-ceramic-discord-breach/">problem of session hijacking</a> and how you can create a more secure session by combining <a href="https://login.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Sign-in with Ethereum</a> and non-extractable keys from the WebCrypto APIs.</p> The Problem <p>A session is established in essentially all applications where users sign in. These sessions typically rely on cookies, JWTs, or similar technologies. The way they are established is roughly as follows: a user arrives at an application and authenticates in some way, usually through signing in with a username and password. The application's backend server verifies the login and creates a valid session for the user.</p><p>The session itself is stored locally in the user’s browser as a cookie or JWT. Unfortunately, this client-side data can be stolen. This is normally referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking?ref=blog.ceramic.network">session hijacking</a>—and this exact attack recently caused a <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/post-mortem-ceramic-discord-breach/">breach of the Ceramic discord server</a>.</p><p>Session hijacking works when a hacker is able to intercept the user's JWT (or other session ID). They can then use this locally on their computer to fool the application backend server into thinking that they are in fact signed in as the user. Once they are signed in, they could take all kinds of malicious actions not approved by the user.</p><p>An unfortunate fact is that in many cases, Sign-in with Ethereum is also vulnerable to this because the suggested way sessions are established is <a href="https://docs.login.xyz/sign-in-with-ethereum/quickstart-guide/implement-sessions?ref=blog.ceramic.network">through cookies</a>. So, what can we do about this?</p> Non-Extractable Session Keys <p>The main problem with the sessions outlined above is that the data that authenticates the session can be stolen. What if there was a way to have a session where this information was impossible to copy? Well, in fact, the  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web Crypto API</a> provides provides such functionality. This API can (among other things) be used to generate cryptographic key pairs. By default, both the public and the private key for these key pairs live in memory on web pages, which wouldn't improve the situation at all.</p><p>However, the private key can be made “non-extractable” by setting the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CryptoKey/extractable?ref=blog.ceramic.network">extractable property</a> to false. This makes it impossible for any JavaScript code or browser extension to access the private key material, effectively making it impossible to steal it. These keys can also be persisted in your application by storing them in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API?ref=blog.ceramic.network">IndexedDB</a>.</p><p>It's worth noting that this solution is not perfect. If a malicious script somehow gets injected into the client, it may still use the user's key while they have their tab open. However, as soon as the tab is closed, the hacker could no longer use this key, which is a significant improvement from complete loss of a session.</p> How to use DIDSession <p>Ok, so how can we use this to make our Sign-in with Ethereum sessions more secure? <a href="https://did.js.org/docs/introduction?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DIDSession</a> is an open-source library that we created at Ceramic to make it easy to use non-extractable keys to secure Sign-in with Ethereum sessions. This library treats your Ethereum address as a <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network"><code>did:pkh</code></a>and the non-extractable session key as a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/?ref=blog.ceramic.network"><code>did:key</code></a>. A SIWE signature is used to delegate permissions from your Ethereum address to the session key. A server can then verify that a message originated from a session key that has been granted permissions from the Ethereum account. To use DIDSession, you first need to install it in your application.</p> Creating a session <p>First we create a session. The code below will prompt the user to sign a SIWE message and finally a session will be created. This session will automatically be persisted in IndexedDB.</p> <code>import { DIDSession } from 'did-session'
import { EthereumWebAuth, getAccountId } from '@didtools/pkh-ethereum'

const ethProvider = window.ethereum // Metamask, WalletConnect or similar
const addresses = await ethProvider.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })
const accountId = await getAccountId(ethProvider, addresses[0])
const authMethod = await EthereumWebAuth.getAuthMethod(ethprovider, accountId)

const session = await DIDSession.get(accountId, authMethod)
</code>  Sign a message and send to server <p>Using the session, the application can now sign any arbitrary message and send this message and the object-capability (SIWE message) along to a server. All signed messages will happen in the background without any further action required by the user.</p> <code>const jws = await session.did.createJWS({ hello: 'world' })

const request = {
  capability: session.did.capability
  jws,
}

// send the request object to your backend server
</code>  Validate user action on server <p>Once the request is received on a server, its signature can be verified; simply looking at the object-capability we can see which user took the given action.</p> <code>import { DID } from 'dids'
import * as KeyResolver from 'key-did-resolver'

const did = new DID({ resolver: KeyResolver.getResolver() })

const result = await did.verifyJWS(request.jws, { capability: request.capability })

console.log('User account:', request.capability.p.iss)
console.log('User action:', result.payload)
</code>  Benefit of Using Ceramic <p>While DIDSession can improve security of SIWE, when interacting with a backend server, we can take applications one step further by storing user data on a decentralized network. This is the reason we built Ceramic, and DIDSession is the native way to write data into the protocol.

		<p>Despite evidence of the positive impact of female participation in leadership roles of corporations, women remain consistently under-represented in business ventures, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. For the U.S. economy to expand and produce jobs at an accelerated rate, women must account for a much higher percentage of entrepreneurial leaders throughout all phases of the innovation life cycle. Female academicians face disproportionately low engagement in the technology transfer process, both in the initial invention disclosure submission as well as in the patenting process (1-4). This investigation sought to both establish a baseline for measuring U.S. academic institutions’ tracking of inventors by gender and gain insight about the barriers keeping technology transfer offices (TTOs) from tracking gender in commercialization-related areas. The researchers also conducted an initial analysis on the leading software tools currently being utilized to track gender in academic TTOs. Raising awareness of this issue on a national level will help institutional leaders create strategies and mechanisms to help address the issue of gender disparity and increase the inclusion of women in the innovation lifecycle, particularly at the university disclosure and patenting level.</p>

		<p>Diversity is a key driver of innovation and a critical component of success on a global scale. Countries that deploy strategies to foster greater inclusion of all inventors in the innovation lifecycle will ultimately be best positioned to maximize their gross domestic product and ensure economic prosperity. The U.S. is losing ground because it is not fully engaging a significant portion of the inventive talent pool. According to a 2019 report from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the share of women among all U.S. inventor-patentees is only 12.8%.<br>
In an effort to understand factors that encouraged and discouraged academic women’s participation in technology commercialization, a group of technology transfer professionals conducted a survey of academic women involved in innovation, invention and/or entrepreneurship. The 168 respondents were from public and private research institutions of varying sizes from all regions of the U.S. This paper outlines the key findings from the qualitative and quantitative data around the themes that emerged. It also puts forth a set of recommendations based on the survey feedback, follow-up interviews, and the collective experience of technology transfer professionals who work daily with academic innovators. It is our hope that these recommendations will provide valuable insights into concrete actions that can be taken to ensure systemic changes that foster greater engagement of academic women and other under-represented populations in all stages of the innovation lifecycle.</p>

<blockquote><p>NIST’s Digital Guidelines are respected and referenced throughout the world so why does New York leave open the potential for ambiguous technology implementations which could be based on standards which are not parallel with efforts to support RON?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Michael Magrath, Director of Identity Policy and Industry Relations, Easy Dynamics Corporation</p>
<p></p>
<p>New York State, the financial capital of the world, undoubtedly sits at or near the top of most cyber criminals’ “hit list”. But it has fallen short when it comes to recent regulatory acts pertaining to identity and authentication.&nbsp; Two recent actions in different departments are alarming during this age of deep fakes and nation-state cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Identity Proofing for Remote Online Notarization (RON)</p>
<p>While RON has been available for a few years, the pandemic was the catalyst for wider spread adoption and use throughout the U.S.&nbsp; New York is no exception and recently revised its RON regulation.&nbsp; On January 25th the New York Department of State amended Title 19 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR), Chapter V, Subchapter E, Part 182 as it relates to RON. Section 182.7.a reads, “Identity proofing must meet, at minimum, the Identity Assurance Level 2 standard as outlined in the Digital Identity Guidelines of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), as referenced in subdivision (b) of this section, or any industry accepted standard that is at least as secure, or more secure, than that standard.”</p>
<p>“Or any industry accepted standard at least as secure, or more secure, than that standard?”&nbsp; Huh?!! “Secure” according to which certification body?&nbsp; NIST’s Digital Guidelines are respected and referenced throughout the world so why does New York leave open the potential for ambiguous technology implementations which could be based on standards which are not parallel with efforts to support RON? In addition, unforeseen risk and exposure may occur due to lack of “uniformity” needed for both RON service providers and all relying parties.</p>
<p>Identity Assurance Level 2, commonly referred to as IAL2 is defined in NIST’s the Special Publication 800-63-3 suite of documents, specifically 800-63a, which is part of the SP 800-63-3 suite of documents last revised in 2017 and currently in the process of being updated.&nbsp; Federal agencies must comply with NIST’s guidance and over the years many state, county and local governments as well as commercial entities have embraced 800-63-3.&nbsp; Many have written 800-63-3 certification as a requirement for vendors into RFPs.</p>




<blockquote><p>Regulations should be “black and white”, as far as is possible.&nbsp; In the case of IAL2 for RON, black and white was possible, but NY regulators opted for gray leaving vendors, state agencies and commercial organizations with questions</p></blockquote>








<p>No doubt, the regulation caught the attention of all RON vendors given New York’s population and position in the financial industry.&nbsp; To date, states that have enacted laws permitting RON have for the most part written portions of MISMO’s RON standards into their laws, which have no requirement to comply with NIST’s IAL2. MISMO is short for the Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Organization, according to its Wikipedia entry, MISMO is “a not-for-profit, wholly owned subsidiary of the Mortgage Bankers Association responsible for developing standards for exchanging information and conducting business in the U.S. mortgage finance industry.”&nbsp; With all due respect to the MBA, RON laws and regulations should not be developed by a trade organization’s subsidiary.</p>
<p>Most vendors meet IAL2 by combining the scan of a government issued identity document such as a driver’s license or a passport, a bank statement or utility bill, with a selfie that can be checked for liveness. This provides assurance that it is really a live person’s face and not a recording or a mask that simply looks like someone else that is compared using biometric algorithms.&nbsp; The documents are also checked to be authentic and verified to provide confidence in the asserted identity’s validity.</p>
<p>Regulations should be “black and white”, as far as is possible.&nbsp; In the case of IAL2 for RON, black and white was possible, but NY regulators opted for gray leaving vendors, state agencies and commercial organizations with questions.</p>
<p>Proposed Amendments to the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Cybersecurity Regulation </p>
<p>The regulation, 23 NYCRR 500, places cybersecurity requirements on all Covered Entities (financial institutions and financial services companies).&nbsp; Last November, NYDFS <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/cybersecurity">proposed a second amendment</a> to 23 NYCRR Part 500 the regulation regarding cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies (the Second Amendment). After a public comment period, on June 28, 2023, a revised proposed Second Amendment was published in the New York State Register. Although the regulation still requires MFA, it is not so restrictive as to mandate a specific NIST Authenticator Assurance Level as defined in NIST’s Digital Identity Guidelines. Financial services organizations may select from a variety of authentication solutions.&nbsp; Under the proposed Second Amendment changes to multi-factor authentication (Section 500.1) include “Multi-factor authentication means authentication through verification of at least two of the following:</p>
 
 knowledge factors, such as a password, 
 possession factors, such as a token [or text message on a mobile phone]; or 
 inherence factors, such as a biometric characteristic” 
 
<p>Passwords?&nbsp; SMS?&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; At a time when federal agencies are mandated to implement zero trust and use phish-resistant authenticators (passwords, one-time password tokens and SMS are not), New York is amending a cybersecurity regulation to include phishable authenticators.&nbsp; Why do this when modern phishing-resistant authentication is available?&nbsp; Sorry New York. In 2023 no cybersecurity regulation pertaining to authentication should include passwords and SMS.</p>
<p>Due to security issues in 2017 NIST classified SMS OTP as a ‘restricted’ authenticator meaning organizations or users would be taking a risk using SMS as part of two-factor authentication, exactly how the proposed Second Amendment is written.&nbsp; Why take such a risk especially when we are talking about accessing financial systems? I would encourage the NYDFS to join the FIDO Alliance and Kantara Initiative.&nbsp; FIDO standards are mature and recognized and adopted across the world. Moreover, FIDO has a stringent product certification program and maintains a certified products list which will enable Covered Entities to procure phish-resistant authentication.</p>
<p>As with RON, NYDFS should leverage NIST’s Digital Identity Guidance – Special Publication 800-63B applies to Authentication and Lifecycle Management.&nbsp; As with enrollment and identity proofing, NIST has defined three authenticator assurance levels: AAL1, AAL2, AAL3.&nbsp; AAL1 does not require MFA (passwords are acceptable) and while AAL3 is per NIST, “is based on proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. AAL3 authentication requires a hardware-based authenticator and an authenticator that provides verifier impersonation resistance”, aka phishing resistant.</p>
<p>For some industries AAL3 may be too cumbersome. However for financial services, I would argue, AAL3 met with a FIDO certified security key would be appropriate.&nbsp; For many organizations, AAL2 is acceptable based on the level of risk should the account be compromised.&nbsp; Per NIST, “AAL2 occurs by the use of either a multi-factor authenticator or a combination of two single-factor authenticators. A multi-factor authenticator requires two factors to execute a single authentication event, such as a cryptographically secure device with an integrated biometric sensor that is required to activate the device.”</p>
<p>Trustmarks and Certified Products Differentiate the “Haves from the Have Nots” </p>
<p>NIST defines guidance but does not assess and certify vendors. &nbsp;The federal government no longer maintains an approved products list of credential service providers and instead recognizes Kantara Initiative, a globally recognized, non-profit certification body for NIST’s SP 800-63-3 under the Kantara Assurance Program.&nbsp; Kantara’s five-person Assurance Review Board (ARB) even includes a representative from NIST. &nbsp;The ARB is the body that reviews assessments and awards the 800-63-3 Trustmark to vendors.</p>
<p>I will note there is a distinct difference between a vendor claiming they meet IAL2 for RON or AAL2 or AAL3 in what I hope would be in the final version of the revised NYDFS cybersecurity regulation and being assessed and awarded a Trustmark.&nbsp; I have been employed by vendors that could claim that they technically met the IAL2 and AAL2 requirements but were never assessed or awarded a Trustmark.</p>
<p>Kantara’s Assurance Program goes well beyond technical requirements and includes non-technical requirements that vendors must first self-attest to and later provide evidence to a Kantara-accredited, independent, third-party assessor. They confirm that the service can actually do what the vendor claims. Some examples include:</p>
 
 Is the vendor financially solvent? 
 How long do they retain personally identifiable information (PII)? Where is it stored and how is it secured? 
 How do they obtain user consent? 
 Do they have a privacy policy in place? When was it last revised? 
 Does the vendor have a Security Awareness and Training Policy applicable to all employees? 
 Do they have an Information Security Management Plan? When was it last revised? 
 
<p>While many RON vendors may qualify for Kantara Trustmark, as of today, none have been approved directly. Some may, however, be partnered with credential service providers that have been certified.&nbsp; One exception is Proof (formerly Notarize) which was recently awarded a Trustmark and is listed on Kantara’s <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-status-list/">Trust Status List. </a>To thwart the ambiguity in identity and authentication regulations, I recommend that procurement officers in New York (and the other 49 states) require a Kantara Trustmark to meet the intent of the regulation.</p>

 Part 1: From Folksonomy to&nbsp;Taxonomy CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p><a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/What_Are_Open_Badges%3F">Open Badges</a> exist to democratise the means of credentialing: anyone can issue a badge for anything. The trouble is that it can be difficult to do so, because people tend to describe things using folksonomies: “Oh yeah, they’re a good listener”</p><p>This article expands on our recent posts about endorsement, offering a method for aligning <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/Open_recognition">Open Recognition</a> with skills taxonomies. For example, “good listener” is reframed as “active listening”.</p><p>The approach we outline helps you gather useful information by talking to people you know, both personally and professionally. It also helps you use an AI assistant to do some of the laborious work and do what machines do best: pattern-matching.</p><p>Here’s the 10-step&nbsp;process:</p>  Come up with questions for your contacts and put them in an online&nbsp;form  Share the online form with relevant&nbsp;people  Organise the answers you get in a way that’s easy to understand  Ask an AI assistant to review the answers and give you a&nbsp;summary  Instruct the AI assistant to review skills taxonomies  Compare the skills you’ve identified with taxonomies to see how they match&nbsp;up  Summarise your skills using a&nbsp;table  Come up with the metadata for Open Badges based on your skills (coming in Part&nbsp;2!)  Create badges using an online platform (coming in Part&nbsp;2!)  Ask contacts to endorse your badges (coming in Part&nbsp;2!)  <p>In our experiment, we gathered 20 responses within a 24-hour time period by explaining the process via social media posts. We’ll use this example to bring the process to&nbsp;life.</p><p>We’ll cover steps one through seven in this post and save steps eight to ten, which deal with turning skills into badges, for Part&nbsp;2.</p> 1. Come up with questions for your contacts and put them in an online&nbsp;form <p>The simpler the better. For this experiment, we started off with one contextual question which used checkboxes. We followed this with three diagnostic questions that allowed for free text&nbsp;entry.</p><blockquote>In what context do you know this&nbsp;person?</blockquote><blockquote>Tick all that&nbsp;apply</blockquote><blockquote>Professional — we have worked together&nbsp;directly</blockquote><blockquote>Professional — we have interacted but not worked&nbsp;together</blockquote><blockquote>Professional — other</blockquote><blockquote>Personal — I am a family&nbsp;member</blockquote><blockquote>Personal — I am a&nbsp;friend</blockquote><blockquote>Personal — other</blockquote><blockquote>What do they know a lot&nbsp;about?</blockquote><blockquote>This could be a subject area (e.g. ‘Geography’) or something more specific (e.g. ‘Identifying rare books’). Feel free to go into&nbsp;detail.</blockquote><blockquote>What are they particularly skilled&nbsp;in?</blockquote><blockquote>This could be a hard skill (e.g. ‘coding in Python’) or a human skill (e.g. ‘facilitation’). Feel free to give examples and&nbsp;context.</blockquote><blockquote>What behaviours do they exhibit which you, or others, find&nbsp;useful?</blockquote><blockquote>This is a catch-all for everything else that makes this person different/valuable to others. You might want to talk about their impact on the work you’ve done, or something you’ve observed that doesn’t fit elsewhere.</blockquote><p>We used <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms">Google Forms</a> to collect answers. Make sure the form is visually appealing and straightforward. Specify who should complete it, like people who know you well, and include links to any privacy policies.</p><p>Based on our experience, people are more willing to fill out forms if they’re anonymous, and this approach tends to yield better feedback.</p> 2. Share the online form with relevant&nbsp;people <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/">LinkedIn</a> is a good platform for sharing the survey, but we also posted on the Fediverse via our <a href="https://mastodon.social/weareopencoop">Mastodon&nbsp;account</a>.</p><p>You might want to email the form to certain people or groups as well. If you’re using LinkedIn, consider tagging individuals you’d like to hear from, especially those you’ve worked with recently.</p> 3. Organise the answers you get in a way that’s easy to understand <p>Google Forms has a handy way to export to a spreadsheet:</p><p>Go to ‘File / Download’ and generate a PDF which can be referenced by an AI assistant such as&nbsp;ChatGPT.</p><p>Ensure that you’ve turned word wrapping on so that none of your data gets&nbsp;hidden.</p> 4. Ask an AI assistant to review the answers and give you a&nbsp;summary <p>You can view the conversation I had with ChatGPT 4 at <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/e51b8ffa-a564-4ca8-9afa-09c66b7825cc">this link</a>. However, we’ll break it down and give you the prompts and if you want to use them yourself.</p> Give some context and upload your&nbsp;PDF <p>We used the <a href="https://askyourpdf.com/">AskYourPDF</a> plugin for ChatGPT. Here is the prompt we&nbsp;used:</p><blockquote>I’m going to share a PDF with you, so I’ll need an upload link. The contents of a PDF are responses to an online form. Here is the introductory text:</blockquote><blockquote>— — —</blockquote><blockquote>Open Recognition in your network [EXPERIMENT]</blockquote><blockquote>👋 Hello! Thanks for filling out this form, which should take less than 5 minutes. This will form an example for an upcoming article showcasing how Open Recognition can work in practice, mapped against skills taxonomies. We do not capture your name or identifiable details, so any words you enter will not be attributable to&nbsp;you.</blockquote><blockquote>Please complete this form as honestly as possible. Your results will be captured using this Google Form (privacy policy), combined with those from other people, and fed into ChatGPT (privacy policy) to map against skills taxonomies. WAO may also store the data on other platforms, in accordance with our own privacy&nbsp;policy.</blockquote><blockquote>We appreciate you taking part. This example is for Doug Belshaw. If you know and have interacted with Doug in a personal or professional context, please continue to fill out this form. If not, thanks for your interest but please do not continue. All questions are optional. 🙂</blockquote><blockquote>— — —</blockquote><blockquote>Once you’ve given me the upload link and I’ve given you the doc_id, we’re going to analyse the responses to the questions to:</blockquote><blockquote>1. Synthesise results</blockquote><blockquote>2. Discover&nbsp;patterns</blockquote><blockquote>3. Match attributes against skills taxonomies</blockquote><p>After you input this text, you should get a link to the AskYourPDF website, where you’ll be asked for the document ID of the PDF you upload. Just copy/paste it into the chat&nbsp;window.</p> Check the&nbsp;summary <p>AI assistants sometimes get things wrong, so check the summary ChatGPT generates. Ours looked like&nbsp;this:</p><p>You could ask ChatGPT for deeper analysis — for example, segmenting what your personal contacts said about you, compared with what your professional contacts indicated.</p> 5. Instruct the AI assistant to review skills taxonomies <p>To compare skills, we need a reference list. In this experiment, we used a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-skills-taxonomies-may-2022">review of skills taxonomies</a> on the UK government website. A direct link to the relevant PDF can be found <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078099/Review_of_skills_taxonomies_report_prepared_for_the_SPB_May_2022.pdf">here</a>. It references the <a href="https://data-viz.nesta.org.uk/skills-taxonomy/index.html">O*NET</a> (USA), <a href="https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en/about-esco/what-esco">ESCO</a> (EU), and <a href="https://data-viz.nesta.org.uk/skills-taxonomy/index.html">Nesta</a> (UK) skills taxonomies.</p><p>To upload the PDF, do as you did earlier: use ChatGPT to get a link that lets you upload the document through the AskYourPDF plugin. Here is the prompt we&nbsp;used:</p><blockquote>I need another PDF upload link. This is from the GOV.UK website and is an “Independent report. Review of skills taxonomies: May 2022. This paper, commissioned by the Skills and Productivity Board, assesses the usefulness of existing skills taxonomies in relation to the work of the&nbsp;board.”</blockquote><p>ChatGPT then summarises the paper, explaining what the different skills taxonomies are useful&nbsp;for.</p><p>We’re interested in all of the skills taxonomies, as O*NET focuses on skills at a higher level than ESCO and&nbsp;Nesta.</p> 6. Compare the skills you’ve identified with taxonomies to see how they match&nbsp;up <p>ChatGPT can now see data from two PDFs. The first has feedback from your contacts about your strengths. The second contains data about skills taxonomies. We can now use this information to match what people say you’re good at with lists of skills used by different organisations and platforms.</p><p>Here’s the prompt we&nbsp;used:</p><blockquote>So now that we’ve got some examples of skills taxonomies, I’d like you to take what we learned about Doug Belshaw from the online form and match it against a list of work-related skills.</blockquote><blockquote>List them all in bullet-point form with a justification for&nbsp;each.</blockquote><p>ChatGPT produced the following:</p><p>Some of these are obvious, but others are perhaps less so. It’s useful to have the specific terminology to use to describe your&nbsp;skills.</p> 7. Summarise your skills using a&nbsp;table <p>Having the list from the previous step is helpful, but it’s even better to compare the data in a table format. Here’s the prompt we used to do&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>Now create a table from this data in a way that I can copy/paste</blockquote><p>ChatGPT produced the following:</p><p>While we’re more than just words in boxes, having a structured way to be able to talk about our skills with people and systems is incredibly impactful.</p><p>Listing your ‘top 10 skills’ just became a whole lot&nbsp;easier.</p> Conclusion <p>Completing this process is highly valuable for understanding the skills your network attributes to you. However, sometimes people struggle with the confidence to reach out even to people they know and trust.

 Specifications 

<p></p>

<p>Creating specifications is one of the most important things we do at Blockchain Commons, because it allows developers to work together in interoperable ways, and thus creates a more resilient ecosystem for all of our digital assets.</p>

<p>IETF. In July we attended IETF 117 with the goal of advancing some of our specifications into standards that will allow their wider use.
We had a meeting on Gordian Envelope as well as a slot for talking about dCBOR as part of the CBOR meeting, and both allowed for notable advancement of those specs.</p>

<p>dCBOR. Our Internet-Draft for dCBOR has been changed from being “implementation details” to being an “application profile”, which makes it a description of how an application might implement a subset of CBOR —&nbsp;in this case to produce deterministic results. With this understanding in place we have released <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/05/">v05 of our dCBOR draft</a> and feel confident that we are zeroing in on a spec that will be accepted by the CBOR community.</p>

<p>More recently we also wrote a very short research paper on our preferred encoding of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-008-dcbor-date.md">dates in dCBOR</a>.</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope. Our discussions at IETF 117 also allowed us to finalize negotations for which CBOR tags we can receive from IANA. As a result, we’ve been able to tighten up the Envelope spec in a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-envelope/">new draft</a> by simplifying the core of Envelope and minimizing the tags we used. Simultaneously, we received the registration of <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml">CBOR Tag #200</a> for Gordian Envelope. Note this was a breaking change, but because of the official IANA recognition and the IETF guidance and support, we feel quite comfortable with the newest iteration of Gordian Envelope going forward.</p>

<p>The updated spec also trimmed a lot of features from Gordian Envelope, to allow for its more general use. However, we’re reintroducing those features through new research papers, which cover <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-003-envelope-known-value.md">known values</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-004-envelope-symmetric-encryption.md">symmetric encryption</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-005-envelope-compression.md">compression</a>.</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope Attachments. We’ve also developed a major new feature for Gordian Envelope: <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-006-envelope-attachment.md">attachments</a>. These encode vendor-specified data, allowing for the inclusion of specific, typed data, either in an open and interoperable way or in a private way, as an individual vendor prefers.</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope Keys &amp; Seeds. Finally, we published two more research papers, covering the storage of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-007-envelope-output-desc.md">Bitcoin output descriptors</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-009-envelope-seed.md">seeds</a> in Gordian Envelopes. We think these will again improve interoperability, and as a result Envelopes are now the preferred method for exchanging keys, seeds, and output descriptors in our reference apps.</p>

<p>If it’s not obvious, nailing down the fundamentals of Gordian Envelope allowed for a very creative period of expansion and extension for the format. We’re very grateful to IETF for working with us to reach this spot and are thrilled to have extended the community of Gordian developers to this larger organization.</p>

 Code &amp; Libraries 

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fyICk0lwL0#t=3143s"></a></p>

<p>Our specifications become reality through reference libraries and reference apps that we make available to developers interested in implementing our protocols. In addition to all our work on dCBOR and Gordian Envelope, we were able to make notable expansions here as well.</p>

<p>Rust Libraries. We have been developing new versions of all of our core cryptography libraries (including Envelope and SSKR) for Rust. Besides performance and type safety advantages, this also allows for easy usage on Android. The libraries are now in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions/116">community review</a>. We’re looking to see if they meet your needs, so please let us know!</p>

<p>Rust Envelope CLI Tool. Using our Rust libraries, we are also working on a new version of our Envelope CLI written in Rust. It’s a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust">Rust crate called <code>envelope</code></a>. It’s very similar to our existing Swift CLI, but without default commands, requiring more precise usage. We’ll be continuing to work on this for full release next quarter.</p>

<p>GST 1.6. We also have done some continued work on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS">Gordian Seed Tool</a> to support both the changes in the Envelope spec and the ability to exchange Envelopes containing metadata with our <code>envelope-cli</code> as a proof of concept for how third-party developers can interchange data. An example of the functionality can be found in the video of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fyICk0lwL0#t=3143s">July Developers Meeting</a>. Participants in our public Testflight for GST should also be able to download GST 1.6 at this time.</p>

 Articles &amp; Discussions 

<p><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/self-sovereign-computing/"></a></p>

<p>We supplement our specs and apps with a variety of documents and articles, explaining our philosophies and documenting ways to support them.</p>

<p>Return to SSI. Self-sovereign identity was one of our first pushes, even prior to the incorporation of Blockchain Commons. Its ideals of independence and privacy remain some of our most important goals. This quarter Christopher followed up on his foundational <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">“Path to Self-Sovereign Identity” article</a> with a new look at <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">“The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>. Seven years on, self-sovereign identity has prospered and spread, but in some cases it’s moved away from its original intents, which the new article discusses. Christopher also penned a piece on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/self-sovereign-computing/">“Self-Sovereign Computing”</a> which talks about self-sovereignty in the larger computing ecosystem, and how we can be the captains of our own vessels on the digital seas.</p>

<p>The concepts of self-sovereign identity aren’t just philosophical musings. They’re very important ideals that affects the safety of their users. In the past, incorrectly used identity has literally led to genocide. Working to prevent this sort of misusage is another of the origins of self-sovereign identity, which Christopher wrote about in an advance reading for Rebooting the Web of Trust 12, called <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot12-cologne/blob/main/advance-readings/ssi-echoes-from-history.md">“Echoes from History: Designing Self-Sovereign Identity with Care”</a>.</p>

<p>Return to Musings. The article on “The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity” was part of Christopher’s “Musings of a Trust Architect” column, where he writes about many of the architectural, security, and privacy decisions underlying our work at Blockchain Commons. This quarter also saw the publication of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Least-Necessary/">“Least &amp; Necessary Design Patterns”</a>, where he discussed a few different ways to look at the protection of data through minimization. Varying viewpoints in this way is important because it can give us new insights into tough security problems.</p>

<p>Return to #SmartCustody. #SmartCustody is a cornerstone of self-sovereign identity because it supports the resilient control of self-sovereign assets. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md">multisig scenario</a>, which describes how to use simple tools to maintain digital assets using a multisignature, received an update this quarter to integrate it with the newest versions of <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/passport/">the Passport wallet</a> and <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">the Sparrow coordinator</a>.</p>

 Web Site Revisions 

<p></p>

<p>Websites help us to organize our documentation and make it easily available. They saw two major expansions in Q3.</p>

<p>Developer Website. We have created a new website at <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/">developer.blockchaincommons.com</a> that collects together all of our info on eleven different specifications and other projects, plus our architectural overviews — all of which was previously scattered across several different repos. The overviews of the specs are supplemented by FAQs, test vectors, use cases, and developer documentation. Take a look! And, if there’s a category of documentation that you want for a specific page, and it’s not there <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/issues">let us know!</a>.</p>

<p>As part of this work, we also created new pages for some of our specifications that had previously received less description. This includes pages on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/dcbor/">dCBOR</a>, <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/lifehash/">LifeHash</a>, and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/oib/">Object Identity Blocks (OIBs)</a>.</p>

<p>Life with Alacrity. Some of the foundational concepts behind Blockchain Commons were originally written for Christopher Allen’s <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/">Life with Alacrity blog</a>. That’s where “The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity” was originally published as well as articles on Dunbar’s Number, community sizes, collective choice, and more. This last quarter we converted the old site over to a GitHub Page using Minimal Mistakes, to make sure it remains a great resource for the future. (There’s still some clean-up of tags to do, and we want to make it look a little nicer!)</p>

 Coming Next 

<p>For the coming quarter we’re going to by trying out a new salon style similar to our <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salons</a> and <a href="http://www.tokenethics.com/">#TokenEthics</a> meeting: Expert Round Tables. These round tables will allow experts to both answer and ask questions about a specific area of expertise, to improve our joint understanding of the topic.</p>

<p>Our first Expert Round Table will be on Schnorr. We’ve already got a few experts lined up, but if you are currently studying or implementing Schnorr, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">contact us</a> to apply to participate. (The whole Round Table will of course be open for viewing too, just be sure you’re signed up to our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/">Signal channels or mailing lists</a> to receive notice when we lock down the date and guest list.)</p>

<p>For the fourth quarter we also plan to finalize the Rust envelope-cli, move GST 1.6 to release (mainly pending an update to restore PSBT compatibility with Sparrow), and continue work on our reference tools for Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR).</p>

 Three lenses to improve your digital&nbsp;strategy Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>“You’ve got to have a system”, as they say. At WAO, we’ve got one that we often apply to strategy projects of all shapes and sizes. Especially digital ones. And it’s easy to remember! 3Ps: People. Process. Product*.</p><p>In practice, the 3Ps are a series of lenses we use with clients to ensure that we’re thinking through projects holistically. Below, we give an introduction on how to use it in practice.</p><p>*A note on the ordering — when we’re talking, we find it easier to say “People. Product. Process” rather than “People. Process. Product”, don’t you? But you can put them in any order, it’s up to&nbsp;you!</p> The Power of&nbsp;People <p>The foundation of any successful organisation is the people who are a part of it. When we talk about ‘People,’ we’re talking about the individuals who make up organisational teams, along with your stakeholders (such as your board), as well as the audience you serve. We also make sure to think about community members and volunteers who are furthering an organisation’s mission through their engagement. We place people at the heart of our approach to prioritise the building of meaningful relationships and also to promote diversity. After all, if we’re not working to strengthen connections and help people find purpose, what are we&nbsp;doing?</p><p>We find that people&nbsp;need:</p>  Common language — there are often too many buzzwords in business, so clear and effective communication ensures that everyone understands one another. Having a shared understanding of a problem or a solution starts with the language we use.&nbsp;Synergy!  Bias towards open — create a more inclusive and engaging environment by encouraging open communication and embracing diverse perspectives. That means not just letting your files languish in unshared folders and making sure people have an opportunity to engage with the&nbsp;work.  Established trust — improve decision-making by creating a positive working environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and supported. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">Nonviolent communication</a> strategies help here, even though the name is a bit&nbsp;weird.  <p>The anthropologist Margaret Mead is credited with&nbsp;saying:</p><blockquote>“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever&nbsp;has.”</blockquote><p>Behind every good project, initiative, and product are a group of talented people, working together. To harness the creativity and innovation of that group, we need to remember that they are humans with thoughts and feelings, as well as biases and complexities. Every group of people is different, so listening to the individuals you are working with and for is priority number&nbsp;one.</p> Streamlining Processes <p>By ‘Process,’ we mean the workflows and approaches that enable organisations to work effectively and sustainably. Efficient and well-structured processes play a crucial role in achieving an organisation’s strategic goals. It also leads to a more satisfying, productive, working environment.</p><p>We think that the following leads to better processes:</p>  Adaptability in teams — the world is always changing, so organisational processes should be flexible and adaptable enough to change with them, to respond to new opportunities and new people. Flexibility isn’t just for gymnasts.  Challenge assumptions — it’s important for us all to reassess our existing beliefs, assumptions, and practices so that we can identify areas for improvement and innovation. Just because you’re used to doing things one way doesn’t make it the best&nbsp;one.  Data driven decision making — while Gary from Marketing might have a great idea, what does the data say? Organisation should base decisions and strategies on objective data and evidence rather than relying on intuition or guesswork.  <p>A hugely important piece of developing effective processes is ensuring that they work for the people who will use them. More often than not, this includes documentation. Potentially boring? Yes. Skippable? No.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that you have to have rigid processes. In fact, adaptability is the key to all of this, and there should be an expectation that an organisation’s knowledge base is kept up-to-date by whoever used it&nbsp;last.</p> Embracing Innovative Products <p>The ‘Product’ component of our approach refers to the software platforms and tools we use and develop to support collaboration among internal and external stakeholders. You’re reading this on a screen thanks to several products. We use them all of the time, so it’s important to get the right&nbsp;ones.</p><p>The best products&nbsp;support:</p>  Iterative strategies — organisations have to evolve to keep pace with changing circumstances, so the tools you use should enable you to continuously improve processes and outcomes. If you feel like you’re having to fight your tools, then perhaps they’re no longer the best&nbsp;ones?  Distributed power / Autonomy — every tool has one or more ‘default’ ways of being used. So we should both use and make tools available that enable users to make decisions as independently as possible.  Learning by doing — the tools we use and develop should solve real-world problems rather than create new ones for users. I’m looking at you,&nbsp;Clippy.  <p>It should be fairly easy to find products that support processes that help people work well together. Sometimes, though, it involves taking multiple products and linking them together in new and interesting ways.</p><p>Although salespeople would like to tell you otherwise, there’s likely no ‘one platform to rule them all’, so we recommend making use of other techniques. You might like our <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop">Architecture of Participation</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/content-is-king-queen-and-everything-inbetween-3c2fc4b1e19c">System Ecosystem</a> tactics to help make sure your bases are&nbsp;covered.</p> Getting Started with this&nbsp;approach <p>If you want to use the ‘People, Product, Process’ approach within your organisation, consider the following steps:</p>  First, take a step back and have a good look at your organisation’s culture. Think about how you can improve things like people management, communication, and teamwork. This might involve taking your digital strategy out of the desk drawer. Or, indeed, writing&nbsp;one.  Next, check out your current processes and workflows. Find any points of friction and opportunities to make things smoother. A diagram might come in handy to visualise all the&nbsp;things.  Now it’s time to explore some tools and tech to help boost your team’s collaboration and productivity. Give them a test run and see which ones might work. Let other people try them&nbsp;out.  Following this, it’s all about crafting a plan to bring those changes and improvements to life. Make sure your team’s in the loop and excited about the process by being open and keeping them in the&nbsp;know.  Last but not least, keep an eye on how things are going with your new approach. Embrace the iterative mindset and tweak things as needed to keep things moving&nbsp;forward!   Conclusion <p>This approach provides a really simple but powerful series of lenses to unlock your digital strategy’s true potential. It’s designed to be a versatile approach, catering to organisations of all shapes and&nbsp;sizes.</p><p>So, if you’re ready to embark on this transformative journey and could use some guidance, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">let us know</a>!

<p>Steering Committee Elections<br>
DIF’s new Steering Committee has been elected! The results will be revealed on the DIF Blog on 2 October and our new members will be invited to join the upcoming Steering Committee meeting on 5 October. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Human-Centric Digital Identity<br>
DIF is thrilled to contribute to a landmark paper, <a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Human-Centric_Digital_Identity_Final.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Human-Centric Digital Identity for Government Officials</a>, published this week.</p>
<p>The paper was announced during the OECD Panel on Recommendations for Digital Identity Governance on 26 September. It was commissioned by The OpenID Foundation and edited by Elizabeth Garber and Mark Hainewith, with input from 12 contributing organizations including DIF.</p>
<p><br>
Source: Human-Centric Digital Identity for Government Officials</p>
<p>DIF's Executive Director, Clare Nelson, commented: "DIF is honored and delighted to be a contributor to the Human-Centric Digital Identity white paper. Many DIF members work on national identity programs, and need a single source that spans everything from policy to threat modeling. We thank OpenID for taking leadership to commission and organize this effort, including collection of input from numerous industry experts."</p>
<p>ID Day<br>
DIF joined dozens of other organisations to celebrate Identity Day (ID Day) on 16 September. The campaign by ID4Africa seeks worldwide recognition of the fundamental right and practical necessity of having proof of identity in today’s digital age. The chosen date symbolizes UN Sustainable Development Goal 16.9, which aims to provide legal identity including birth registration to all individuals by 2030.</p>
<p>DIF is delighted to become an Official Coalition Partner of ID4Africa and is committed to supporting Executive Chairman Dr Joseph Atick and his team to raise awareness of ID Day, decentralized identity and key use cases.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>More about this event on the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/dif-attends-conference-on-next-generation-authentication/">DIF blog</a>.</p>
<p>JP Morgan Onyx Hackathon<br>
DIF is supporting a Digital Identity Hackathon sponsored by Onyx by JP Morgan. This 4 week innovation sprint challenges participants to reinvent the future of online identity security and privacy, with prizes for helping to improve the Onyx SSI SDK in 5 areas: add support for a new DID method or support the Universal Resolver, provide support for JSON-LD Credentials, implement a new Credential Revocation scheme, implement the SD-JWT spec for selective disclosure, implement support for OIDC, DIDComm or Presentation Exchange.</p>
<p>Our thanks to Steering Committee members Markus Sabadello and Sam Curren, who inspired many participants to dive into relevant DIF tools and protocols with workshops on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gKJDGKX21Q&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Universal Resolver / Universal Registrar</a> and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4Xtn1xWxfw&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Introduction to DIDComm</a> (you can view the workshops on YouTube by clicking the links).</p>
<p>GSM Association adds its support to BBS<br>
<br>
Image © GSMA</p>
<p>The GSM Assocation, which represents the interests of mobile network operators worldwide, has declared its support for the <a href="https://identity.foundation/bbs-signature/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">BBS Signature Scheme</a>. GSMA Europe highlighted the need for accelerated standardisation of BBS and definition of its end-to-end use in its <a href="https://www.gsma.com/gsmaeurope/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GSMA-Official-Response-Privacy-for-eIDAS-June-2023.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Official Response on eIDAS 2.0 and Privacy</a></p>
<p>Here is an exerpt from the paper: "In the context of eIDAS 2.0 this translates as follows: 1. Identification of “strictly necessary” information: there is a need for the definition / standardisation of requests and the acceptable attributes to be requested for each purpose (i.e., for each use case). We would welcome and participate to an EC initiative tackling this point.2. Technical means to provide only the “strictly necessary” information: protocols or technologies need to support the minimisation of shared information, including supporting Yes/No questions. To our knowledge, the only current technology that can achieve this is ZKP (particularly combined with a ZKP-enabled signature scheme of the BBS+ family)."</p>

      <p>This approach to VCs is innovative because it brings together different elements from several of the existing approaches to VCs. It is based on the usage of <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">BBS+ JSON-LD Signatures</a>, which is a subclass of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">LD Signatures</a>, in combination with a JSON-LD credential schema. The cryptography behind this mechanism is BBS+ Signatures, which require what’s called a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-03">pairing-friendly</a> curve. Existing implementations in the VC ecosystem use the elliptic curve <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-02#section-2.4">BLS12–381</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This specification defines a set of cryptographic suites for the purpose of creating, verifying and deriving proofs for BBS+ Signatures in conformance with the Data Integrity [VC-DATA-INTEGRITY] specification.</p>

      <p>In general the suites uses the RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm [RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION] to transform an input document into its canonical form. It then uses the statement digest algorithm to digest each statement to be signed individually, finally the digested statements are signed using the defined signature algorithm.</p>

      <p>BBS+ signatures [CFRG-BBS-SIGNATURE] are compatible with any pairing friendly elliptic curve, however the cryptographic suites defined in this document elect to only allow the usage of the BLS12-381 for interoperability purposes.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>BBS signatures were implicitly proposed by Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham (CRYPTO ’04) as part of their group signature scheme, and explicitly cast as stand-alone signatures by Camenisch and Lysyanskaya (CRYPTO ’04). A provably secure version, called BBS+, was then devised by Au, Susilo, and Mu (SCN ’06), and is currently the object of a standardization effort which has led to a recent RFC draft. BBS+ signatures are suitable for use within anonymous credential and DAA systems, as their algebraic structure enables efficient proofs of knowledge of message-signature pairs that support partial disclosure.</p>

      <p>BBS+ signatures consist of one group element and two scalars. As our first contribution, we prove that a variant of BBS+ producing shorter signatures, consisting only of one group element and one scalar, is also secure. The resulting scheme is essentially the original BBS proposal, which was lacking a proof of security. Here we show it satisfies, under the q-SDH assumption, the same provable security guarantees as BBS+. We also provide a complementary tight analysis in the algebraic group model, which heuristically justifies instantiations with potentially shorter signatures.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Selective disclosure via BBS+ signatures […]</p>

      <p>Like monoclaim credentials allow users to share specific claims from a VC, BBS+ Signatures is a multi-message digital signature scheme (named after its creators Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham) that gives users the possibility of sharing VCs with only specific attributes revealed. How does it work?</p>

      <p>BBS+ signatures allow a VC holder to derive proofs from the original signature:</p>
       
         Deriving a proof: When a holder takes the signed VC and hides one, several, or none of the containing claims, creating a new signature (a derived proof) using the Issuer’s public key. This derived proof can prove that the holder knows all of the original claims contained in the VC but chooses only to reveal the required ones. 
         Verifying a proof: The verifier validates the derived proof using the Issuer’s public key. This process enables the verifier to confirm the validity of the proof, proving that the subset of claims was part of an original message signed by the Issuer.

      <p>BBS+ LD-Proofs use JSON-LD schemas, so credentials that use them can have a rich, hierarchical set of attributes. Instead of the heavy-handed mechanism for the encoding and canonicalization of attributes values that we’d imagined for Rich Schemas, they use RDF canonicalization and a hash function. Rather than expanding the credential definition, they discarded it, taking advantage of some properties of BBS+ keys which allow for deterministic expansion.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Blum Blum Shub (BBS) is used as a pseudo-random number generator (it is pseudo as it is not a truly random number, and where its randomisation depends on a random seed). It was created by Lenore Blum, Manuel Blum and Michael Shub in 1968. Blum Blum Shub uses the form of xn+1=x2n(modM), and where x0 is a random seed. The value of M is equal to pq, and where p and q are prime numbers. These values of p and q are both congruent to 3 mod 4 (p=q=3(mod4)). The security of the method involves the difficulty in factorizing M. It is slow, but is the strongest proven random number generator. For each step, we extract some of the information from xn+1, and which is typically the least significant bit. It would not be used within a cipher application, but could be used in key generation.</p>

      <p>What do we want from a pseudo-random sequence generator? Ideally, we would like a pseudo-random sequence generator to quickly produce, from short seeds, long sequences (of bits) that appear in every way to be generated by successive flips of a fair coin.</p>

      <p>Certainly, the idea of a (fast) deterministic mechanism producing such non-deterministic behavior seems contradictory: by observing its outcome over time, we could in principle eventually detect the determinism and simulate such a generator.</p>

      <p>In this formula, M is the product of p and q, two large primes.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Digital signature schemes are a fundamental cryptographic primitive, of use both in its own right, and as a building block in cryptographic protocol design. In this paper, we propose a practical and provably secure signature scheme and show protocols (1) for issuing a signature on a committed value (so the signer has no information about the signed value), and (2) for proving knowledge of a signature on a committed value. This signature scheme and corresponding protocols are a building block for the design of anonymity-enhancing cryptographic systems, such as electronic cash, group signatures, and anonymous credential systems. The security of our signature scheme and protocols relies on the Strong RSA assumption. These results are a generalization of the anonymous credential system of Camenisch and Lysyanskaya</p>

      <p>The technology itself is not new, as it was originally part of Hyperledger Indy, the digital identity ledger project. However, it has now been separated from Indy so that it can be used for verifiable credentials on ledgers such as Hyperledger Fabric or Ethereum-based Hyperledger Besu, or others.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This specification describes mechanisms for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of Verifiable Credentials and similar types of constrained digital documents using cryptography, especially through the use of digital signatures and related mathematical proofs. Cryptographic proofs enable functionality that is useful to implementors of distributed systems.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This specification recognizes two classes of securing mechanisms: those that use external proofs and those that use embedded proofs. An external proof is one that wraps an expression of this data model, such as via a JSON Web Token, which is elaborated on in the Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE [VC-JOSE-COSE] specification. An embedded proof is a mechanism where the proof is included in the data model, such as a Data Integrity Proof, which is elaborated on in Verifiable Credential Data Integrity [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/">VC-DATA-INTEGRITY</a>].</p>

      <p>It should be noted that these two classes of securing mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Verifiable credentials make use of JSON-LD to extend the data model to support dynamic data vocabularies and schemas. This allows us to not only use existing JSON-LD schemas, but to utilize the mechanism defined by JSON-LD to create and share new schemas as well. To a large extent this is what JSON-LD was designed for; the adoption and reuse of common data vocabularies.</p>

      <p>This type of verifiable credential is best characterised as a kind of Linked Data Proof. It allows issuers to make statements that can be shared without loss of trust because their authorship can be verified by a third party.</p>

<p>In this era of generative AI, how do we determine whether an image is human-created or machine-made?&nbsp;For the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Professor Hany Farid shares the techniques used for identifying real and synthetic images — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, environmental lighting, and GAN-generated faces. A world-renowned expert in the field of misinformation, disinformation, and digital forensics as well as an advisor to the CAI, Professor Farid explores the limits of these techniques and their part in a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the final article in a six-part series.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>Part 1: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">From the darkroom to generative AI</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">How realistic are AI-generated faces?</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-for-ai-generated-faces">Photo forensics for AI-generated faces</a></p><p>Part 4: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-from-lighting-environments">Photo forensics from lighting environments</a></p><p>Part 5: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-from-lighting-shadows-and-reflections">Photo forensics from lighting shadows and reflections</a></p>




 


  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>In the past few posts, I have described representative examples of passive forensic techniques. This category of tools for distinguishing the real from the fake assumes no explicit knowledge of the content source or specialized recording equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>The benefit of these techniques is that they are applicable to a broad category of content. The drawback, however, is they sometimes require manual intervention. The shadow and reflection analysis, for example, requires identifying corresponding points on an object and shadow or reflection. While this is a relatively simple step for a human analyst, it is still out of reach of automation. As a result, these techniques cannot be applied to the torrent of daily online uploads.</p><p>Active forensic techniques, on the other hand, operate at the source of creation, embedding into or extracting from an identifying digital watermark or signature. There is a long history of marking content to prove authenticity, indicate ownership, and protect against counterfeiting. For example, Getty Images, a massive image archive, adds a visible watermark to all digital images in their catalog. This allows customers to freely browse images while protecting Getty’s assets.&nbsp;</p><p>An “invisible” or steganographic watermark can be added to a digital image by, for example, tweaking every 10th image pixel so that its color (typically a number in the range of 0 to 255) is even-valued. Because this adjustment is so minor, the watermark is imperceptible. And, because this periodic pattern is unlikely to occur naturally, it can be used to verify an image’s provenance.</p><p>The ideal watermark is one that is imperceptible and also resilient to basic manipulations like cropping or resizing. Although the above pixel manipulation is not resilient to, for example, image resizing, many robust watermarking strategies have been proposed that are resilient — though not impervious — to attempts to remove them.</p><p>The benefit of watermarks is that identifying information is directly associated with a piece of content before it is released into the world, making identification fast and easy. The drawback to this approach is that watermarks are vulnerable to attack, where an adversary can digitally remove the watermark while leaving the underlying content largely intact.</p><p>Therefore, in addition to embedding watermarks, a creator can extract an identifying fingerprint from the content and store it in a secure centralized ledger. (This fingerprint is sometimes called a perceptual hash —&nbsp;see article 2 in Further Reading below.) The provenance of a piece of content can then be determined by comparing the fingerprint of an image or video that is out in the world to the fingerprint stored in the ledger. Both watermarks and fingerprints can be made cryptographically secure, making it very difficult to forge.</p><p>This type of watermarking and fingerprinting is equally effective for actively tracking AI-generated and human-recorded content. The benefit of this approach is that it can efficiently scan the billions of online daily uploads. The drawback is that it requires specialized hardware or software to be used at the point of creation and recording. It also requires downstream platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok to respect the watermarks, and it requires browsers to display the accompanying content labels. Although not perfect, these combined technologies make it significantly harder to create a compelling fake and significantly easier to verify the integrity of real content.</p><p>Importantly, this active approach is agnostic as to the truthfulness or value of content. The goal of this approach is simply, but critically, to distinguish between human-recorded and AI-generated content.</p>

  <p><a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">I started this series</a> by talking about my initial journey some 25 years ago into the world of media authentication and forensics, and so I'll end with some thoughts of what may lie ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>A combination of many factors has contributed to a complex and at times chaotic online information ecosystem. With democratized access to powerful editing and creation software, the widespread deployment of generative AI is poised to significantly complicate this environment. Harms ranging from the creation of non-consensual sexual imagery to small- and large-scale fraud and disinformation have already emerged even in these early days of this AI revolution.&nbsp;</p><p>Legitimate concerns have also been raised regarding creators' rights and their very livelihoods. Here we can draw on some historical analogs. The introduction of photography did not — as some 19th-century artists feared — destroy art or artists. It disrupted some aspects like portrait paintings, but it also liberated artists from realism, eventually giving rise to Impressionism and the Modern Art movements.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, the digitization of music did not kill music or musicians, but it did fundamentally change the way we produce and listen to music, and it spawned new genres of music. This history suggests that generative AI does not necessarily have to lead to the demise of creators, but that it can, with proper care and thought, be a new enabling medium.&nbsp;</p><p>There is much to be excited about during these early days of the AI revolution. At the same time, there are legitimate and real concerns as to how these new technologies are being weaponized against individuals, societies, and democracies, and how they might disrupt large sections of the workforce. Advances in AI do not need to lead us into an unrecognizable dystopian future. But, technologists, corporate leaders, and regulators need to carefully consider how they develop and deploy technologies, and build in proper safeguards from the point of conception through rollout.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>[1] H.

<p>The Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) and Ceramic are excited to share an integration that allows developers to easily store EAS attestations on Ceramic. We’ve seen a marked increase in awareness and interest in using attestations to express flexibly-defined, verifiable data about online activity. Attestations are a building block for creating and working with this data.</p><p>EAS is an open-source, permissionless, and token-free public good for making on-chain or off-chain attestations. It runs on two elegantly simple smart contracts, one for registering schemas and one for making attestations on those schemas. Developers can use EAS to create, issue, and manage attestations with options to store on-chain, off-chain, and now, on Ceramic.</p><p>Ceramic is a decentralized data network for managing data at scale and with trust, making it easy for developers to build applications that rely on verifiable data. It can be used to store a wide variety of data types, including profiles, badges, credentials, attestations, and stamps.</p> EAS + Ceramic: How to Use and Store Composable Attestations <p>Attestations play a crucial role in building trust and ensuring data accuracy in various decentralized applications and platforms. EAS offers a straightforward standard that simply works, agnostic of the nature of the attestations themselves or where they are stored. As such, it’s important for communities that rely on attestations to consider the benefits and trade-offs relevant to the attestation frameworks they use, which technical standards those frameworks rely on, and how to safely and efficiently store them for later use.</p><p>This blog post will explore the advantages of storing attestations on Ceramic and includes references to a <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">new tutorial for storing off-chain attestations using EAS</a>.</p> Understanding Attestations <p>Before diving into Ceramic and EAS, let's briefly recap what attestations are and the key differences between on-chain and off-chain attestations.</p><p>Attestations are like digital seals of approval, signed by one entity (the attester) about another entity or a piece of data. The attester cryptographically signs the attestation to ensure its authenticity and immutability. Attestations are basically reputation primitives and therefore only matter based on the context it’s being represented in and the reputation of the attester. For example, a credit score attestation from a credit bureau is more credible than a credit score attestation from a friend. But it’s only relevant if you need to provide a sense of your financial stability. Our friends at EAS go into greater detail on attestation examples <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/core--concepts/onchain-vs-offchain?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p><p>Attestations enable the verification and validation of information. When viewed in aggregate, attestations provide an integral building block to the broader manifestation of identity and contextual reputation.</p><p>On-chain attestations are stored directly on the Ethereum blockchain, which makes them secure, decentralized and immutable. They are ideal for scenarios where attestations need to be read by smart contracts or when guaranteed availability is essential. On the other hand, if privacy, high-volume throughput, or cost efficiency are important to your need for attestations, then purely on-chain attestations might not be the best option for your use case.</p><p>Off-chain attestations are stored off the Ethereum blockchain, often in decentralized storage solutions like IPFS or even in ephemeral cold storage. They are linked to the blockchain through cryptographic signatures but do not reside on it. This makes them great for maintaining attestations privately and sharing them when necessary.</p><p>However, some use cases may require the scalability and efficiencies related to off-chain attestations together with the myriad of qualities corresponding to on-chain guarantees. To help meet these needs, there are solutions that don’t fall cleanly into the on vs. off-chain binary, but instead share qualities of both—granting benefits like better scalability with on-chain assurances.</p><p>Ceramic, with its unique approach to storing data, serves as an attractive third option for projects seeking a combination of both on-chain and off-chain characteristics.</p> Ceramic Acts as a Data Ledger <p>Ceramic can be understood as a middle ground between on-chain and off-chain attestations. It offers a decentralized data network that combines the security and transparency of on-chain transactions with the scalability and cost efficiency typically associated with off-chain solutions.</p><p>Ceramic’s underlying protocol is built on decentralized event streams. Users can benefit from a variety of verifiable DID methods (including using their existing digital wallet to incur a did:pkh instance with no additional configuration) to cryptographically sign data events and submit them to the network. Ceramic stores these events in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), using the IPLD protocol to organize them into readable streams. This flexibility allows developers the ability to store any data types one could expect to find in a traditional SQL/NoSQL database (along with several additional scalars to support decentralized identifiers and account types) needed to create rich user experiences—including attestations, which can be used to reflect users’ experience and reputation on Ceramic.</p><p>Ceramic, together with the tools built on the network, provides data-streaming and querying capabilities familiar to developers experienced with tools like Kafka, GraphQL, and relational databases. However, it is built on a fully decentralized and open-source protocol, using the IPLD content addressing protocol within IPFS, which is periodically anchored to the Ethereum blockchain in the form of a Merkle tree. This architecture preserves global consensus, immutability, and transparency while delivering faster performance, lower costs, and straightforward traversal capabilities, making it an attractive option for projects dealing with high volumes of attestations.</p><p>Developers can also take advantage of ComposeDB, a graph database built on Ceramic. ComposeDB enhances composability and ease of querying, offering native support for GraphQL and optimizing read/write load distribution for improved performance. This allows developers to define their own data models using GraphQL or leverage existing community-defined models.</p> Create Your Attestations <p><a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Follow along in this tutorial</a> to learn how to generate simple off-chain attestations representing a “met in real life” claim. This guide uses a preexisting attestation schema already deployed on the EAS schema registry and therefore is designed to focus on the core processes and attributes available to developers using the EAS SDK.</p><p>You will learn how to generate off-chain “met in real life” attestations, allow users to generate referenced attestations confirming the original attestation, and verify attestations instances—all within the context of using ComposeDB to store and query attestations.</p>

<p>FIDO Alliance FDO Certification program will allow users to mix and match FDO solutions from different vendors with confidence</p>



<p>Mountain View, Calif., September 26, 2023 – The <a href="http://www.fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance’s</a> FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) technology allows edge and IoT users to quickly and securely onboard devices, thereby reducing cost, time and risk. Today the FIDO Alliance announced the launch of its FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) Certification Program, enabling edge node and IoT device vendors to prove that their solutions adhere to the security and interoperability requirements of the FDO specifications. Achieving certification allows vendors to demonstrate their products are high quality and at low risk of cyberthreats, while deploying companies can ensure devices will interoperate more seamlessly and securely within IoT and distributed computing infrastructures.</p>



<p>Leading vendors around the world, including Dell Technologies, IBM, Intel, Red Hat and VinCSS&nbsp; have already begun to include the FDO specification in products and services, which are being utilized by customers in a variety of settings and applications. [Media note: see quotes from FDO vendors at end of press release].</p>



<p>According to Markets and Markets in their June 2023 report, the “Edge Computing Market size is expected to grow from $53.6 billion in 2023 to $111.3 billion by 2028.”(1) They go on to say that “despite the benefits, the edge computing architecture is susceptible to cyberattacks with the addition of vulnerable edge nodes and IoT devices.” The FIDO Alliance’s FDO technology has been specifically defined by leaders including Infineon, Intel, Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm and ARM to address these concerns so that users in areas such as enterprise and industrial can fully take advantage of edge computing opportunities.</p>



<p>The FDO protocol is a freely available standard that champions a ‘zero trust’ approach to remove these barriers, enabling devices to quickly and securely onboard to cloud and edge management platforms. As a Dell Technologies <a href="https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/p/dell-nativeedge-speeds-edge-deployments-with-fido-device-onboard-fdo/">white paper</a> explained, “The installation of these systems must prioritize simplicity and must be zero-touch once plugged in and powered on. Secure operations require the ability to bring edge devices into your environment with zero touch in mind.”(2)</p>



<p>FDO Certification, testing for which will take place in early October provides conformance and interop testing, a security risk analysis, and assurance that a company’s device meets FDO Specification and Security and Privacy Requirements. Certification testing builds trust among device owners, as devices are validated as meeting a high level of security by a third-party. Companies interested in taking part in the FDO Certification interop test can register for free and get more information <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fdo-functional-certification/">here</a>.</p>



<p>“Edge nodes and IoT devices are bringing transformative benefits to a whole range of industries but overcoming the security risks that exist today is critical to enable more organizations to take the leap,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “The appetite we’ve seen for the FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) standard since we launched last year is a testament to how urgent the business need is to secure the edge in a way that’s quick and cost-effective. Launching the certification program marks another step towards fostering trust in the edge and IoT space and taking mass deployments to the next level.”</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance brings together 250+ of the most influential and innovative companies and government agencies from across the globe to deliver unrivaled security specifications that offer strong security, are free to use and easy to deploy. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/internet-of-things/">FDO Specification</a> is an important pillar in the expansion of the Alliance’s core vision: to boost global cyber security levels, help eliminate data breaches and enable secure online experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The business benefits of the FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) standard include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Simplicity&nbsp;– Businesses no longer have to pay more for the installation and onboarding process than they do for the actual hardware devices themselves. The highly automated FDO process effectively brings ‘plug and play’ to the world of onboarding edge nodes and IoT devices. 



 Flexibility&nbsp;– Businesses can choose which cloud or edge platforms they want to onboard devices to at the point of installation (as opposed to when devices are manufactured). A single device SKU can be onboarded to any platform (edge or cloud), thereby greatly simplifying the device supply chain.&nbsp; 



 Security&nbsp;– FDO leverages an “zero trust” approach, which means the installer no longer needs – nor has access to – any sensitive infrastructure/access control information.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Developers can view and download the FDO Specification <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/download-iot-specifications/">here</a>. Higher levels of security certification are planned for the program in future, and interested parties are encouraged to join the FIDO Alliance and contribute to the evolution of the FDO standard. For more information or help, please contact: <a href="mailto:certification@fidoalliance.org">certification@fidoalliance.org</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance will be hosting a <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/session/fido-device-onboard-fdo-showcase/">workshop</a> on FDO on the opening day of its annual Authenticate conference, which takes place October 16-18 in Carlsbad, CA. More information on Authenticate can be found on the event <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/event/authenticate-2023/">website</a>.</p>

<p>26 September 2023</p>



<p>The not-for-profit, Digital Identity NZ, is calling for any future Government to ensure they focus on supporting the uptake of digital identity for the benefit of all New Zealanders.</p>



<p>In their recently released manifesto, the New Zealand digital identity ecosystem seeks to remind Government of the importance of digital identity as a way to revolutionise the lives of all New Zealanders by enabling them to fully participate in the digital economy safely and confidently.</p>



<p>“If people don’t have trust in the safe and secure use of their identity in a digital world, they will not participate, and will miss many opportunities,” says Colin Wallis, executive director of Digital Identity NZ.</p>



<p>“We believe the Government must focus on building a resilient digital identity ecosystem in order to address digital inclusion, and establish trust and security across New Zealand’s economy and society.”</p>



<p>“Our Manifesto outlines four key areas to enable such an environment – how to establish trust and security, empowering digital inclusion, enabling user-centric design and promoting interoperability and standards.”</p>



<p>“The expertise needed to get the right outcomes from Digital Identity for New Zealanders is found less in government and more in industry. As a nation we need to face this reality and change the way we set policy and regulation for technically complex domains, for example biometrics,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2023/09/22/why-its-too-early-for-biometrics-regulation-in-aotearoa/">which I opinioned recently</a>,” says Wallis.</p>



<p>The manifesto calls for increased focus on bridging the digital divide to ensure equitable access to digital identity solutions for all New Zealanders – people and organisations – taking into account Māori tikanga and Māori data sovereignty, and social inclusion for the disadvantaged in our society.</p>



<p>Digital Identity NZ is the voice of digital identity in Aotearoa, a not-for-profit formed to help New Zealand’s transformation as a digital nation, where everyone should have the right and ability to prove who they are in a secure and trusted way. Digital Identity NZ is a part NZTech, the umbrella tech association for New Zealand.</p>

<p>While the roots of computer security can be traced back to the military and intelligence communities, where the focus was on protecting information and assets from enemies and adversaries, I prioritize the protection of individuals, who are uniquely due respect and dignity, and who are likely to be more vulnerable and less resilient than groups such as tribes, corporations and goverments.</p>

<p>I’ve already written about design patterns such as <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">Data Minimization and Selective Disclosure</a> that protect those individuals, but I want to share some thoughts on related design patterns that talk not about what data to release, but instead what permissions to grant. And moreso, I want to talk about how those design patterns can provide even more insight into protecting the data of indvidiuals when we turn them inside out.</p>

<p>So let me introduce the least design patterns followed by their reverse, the necessary design patterns.</p>

 The Principle of Least Privilege 

<p>The concept of “least privilege” has been around in computer security for several decades. Though its origins are not entirely clear, the design pattern was popularized in the mid-1970s by Jerry Saltzer and Michael Schroeder in their influential paper, <a href="https://bitstreamllc.com/assets/documents/the-protection-of-information-in-computer-systems-saltzer-schroeder.pdf">“The Protection of Information in Computer Systems”</a>. Since then, the “Principle of Least Privilege” has become a cornerstone of modern computer security design.</p>

<p>At its core, the principle of least privilege is all about limiting the damage that can be caused by a security breach. This principle stipulates that each user, program, or system component should have only the minimum set of permissions required to perform their respective functions. In other words, if a user does not need access to a particular file, system resource, or network device to perform their job, then they should not have access to it. By limiting the access of each user or component to only what is necessary, the system as a whole becomes more resilient to attack.</p>

<p>“It also reduces the number of potential interactions among privileged programs to the minimum for correct operation, so
that unintentional, unwanted, or improper uses of privilege are less likely to occur. Thus, if a question arises related
to misuse of a privilege, the number of programs that must be audited is minimized.”<br><a href="https://bitstreamllc.com/assets/documents/the-protection-of-information-in-computer-systems-saltzer-schroeder.pdf">—Jerry Saltzer &amp; Michael Schroeder, “The Protection of Information in Computer Systems”</a></p>

<p>The principle of least privilege can be applied to a wide range of security domains, including access control, network security, and application security. In access control, for example, least privilege means that each user should be granted only the permissions necessary to perform their job functions, and no more. In network security, least privilege means that each network device should be configured to only allow the traffic that is necessary for its specific function, and no more. In application security, least privilege means that each application should be designed to only access the resources and data that are necessary to perform its intended function, and no more.</p>

 Principle of Least Authority 

<p>The principle of least privilege has evolved and grown over the decades. In particular, it has been refined as the principle of least authority, which expands on how a user (or device) might gain access to a resource. It is perhaps best described in Chapter 8 of Mark S. Miller’s dissertation, <a href="http://www.erights.org/talks/thesis/markm-thesis.pdf">“Robust Composition: Towards a Unified Approach to Access Control and Concurrency Control”</a>. Whereas least privilege focuses on individual permissions granted to a user, least authority instead recognizes that a user and a resource are part of a larger ecosystem that can include transitive authority: even if a user doesn’t have the privilege to access a resource, he might have the privilege to access a program (or some other object) that itself has the privilege to access the resource. It’s a recognition that privileges are part of a larger web, which when seen together becomes authority.</p>

<p>“It is unclear whether Saltzer and Schroeder’s Principle of Least Privilege [SS75] is best interpreted as ‘least permission’ or ‘least authority.’ As we will see, there is an enormous difference between the two.”<br><a href="http://www.erights.org/talks/thesis/markm-thesis.pdf">—Mark S. Miller, “Robust Composition:
Towards a Unified Approach to Access Control and Concurrency Control”</a></p>

<p>The concept of least authority has become a standard principle in many modern security designs. In a least privilege system, a user might have been granted privileges to access a file or to utilize a database program; but a least authority system is more likely to additionally consider the access to files that the user might receive through access to the database.</p>

<p>Many modern discussions of least privilege conflate it entirely with least authority, but that should only be done if least privilege has been expanded to incorporate the larger ecosystem of interwoven privileges recognized in Miller’s paper.</p>

 A New Principle of Least Access 

<p>The least privilege and least access design patterns focus on the permission to do things, which is the standard for security on computing systems. However within the world of self-sovereign identity (SSI) and verifiable credentials, we instead need to focus on data access.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">“data minimization” and “selective disclosure”</a> design patterns already outline methods for reducing access to data. Combining that with “least privilege” and “least authority” reveals a larger, related design pattern that we can apply more specifically to digital data:&nbsp;”least access”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Data Minimization is the practice of limiting the amount of shared data to the minimum necessary: just enough for parties to successfully transact, accomplish a task, or otherwise meet a goal with each other, while minimizing risks to all parties by omitting unnecessary content.”<br><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">—Christopher Allen, “Musings of a Trust Architect: Data Minimization &amp; Selective Disclosure”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Data minimization mitigates the following threats: surveillance, stored data compromise, correlation, identification, secondary use, and disclosure.”<br><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6973/">—IETF RFC 6973</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than just minimizing data, least access minimizes data access. We can state the principle as follows: In order to protect privacy, respect individual entitlements, and maintain human dignity, only the minimum amount of data access necessary to achieve a specific goal should be granted.</p>

<p>In practical terms, this new “least access” principle can be applied in a variety of contexts. For example, in the case of online transactions, this principle would go beyond the idea of data minimization, which says that only the minimum identifying data necessary to complete the transaction should be collected, and no more, to say that a merchant should not have any ability to access data he shouldn’t have — and perhaps even that a datastore shouldn’t be able to reveal data that the merchant shouldn’t have access to. Consider a more coerceive situation where an LEO might demand personal data from a citizen: if the citizen’s datastore refuses to grant the LEO access to information that they shouldn’t have, then the threat of coercion is negated.</p>

<p>To further enhance privacy and security, a “least access” principle should be extended to minimize opportunities for correlation. This refers to the process of linking different pieces of data together to identify an individual, even if that data was collected separately. Limiting access to data through the Principle of Least Access (and especially through the Principle of Least Authority that it’s built upon) should help to minimize data more than just selective disclosure alone, because it looks at the whole data ecosystem. This in turn can help protect individuals’ privacy and prevent the misuse of their personal data.</p>

 Turning Design Patterns Inside Out 

<p>Once I discover a useful design pattern, I often find utility in turning it inside out. This results in a different mindset that can provide new insights into security design.</p>

<p>For instance, selective disclosure is a part of my architectural tool box, and also a goal and byproduct of least access. Turning it inside out creates the idea of “selective correlation” instead: you think about what to purposefully disclose to enable correlation, rather than what to minimize to avoid correlation. It’s built on the idea that correlation is not always a bad thing, and that in some cases it is necessary to achieve specific security goals.</p>

<p>Thus, with the inside-out design pattern of selective correlation, you: identify the specific pieces of data that need to be correlated in order to achieve a particular security objective; and then design systems and applications that allow for this correlation to occur while minimizing the risk of privacy violations.</p>

<p>A similar methodology can be applied to the “Least” design patterns.</p>

 Necessary Privilege, Authority, and Access 

<p>To turn the design patterns of “least privilege”, “least authority”, and “least access” inside out, we focus on the positive aspects of granting access to resources and data in a way that enables effective and efficient operation, rather than simply limiting access. We could call this “necessary privilege”. The idea actually goes back to Saltzer’s original design for least privilege in <a href="https://bitstreamllc.com/assets/documents/protection-control-info-sharing-multics-saltzer.pdf">“Protection and Control of Information Sharing in Multics”</a> when he said: “Protection mechanisms should be based on permission rather than exclusion.”</p>

<p>Fundamentally, necessary privilege and necessary authority systems should focus from the start on what will be necessary for a user to do their job, rather than just how to limit them. This allows for the boundaries of design for a project to be reset. Rather than trying to tamp down all possible abuses, which is potentially an endless task, it instead concentrates a designer’s attention on the positive. Once a designer fully understands the boundaries for what are necessary, their design task becomes easier and their work more proficient.</p>

<p>If this job is done well, then designers can create systems and applications that scale and that are more flexible and adaptable to changing user needs, because everything is proactively flagged for usage, rather than being negatively limited, with access then added after the fact. This approach may also help to minimize the burden on system administrators by reducing the need for constant permission updates and access control changes. And it’s all done while still maintaining a high level of security.</p>

<p>Besides improving administrator workload, the system can also create better user experiences: if a user prooactively has access to everything that they need, they’ll never bump up against barriers in a system. This can help to reduce the risk of human error and increase user satisfaction by empowering users with the authority they need to perform their tasks effectively. It creates a more “humane” and thus more resilient system.</p>

<p>A necessary access system can extend these necessary privilege and necessary authority advantages to digital data. It does so by defining what data each system needs to operate rather than what data each individual is willing to release. Now perhaps a user won’t be willing to release the data in question, but this creates the foundation needed for a negotiation, where a user can decide whether he wants to use a system or not. It also ensures that the user knows what data he’s releasing, thanks to the improved user experience of the positvely oriented system. Since this sort of negotiation is crucial for credential systems, necessary access offers the potential of improving the whole space.</p>

 A Summary in Brief 

<p>The differences between these six design patterns can be subtle. Here’s how each one offers a slightly different way to consider computer security:</p>

 
   Least Privilege. Minimize permissions to what’s necessary for a task. 
   Least Authority. Minimize permissions, but consider transitive authority. 
   Least Access. Minimize data access to what’s necessary for a task, considering transitive authority. 
   Necessary Privilege. Provide permissions necessary for a task. 
   Necessary Authority. Provide permissions and consider transitive authority. 
   Necessary Access. Provide data access necessary for a task, considering transitive authority. 
 

 One Last Flip-Flop 

<p>Turning design patterns inside out forces us to think differently and creates new insights into how to solve security problems.</p>

<p>Turning the “least” design patterns inside-out involves a shift in focus from limiting access and authority to enabling access and authority in a controlled and strategic way. It allows us to identify the specific needs of users and applications and to grant access and authority accordingly, creating security designs that are more effective, efficient, and user-friendly.</p>

<p>And privacy be damned.</p>
<p>See, there is an iron law for every new technology: What can be done will be done. And a corollary that says, —until it’s clear what shouldn’t be done.&nbsp; Let’s call those Stage One and Stage Two.</p>
<p>With respect to safety from surveillance in our cars, we’re at Stage One.</p>
<p>For Exhibit A, read what <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/author/6389/ray-schultz/">Ray Schultz</a> says in <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/388956/can-radio-time-be-bought-with-real-time-bidding-i.html">Can Radio Time Be Bought With Real-Time Bidding? iHeartMedia is Working On It</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>HeartMedia hopes to offer real-time bidding for its 860+ radio stations in 160 markets, enabling media buyers to buy audio ads the way they now buy digital.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have the capabilities to do real-time bidding and programmatic on the broadcast side,” said Rich Bressler, president and COO of iHeart Media, during the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, according to Radio Insider.</p>
<p>Bressler did not offer specifics or a timeline. He added: “If you look at broadcasters in general, whether they’re video or audio, I don’t think anyone else is going to have those capabilities out there.”</p>
<p>“The ability, whenever it comes, would include data-infused buying, programmatic trading and attribution,” the report adds.</p>
<p>The Trade Desk lists iHeart Media as one of its programmatic audio partners.</p>
<p>Audio advertising allows users to integrate their brands into their audiences’ “everyday routines in a distraction-free environment, creating a uniquely personalized ad experience around their interests,” the Trade Desk says.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trade_Desk">The Trade Desk</a> “specializes in real-time programmatic marketing automation technologies, products, and services, designed to personalize digital content delivery to users.” Translation: “We’re in the surveillance business.”</p>
<p>Never mind that there is negative demand for surveillance by the surveilled. Push-back has been going on for decades.&nbsp; <a href="https://doc.searls.com/the-adblock-war/">Here are 154 pieces I’ve written on the topic since 2008</a>.</p>
<p>One might think radio is ill-suited for surveillance because it’s an offline medium. Peopler listen more to actual radios than to computers or phones. Yes, some listening is online; but&nbsp; not much, relatively speaking. For example, here is the bottom of the <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb009">current radio ratings for the San Francisco market</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb009"></a></p>
<p>Those numbers are fractions of one percent of total listening in the country’s most streaming-oriented market.</p>
<p>So how are iHeart and The Trade Desk going to personalize radio ads?&nbsp; Well, here is a meaningful excerpt from<a href="https://www.insideradio.com/free/iheart-to-offer-real-time-bidding-for-its-broadcast-ad-inventory/article_95861ff4-4e19-11ee-b044-b346721c7d1f.html">&nbsp;iHeart To Offer Real-Time Bidding For Its Broadcast Ad Inventory</a>, which ran earlier this month at&nbsp;Inside Radio:</p>
<blockquote><p>The biggest challenge at iHeartMedia isn’t attracting new listeners, it’s doing a better job monetizing the sprawling audience it already has. As part of ongoing efforts to sell advertising the way marketers want to transact, it now plans to bring real-time bidding to its 850 broadcast radio stations, top company management said Thursday.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have the capabilities to do real-time bidding and programmatic on the broadcast side,” President and COO Rich Bressler said during an appearance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference. “If you look at broadcasters in general, whether they’re video or audio, I don’t think anyone else is going to have those capabilities out there.”</p>
<p>Real-time bidding is a subcategory of programmatic media buying in which ads are bought and sold in real time on a per-impression basis in an instant auction. Pittman and Bressler didn’t offer specifics on how this would be accomplished other than to say the company is currently building out the technology as part of a multi-year effort to allow advertisers to buy iHeart inventory the way they buy digital media advertising. That involves data-infused buying and programmatic trading, along with ad targeting and campaign attribution.</p>
<p>Radio’s largest group has also moved away from selling based on rating points to transacting on audience impressions, and migrated from traditional demographics to audiences or cohorts. It now offers advertisers 800 different prepopulated audience segments, ranging from auto intenders to moms that had a baby in the last six months…</p>
<p>Advertisers buy iHeart’s ad inventory “in pieces,” Pittman explained, leaving “holes in between” that go unsold. “Digital-like buying for broadcast radio is the key to filling in those holes,” he added…</p>
<p>…there has been no degradation in the reach of broadcast radio. The degradation has been in a lot of other media, but not radio. And the reason is because what we do is fundamentally more important than it’s ever been: we keep people company.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Buried in that rah-rah is a plan to spy on people in their cars. Because surveillance systems are built into every new car sold. In <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/">Privacy Nightmare on Wheels’: Every Car Brand Reviewed By Mozilla — Including Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota — Flunks Privacy Test</a>, Mozilla pulls together a mountain of findings about just how much modern cars spy on their drivers and passengers, and then pass personal information on to many other parties. Here is one relevant screen grab:</p>
<p><a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/what-data-does-my-car-collect-about-me-and-where-does-it-go/"></a></p>
<p>As for consent? When you’re using a browser or an app, you’re on the global Internet, where the GDPR, the CCPA, and other privacy laws apply, meaning that websites and apps have to make a show of requiring consent to what you don’t want. But cars have no UI for that. All their computing is behind the dashboard where you can’t see it and can’t control it. So the car makers can go nuts gathering fuck-all, while you’re almost completely in the dark about having your clueless ass sorted into one or more of Bob Pittman’s 800 target categories. Or worse, typified personally as a category of one.</p>
<p>Of course, the car makers won’t cop to any of this. On the contrary, they’ll pretend they are clean as can be. Here is how Mozilla describes the situation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many car brands engage in “privacy washing.” Privacy washing is the act of pretending to protect consumers’ privacy while not actually doing so — and many brands are guilty of this. For example, several have signed on to the automotive <a href="https://www.autosinnovate.org/innovation/Automotive%20Privacy/Consumer_Privacy_Principlesfor_VehicleTechnologies_Services-03-21-19.pdf">Consumer Privacy Protection Principles</a>. But these principles are nonbinding and created by the automakers themselves. Further, signatories don’t even follow their own principles, like Data Minimization (i.e. collecting only the data that is needed).</p>
<p>Meaningful consent is nonexistent. Often, “consent” to collect personal data is presumed by simply being a passenger in the car. For example, Subaru states that by being a passenger, you are considered a user — and by being a user, you have consented to their privacy policy. Several car brands also note that it is a driver’s responsibility to tell passengers about the vehicle’s privacy policies.</p>
<p>Autos’ privacy policies and processes are especially bad. Legible privacy policies are uncommon, but they’re exceptionally rare in the automotive industry. Brands like Audi and Tesla feature policies that are confusing, lengthy, and vague. Some brands have more than five different privacy policy documents, an unreasonable number for consumers to engage with; Toyota has 12. Meanwhile, it’s difficult to find a contact with whom to discuss privacy concerns. Indeed, 12 companies representing 20 car brands didn’t even respond to emails from Mozilla researchers.</p></blockquote>
<p>And, “Nineteen (76%) of the car companies we looked at say they can sell your personal data.”</p>
<p>To iHeart? Why not? They’re in the market.</p>
<p>And, of course, you are not.</p>
<p>Hell, you have access to none of that data. There’s what the dashboard tells you, and that’s it.</p>
<p>As for advice? For now, all I have is this: buy an old car.</p>

Everledger was quick to tap into the power of Hyperledger Fabric to power its Origin Program, which traces each diamond's journey from its origin deep within the Earth until it arrives, ready to wear, at a customer. At the heart of Origin lies Everledger’s cutting-edge blockchain platform, which meticulously documents and verifies every step of this transformative voyage. And, at the heart of that blockchain sits Hyperledger Fabric.</p>

<p>Condatis delivers bespoke Identity and Access Management solutions designed to simplify onboarding, enhance security, and boost overall business efficiency for clients globally.<br></p><p>The company is a leading systems integrator for Microsoft Azure in the UK, and is one of the partners involved in delivering the National Health Service (NHS) Digital Staff Passport for the past three years. <br></p><p>We caught up with founder and CTO, Chris Eckl, to hear about how the service began life in the midst of the pandemic, and how it is evolving to support broader NHS objectives and use cases. &nbsp; <br></p><p>The NHS Digital Staff Passport has an interesting history. How did the project come about? <br></p><p>Staff onboarding can take a long time in the NHS. There are hundreds of Trusts (local healthcare organizations) and senior staff have many credentials. Doctors were turning up with briefcases full of paper every time they needed to move to a new location. <br></p><p>We were planning some hackathons in December 2019 together with our sister company Sitekit and Interopen (a group aiming to accelerate interoperability in the UK healthcare sector) to explore how decentralized identity could help address this. </p><p>Then the pandemic hit. <br></p><p>Suddenly, the NHS was facing hotspots of high demand around the country. They needed to move staff around a lot quicker, and to have them working in the new organization from Day One. <br></p><p>We saw that a decentralized approach was the right direction. Give the doctor or nurse their own data and they can share it directly with the new employer, without the need for Human Resources (HR) to manage everything.<br></p><p>What solution did you implement initially and how has it evolved?<br></p><p>Because of our long experience building Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, we suggested we could stand something up quickly. First, we went through this legal exploration of how to do the staff onboarding in a new way. The base system was built in six weeks and the COVID-19 Digital Staff Passport went live in summer 2020. <br></p><p>Every NHS Trust that opted in got their own instance. At first the aim was to ensure COVID hotspots had enough staff. The ‘sending’ Trust’s HR team put the staff member’s credentials into a Verifiable Credential (VC), then physically visited the ‘receiving’ Trust to authorize the secondment.<br></p><p>Later in the project, it became more about ensuring all immunization facilities are staffed. We also moved from face-to-face governance meetings to Skype, and connected to the Electronic Staff Record (ESR), a common HR system. &nbsp;</p><p>We’ve built in a lot more automation since the early days. <br></p><p>Please can you describe the key technology pieces that sit behind the NHS Digital Staff Passport, and Condatis’ role in delivering these &nbsp;<br></p><p>Microsoft Entra is now being used to issue and verify credentials, but the NHS wants to ensure staff are not forced to use any particular wallet. Condatis developed an OpenID Connect (OIDC) bridge we call the Credentials Gateway, that can communicate with many wallet providers and allows the NHS to work with a single integrator partner, as well as enabling users to choose their wallet. <br></p><p>A key piece is the trust layer that underpins communication between wallet and verifier. The issuers’ Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) were initially anchored on the Sovrin network. This is now moving to did:web, as credential holders don’t need their own identifiers (Editor’s note: this method works by hosting an issuer’s DID document on a company website domain, proving the DID’s owner controls the domain and is affiliated with the company). &nbsp; <br></p><p>There’s also a need for a trust register and a revocation register, so verifiers know they can trust the issuer of a credential, and that it is still valid. Condatis is working on both of those pieces. <br></p><p>What is the current status of the project, and what’s the future direction? <br></p><p>We have a successful system in place that’s been used since summer 2020, and was really helpful in enabling the COVID-19 immunization program to be delivered. <br></p><p>The NHS has used this experience to create a framework for a long-term Digital Staff Passport.<br></p><p>The program is moving into a public Beta phase over the autumn (Editor’s note: a full roll-out is expected by August 2025*). The current system will be decommissioned and replaced with a new solution encompassing the full identity lifecycle of a healthcare professional, from when they graduate and do placements, to getting registered with their professional body, right-to-work checks and continuing professional development, all using Verifiable Credentials. It’s also moving into access credentials for digital services used by NHS staff. <br></p><p>The ecosystem is expanding (for example, enabling more wallet providers to participate) and Condatis and Sitekit have been retained as partners. <br></p><p>What lessons have been learned during this journey? <br></p><p>The current program has provided a lot of insight about how to do things better. For example, we ended up with a lot of data fields in the credentials. Now we’re looking to use more specific credentials and combine them in compound proofs. We’ve also done important work with Microsoft, Evernym (now part of Gen Digital) and Yoti on how different wallets can interoperate. <br></p><p>Another learning has been around the governance process for staff secondments. There are many legal and HR challenges, such as who needs to agree to what in a secondment. &nbsp;<br></p><p>There’s also the question of how to establish trust between issuers and verifiers. Each identity platform only goes so far. We’re aiming to codify the trust framework in the Credentials Gateway and to make it more modular, so it’s replicated on all partner nodes.<br></p><p>How has DIF membership helped? <br></p><p>We’ve been a DIF member for a long time. The work on Presentation Exchange (PE) in particular is important to us, and has helped us address some of the interoperability challenges around exchanging credentials. </p><p></p><p>*Source: NHS Long Term Workforce Plan <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nhs-long-term-workforce-plan-v1.2.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nhs-long-term-workforce-plan-v1.2.pdf</a><br><br><br><br><br></p>

<p>We’ve been in an uphill fight to empower people—customers—in online markets where the prevailing belief is that captive customers are more valuable than free ones. (The value of free customers is well-understood, though not always respected, in offline markets.) And we’ve been in this fight for more than seventeen years.</p>
<p>But now AI is&nbsp;<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=AI&amp;hl=en">all the craze</a>.</p>
<p>Question: Can AI help VRM? And vice versa?</p>
<p>Think about&nbsp;what would happen if people had their own AI systems, working for them and not for companies whose business is selling you something (e.g. Amazon), pushing advertising at you (e.g. Google), or trapping you in their walled garden (e.g. Apple)? Why not have our own AI, to help us make better sense of our contacts, our calendars, our health, financial, property, travel, and other kinds of data? And then, when the need arises, have our personal AI help us make well-informed decisions about what to buy, how, and where, without being biased by marketers and their bots on the other side?</p>
<p>Those are just a few questions we’ll be visiting two Mondays from now, October 9, at VRM Day in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. The time frame will be 9am to 4pm. There is also plenty of parking (the Museum is otherwise closed on Mondays).</p>
<p>We’ll visit other questions that come up, of course. And participants with something to show off are free to do that as well. And some will, especially with <a href="http://iiworkshop.org/">IIW</a>&nbsp;happening the following three days, also at the Computer History Museum.</p>

<p>The world moves. Technology advances. We find ourselves standing at crossroads, staring at paths paved by Big Gov and Big Tech. Both promise the same thing: a digital ID for the new age. But the truth? It’s found somewhere else – in Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Here’s why.</p>



<p>Big Gov has strength. It has power. But with that power comes weight. The heavy bureaucracy makes change slow, like an old bull trying to keep pace with sprightly calves. Big Gov means centralized control. It means data housed in a single barn, a target for those with ill intentions. It’s a single point of failure in a vast digital landscape. Too risky.</p>



<p>Then there’s Big Tech. Sleek. Modern. But with its shine comes opacity. Behind the gleaming surface, data gets traded, often without consent. With Big Tech, control is elsewhere, not with the individual. The profits, the power, they flow upward, leaving the user, the real owner of the data, out in the cold.</p>



<p>SSI? It’s different. It’s like the open plains. Vast. Decentralized. SSI gives control back to the individual. It’s your identity, your data. You decide who sees it, who doesn’t. It’s not stored in one barn or controlled by one entity. It’s spread out, secure, like stars scattered across the night sky.</p>



<p>With SSI, trust is inherent. Transactions are transparent. You know where your data goes, and who’s knocking at your digital door. There’s no middleman. No ulterior motives. It’s just you and your identity, standing strong.</p>



<p>The world is complex. Digital identity shouldn’t add to that complexity. It should be straightforward, transparent, and secure. It should be in the hands of the one it belongs to. That’s the simple truth.</p>



<p>In the end, it’s a matter of trust. Do you trust a heavy system, slow to change, susceptible to breaches? Do you trust shiny corporations, with their hidden motives and centralized power?</p>



<p>Or do you trust yourself?</p>



<p>The answer seems clear. The world moves. And as it does, may it move towards the simplicity and truth of Self-Sovereign Identity.</p>

<p></p>      DENSO, Honda, and Nissan to Co-Chair New MOBI Working Group           <p>Circular Economy and the Global Battery Passport Working Group unites efforts to drive solutions for comprehensive circularity in global supply chains.</p>
          <p>MOBI is proud to introduce the co-chairs of our highly anticipated Circular Economy and the Global Battery Passport (CE-GBP) Working Group (WG). The WG aims to set interoperability standards and build the foundational infrastructure for comprehensive circularity in global supply chains, with an initial focus on building a decentralized Global Battery Passport System (GBPS).</p>
<p>As organizations worldwide strive to meet global sustainability goals, enhance energy efficiency, and pave the way for long-term supply chain resilience, it is critical to drive the adoption of circular business practices from product sourcing to manufacturing, use, end-of-life, and beyond. This transformative shift towards end-to-end circularity represents a pivotal moment in our collective efforts to address urgent environmental and economic challenges.</p>
<p>Circularity in the battery industry remains a pressing concern for supply chain stakeholders as battery usage proliferates in various industries — including EV production and renewable energy storage. Emerging regulations worldwide emphasize battery traceability and highlight the need for a standardized approach to promote circularity, safety, and quality assurance throughout the battery supply chain.</p>
<p>Global policies regarding batteries, like the US Treasury’s Section 30D Guidance on EV Tax Credits and the EU Battery Regulation, mandate digital recordkeeping to track battery life cycles, underscoring the need for a global battery passport — a digital credential containing key information about the battery’s composition, state of health, history, and more.</p>
<p>Ensuring battery supply chain circularity requires a new system built on global interoperability standards — one that enables verifiable, end-to-end information traceability throughout a battery’s lifecycle and permits privacy-preserving coordination between supply chain stakeholders (public and private). MOBI and its members are developing a decentralized GBPS to facilitate seamless communication in production management, maintenance, safety, second and third-life uses, and recycling while meeting consumer demands and ensuring regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>Released in June 2023, MOBI’s Guideline for Implementation of a Decentralized Global Battery Passport System marked a critical milestone towards this goal. The CE-GBP Working Group is set to build on this foundation through the creation of new standards and the development of GBPS infrastructure. Members of the WG will also focus on implementation of the GBPS and defining the next steps for interoperability and industry adoption.</p>
<p>The CE-GBP Working Group is supported by our dedicated working group members: Anritsu, ASJade Tech, Aucnet, AWS, BMW, CEVT, Dana, DENSO, Ford, Hitachi America Ltd, Honda, HIOKI, ITOCHU, Mazda, Nissan, Orico, Politecnico di Torino, ParkyMyFleet, Quantstamp, Reply, Stellantis, SyncFab, State Farm, Toyota Industries Corporation (TICO), Tradelog, Vitesco, and Vinturas.</p>
           Meet the CE-GBP Co-Chairs   <p>Roger Berg — Vice President, DENSO North America R&amp;D: “I embrace the prospect of collaborating once more with industry experts in crafting a universally adaptable sustainability battery passport solution for the evolving electric vehicle (EV) landscape. MOBI stands with its members at a pivotal juncture, and all of us are acutely aware of the profound significance of this work for the broader industry.”</p>
<p>Christian Köbel — Sr. Project Engineer, Honda R&amp;D Europe: “Web3 principles and blockchain hold the potential to facilitate the implementation of upcoming battery regulations, such as reporting CO2 emissions embedded in a battery, or providing a battery product passport with verifiable stakeholders and data. The time is now right to evaluate this potential and exploit it further, towards future interoperable ecosystems for battery passports and data sharing.”</p>
<p>Yoshinori Suzue — Sr. Manager, Nissan North America Inc.: “I am honored to serve as a CE-GBP Working Group Co-chair with MOBI, which is helping to drive mobility innovation toward Circular Economy and create an automotive industry ecosystem that is more sustainable for all.”</p>
<p>About MOBI</p>
<p>MOBI is a global nonprofit smart mobility consortium. We are creating standards for trusted decentralized identities (e.g. vehicles, people, businesses), data interoperability, business automation, and MOBI Trusted Trip. MOBI and members are building the Web3 digital infrastructure for connected ecosystems and IoT commerce. Our goal is to make transportation more efficient, equitable, decentralized, and sustainable while preserving data privacy for users and providers alike.</p>

<p>‘<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DINZ-Response_-Biometrics-discussion-document-2023.pdf">Digital Identity NZ’s submission</a>&nbsp;to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/publications/guidance-resources/biometrics-and-privacy/">potential code of practice for Biometrics</a>&nbsp;is possibly the most comprehensive response to a submission on Biometrics ever done in Aotearoa in recent times’. In my message to DINZ’s Executive Council to confirm the submission, that was my assessment of the depth and quality of the mahi produced by DINZ’s Biometrics Special Interest Group (SIG) and two further experts – one an indigenous rights advocate working with Māori data experts in this space, the other with deep knowledge and insights into Māori tikanga and Māori Data Sovereignty – both of whom hugely informed this submission. Our subsequent&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2023/09/11/digital-identity-new-zealand-dinz-advocates-for-a-thoughtful-approach-to-potential-biometric-regulation-in-new-zealand/">press release</a>&nbsp;was picked up by RNZ’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/businessnews/audio/2018906570/midday-business-news-for-12-september-2023">Midday Business News</a>&nbsp;at 1’56” and a further post on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/497828/biometric-industry-warns-that-regulation-may-bring-unintended-consequences?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=0eab72ff5e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-0eab72ff5e-">website</a>.</p>



<p>Our submission maintained that the Privacy Act 2020 remains the most appropriate regulatory instrument for all personal information, provided Privacy Impact Assessments are made mandatory and that definitions are clear. Standards based clear guidance co-created with industry would both improve education, provide confidence for industry, and maintain convenience and benefits for people while avoiding unintended consequences for them such as increased friction in their online experience and hampering technological improvement for industry. It’s far better to regulate the rare exceptional use cases than regulate the whole domain and have a plethora of exceptions. To follow up our submission, one DINZ member has a blog/podcast in the works on how Privacy Enhancing Technologies can retain the benefits of biometrics while protecting people from potential harm. Look out for it in the coming months.</p>



<p>All of our submissions, reports and other mahi are published&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/submissions/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=0eab72ff5e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-0eab72ff5e-">on our website under Our Work</a>&nbsp;including yesterday’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DINZ-Submission-Targeted-Engagement-DISTF-Regulations.pdf">submission</a>&nbsp;to the Department of Internal Affairs’&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DISTF-Regulations-Discussion-Paper.pdf">Discussion Paper on the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Regulations</a>.</p>



<p>While the topic above is a case in point, it’s clear that in recent years there’s been a downward trend across public sector agencies in retaining deep technical expertise and operational experience in their respective knowledge domains they are responsible for. It’s understandable given the pressure to reduce public spending. Even workarounds to bring in experts on short-term contracts are caught up in spending cuts. Election rhetoric around public sector cuts oversimplifies the expertise vs budget challenge that agencies face. As a consequence we see high level material developed in-house by agencies put out for public consultation with the ensuing submission-consultation-submission back and forth. It’s not a great way to develop anything because it wastes all parties’ precious time and effort typically ending in suboptimal outcomes and unintended consequences. But it’s the symptom of a deeper cause rooted in how we have traditionally developed and implemented policy in Aotearoa. Simply put, we have to start ‘right-sizing’ for the reality of our public expenditure budget. The public sector co-creating with industry (just as more effort has been made in recent years to co-create with Māori) would motivate people and organisations to step up and deliver better outcomes for all. Of course this challenges long standing public sector policies to avoid conflicts of interest and bias that have led to the current approach but we simply have to think in more modern terms about how we deliver really good outcomes in technically complex domains with minimal budgets. It’s not just an issue and opportunity for digital identity and its related technical domains such as Biometrics. It’s a macro-economic issue though most easily observed in digital contexts. The NZTech Alliance, of which DINZ is a part, continues to press for change. Please support us to drive a co-creation agenda for better outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Open Wallet Foundation has accepted a proposal by Findynet and TNO to take ownership and control of the open-source digital wallet and agent comparison matrix and establish a new special interest group to maintain it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The digital wallet and agent overview is a framework that enables the comparison of digital wallets based on their characteristics, such as the technical capabilities they support. Digital wallets enable the holder to store credentials and to make presentations to verifiers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tno-ssi-lab.github.io/wallet-overview/">SSI wallet overview</a> of the comparison framework, hosted in TNO’s Github repository, is focused on cloud and mobile applications for holders that can be used to store, manage, and present verifiable credentials. The <a href="https://findyfi.github.io/wallet-overview/">SSI agent overview</a>, forked into Findynet’s Github repository, extends the scope to include agents that can issue and verify&nbsp;verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>The overview was born when the Dutch research organization for applied science (TNO) began evaluating various digital wallets. One driver was to prioritize the development of connectors in the <a href="https://eassi.ssi-lab.nl/">TNO EASSI gateway</a>, but also to provide an independent and transparent overview. TNO invited SSI wallet vendors to fill in the data for the overview in order to keep the data as correct and up-to-date as possible.</p>
<p>The second version was developed when Findynet needed to evaluate SSI solutions for enterprise use. Findynet added more characteristics and functionality to the framework. Some of the Findynet additions are also merged into TNO’s version.</p>
<p>Together, TNO and Findynet <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/tac/issues/56">proposed</a> that the OpenWallet Foundation (OWF) adopt the repository. We also proposed a new Special Interest Group (SIG) to be formed to further develop and maintain the digital wallet and agent overviews. The proposals were <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18fnNIsJSsyLVghINBK4iTqFP6UYacCJjP7jnDjxZcGw/edit#slide=id.g27a1c9067e9_0_0">accepted</a> on September 20th, 2023 in the OWF Technical Advisory Council meeting.</p>
<p>The new group should discuss the terminology and the scoping of the overview – whether the holder wallets and the issuer and verifier agents should be contained in one overview, or be split up into two.</p>
<p>TNO is an independent research organization making knowledge serve the common good.</p>
<p>Findynet Cooperative is building infrastructure for trusted communications and self-sovereign identity in Finland.</p>
<p>The OpenWallet Foundation is a consortium of companies and non-profit organization collaborating to drive global adoption of open, secure, and interoperable digital wallet solutions as well as providing access to expertise and advice.</p>

<p>Andrew Shikiar is quoted in the lead story of The Green Sheet: “Simply put, verification is the process of confirming someone’s identity. Authentication is the process of recognizing someone’s identity,” he said. “The easiest way to think about it is that you verify someone’s identity less often—usually at the point of account creation—to confirm they are who they say they are. You then authenticate them at subsequent sign-ins to confirm the person logging in is the person who created the account.”</p>

  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>Where there is light, there are shadows. The relationship between an object, its shadow, and the illuminating light source(s) is geometrically simple, and yet it’s deceptively difficult to get just right in a manipulated or synthesized image. In the image below, the bottle's cast shadow is clearly incongruous with the shape of the bottle. Such obvious errors in a shadow are easy to spot, but more subtle differences can be harder to detect.</p>

  <p>Below are two images in which the bottle and its cast shadow are slightly different. (The rest of the scene is identical). Can you tell which is consistent with the lighting in the rest of the scene?</p>















































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  

                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>The geometry of cast shadows is dictated by the 3D shape and location of an object and the illuminating light(s). This relationship is wonderfully simple: A point on an object, its corresponding shadow, and the light source responsible for the shadow all lie on a single line.</p><p>Because (in the absence of lens distortion) straight lines in the 3D scene are imaged to straight lines in the 2D image, this basic constraint holds in the image. Locate any point on a shadow and its corresponding point on the object, and draw a line through them. Repeat for as many clearly defined shadow and object points as possible, and for an authentic image, all the lines will intersect at one point — the location of the illuminating light.</p><p>Below are the results of this simple geometric analysis applied to the two images above, clearly revealing the fake.</p>















































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  

                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>From shadows to reflections</p><p>As a student taking the subway to work each morning, I would stare out the window and watch the tunnel walls whiz by superimposed atop reflections of my fellow passengers. On occasion someone’s reflection would catch my eye, and I would look back into the subway car to get a better view. But I would invariably not see them where I thought they would be given the position of their reflection on the window. As a budding image and vision scientist this really bothered me — how could it be that it was so hard to reason about something so simple as a reflection in a window?</p><p>Below are two images of the same basic scene. The reflection of the table and garbage can are slightly different; everything else is the same. Can you tell which is correct? </p>















































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  

                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>The geometry of reflections is fairly straightforward. Consider standing in front of a mirror and looking at your reflection. An imaginary straight line connects each point on your body with its reflection. These lines are perpendicular to the mirror’s surface and are parallel to one another. When photographed at an oblique angle, however, these imaginary lines will not remain parallel but will converge to a single point. This is the same reason why railroad tracks that are parallel in the world appear to converge in a photograph.</p><p>This geometry of reflections suggests a simple forensic technique for verifying the integrity of reflections. Locate any point on an object and its corresponding point on the reflection, and draw a line through them. Repeat for as many clearly defined object and reflection points as possible. As you do this, you will find that all the lines should intersect at one point.&nbsp;</p><p>Below are the results of this simple geometric analysis, which clearly reveals the second reflection to be the fake.</p>















































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  

                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  



  



  <p>Notice that this geometric analysis is exactly the same as that used to analyze shadows. The reason is that in both cases we are exploiting basic principles of perspective projection that dictate the projection of straight lines.</p><p>In practice, there are some limitations to a manual application of this geometric analysis. We must take care to select appropriately matched points on the shadow/reflection and the object. We can best achieve this when the object has a distinct shape, like the corner of a cube or the tip of a cone. Depending on the scene geometry, the constraint lines may be nearly parallel, making the computation of their intersection vulnerable to slight error in selecting matched points. And, it may be necessary to remove any lens distortion in the image that causes straight lines to be imaged as curved lines that will then no longer intersect at a single point.</p><p>From Adobe Photoshop to generative AI</p><p>When we first developed these techniques, we were primarily concerned with images that were manipulated with Photoshopto, for example, digitally add a person or object and its shadow or reflection. Because our own visual system is not particularly sensitive to inconsistent shadows and reflections (see item 1 in the Further Reading section below) and because it is difficult to precisely match the 3D scene geometry within 2D photo editing software, this technique has proven quite effective at uncovering fakes.</p><p>Classic computer-generated imagery is produced by modeling 3D scene geometry, the surrounding illumination, and a virtual camera. As a result, rendered images accurately capture the geometry and physics of natural scenes, including shadows and reflections. In contrast, AI-generated imagery is produced by learning the statistical distribution of natural scenes from a large set of real images. Without an explicit 3D model of the world, it is natural to wonder how accurately synthesized content captures the geometry of shadows and reflections.&nbsp;</p><p>Although we are still early in the age of generative AI, today's AI-generated images seem to struggle to produce perspectively correct shadows and reflections. Below is a typical example, generated using OpenAI's DALL-E2, in which the shadows are inconsistent (yellow lines), the reflections are impossibly mismatched and missing, and the shadows in the reflection are oriented in exactly the wrong direction. (See item 2 in the Further Reading section below for a more detailed analysis.</p><p>Even in the absence of explicit 3D modeling of objects, surfaces, and lighting — as found in traditional CGI-rendering — AI-generated images exhibit many of the properties of natural scenes. At the same time, cast shadows and reflections in mirrored surfaces are not fully consistent with the expected perspective geometry of natural scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>The trend in generative AI has been that increasingly larger synthesis engines yield increasingly more realistic images. As such, it may just be a matter of time before generative AI will learn to create images with full-blown perspective consistency. Until that time, however, this geometric forensic analysis may prove useful.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>1. S.J. Nightingale, K.A. Wade, H. Farid, and D.G.

Citopia and the ITN services are business-to-business (B2B) only. Together, Citopia and the ITN provide the necessary infrastructure for node operators to build out secure, seamless, globally compliant web services and applications. MOBI membership is required to operate a node on Citopia and/or the ITN. <a href="https://dlt.mobi/participate/">Contact us to learn more about becoming a node operator</a></p>
     <a></a>         Overview of the Pilot and the Problem It Solves           <p>The eTitling/eRegistration Automation Pilot (“Pilot”) is spearheaded by MOBI’s <a href="https://dlt.mobi/mobi-working-groups/">Finance, Securitization, and Smart Contract (FSSC) Working Group (WG)</a> with contributions from Accenture, Altaventure, Amazon Web Services, BMW Bank, CEVT, Connections Insights, CO-OP Financial Services, ConsenSys, D.E. Consulting, DENSO, DMI, Ford Credit, Global Debt Registry, GM Financial, Honda, IOTA, Itochu, National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), Nissan Motor Acceptance Company, On the Road Lending, Orrick, Quant Network, Quantstamp, Reply, RouteOne, Southeast Toyota Finance, Spring Free EV, Stellantis Financial Services, Tezos Foundation, Toyota Industries Corporation, Trade Log, and USAA.</p>
<p>Across the U.S., there are hundreds or even thousands of jurisdictions with unique databases and processes for handling registration and titling. While organizations in some of these jurisdictions have begun digitizing certain processes, it is difficult to automate eTitling/eRegistration across state lines with existing centralized platforms and databases. The sheer amount of stakeholders involved means that the frictional cost of trust is extremely high, and centralized solutions lack the interoperability and data security needed to address the challenges facing the ecosystem. Solving these pain points requires a secure solution that can be easily and cheaply adopted across all jurisdictions rather than one that functions at a state, county, or municipal jurisdiction level. </p>
<p>MOBI leverages standards-based <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twins™ (SSDTs)™</a> — decentralized universal translators — for ecosystem interoperability. SSDTs™ can be used by stakeholders within their existing applications to increase the efficiency of registration and titling for vehicles at the point of purchase or transfer. In Phase 1 of the Pilot, the FSSC WG will demonstrate privacy-preserving multiparty business automation for eTitling across jurisdictional and organizational lines. SSDTs™ will be used for communication interoperability without the need to build new infrastructure. The WG is currently drafting high-level requirements for the pilot. Phase 2 will include real-world implementation.</p>
                    Stakeholders:    Vehicle Manufacturers(OEMs); Financial Institutions (FIs) /Lenders &amp; Servicers; Dealerships; Motor Vehicle Authorities (MVAs) / Third party registration &amp; titling providers (RTPs); State Authorized Inspectors, Department of Justice National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (DoJ NMVTIS); Third Party Data Consolidators; Fleet Operators; and Consumers.                Our Innovative Solution        Self-Sovereign Digital Twins™: trusted decentralized identity for interoperability and business automation   <p>Currently, digital transactions rely on identities issued by centralized platforms to prove their credentials. However, in addition to being vulnerable to fraud, identity theft, and data leaks, centralized approaches to identity management fail to address the trust problems created by the rise of decentralized services, IOT, and Generative AI. As digitization advances, it will become increasingly challenging — and costly — to verify data authenticity, secure digital perimeters, and ensure cross-border regulation compliance. This is critical for state agencies like MVAs and regulated lenders, who are responsible for executing the bulk of the registration/titling process.</p>
<p>Overcoming these challenges calls for a new solution. The White House’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf">Federal Zero Trust Strategy</a> (2022) underscores this need by directing federal agencies to adopt a Zero Trust framework by the end of FY 2024. Zero Trust requires every entity to authenticate and validate every other entity for every single digital transaction at all times. Since this is not possible through Web2/centralized means, we must leverage Web3 technologies and principles to unlock privacy-preserving ecosystem interoperability using Citopia <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twins™ (SSDTs™)</a>.</p>
           What are SSDTs™?   <p>SSDTs™ are portable digital twins that can automatically authenticate identity and selectively disclose pertinent data for Web3 transactions at the edge. SSDTs™ combine standards from W3C, MOBI, IEEE, ISO, SAE, and others with Zero-Knowledge cryptography to offer the data privacy and autonomy needed to engage in secure, tamper-evident transactions across the connected ecosystem. SSDTs™ enable cross-industry interoperability and business automation through:</p>
        
<p>Enabling seamless verification and validation of identities and transactions</p>
    
<p>Empowering the creation of regulation-compliant data privacy solutions</p>
    
<p>Providing the ability to obtain and monetize data at the moment of transaction without the need to open up databases / store data</p>
    
<p>Serving as platform-agnostic, legacy system compatible “universal translators,” eliminating the need to build new infrastructure / APIs</p>

<p>The biometric industry is asking the privacy commissioner to develop a code of practice that will not impose regulations that stifle innovation.</p>



<p>Industry organisation Digital Identity (DINZ) was concerned regulation would introduce complexities and unintended consequences for the emerging technology.</p>



<p>DINZ executive director Colin Wallis said the industry was advocating for a code that offered strong guidance, while building awareness and education.</p>



<p>“No decision has been made yet, but our point to them was just be careful of the unintended consequences of coming in too quickly, with a lack of forethought about some of the unintended consequences,” he said.</p>



<p>“And our point was, start with beefing up guidance and support and knowledge and awareness, before beginning to try and regulate the space.”</p>



<p>Biometric information included physical and behavioural features such as faces, fingerprints, voices, and walking patterns, which could be used to verify identities online, border control, law enforcement, retail security, access control and attendance monitoring in workplaces and schools.</p>



<p>“Our response focuses on striking a balance between protecting individuals’ privacy and allowing responsible government and business use of biometric data,” Wallis said.</p>



<p>“We emphasise the importance of a thoughtful and well-informed approach to considering the potential for regulation of the use of biometrics, tailored to the unique challenges of this technology.”</p>

<p>Talk with Vladimir Vujovic, Senior Digital Innovation Manager from SICPA about product definition and value proposition of Issuer/Holder/Verifier software of SSI tech providers. Why is it hard to convey the right message to the audience coming from outside of SSI domain. How different SSI tech providers define their offering and the language they use to convey the message. What is really the value proposition of SSI tech providers who are offering their Issuer/Verifier software to the market. How big regulation initiatives like the one in Europe for eIDAS v2 are driving the market and roadmaps for SSI tech providers and how will such initiative will have impact to the rest of the world in terms of regulation, but some of the underlying technical standards. What is the place of SSI platforms in the broader Identity landscape and when are we going to see more maturity from the market. </p>

<p>Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ), an organization making expert contributions to New Zealand’s digital transformation efforts, has underlined the need to prioritize an intense awareness and education program related to the intricacies of biometrics deployment in the country.</p>



<p>This call is contained in a&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DINZ-Response_-Biometrics-discussion-document-2023.pdf">submission</a>&nbsp;by the group and it comes as the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/new-zealand-privacy-commissioner-considers-biometric-regulation-code">is considering</a>&nbsp;a code of practice that will regulate the use of the technology that has become a common feature in the daily lives of New Zealanders, according to a DINZ news release.</p>



<p>From online ID verification to border control, to law enforcement, retail security, access control and attendance monitoring in offices and schools, the deployment of biometrics in growing by the day in New Zealand and users are also getting worried about the potential risks of the technology if it is deployed improperly.</p>



<p>“Our response focuses on striking a balance between protecting individuals’ privacy and allowing responsible government and business use of biometric data. We emphasize the importance of a thoughtful and well-informed approach to considering the potential for regulation of the use of biometrics, tailored to the unique challenges of this technology,” says Colin Wallis, DINZ executive director.</p>



<p>He adds that because biometrics are increasingly taking a preponderant place in the lives of citizens, the need for “demonstrable privacy and technical expertise, alongside practical experience combined with good design and implementation, are keys to great outcomes.”</p>



<p>In the submission, DINZ advises the OPC on five key things to consider as it figures out a biometrics code of practice.</p>



<p>On privacy protection, the organization believes that users can have assurance about adequate privacy protection if privacy impact assessment as sated in the Privacy Act 2020 is made mandatory. This, it says, will help “avoid unintended consequences, elevate industry standards and prevent subpar practices.”</p>



<p>Among other things, DINZ calls for clarification on which definition of biometrics should apply to New Zealand before a code of practice is considered, suggests that regulatory changes should primarily safeguard individuals’ privacy in identification and verification processes, advises OPC to exercise caution and avoid rushing into implementing a code of practice which could trigger a change towards “compliance behaviour” that will stifle innovation.</p>



<p>“The proposals for a code could suspend, reduce, or delay use of biometric information, to the detriment of information security and customer service,” DINZ writes in response to the OPC’s question about potential unintended consequences of its regulation. “The proposals could also stunt development and innovation that would in time improve the accuracy and acceptability of less well known/trusted use cases.”</p>



<p>A similar point about the risk of stifling biometrics innovation with overly restrictive regulation has also been made by, biometrics developers like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/201910/facefirst-helps-us-lawmakers-draft-facial-recognition-privacy-regulations">FaceFirst</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/eu-preparing-tough-measures-for-ai-while-uk-and-us-take-a-slow-approach">government officials</a>, and even the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202207/with-long-road-ahead-experts-suggest-eu-ai-act-could-stifle-or-enable-biometrics-adoption">International Association of Privacy Professionals</a>.</p>



<p>The group also recommends that OPC collaborate with industry experts to co-create guidance on biometric information’s use in identification and verification.</p>

<p>Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ) has submitted a comprehensive response to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) on its consideration of a code of practice for biometrics.&nbsp;DINZ is Aotearoa’s only community dedicated to digital identity, delivering trustworthy and recognised thought leadership that influences digital identity decision-making for the common good.&nbsp;DINZ’s deep insight into the operating environment for biometrics highlights the complexities and potential unintended consequences of introducing regulation through a code rather than starting with strong guidance, awareness, and education in this field.</p>



<p>Biometric information encompasses physical and behavioural features such as faces, fingerprints, voices, and walking patterns.&nbsp;Some examples of its use include identity verification online, border control, law enforcement, retail security, access control, and attendance monitoring in workplaces and schools.</p>



<p>The increasing role of biometric technologies in the lives of New Zealanders has led to calls for greater regulation of biometrics. Other countries are also considering how best to minimise potential harm to people caused by improper use of these technologies and some have enacted specific regulatory frameworks for biometrics.&nbsp;A code (if taken forward) could change how the privacy principles in the Privacy Act apply when organisations use technology to analyse biometric information.</p>



<p>DINZ Executive Director Colin Wallis says, “Our response focuses on striking a balance between protecting individuals’ privacy and allowing responsible government and business use of biometric data. We emphasise the importance of a thoughtful and well-informed approach to considering the potential for regulation of the use of biometrics, tailored to the unique challenges of this technology.</p>



<p>“Biometrics improves the digital experiences of New Zealanders every day in both the public and private sectors. Demonstrable privacy and technical expertise, alongside practical experience combined with good design and implementation, are keys to great outcomes,” says Colin.</p>



<p>Key Points from DINZ’s Response:</p>



  Privacy Protection: DINZ believes that the Privacy Act 2020 can provide people with adequate privacy protections for biometrics if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/responsibilities/privacy-impact-assessments/">Privacy Impact Assessments&nbsp;</a>become mandatory and high-quality, clear industry co-created guidance is issued under the oversight of OPC. This approach aims to avoid unintended consequences, elevate industry standards and prevent subpar practices.  



  Clarity on Definitions: DINZ emphasises the need for consensus on which of the international definitions of biometrics will apply in New Zealand before considering a code of practice. Clear definitions across the entire domain are essential to prevent confusion and ensure alignment with global standards.  



  Focus on Identification, Verification and Classification: DINZ suggests that regulatory changes should primarily safeguard individuals’ privacy in identification and verification processes, avoiding overlap with other regulatory authorities or areas outside the Privacy Act’s jurisdiction.  



  Measured Approach: DINZ advises OPC to exercise caution and avoid rushing into implementing a code of practice. The roughly equal support for further guidance and a code indicates concerns that a rush to a code will result in a change towards ‘compliance behaviour’ that will stifle innovation, have unintended consequences, and negatively affect the positive outcomes sought by a code’s introduction.  



  Industry Expertise: DINZ recommends that OPC collaborates with industry experts to co-create guidance on biometric information’s use in identification and verification. Such collaboration ensures informed and practical guidance while enhancing OPC’s expertise in this complex field.

JSON-LD credentials that did have an @context that were being read by tooling that just did JSON could still read the credentials – it did nothing to interfere. This seems like a pretty good “let’s figure out how to live with each other” solution.</p>

      <p>A JWT-VC has three parts, and the payload contains what I would call envelope information: the data needed to know who the credential is is bound to, who made the credential, when it was made and how it can be identified.  Additionally, there is a JSON object called “vc”. Claims information is embedded inside the vc object.  A JWT-VC uses an external proof, meaning in this case that signature data is not embedded inline with the credential, the signature is detached from the credential.

      <p>JWT takes a different approach to determining the meaning of claim terms in credentials. There is an <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml">IANA registry for JWT claims</a> as a first place to look for JWT claim definitions. If the claim name isn’t in the IANA register, then the claim can be given a “give it a public name (i.e., a URI), [or] a local name (i.e., any string)”.

 VC-JWT Selective Disclosure

    <blockquote>
      <p>JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [RFC7519] can in principle be used to express Verifiable Credentials in a way that is easy to understand and process as it builds upon established web primitives.</p>

      <p>Selective Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT) [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] is a specification that introduces conventions to support selective disclosure for JWTs: For an SD-JWT document, a Holder can decide which claims to release (within bounds defined by the Issuer).</p>

      <p>SD-JWT is a superset of JWT as it can also be used when there are no selectively disclosable claims and also supports JWS JSON serialization, which is useful for long term archiving and multi signatures. However, SD-JWT itself does not define the claims that must be used within the payload or their semantics.</p>

      <p>This specification therefore uses SD-JWT and the well-established JWT content rules and extensibility model as basis for representing Verifiable Credentials with JSON payload. Those Verifiable Credentials are called SD-JWT VCs.</p>

<p>In this era of generative AI, how do we determine whether an image is human-created or machine-made?&nbsp;For the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Professor Hany Farid shares the techniques used for identifying real and synthetic images — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, environmental lighting, and GAN-generated faces. A world-renowned expert in the field of misinformation, disinformation, and digital forensics as well as an advisor to the CAI, Professor Farid explores the limits of these techniques and their part in a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the fourth article in a six-part series.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>Part 1: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">From the darkroom to generative AI</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">How realistic are AI-generated faces?</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-for-ai-generated-faces">Photo forensics for AI-generated faces</a></p>




 


  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>Classic computer-generated imagery (CGI) is produced by modeling 3D scene geometry, the surrounding illumination, and a virtual camera. As a result, rendered images accurately capture the geometry and physics of natural scenes. By contrast, AI-generated imagery is produced by learning the statistical distribution of natural scenes. Without an explicit 3D model of the world, we might expect that these images will not always accurately capture the 3D properties of natural scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>The lighting of a scene can be complex, because any number of lights can be placed in any number of positions, leading to different lighting environments. Under some fairly modest assumptions, however, it has been shown that a wide range of lighting can be modeled as a weighted sum of nine 3D lighting environments that each capture a variety of lighting patterns from different directions.</p><p>My team and I first wondered if lighting environments on AI-generated faces match those on photographic images. Next, we wondered if the lighting on multiple faces or objects in an image are the same, as would be expected in an authentic photo.</p><p>Analyzing lighting environments first requires fitting and aligning a 3D model to individual objects. Fortunately, for faces, fitting a 3D model to a single image is a problem that has largely been solved. (See article 1 in the Further Reading section.)&nbsp;</p><p>Below you’ll see a 3D model fitted to an AI-generated face. From this aligned 3D model, we can estimate the surrounding lighting environment, which reduces to nine numeric values corresponding to the weight on each of nine 3D lighting environments.</p>

This is the reverse of our <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-for-ai-generated-faces">previously described technique</a>, which was applicable to GAN-based faces but not diffusion-based faces, further highlighting the need for a wide variety of approaches.</p><p>The above analysis can be expanded to compare the lighting between two people or two objects situated side by side in an image where, in a naturally photographed scene, we expect the lighting to be the same. For this analysis, we find that diffusion-based faces and objects exhibit relatively large (but not always perceptually obvious) differences in lighting. (See article 3 in the “Further reading” section below for more details.)</p><p>The strength of this lighting analysis is that we have discovered a fairly fundamental limitation of today's AI-generated content: In the absence of explicit 3D models of the physical world, diffusion-based models struggle to create images that are internally (across multiple people/objects) and externally (as compared to photographic images) consistent. The weakness of this technique is that, unlike other approaches, it does not necessarily lend itself to a fully automatic and high-throughput analysis. The fitting of 3D models can be somewhat time intensive and require manual intervention.</p><p>Another strength of this technique is that even when made aware of the issue of lighting inconsistencies, it is not easy for an adversary to adjust the image. That is because the pattern of illumination is the result of an interaction of the 3D lighting and the 3D scene geometry, whereas most photo editing occurs in 2D. Also, as you will see in the next post, there are additional aspects to lighting that we can exploit to distinguish the real from the fake.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>[1] Y. Feng, H. Feng, M.J.

  <p>ABSTRACT: Self-Sovereign Computing is a transformative paradigm designed to empower individuals to take command of their digital journey and to uphold their dignity, human rights, and resilience online. It encourages proactive collaboration among individuals, collectives, and platforms to enhance digital autonomy and to mitigate vulnerabilities. Building on Christopher’s initial ideas of self-sovereign identity, self-sovereign computing introduces an allegory that revisits some foundational influences and recognizes self-sovereignty not just as a personal choice but as something that’s part of a larger ecosystem._</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2016, Christopher Allen authored <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">“The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>, where he introduced the concept of “Self-Sovereignty” to the world, with its ten principles. Five years later, he offered an <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/SSI-5-Years-On/">update</a> on its progress. Today, the self-sovereign community continues to evolve, with recent successes including <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/news/specifications/DIDs-Ratified/">the ratification of DIDs</a> and the passage of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">laws in Wyoming</a> that recognized self-sovereignty. Given the time that had passed, Christopher also wrote an article talking about <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.</p>

<p>Christopher’s newest look at self-sovereignty is an allegory that again revisits some of its foundational influences, recognizing self-sovereignty not just as a personal choice, but something that’s part of a larger ecosystem.</p>



 Your Digital Journey 

<p>Consider the times when you’ve felt lost in the vast and unpredictable digital sea. You’ve set out in a small ship, but your course is uncertain.</p>

<p>Despite being the rightful owner of that ship, you are a mere passenger. Your ports of call and your choice of companion vessels are not under your command but dictated by corporate behemoths that lurk beneath the waves. These unseen gatekeepers exact a continuous “toll” from you, not always in gold, but often in the currency of your personal data or by compelling you to relinquish your rights. Those behemoths control not just your data, but also your actual digital identity.</p>

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing is about finding a better way: about giving you control over your digital vessel.</p>

 Claiming Command — From Passenger to Captain 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing empowers you to claim command, to ascend from being a passenger to becoming the captain of your digital ship. This gives you the autonomy to plot your journey, to command your personal data, and to navigate digital exchanges without the burden of incessant tolls.</p>

<p>You become the rightful commander of your digital voyage and online experience.</p>

 Assembling Your Tools — Devices and Services 

<p>Your smartphone, your laptop, your smartwatch, and your digital wallet are the tools that you use to command your vessel, modern-day sextants and compasses. They help you to become a skilled navigator in the often treacherous marketplace of the digital ocean.</p>

<p>They are also powerful tools of communication that allow you to foster cooperation with other digital captains, opening up new possibilities when we self-sovereign sailors come together.</p>

<p>Tools that important must be reliable. Beyond that, they must meet our personal needs. This calls back to a time when ship makers would consult with captains about the individual needs of their vessels (just as we do in the modern day with <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salons</a>). This ensures that we can sail the digital seas safely and have control and trust in our tools.</p>

 Fostering Digital Cooperation — Unity on the High Seas 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing envisions a cooperative digital ecosystem where individuals, as digital captains, can unite. Each ship, regardless of its size, contributes to the strength of our self-sovereign fleet, enhancing autonomy and rights for every individual. They can come together against the considerable adversaries of the digital landscape.</p>

<p>There are also promises of mutual aid: Self-Sovereign Computing seeks to protect the vulnerable. If a ship is in distress, others are obligated to give it support, which might mean helping to route messages to evade censorship or just lending some bandwidth to get around a digital traffic jam.</p>

<p>In essence, Self-Sovereign Computing steers us towards a cooperative digital ecosystem, where every digital captain’s strength is amplified through unity. The result is a digital seascape where collective strength is harnessed and where collective bargaining power is pooled, to negotiate better terms, services, and experiences for all.</p>

 The Inspiration of Self-Sovereign Computing 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing stems from a blend of inspirations, some of which are shared with <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity</a>. Among the influences most important to understanding the idea of Self-Sovereign Computing are: the Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity, Living Systems Theory, Agency Law, and Maritime Law, each of which contributed to its foundational ethos.</p>

<p>The Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity play a crucial role in defining the paradigm of Self-Sovereign Computing. These principles emphasize user control and consent, the freedom of data interoperability, and the decentralization of identity authority, pushing the boundaries of individual digital autonomy.</p>

<p>Living Systems Theory speaks of inviduals having boundaries (“membranes”) that separate them from the rest of the world, but recognizes that communication occurs through that membrane. It was a foundational inspiration for Self-Sovereign Identity and is closely linked to the analogy of ships upon the sea.</p>

<p>Agency Law offers the concept of fiduciary duties that dictate a relationship of trust, responsibility, and user priority. Under this framework, digital tools and platforms are required to grant a duty of loyalty and care to their user: acting in their best interest, respecting privacy, protecting data, and ensuring users maintain control and authority over their digital identities and personal information.</p>

<p>Maritime Law contributes principles of mutual aid, freedom of navigation, and the doctrine of the high seas, reinforcing the importance of collective security, unrestricted access, and autonomy in the digital realm.</p>

<p>This blend of inspirations helps us envision a digital landscape that respects individual autonomy while also acknowledging our shared responsibility within the digital community. Collectively, these principles create the bedrock of Self-Sovereign Computing, guiding us towards a future where technology remembers its ultimate duty — to serve and protect the people.</p>

 The Self-Sovereign Computing Call to Action 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing is more than a concept. It’s a beacon on the digital seas. It’s a movement and a rallying cry for individuals including: professionals in decentralized identity; digital human rights advocates; lawyers; and technologists alike. It’s a call for us to advocate for privacy-preserving tools, to demand transparency from platforms, and to assert control over personal data. It’s about supporting initiatives and platforms that align with the principles of Self-Sovereign Computing, fostering a culture of digital self-sovereignty in our communities.</p>

<p>Working collectively, we can form a fleet, to command respect and instigate change in the digital seas. By engaging in discussions, raising awareness, and actively advocating for change, we can reshape the digital world to prioritize people over corporations.</p>

 The Journey Ahead 

<p>Are you ready to seize control and chart your own course on this digital ocean? The era of Self-Sovereign Computing is upon us. It’s time to take the helm for your digital journey, shaping your route based on your choices and needs, not those of distant corporations.</p>

<p>Together, we can navigate toward a future where technology serves us unconditionally, and our devices, our data, and our digital experiences truly belong to us.</p>

<p>The helm is in your hands. The journey towards self-sovereignty begins now. Will you join us?</p>

<p>Passwordless authentication is one of those concepts that is finally having its day in the sun after Apple, Google and Microsoft came onboard last year, expanding their support for the passwordless sign-in standard created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium. “The work that the FIDO Alliance has done to roll out passkeys, really positioning them as a strong way for consumers to start using and leveraging that strong PKI authentication, I think that is a really good step forward,” said Josh Cigna, enterprise solutions architect at Yubico.</p>

<p>Two of the biggest social media sites, X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn, are reportedly soon set to support passkeys, a way for users to log in to their accounts without using a password. According to discoveries made by iOS developer Steve Mosher, the two services contain code that suggest they will soon be compatible with the new technology, whose standards are governed by the FIDO alliance as set out in the FIDO2 specifications.</p>

 Introduction <p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to make the most out of the query filtering and ordering capabilities in ComposeDB. By the end, you will know how to:</p>  Set up type validation directives and create indices for specific fields  Use value and logical conditions for querying  Sort the returned results by specific fields   Prerequisites   Basic understanding of GraphQL  An active ComposeDB environment (make sure to <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/set-up-your-environment?ref=blog.ceramic.network">install the latest versions of Ceramic CLI and ComposeDB CLI</a>)   The Model <p>Before we can start querying, we need to have data models defined in ComposeDB, along with some data to query, filter, and sort.</p><p>You can use a simple social app from the great <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/getting-started-with-composedb-on-ceramic-2/">Getting Started With ComposeDB on Ceramic</a> tutorial, create a model from scratch, or work on your existing data.</p><p>For simplicity, I’ll create a new model, adapt it to support filtering, add some data to it, and demonstrate all the filtering and sorting capabilities.</p> Defining a <code>Posts</code> model <p>A simple <code>Posts</code> model from the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/getting-started-with-composedb-on-ceramic-2/">“Getting Started” guide</a> looks like this:</p> <code>type Posts @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple Post") {
  body: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
  edited: DateTime
  created: DateTime!
  profileId: StreamID! @documentReference(model:"BasicProfile")
  profile: BasicProfile! @relationDocument(property: "profileId")
}
</code> <p>It’s good enough to capture and store data, but let’s make it more robust, add a few fields and get it ready for filtering and sorting.</p> Create indices and add fields <p>Query filtering in ComposeDB allows you to create queries that return a subset of data that matches specified criteria. This functionality helps you narrow down the search by specifying the search parameter.</p><p>To filter queries, you will need to create an index for the corresponding field. An index is a data structure that allows the database to find documents matching the filter criteria more quickly.</p><p>In our <code>Posts</code> type, for example, we have created indexes for <code>status</code>, <code>tag</code>, <code>created</code>, <code>rating</code>, and <code>edited</code> fields using the <code>@createIndex</code> directive as shown below:</p> <code>@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "status" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "tag" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "created" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "rating" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "edited" }])
</code> <p>Our model now looks like this:</p> <code>enum PublicationStatus {
    DRAFT
    PUBLISHED
    ARCHIVED
}
type Posts
    @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple Post")
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "status" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "tag" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "created" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "rating" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "edited" }]) {
    body: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    tag: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    rating: Float @float(min: 0, max: 10)
    status: PublicationStatus!
    edited: DateTime
    created: DateTime!
}
</code> <p>You’ll notice a few additions here:</p>  A new <code>enum</code> type: <code>PublicationStatus</code>. We know that the publication status can have only a few possible options. We’re enumerating them all here and then we’ll use that as a type that we can apply to variables. We’ll use it for the new <code>status</code> value, and we’ll make the <code>status</code> mandatory by adding an exclamation point to the type  New fields: <code>tag</code>, <code>rating</code>, <code>status</code>, <code>edited</code>. A good social app should have more than just short entries. With these fields, we’re adding an option to tag and rate posts, have different publication statuses, and an option to see which entries were edited and when.  <code>@createIndex</code> directive on five fields: <code>status</code>, <code>tag</code>, <code>created</code>, <code>rating</code>, <code>edited</code>. These add all the necessary indices. We can now filter and sort on all of these.   Add data <p>We have a model now but we don’t have any data yet. We can’t do much filtering if we don’t have anything to filter. Let’s add some posts.</p> <code>mutation CreatePosts{
  createPosts(input: {
    content: {
      body: "ComposeDB Launch",
      tag: "announcement",
      rating: 9.9,
      status: PUBLISHED,
      created: "2023-02-28T12:00:00Z"
      edited: "2023-03-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  }){
    document{
      body
      tag
      rating
      status
      created
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>This mutation adds our first post, a ComposeDB launch post, with an <code>announcement</code> tag, a <code>9.9</code> rating and a non-zero <code>edited</code> field.</p><p>Let’s add 20 more posts so that we have enough to play with. You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/velvet-shark/ff6e840e939ba80dc5a11ad3338db5f9?ref=blog.ceramic.network">copy them from this gist</a> and use GraphiQL to add them to your Ceramic node.</p> Query Filtering <p>Now that we have a way to filter and have the data to filter on, let’s do some filtering.</p><p>You can filter by value or with logical conditions.</p><p>Filtering by value is based on a single field value and we can do a lot with it:</p>  check if it’s null - <code>isNull:</code> Boolean  check if it’s equal or not equal to a value - <code>equalTo:</code> (value), <code>notEqualTo:</code> (value)  check if it is or isn’t in a list of values: <code>in:</code> […values], <code>notIn:</code> […values]  check if it’s greater or smaller than a certain value: <code>lessThan:</code> (value), <code>lessThanOrEqualTo:</code> (value), <code>greaterThan:</code> (value), <code>greaterThanOrEqualTo:</code> (value)  <p>Logical conditions combine multiple conditions using <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, or <code>not</code>.</p> Filtering Examples: Filtering by Value <p>Let’s see all the ways we can filter our posts.</p><p>Filter by publication status</p><p>A query:</p> <code>query FilterByStatus($input: PostsFiltersInput!) {
  postsIndex(filters: $input, first: 50) {
    edges {
      node {
        body
        created
        rating
        tag
        status
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>With the input to show only posts with <code>DRAFT</code> status:</p> <code>{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "status": {
        "equalTo": "DRAFT"
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>If you’re <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/interact-with-data?ref=blog.ceramic.network#graphql-server">using GraphiQL</a> to run your queries, you need to write the query in the query section <code>(1)</code> and the input data in the variables section below <code>(2)</code>.</p><p>You can then run the query with the filter by pressing a play button and you get the results on the right <code>(3)</code>.</p><p>As you can see, only the posts with <code>DRAFT</code> status are showing up. The filter works!</p><p>Let’s do more filtering.</p><p>Filter by rating</p><p>Show poorly-rated posts, with rating less than 7.5</p> <code>{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "rating": {
        "lessThan": 7.5
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>Filter by date</p><p>Posts from earlier than Jan 10, 2023.</p> <code>{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "created": {
        "lessThan": "2023-01-10"
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>Filter by edited status</p><p>Show me the posts that have been edited (their <code>edited</code> field is not null).</p> <code>{
  "input":{
    "where": {
      "edited":{
        "isNull": false
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>Filter by tags</p><p>Only the posts tagged with <code>Decentralization</code>, <code>Future</code>, or both.</p> <code>{
  "input":{
    "where": {
      "tag":{
        "in": ["Decentralization", "Future"]
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>  Filtering by Logical Conditions <p>Logical conditions combine multiple conditions. These could be either for a single field, or for multiple fields. The syntax is the same.</p><p>Filter by rating range</p><p>This is filtering on the same field but it needs combining two <code>where</code> filters with an <code>and</code> operator, indicating that both conditions must be true. If you know GraphQL, this syntax should be familiar.</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "and":[
         {
            "where":{
               "rating":{
                  "greaterThanOrEqualTo":2.2
               }
            }
         },
         {
            "where":{
               "rating":{
                  "lessThan":8.8
               }
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
</code> <p>Filter by date range</p><p>Show me only the posts from January of 2023 (note the <code>greaterThanOrEqualTo</code> operator).</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "and":[
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"greaterThanOrEqualTo":"2023-01-01"
               }
            }
         },
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"lessThan":"2023-01-31"
               }
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
</code> <p>An alternative way of filtering by range</p><p>The previous two examples of filtering by range used an explicit <code>and</code>: you started with <code>and</code> at the top and supplied two <code>where</code> queries.</p><p>This can also be achieved with an implicit <code>and</code>, where you supply two conditions and the <code>and</code> is implied.</p><p>The two examples above can be rewritten like this:</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "where":{
         "rating":{
            "greaterThanOrEqualTo":2.2,
            "lessThan": 8.8
        }
      }
   }
}</code>  <code>{
   "input":{
      "where":{
         "created":{
            "greaterThanOrEqualTo":"2023-01-01",
            "lessThan":"2023-12-31"
        }
      }
   }
}</code> <p>In both cases, the results are the same with both an implicit and an explicit <code>and</code>.</p><p>Filter by multiple fields</p><p>I want to clean up some posts. Show me the posts with <code>DRAFT</code> or <code>ARCHIVED</code> status, created before March 1, 2023.</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "and":[
         {
            "where":{
               "status":{
                	"in": ["DRAFT", "ARCHIVED"]
               }
            }
         },
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"lessThan":"2022-03-01"
               }
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
</code>  Query Ordering <p>Now that we have focused on the posts we wanted, it would be nice to be able to sort the results, too.</p><p>For that, we need to define an additional variable: <code>$sortinginput</code>, include it in the query, and then add it next to the <code>$input</code> variable.</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "and":[
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"greaterThanOrEqualTo":"2023-01-01"
               }
            }
         },
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"lessThan":"2023-12-31"
               }
            }
         }
      ]
  },
  "sortinput":{
      "created":"DESC"
   }
}
</code> <p>Now the posts are filtered, only showing the ones from 2023, and they’re also all sorted by created date, in a descending order, with the newest ones at the top.</p> Putting it all together <p>Here's a sample query that uses multiple filtering options and a sorting option on top, to show you what's possible:</p><p>A lot is going on here:</p>  Implicit <code>and</code> for range filtering  Filtering by options in a provided list  Combining multiple filters  Sorting the output  <p>And that’s it. You’re now filtering and sorting at will! Congratulations 🎉</p> Conclusion <p>ComposeDB's query filtering and ordering features offer powerful ways to manipulate and retrieve your data.</p><p>With the steps in this tutorial, you can now efficiently filter and order your data based on specific criteria, enabling you to build more robust applications.</p><p>Dive deeper into the documentation for more advanced filtering and ordering techniques.</p><p>If you have any questions about filtering and ordering, jump into our <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">community forum</a>.

<p>In January 2023, the ToIP Foundation announced the formation of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force">Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force</a> (TSPTF) within our <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group">Technology Stack Working Group</a> (TSWG). <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">See the introductory blog post</a> for an overview of this task force. In short, the goal is to maximize interoperability of decentralized digital trust infrastructure by defining the core protocol at the center of the ToIP <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">hourglass model</a>. This protocol needs to meet all the Layer 2 requirements defined in the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification</a>.</p>



<p>To do this, the TSPTF spent three months to go through the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27724781">proposal stage</a>, entertaining four overall design proposals from <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/17">Sam Smith</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/19">Daniel Hardman</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/25">Wenjing Chu</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/27">Michael Herman</a>. Then the task force entered the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27724781">consolidation stage</a>: the hard work of finding enough common ground among these proposals to reach a rough consensus about the overall framework of the design so it can prepare the first Working Draft of the specification.</p>



<p>The good news is that we believe we have achieved that goal. Through a series of in-depth virtual workshops, additional proposals, and small group <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions">discussions</a>, we have arrived at seven “pillars” of the design. These seven pillars apply not just to the trust spanning protocol, but to a core family of protocols that together form the foundation for all the trust task protocols at Layer 3 of the ToIP technology stack.</p>



<p>In this blog post we will summarize these seven pillars:</p>



 
 <a>Verifiable Identifiers</a> 



 <a>End-to-End Authenticity and Confidentiality</a> 



 <a>Direct Connections (Inner and Outer Channels)</a> 



 <a>Routing Via Intermediaries (Routing Channels)</a> 



 <a>Relationship Context Channels</a> 



 <a>Text and Binary Encoding</a> 



 <a>Trust Task Protocol Framework</a> 
 



<p>This blog post does not attempt to provide the full technical details about each of these topics, rather it will attempt to summarize them using language accessible to anyone interested in decentralized digital trust infrastructure.</p>



 #1: Verifiable Identifiers 



<p>The ToIP Foundation as a whole—and the TSWG in particular—have long compared the ToIP stack to the Internet’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP stack</a> (see <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">our introductory white paper</a> for a full explanation). In particular, we have pointed to how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">Internet Protocol</a> (IP) illustrates the critical role of a spanning protocol in a protocol stack (for details, see Principle #3, The Hourglass Model, in <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack</a>).</p>



<p>The heart of the Internet Protocol defined a new type of address—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP address</a>—that enabled communications between existing networks that otherwise had no automated way to pass data between them. This new addressing layer enabled the Internet Protocol to “span” existing local area networks and create the ubiquitous global Internet we enjoy today.</p>



<p>Since the goal of the ToIP stack is to enable trust to span existing trust domains, the ToIP trust spanning protocol needs the same solution: a new type of address—one designed explicitly to enable cryptographically verifiable communications. In section 6.4 of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Technical-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-PR1-2022-11-14.pdf">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification</a> (TAS), we call this new type of address a verifiable identifier (VID). The three essential characteristics of a VID are:</p>



 
 It can be resolved securely to obtain the current public key(s) needed to verify that the VID owner controls the VID. 



 It can be resolved securely to obtain the current network endpoint(s) for establishing a ToIP connection with the entity identified by the VID. 



 It does not need to change when the controller’s key(s) are rotated or network endpoint(s) are updated. 
 



<p>Section 6.4 of the TAS explains that there are multiple types of VIDs, including many different types of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs—standardized by the W3C), and several types of Autonomous Identifiers (AIDs), such as those being standardized in the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-did-keri">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a> specifications from the ToIP <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force">Authentic Chained Data Container</a> (ACDC) Task Force. Since a verifier’s trust in a VID may depend on both the type of VID and the characteristics of its supporting infrastructure (e.g., cryptographic algorithms, storage, key management, resolution, etc.), the trust spanning protocol specification must also include an appraisability framework: a standard way for a ToIP endpoint to describe the type and properties of its particular VID.</p>



<p>In addition, VIDs share the same challenge as any other new type of identifier: how do parties discover and share the VIDs they want to use for each other? How do they bootstrap setting up their first ToIP communications channel? How can they do this safely while avoiding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle</a> (MITM) attacks?&nbsp;</p>



<p>All VID-based protocols, including <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/">DIDComm</a>, <a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/">Decentralized Web Nodes</a>, rely on some form of out–of-band introduction (OOBI), such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR code</a>, to accomplish this critical first step. Regardless of the specific OOBI used, the ultimate result is that all parties now have the VIDs needed to begin using the ToIP trust spanning protocol to connect and interact.</p>



 #2: End-to-End Authenticity &amp; Confidentiality 



<p>Almost all modern security protocols based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public/private key cryptography</a> use some combination of message signing (for authenticity) and message encryption (for confidentiality). A longstanding question has been: precisely what combination of these two properties produces the strongest security?</p>



<p>Our second pillar is a firm answer to that question: the signing and encryption pattern that provides the strongest protection against both key compromise impersonation (KCI) and sender impersonation of the ciphertext is called ESSR (for Encrypt Sender’s key then Sign Receiver’s key). ESSR was first defined <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2001/079">in a 2001 paper</a> by Jee Hea An and is well explained in these three Neil Madden blog posts about public key authenticated encryption: <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/11/14/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-i/">PKAE1</a>, <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/11/26/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-ii/">PKAE2</a>, <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/12/14/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-iii/">PKAE3</a>.</p>



<p>The bottom line: by binding the sender’s public key inside the encrypted ciphertext and binding the receiver’s public key in the enclosing signed plain text, an adversary is prevented from forging messages that compromise either authenticity or confidentiality. So the trust spanning protocol can achieve both strong authenticity and strong confidentiality by applying ESSR to all messages that require both properties.</p>



 #3: Direct Connections (Inner and Outer Channels) 



<p>With VIDs supplying verifiable public key(s) and network endpoint(s), and ESSR supplying the message signing and encryption pattern, all the essential ingredients for two ToIP endpoints are in place to establish a connection in order to communicate securely and confidentially. The only ToIP Layer 2 requirement that we have not addressed is correlation privacy: preventing public observation/correlation of the VIDs that parties are using to communicate.</p>



<p>Although the trust spanning protocol is designed to be transport-independent and could be used with any transport protocol for which a binding is defined (e.g., Bluetooth, AMQP, MQTT), if ToIP endpoints A and B have a direct connection with each other over a public TCP/IP network like the Internet, then full correlation privacy is impossible: anyone who can see the Internet traffic can track the flow of encrypted messages between A’s VID and B’s VID. Thus the only way A and B can achieve full correlation privacy is by employing intermediaries (see Pillar <a>#4</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>However A and B can still achieve partial correlation privacy over a direct connection by tunneling one ESSR protocol inside another. This is shown in Figure 1 below.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Figure 1: A direct connection showing one ToIP channel tunneled inside another for partial correlation privacy.</p>



<p>In Figure 1, the VIDs A0 and B0 are publicly-observable VIDs used to form the outer channel (shown in red). They are outside the two endpoint boxes because they are publicly observable on the Internet. The VIDs A1 and B1 are private interaction VIDs that form the inner channel (shown in orange).&nbsp; They are inside the two endpoint boxes because they are completely private to A and B. Each ToIP message between A1 and B1 is carried in the encrypted payload of ToIP messages between A0 and B0, so A1 and B1 are never exposed publicly on the Internet.</p>



<p>This two-layer, two-channel model enables A and B to communicate privately between A1 and B1 over the inner channel. As explained in Pillar <a>#5</a>, one potential use of this private channel is for A and B to negotiate replacing their current publicly-observable VIDs A0 and B0 with new publicly-observable VIDs An and Bn if/when needed. They can do this while still keeping A1 and B1 hidden. This enables some degree of correlation privacy even without the use of intermediaries.</p>



 #4: Routing Via Intermediaries (Routing Channels) 



<p>To provide stronger correlation privacy—i.e., to prevent public observation that A and B are communicating at all—it is necessary to tunnel one layer deeper using intermediaries. This triple layering is shown in Figure 2.</p>







<p>Figure 2: Adding a routing layer tunneled via intermediaries for stronger correlation privacy</p>



<p>In this configuration, both A and B first establish outer channels over direct connections with their respective intermediaries α and β (shown in red between VIDs A0 and α0 and B0 and β0 respectively). Then A and B tunnel another ESSR protocol (shown in blue) inside the outer channel to send ToIP routing messages. This routing channel gives the intermediaries α and β just enough information to pass the messages to the next hop on the path. The full path is never revealed to any single intermediary; all α and β know is the next destination.</p>



<p>The inner channel (orange) is layered within the routing channel (blue). As with direct connections, this is the fully private interaction channel between A1 and B1. Neither α or β know about A1 and B1 and cannot see any of the communications on this inner channel. To use a physics analogy, this inner channel has two layers of “insulation” that prevent the heat (private information) from leaking out into the environment (third parties observing the outer channel).</p>



<p>This routing architecture is not limited to two intermediaries; it can scale to more as needed. However adding more intermediaries is not required to enable better correlation privacy; it simply increases the number of intermediaries that would need to be compromised to learn the full path.</p>



 #5: Relationship Context Channels 



<p>The double or triple layering of ToIP channels described in Pillars <a>#3</a> and <a>#4</a> satisfies the ToIP architecture requirements for authenticity, confidentiality, and ​​correlation privacy. Whether it operates over a direct connection or via intermediaries, the inner channel instantiates a relationship root context connecting the two endpoints.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, what if two endpoints A and B need to communicate over other inner channels representing different relationship contexts? For example, what if they need to:</p>



 
 Move to a higher level of identity assurance, e.g., for high-value transactions instead of low-value transactions? 



 Step up to perfect forward secrecy or some other cryptographic algorithm? 



 Stream data instead of sending individual messages? 



 Instantiate a multi-party channel incorporating other parties (such as using the IETF <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_Layer_Security">Message Layer Security</a> protocol)? 



 Instantiate new publicly-observable VIDs to increase correlation privacy? 



 Instantiate new private interaction VIDs to prevent privacy leakage over time? 



 Invoke specific higher-level (ToIP Layer 3) trust task protocols (see Pillar <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CULKg76dSLnO5EX3YM5kG6Ya8PWDwmPSZAbGKKqdoTU/edit#heading=h.ekx5229cmb3v">#7</a>)? 
 



<p>In these cases, A and B need to be able to use the default inner channel as a “control channel” to establish other inner channels. Each new inner channel needs: a) a new pair of VIDs to establish a new relationship context, and b) a new set of parameters specific to that relationship context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This can be accomplished using a simple control channel protocol that enables A and B to establish and manage as many relationship context channels as they need over the lifetime of their relationship. This is illustrated in Figure 3 (shown over a direct connection for simplicity). The control channel is shown in orange and each new relationship context channel is shown in black.</p>







<p>Figure 3: Using the default inner channel as a control channel to establish new independent relationship context channels between A and B</p>



<p>Note that these new inner channels can emulate the same features as the concept of sessions used in other protocols. However, by using VIDs, they have the following advantages:</p>



 
 They can operate independently from any session management defined by underlying transport protocols. 



 They can persist as long as both parties need them (not just during one communications session). 



 They can establish fully “cryptographic sessions” that include all the security and privacy protections of the ToIP trust spanning layer. 
 



 #6: Text and Binary Encoding 



<p>Every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_protocol">wire protocol</a> that moves data from one endpoint to another must define its encoding(s). Encoding choices are even more critical (and often contentious) with security protocols because: a) they are replete with heavyweight cryptographic data structures, and b) they impose very strict rules governing message signing, encryption, decryption, and signature verification.</p>



<p>To avoid as much contention as possible, we propose to use Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) as the encoding format for all ToIP messages. The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ssmith-cesr/">CESR specification</a> is one of the deliverables of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force">ToIP ACDC Task Force</a>. To quote from the introduction:</p>



<p>The Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) is a dual text-binary encoding format that has the unique property of text-binary concatenation composability.&nbsp; This composability property enables the round trip conversion en-masse of concatenated primitives between the text domain and binary domain while maintaining the separability of individual primitives.&nbsp; This enables convenient usability in the text domain and compact transmission in the binary domain.</p>



<p>Other key benefits of CESR include:</p>



 
 Format-agnostic. CESR streams support interleaved JSON, CBOR, and MGPK serializations. 



 Optimized for cryptography. Popular cryptographic material suites have compact encodings for efficiency while less compact encodings provide sufficient extensibility to support all foreseeable types. 



 Self-framing. CESR supports self-framing group codes that enable stream processing and pipelining in both the text and binary domains. 
 



<p>For a complete overview of the benefits of CESR, see the IIW presentation <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12nX_IIPp5xw8qAxhZy-ae2aWYytYQmFBbB9K3PcVhqQ/edit?usp=sharing">CESR for First Year Wizards</a>.</p>



<p>Note: CESR V1.1 will include a few minor pipelining improvements based on production experience with CESR V1.0.</p>



 #7: Trust Task Protocol Framework 



<p>The final pillar is the capability for architects and developers to design, define, and build higher-level ToIP Layer 3 trust task protocols that operate over the Layer 2 relationship context channels described in Pillar <a>#5</a>. This trust task protocol framework should be modeled using the same protocol definition patterns established by other VID-based protocols such as <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/">DIDComm</a>, <a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/">Decentralized Web Nodes</a>. These definitions typically follow a two level model:</p>



 
 Protocol definitions specify the protocol ID (or VID), human-readable name, version, and other identifying metadata for the protocol. They also define its overall relationship context channel parameters and a catalog of its specified packets/messages. 



 Packet/message definitions specify the required and optional contents of each packet or message defined in the protocol. 
 



<p>A complete trust task protocol specification based on this framework will also include roles, states, request/response business logic, co-protocols, error messages, etc.. See <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/#protocols">section 9 of the DIDComm V2 specification</a> for a detailed example.</p>



<p>The ToIP trust task protocol framework should also define a small set of standard utility trust tasks such as:</p>



 
 Discovery. Rather than broadly defining how two parties try to discover each other’s VIDs, this trust task will narrowly define how two ToIP endpoints that have established a connection can discover what trust tasks each other is capable of supporting (see examples below). 



 Error handling. The rich extensibility of trust tasks—and the fact they may be combined into complex workflows—make it very useful to have a well-known trust task for handling error messages. 



 Trust ping. This simple, universal trust task for testing a ToIP connection is the ToIP equivalent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)">ping network utility</a> for testing an IP connection. 



 Logging/auditing. This is a standard trust task for logging ToIP interactions for debugging or auditing purposes. 
 



<p>The whole reason for the hourglass design of the ToIP technology stack is for the Layer 2 trust spanning protocol to support any number of trust task protocols at Layer 3. With authenticity, confidentiality, and correlation privacy all handled by the trust spanning layer, it becomes far easier for infrastructure architects and developers to design reusable trust tasks. This is turn makes it much easier for application designers and developers to build trusted applications by calling a series of trust tasks to accomplish their workflows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current market emphasis on digital identity wallets (such as the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">EU eIDAS 2.0 initiative</a>) can give the impression that the only important trust tasks are the issuance, presentation, and revocation of verifiable digital credentials. These are in fact only a small subset of the universe of trust tasks that can be enabled by the ToIP stack. Some other common examples discussed by the TSPTF include:</p>



 
 Stepping up authentication by using a ToIP connection to request local biometric authentication and/or liveness detection of a user. 



 Signing digital documents with strong, permanently verifiable digital signatures that do not require centralized service providers (a required feature of eIDAS 2.0). 



 Querying a trust registry to determine the authorized participants in a digital trust ecosystem (a trust task protocol under development by the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">ToIP Trust Registry Task Force</a>). 



 Exchanging electronic business cards for peer-to-peer communications and relationship management. 



 Secure messaging using synchronous chat or asynchronous mail. 



 Transmitting digital payments via any mutually-agreed means: credit card, debit card, direct-to-bank, fiat currency, cryptocurrency, loyalty points, etc. 



 Issuing e-receipts for any type of digital payment or value exchange. 



 Buying a digital ticket for an event and presenting it for admission. 



 Bidding in a digital auction, including reconciling and settlement of a winning bid. 



 Issuing a digital purchase order, sending an invoice, and remitting payment. 



 Orchestrating data supply chains using “product passports” that can be the digital twin of physical or digital products. 
 



 Next Steps 



<p>The TSPTF is now moving into the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27724781">Working Drafts stage</a>. After a break during the month of August, we are beginning two weekly meetings again every Wednesday (8AM PT for NA/EU time zones and 6PM PT for APAC time zones) starting on&nbsp;06 September&nbsp;(the full schedule of all ToIP meetings is published on the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Calendar+of+ToIP+Meetings">ToIP Calendar</a>).&nbsp;Our goal will be to work through enough open issues to be ready to present a complete “IIW Preview Draft”&nbsp;at the next Internet Identity Workshop, 10-12 October in Mountain View, California.

 OT-RFC-18 — Growing the Trusted Knowledge Foundation: TRAC delegation &amp; OTP incentives <p>“Q. How do you propose to do&nbsp;this?</p><p>A. By saving the knowledge of the race. The sum of human knowing is beyond any one man; any thousand men. With the destruction of our social fabric, science will be broken into a million pieces. Individuals will know much of the exceedingly tiny facets of which there is to know. They will be helpless and useless by themselves. The bits of lore, meaningless, will not be passed on. They will be lost through the generations. But, if we now prepare a giant summary of all knowledge, it will never be lost. Coming generations will build on it, and will not have to rediscover it for themselves. One millennium will do the work of thirty thousand.”</p><p>Hari Seldon</p><p>Foundation series by Isaac Asimov&nbsp;(1951)</p> Introduction <p>OriginTrail ecosystem’s vision is to build a trusted knowledge foundation that greatly improves the way humanity’s knowledge is produced, maintained and shared in a trusted and inclusive manner. The purpose of the OriginTrail Parachain is to provide a tailored blockchain for Trusted Artificial Intelligence that extends the capabilities of the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) with growth incentives for <a href="https://origintrail.io">real-world adoption</a>.</p><p>The requirements have already been met for the OriginTrail Parachain utility token (OTP) to be transferable via both centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEXs and DEXs) by having the decentralized governance in place. Now this DKG-focused L1 blockchain supporting real-world adoption, is set to drive growth of both valuable Knowledge Asset assemblies and DKG multichain infrastructure — crucial components of the Trusted Knowledge Foundation. It achieves that by incentivizing Knowledge generation and trusted knowledge infrastructure operation with OTP tokens, in unison with the multichain DKG adoption (detailed in OT-RFC-17).</p><p>The OT-RFC-18 proposes the first batch of incentivization features, which also leverage already implemented OriginTrail Parachain community voting.</p> OTP incentives for Trusted Knowledge Foundation Growth <p>Using OTP to create incentives for Trusted Knowledge Foundation Growth is one of its core utilities. The pool of OTP designated for that was 14% (or 70 million OTP) of the Genesis supply and also receives 30% of the annual inflation (you can learn more about the tokenomics and exact numbers&nbsp;<a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/OriginTrail_Ecosystem_White_Paper_2.0.pdf">here</a>).</p><p>When considering the best first activities to be included for the OTP incentives, the key requirements include the relevance of the activity, measurable nature of the activity and inclusiveness for all OriginTrail participants. All OTP incentives should also take full advantage of OriginTrail Parachain Governance — from proposal stage for an activity, to ongoing decisions on the scope of incentivisation support or even proposals to discontinue/substitute the incentives with more appropriate ones.</p><p>The OT-RFC-18 takes the above guidelines in action to propose 2 categories of activities as candidates for incentivization — (1) Incentivizing trusted knowledge creation and (2) Incentivizing trusted infrastructure.</p> Incentivizing trusted knowledge creation <p>Incentivizing the creation of trusted knowledge is central to the growth of the OriginTrail Trusted Knowledge Foundation. By offering OTP incentives for Knowledge Asset creation the “north star” growth activity is supported. The intention of incentives is also to serve as a curation mechanism for guiding publishing of high quality knowledge on the DKG. Curation is to be implemented through community-wide decisions using OriginTrail Parachain Governance. These activities will provide a significant boost towards creating truthful, structured, and AI-ready Knowledge Assets — ultimately leading to the creation of the largest trusted knowledge foundation in the world. The specific incentive mechanisms to achieve this will be continuously improved through OriginTrail Parachain Governance proposals.</p> Incentivizing trusted infrastructure: TRAC delegation &amp; Multichain adoption <p>The OriginTrail trusted infrastructure is a two layer system with two&nbsp;tokens:</p>  the DKG layer hosted on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN) fueled by the TRAC utility&nbsp;token,  and multi-chain consensus layer, with respective native blockchain tokens in use (which includes the OriginTrail Parachain and OTP&nbsp;token).  <p>Each of the layers performs a distinct function, yet are necessary building blocks for the implementation of the DKG (more info available in the OriginTrail whitepaper 2.0).</p><p>An increasingly important element of the trusted knowledge infrastructure is the TRAC stake for DKG nodes. The stake presents a collateral TRAC amount that is locked-up as a signal for the security and quality of node operations. The amount of TRAC stake also significantly contributes to the share of the network rewards (paid as network fees by Knowledge Asset publishers) that a DKG node can&nbsp;receive.</p><p>With the OT-RFC-18, the TRAC delegation feature is introduced, and DKG node operators will now be able to open their node stake for other TRAC holders to participate. With a higher amount of TRAC as their stake, nodes are eligible for more network rewards which are then shared with those that delegated their TRAC (implementation details below). This instrument will lead to more TRAC being used for its utility, larger TRAC holder community engagement, more robust and secure trusted knowledge infrastructure and a vibrant “marketplace” of DKG nodes and TRAC delegators.</p><p>To incentivize all of the above-mentioned positive effects of TRAC delegations, the OT-RFC-18 proposes this feature to be eligible for OTP incentives as well. The core premise of the OTP incentives would be to allow any TRAC delegator on blockchains where DKG V6 is implemented to be eligible for OTP rewards according to the size of their delegated stake.</p><p>Moreover, as more blockchain ecosystems <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-17-origintrail-integration-with-evm-compatible-blockchains-e635dc8afb86">express interest</a> to integrate with the DKG (following<a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/tree/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-17-OriginTrail-integration-with-EVM-compatible-blockchains"> the procedure and criteria detailed in the OT-RFC-17</a>), one time incentives in OTP are proposed, to both reward TRAC token holders who support integrations by contributing to the minimum required threshold. More details on this to be discussed in a separate proposal on incentivising MultiChain DKG adoption before voting on it via OriginTrial Parachain governance mechanism.</p> TRAC delegation mechanics <p>The implementation of the TRAC token delegation mechanism is loosely based on DeFi projects such as Uniswap, with the core component representing Node share tokens, (similar to Uniswap LP tokens). Each node deployed on ODN has a respective, node-specific, mintable and burnable 18 decimal ERC20 token created for it on the desired blockchain during node deployment, with the token symbol and name set by the node operator, as can be seen in the figure&nbsp;below.</p>Figure 1: Node share tokens on OriginTrail Parachain, visible through Subscan block&nbsp;explorer<p>The “share tokens” represent essentially a share of the total amount of TRAC stake that has been deployed on a specific node. The TRAC delegation feature, when fully activated, will enable node operators to “open up” their node to receiving more TRAC stake through delegation by TRAC token holders. The delegation mechanism is explained in the following figures:</p><p>Formula for share tokens&nbsp;minting:</p><p>Where tracAmount is the amount of TRAC delegated to the&nbsp;node.</p><p>Formula for share tokens&nbsp;burning:</p><p>Where tracAmount is the amount of TRAC withdrawn from the node&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Nodes with larger amounts of TRAC staked have effectively stronger economic security signals (see <a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/OriginTrail_Ecosystem_White_Paper_2.0.pdf">the whitepaper</a>), and therefore an advantage in receiving Knowledge Asset publishing fees from Knowledge Publishers (also in TRAC). Therefore, node operators have an interest in attracting a large amount of TRAC stake to establish a better position in the DKG service&nbsp;market.</p><p>TRAC token holders’ interest is in putting their TRAC tokens to work, which is achieved by node operators effectively sharing a portion of the TRAC fees received through Knowledge Asset publishing with the delegators.</p><p>Effectively, node runners are delegators to their own nodes at the moment of writing this RFC (currently only node admin keys can delegate, until the fully fledged system is implemented), and get 100% of the TRAC rewards from publishings their nodes&nbsp;receive.</p><p>When the delegation feature goes live, each node operator will be free to set their node settings, which are the following:</p>  operator_fee: percentage of the TRAC fee, which is deducted from each knowledge asset publishing fee, and is directed to the node operator prior to sharing with other delegators. The remaining TRAC fee is then split in proportion to the amount of share tokens among all delegators,  maximum_delegated_trac: the maximum amount of stake a node operator allows to be present on their&nbsp;node.  <p>It is important to note that the system is non-custodial, meaning that all delegated TRAC is locked in DKG core contracts, and can only be “withdrawn” from the system by burning share tokens by the delegators, which can only be performed by the <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/dkg-evm-module/blob/main/contracts/Staking.sol">DKG Staking contract</a>.</p><p>With such a system in effect, TRAC token holders can safely delegate their tokens to node runners. Having Node Share tokens be ERC20 tokens, they can also be easily transferred between wallets (e.g. a delegator can change wallets for OpSec purposes by transferring share tokens to a different address) and utilized with any ERC20 supporting tool.</p><p>Finally, the proposal indicates delegating TRAC in two&nbsp;ways:</p>  “Delegate” function: by using this function, share tokens are available to the delegator, enabling withdrawing TRAC at all times. This function should not involveOTP incentives,  “Delegate &amp; Lock” function: share tokens are locked in DKG contracts for a period of time, which qualifies the delegator for OTP Incentives, as they promote long-term security in the&nbsp;network.   TRAC Delegation: Implementation action&nbsp;points <p>After the RFC process and open discussion on TRAC delegation feature is completed, the core development team will proceed with detailed specification and updates on the implementation. Community proposals through comments on this RFC are very&nbsp;welcome.</p><p>The relevant updates are expected to include an updated version of smart contracts, with the aim to encapsulate other optimizations to the system (system formulas, neighborhood distance function updates, etc). All information will be available in the relevant Github repositories.</p> Conclusion <p><a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-18-Growing-the-Trusted-Knowledge-Foundation/README.md">This RFC</a> introduces the implementation direction for OTP incentives and initial high-impact activities for the growth of the Trusted Knowledge Foundation.
