<p>Business Situation</p>



<p>Intuit is the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for more than 100 million consumers and businesses around the world using TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks and Mailchimp. The company’s long- held commitment to Design for Delight principles has been a key ingredient of its success in fueling innovation across its products, services and customer touchpoints to create bold new AI and data-driven personalized experiences at scale.</p>



<p>To execute on a user-centric focus, Intuit’s customer authentication products team, led by Rakan Khalid, Intuit Group Product Manager, Identity, justifies and prioritizes development of new authentication capabilities based on user research, security trends and technology advancements in the industry. This has led to an overarching strategy that emphasizes secure and convenient authentication experiences on its platform.</p>



<p>Intuit saw the potential of the FIDO (Fast ID Online) Alliance early on and began a multi-year FIDO journey in 2018 to reduce customer friction and enhance security, at lower operating costs.</p>



<p>Business Challenges</p>



<p>Intuit set out to address several challenges when evolving its customer authentication strategy to serve a growing customer base across a diverse set of product offerings and user personas:</p>



 
 Customers experienced friction when logging on, which negatively impacted key business metrics. 
 



 
 Sign-in times (time to successful sign-in) were getting longer, and calls into customer care for account sign-in-related issues were increasing. 



 Product teams were challenged to balance ease-of-use and convenience for users with appropriate levels of security. 
 



<p>Business Objectives</p>



<p>The team set out to achieve the following business objectives for customer authentication across Intuit’s product portfolio:</p>



<p>Results and Benefits</p>



 
 Deliver a delightful and seamless customer authentication experience that “just works” across multiple devices. 



 Push the envelope on customer authentication technology to further enhance the security posture of Intuit. 



 Build a resilient, scalable, durable customer authentication capability for its current and future business needs. 
 
 



  
 


<p></p> <p>OVERVIEW</p>“As an early adopter of FIDO, we’ve seen<br>significant business benefits and are completely on board with continuing to leverage the latest FIDO innovations with our partner, Nok Nok.”<br> <br>Rakan Khalid, Intuit Group Product Manager, Identity<br><br>Intuit was able to reduce customer friction, resulting in authentication success rates of 95% to 97% and 70% faster sign-in speeds. <p></p>


 
 


 


 
 


 


 
 


 


 
 


 


 
  
 



<p>FIDO Authentication Deployment – Measured Steps</p>



<p>Intuit implemented a FIDO-based customer authentication solution in line with the FIDO Alliance’s founding members’ goals. FIDO protocols are based on an asymmetric cryptographic authentication framework designed to enhance security, provide a better user experience (compared to traditional passwords) and reduce cost and complexity.</p>



<p>Although FIDO is an open standard, the expertise required to code and deploy a scalable FIDO solution for millions of consumer and small business customers led Intuit to license a FIDO authentication platform.</p>



<p>Intuit selected the Nok NokTM S3 Authentication Suite (S3 Suite) for its advanced FIDO features and capabilities; optional on-prem deployment model; and speed, scale, and resilience, which was validated by Nok Nok enterprise customers.</p>



<p>Intuit’s authentication team placed a high priority on working with a FIDO leader with deep and relevant experience in customer authentication and therefore well-equipped to keep pace with industry progress with this fast- evolving technology.</p>



<p>Build vs. Buy: Intuit recognized that the company would benefit from the expertise of a vendor with experience working with other major companies on its authentication journey, and enjoy access to innovative product enhancements along the way.</p>



<p>Progressive Deployment: Intuit opted to deploy Nok Nok’s customer authentication solution across multiple apps in a controlled and measurable manner:</p>



 
 Intuit’s authentication team initially tested Nok Nok’s FIDO passwordless customer authentication on the mobile iOS version of an Intuit product with a small customer base. 
 



 
 Over the next few months, the team rolled out Nok Nok’s FIDO passwordless solution on mobile iOS and Android platforms for a broader customer base on multiple Intuit products. 
 



 
 The team added FIDO as an option to Intuit’s passwordless customer onboarding flow, which improved onboarding conversion rates and reduced subsequent sign-in times. 



 Over the last 5 years, Intuit has grown its total FIDO registrations to over 77 million. 
 



<p>Authentication Solution Delivers on Business Objectives </p>



<p>Intuit has been able to achieve all of its business objectives, while simultaneously addressing new use cases for a growing customer base:</p>



 
 Delightful Customer Sign-in – FIDO-based multi-factor authentication (MFA) for customer sign-in dramatically improves and simplifies the user sign-in experience because it’s completed in a single user step. This reduces the need for a multi-step authentication process (e.g., password, texting one-time passcodes). Using FIDO, Intuit users are presented with a seamless, passwordless flow using device-based platform authenticators, such as biometrics with which they’re already comfortable. 
 



<p>Today, more than 85% of all customer authentications on Intuit’s mobile apps are now done using FIDO</p>



 
 Enhanced Customer Security – When FIDO authentication is used, it eliminates the passing of passwords and one-time tokens between apps and services, which can reduce the risk of interception attacks. 



 Global Scale – Since Nok Nok’s S3 platform is trusted by some of the largest banks, telcos and fintech brands across five continents and has been proven to scale across demanding customer environments, it’s given Intuit the confidence that it will continue to scale with the company’s future growth to match uptime and authentication speeds. 
 



<p>Business Results</p>



<p>By deploying a passwordless solution for customer authentication, Intuit was able to reduce customer friction, thereby reducing operating expenses. Users who adopted the FIDO passwordless authentication option experienced authentication success rates of 95% to 97% when compared to a baseline of 80% for legacy multi-factor authentication and 70% faster sign-in speeds over non-FIDO sign-ins.</p>



<p>Looking Ahead</p>



<p>Over the past several years, Intuit has experienced the power of FIDO customer authentication for its consumer and small business customers, and validated its benefits with its product, technology, security, user experience and customer care teams. Looking ahead, the company intends to explore multi-device passkey technology as the next frontier on its authentication journey.</p>

 Scope 
<p>This whitepaper is focused on the privacy implications surrounding government-issued digital credentials. In particular, we look at the digital credentials issued by government authorities and intended as a technology that helps enable efficient, privacy-preserving services to people and businesses. Similarly, we consider where legislation and regulation define the individual’s expectation for privacy and establish some of the requirements for the technology. The scope here is global, with a particular focus specifically on digital credentials issued by liberal democratic governments which tend to have more stringent privacy laws and higher expectations of their residents to have their privacy expectations met. The paper does not cover privately issued identity credentials, what governments need to do to provide services to users that do not have government-issued identity credentials, or the needs of centralized governments with less focus on privacy.</p>

<p>The Findynet Cooperative is soliciting answers to a request for information (RFI) from SSI solution vendors. Our goal is to build a list of candidate solutions to be used in our pilots and later in our production network.</p>
 Scope of the RFI 
<p>To support organizations participating in the pilots, we will create a list of SSI solutions and their vendors. Of course, participating organizations can choose their own solutions, as long as they are interoperable with the protocols and formats selected for the pilot.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting organizations participating in the Findynet pilots, we will use the data collected to evaluate the potential future provision of SSI services as part of our own service portfolio.</p>
<p>We are interested in solutions that enable organizations to:</p>
 
 hold and present Verifiable Credentials issued to them 
 issue Verifiable Credentials to other parties and 
 verify Verifiable Credentials presented to them by other parties. 
 
<p>Some vendors refer to these as “all-in-one SSI solutions.”</p>
 Background and previous work 
<p>We have already worked with TNO to <a href="https://findyfi.github.io/wallet-overview/">add more SSI solution providers</a> to their <a href="https://tno-ssi-lab.github.io/wallet-overview/">Wallet Overview</a>. This list is well suited for technical comparison of solutions. Next, we want to learn about the advanced features, APIs, support, business models, etc. of the SSI solutions.</p>
 Findynet pilots 
<p>The Findynet Cooperative together with its members and other stakeholders, is launching a series of projects to test and pilot Self-sovereign identity (SSI) and Verifiable Credentials. We will run the pilots during 2023 and 2024, aiming to be ready for production in early 2025.</p>
<p>In some pilots, we may require compatibility with our current test network (<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>). In some pilots, there may be a requirement to be <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">EUDI ARF</a> compatible. In yet another pilot, we may require <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Conformant+wallets">EBSI compliant</a> technology. We are not looking for one solution to be used on all pilots (although that is a very welcome option), but rather a list of solutions to choose from based on each pilot’s requirements.</p>
<p>Our pilots are not directly linked to the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eudi-wallet-implementation">EUDI Large Scale Pilots</a>. Findynet is an associated partner in the <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/">EUDI Wallet Consortium</a>, and there may be some synergies between some Findynet pilots and the EUDI Large Scale Pilots.</p>
 How to participate 
<p>You can answer to the RFI by filling in the <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/NE7V50bx6f">online RFI form</a>. You can also send additional information to an email address included in the form. The deadline for submission is August 6th, 2023.</p>
<p>For more information, please contact:<br>Samuel Rinnetmäki, CTO, Findynet Cooperative, tel. +358 40 534 4332, <a href="mailto:samuel.rinnetmaki@findy.fi">samuel.rinnetmaki@findy.fi</a></p>

<p>Tackling climate change will take innovation and collaboration on a global scale. Open source blockchain technologies are particularly valuable at uniting parties to collect, validate and innovate with climate data. There is a growing range of applications that are leveraging distributed ledger and related technologies, including green finance, sustainability reporting, climate accounting and supply chain traceability.</p>



<p>As part of our spotlight on #HyperledgerClimate, we’ve compiled a sampling of production deployments and solutions built using Hyperledger technologies that are leading the way towards a more sustainable future:</p>



<p>4AIR’s Comprehensive Blockchain-based Registry for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)</p>



<p>Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a type of biofuel with a lower carbon footprint than conventional jet fuel. With mandates to use SAF on the horizon, companies need a way to collect and verify key information related to their use of SAF. 4AIR teamed with IntellectEU to build a blockchain-based registry that includes all necessary SAF details, regulatory eligibility, and ownership information. The main stakeholders within the 4AIR platform are fuel producers, fuel distributors, fuel sellers, airlines and operators.</p>



<p>Developers used a private-instance of <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> supported by IntellectEU’s<a href="https://catalyst.intellecteu.com/"> Catalyst Blockchain Manager</a> to build the platform. 4AIR’s resulting SAF Registry allows registering, transferring, retiring and tracking of tokenized aviation fuel batches across the platform. Tokens are used to represent the emission reduction claim from one metric ton of SAF. Once created by fuel producers, these digital tokens can be transferred to fuel distributors and fuel consumers, before then being burned/retired when a claim has been finalized.

<p>Botanical Water Technologies&nbsp;</p>



<p>Botanical Water Technologies (BWT) from Australia is leveraging <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> to tackle severe water shortages that are affecting populations around the world. BWT found a way to recover the water usually wasted making alcohol, juice, ketchup, and sugar. The process involves capturing, purifying and creating sustainable drinking water with technology housed in shipping containers and connected up to existing systems that process fruit, vegetables, or sugar cane. BWT teamed with Fujitsu to develop a blockchain-based marketplace for buyers and sellers of this plant-sourced water, opening the door to the sale and donation of this water or of “water impact credits” (WICs) to help fulfill corporate water stewardship goals.

<p>Circulor</p>



<p>Tracking the flow of materials through their lifecycle, including extraction, production and into second life and recycling, is a cornerstone of sustainable and responsible manufacturing. <a href="https://www.circulor.com/">Circulor</a> has united whole industry segments onto a <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a>-powered platform that is introducing critical traceability to automotive, construction, extraction and plastic recycling. Drawing on its work with electric vehicle OEMs and supply chain participants to manage the lifecycle of the materials required to manufacture EV batteries, Circulor was named as one of 11 consortium members and the lead technology implementer for Germany’s<a href="https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2022/04/20220425-parliamentary-state-secretary-kellner-batteries-in-the-eu-must-be-as-sustainable-as-possible.html"> Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action</a> (BMWK) “Battery Pass” project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust</p>



<p>Initiated by the Government of British Columbia, Canada, in partnership with TELUS, <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/learning/case-studies/energy-mines-digital-trust-pilot/">Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust</a> provides digital trust solutions for the natural resource sector, empowering companies to prove their sustainability practices. To compete in a global market that prioritizes sustainably sourced products, mining companies must be able to prove where their products originated and how they were produced. The Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust project leverages tamper-proof digital credentials, issued in real time, as a new approach to sustainability reporting, and empowering mining companies to share verified data that can be trusted. The Government of British Columbia developed Traction, a tool based on<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy"> Hyperledger Indy</a> and<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries"> Hyperledger Aries</a>, to send and receive digital credentials.</p>



<p>Participating mining companies will be issued two digital credentials:&nbsp;</p>



  Mines Act Permit – A credential issued by the Government of British Columbia that regulates all mining activity in the province. Using this credential, mining companies can confirm the legality of their operations to a multitude of recipients.  <a href="https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/">Towards Sustainable Mining</a> (TSM) report – A voluntary benchmarking standard governed by the<a href="https://mining.ca/"> Mining Association of Canada</a>, a private-sector industry association, that recognizes environmental, social, and governance performance, enabling mining companies to differentiate themselves in global markets.  



<p>Equipped with the Mines Act Permit and TSM report, a mining company can easily prove that they are operating legally, and their sustainability claims are backed by audited data.

 Unravelling the Nuances of Online&nbsp;Spaces <p>Online communities often spill out across multiple digital spaces. While there is usually a central hub towards which newbies are pointed, conversations can be found all over the place. These discussions could manifest themselves as hashtags, subreddit discussions, or even impromptu group chats at&nbsp;events.</p><p>Lately, we’ve been involved in a few conversations where we had to clarify the three primary modes of online community interaction: chat apps, social networks, and forums. We’ve realised that organisations sometimes expect these interactions to occur all in location. Although technically feasible, it’s not always the optimal solution.</p>Scroll down to the bottom of this post for this text in a more accessible format Chat apps: swift and personalised interactions <p>Chat applications such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, or professional platforms like Slack, Mattermost, and Microsoft Teams, lend a personal touch to digital conversations. Their strength lies in instant, small group and private chats. Real-time notifications ensure you won’t miss critical updates, but these platforms may falter when it comes to large-scale discussions. Older threads and crucial information can be difficult to find, and the lack of anonymity could deter some&nbsp;users.</p> Forums: structured, lasting discussions <p>Forum platforms like Discourse, phpBB, and Flarum offer a way to host structured discussions that are easily referenced. They welcome everyone in the community to participate and the content enjoys a longer lifespan. However, forums are not real-time, so responses may take time. They can feel more formal and less personal, and moderation could be a challenge for larger&nbsp;forums.</p> Social networks: broad reach and rich&nbsp;content <p>Social networks such as Twitter, Mastodon, and Instagram provide a plethora of engagement opportunities and ways of reaching new community members. Hashtags and trending topics enhance content discoverability. However, the visibility of content, unless privacy settings are managed effectively, can raise concerns. Controlling content spread can be tricky and public posts can sometimes attract unwanted negativity.</p><p>Our recommendation is not to silo these platforms but to be strategic in how to use&nbsp;them.</p><p>Define your community’s ‘home’: Is it a chat app for real-time interaction amongst a smaller group? Is it a forum to ensure structured, easily referenceable discussions? Or is it a Twitter hashtag for broader engagement?</p><p>Remember, overlaps are inevitable. For instance, Discourse, a forum software, has a real-time chat option, but it isn’t a ‘chat app’. There’s a platform called Hylo which we’ve tested with one client that feels like a social network but has the underlying structure of a forum. It’s essential to recognise your community’s primary hub, even if conversations overflow into other digital&nbsp;spaces.</p><p>To sum it up, each online space — whether it’s a chat app, a forum, or a social network — has its own benefits and drawbacks. It’s important to think about what you want from these spaces and use them in a way that works best for your community. A good way to start thinking about that is to use our <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop/">Architecture of Participation</a> approach.</p><p>We’re curious to hear your thoughts. Have you figured out where your community feels most at home online? How do you handle conversations that take place in different online&nbsp;spaces?</p><p>The following is the text from the image which accompanies this&nbsp;post.</p> Chat Apps  Positives   Swift interaction: Allows for instant replies and prompt issue resolution.  Personal touch: Conversations often involve one-to-one or small group&nbsp;chats.  Effective notifications: Real-time alerts ensure messages aren’t easily&nbsp;missed.   Negatives   Not for large groups: The format doesn’t favour large-scale discussions or broad information dissemination.  Organisational challenge: Without appropriate management, old conversations or key information can be hard to&nbsp;locate.  Lack of anonymity: Users typically can’t hide their identity, which may not suit everyone.   Forums  Positives   Structured discussions: Forums allow for easy categorisation and referencing of&nbsp;threads.  Open participation: Everyone in the community can contribute.  Longevity: Content in forums remains accessible and can be referenced over&nbsp;time.   Negatives   Delayed responses: Forums aren’t real-time, so responses can take a&nbsp;while.  Formality: The structured nature of forums can make them seem less personal.  Moderation effort: Large forums can require significant resources for proper moderation.   Social Networks  Positives   Broad reach: Social networks allow content to be shared with a vast number of&nbsp;people.  Rich content: They support diverse types of content — text, images, videos,&nbsp;etc.  Discoverability: The use of hashtags and trending topics make content easily&nbsp;found.   Negatives   Privacy concerns: Unless privacy settings are carefully managed, content can be seen by&nbsp;anyone.  Control issues: Resharing posts can make information management tricky.  Unwanted negativity: Public posts can attract undesirable comments or trolling.   <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-good-the-bad-and-the-social-a7b7639165bd">The Good, The Bad, and the Social</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

      <p>But with challenges in the offing and platforms preparing to do battle, we must all support initiatives that support privacy and security, as well as the services that will bolster it. We must expect better and support the solutions that help us do better. That’s the only way to create a future where privacy and security are at the core of our collective digital experiences.</p>

      <p>Privacy is a human right. Surveillance has a chilling effect on free speech and freedom of association, which we consider to be fundamental tenets of democracy. Sure, you can make a bunch of money by learning everything you can about an individual and selling access to their attention. But not everything that is profitable should be permissible.</p>

  Decentralization is a commonly misunderstood concept. For example, it is sometimes said that the reason cryptonetwork advocates favor decentralization is to resist government censorship, or because of libertarian political views.

      <p>It is common to&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@jaygraber/decentralized-social-networks-e5a7a2603f53">hear people say that “decentralized” describes what a distributed system is</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@jaygraber/decentralized-social-networks-e5a7a2603f53">not</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@jaygraber/decentralized-social-networks-e5a7a2603f53">instead of what it is</a>. However, when using the word “decentralized” they typically mean something more than just the organization of the network. To them it implies a partitioning of the services, governance, and overall power structure to prevent any one entity, or user, from controlling others in the system. It then follows that a fully decentralized system — among many other things — atomizes the power structure to the smallest possible unit and distributes it out to the edges where it is under direct user control.</p>

      <p>Before setting out on solving the authentic data solution for global scale I wanted to best understand the problem of decentralization and then declare the principles that I bound myself while solving it. There was very little discussion other than some clarifications on what I mean by “absolute” privacy by default and how that may make users reluctant to use any software like that.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>But also, the general populations’ computer skills must be taken into account when designing the solution, along with legal considerations of whether individuals should be allowed to sell sensitive data, such as health data to third parties. If it is legal to monetize personal data, users can be tempted to share personal data in a way that might harm them later e.g. sharing health data and later being denied an insurance. Monetization might also create a gap in the society and the world, having rich people prioritize protecting their privacy while less fortunate citizens might feel like they have no other option than selling their data. Thoughts about the monetization of data need to be considered in a legal context as it has been done with the donation of blood, when creating a self-sovereign identity solution. Furthermore, safeguard measures must be made against discrimination like only providing identity for a selected few, and to ensure that everyone have equal access to creating a trustworthy digital identity.</p>

      <p>Credential Marketplace is quite high up the SSI stack but we want to start this discussion.</p>
       
         What is Credential Marketplace? 
         We have a Trust Triangle of Issuer-Holder-Verifier. This does not need any centralized entity except schema hosting. 
         However, we want to solve the problem of discovery of Issuers and Verifiers. 
         Example: I’m traveling to a new country. I need to get what healthcare VCs are needed to go there, in an automated way. 
         How can we solve this without relaying on a centralized registry of Verifier requirements and Issuer capabilities? 
         How it works 
         In order to discover issuers / vc types, there should be a registration step where issuers/verifiers actively OR passively provide metadata about their capabilities. 
         Credential Data — can contain some filters or constraints on the data from within the VC. E.g. As a Verifier, I only accept passport VC from only certain governments: only German nationals. 
         VC Metadata 
         Issuer Metadata 
         Reputation mechanism for credential issuers 
         Marketplace can also implement value transfer: paying for issuance by the verifier, for example. Even if they are part of different SSI ecosystems. This is optional but can help incentivize different participants.

<p>This white paper describes the need for a more secure and convenient solution for authentication. Passwords have long been the standard for authentication, but the risks inherent to passwords reduce their efficacy as an authentication mechanism. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions have been on market for some time, but their widespread adoption has been slow due to various barriers. Passkeys are an authentication solution that reduces the adoption barriers of traditional MFA mechanisms, while offering improved security, ease of use, and scalability over passwords and classic MFA solutions. Passkeys utilize on-device biometrics or PINs for authentication and provide a seamless user experience. This white paper outlines the benefits of passkeys, the user experience, and adoption considerations for enterprises.</p>

<p>Half-day virtual Authenticate Summit to educate on how passkeys can fit into a variety of enterprise environments</p>



<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., June 27, 2023 – <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> are a gamechanger for signing to online services and apps, providing phishing-resistant security and easy user experience far superior to passwords and other phishable forms of authentication. Enterprises globally are interested in passkeys but may be wondering: how do I start? And “what type of passkey is right for my environment?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance addresses these questions in a new series of papers providing considerations for leveraging passkeys across different enterprise use cases. The series was developed by the FIDO Alliance’s Enterprise Deployment Working Group (EDWG) and can be found at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The papers in the series are:</p>



 
 FIDO Deploying Passkeys in the Enterprise – Introduction 



 Replacing Password-Only Authentication with Passkeys in the Enterprise 



 FIDO Authentication for Moderate Assurance Use Cases&nbsp; 



 High Assurance Enterprise FIDO Authentication&nbsp; 
 



<p>A fifth paper in the series, “Displacing Password + SMS OTP Authentication with Passkeys,” is expected to publish later this summer.</p>



<p>“Passkeys are a new concept to many enterprise organizations, in terms of both terminology and FIDO authentication capabilities,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “These papers demystify synced and device-bound passkeys and provide the decision points for how to leverage them across a variety of use cases, whether they are using passwords alone, legacy MFA or FIDO-based solutions today.

  Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is a cryptocurrency area that has recently been attracting significant attention. DeFi refers to financial services using smart contracts. These are automated enforceable agreements that do not need intermediaries, such as banks or lawyers, and use online blockchain technology instead.

<p></p>



 Corporate overview and challenge 



<p>As the “CASE” trend is gaining ground in the automotive industry, Toyota Motor Corporation, a leader and evolving company in the industry, is changing its model from a “car company” to a “mobility company”. In the area of “C: Connected,” Toyota is working to realize its vision of “Mobility for All – Freedom and Enjoyment of Mobility for All People,” and is developing a number of new services, including a “digital key” that allows the use of smartphones as keys, as well as a website and smartphone applications, for a wide range of users.</p>



<p>The “TOYOTA/LEXUS common ID” (“common ID”), a customer authentication service for safe and comfortable use of various services provided by Toyota, plays an important role in the provision of a series of services. The 5 million TOYOTA common IDs are linked to about 40 different services, and the multiple smartphone applications provided to customers required the input of IDs/passwords for each application.</p>



 FIDO 2 deployment 



<p>Toyota Motor Corporation has decided to deploy FIDO authentication as an optional authentication function for the “Common ID,” the major advantage of which is that by registering FIDO authentication credentials in advance, users will no longer need to go through the process of entering their ID/password each time they use each smartphone application.</p>



<p>Prior to deploying FIDO authentication, Toyota Motor Corporation had been using one-time password authentication and backup code authentication as a means of multi-factor authentication for common IDs. The main reason for choosing FIDO as one of the new options for multi-factor authentication this time was the consideration of the robust security and usability of FIDO authentication. By utilizing FIDO, which is a multi-factor authentication that involves possession using biometrics on the smartphone used in everyday life, a high level of security was ensured, and it also contributed to an improved user experience.</p>



<p>NRI Secure Technologies, Inc. (NRI Secure), which manages common IDs, has an authentication infrastructure called “Uni-ID Libra” that is compliant with FIDO authentication, and we requested their cooperation for implementation.</p>



<p>Until the introduction of FIDO authentication for iOS and Android devices, the differences in behavior depending on the OS (whether or not Discoverable Credential (formerly known as Resident Key) is supported, explicit user interaction during key registration is required for Safari for iOS, etc.) The issue was the impact on the UX.In the end, we were able to absorb the differences in UX by modifying the authentication web screen, and this led to a solution.</p>



<p>With this implementation, Toyota Motor Corporation has also focused on the importance of designing the life cycle of FIDO authenticators together. In providing services, it is necessary to prepare not only for authentication, but also for registration, device switching, and account recovery in case of loss. If other companies that provide services to consumers consider FIDO authentication, they should have a method that can maintain security strength when switching devices or recovering accounts.</p>
 



  
 


 



 



<p>OVERVIEW<br>Toyota Motor Corporation, headquartered in Toyota City, Japan, is Japan’s largest automobile manufacturer.<br><br>C (Connected): <br>IoT for automobiles<br><br>A (Autonomous): <br>Automated driving<br><br>S (Shared &amp; Services): <br>From ownership to sharing<br><br>E (Electric): <br>Electric vehicles</p>



 



<blockquote>
 “With the expansion of the connected strategy, the number of operations that can be carried out on smartphone applications and websites has been increasing. While convenient, they can also lead to accidents if misused, so more security measures are required. We believe that FIDO authentication will contribute as one piece to continue providing convenient and safe mobility services to our customers.”

These are major issues requiring strong and widely adopted open standards in today’s fast-paced and interconnected business environment.</p>



<p>Supply Chain Integrity: Maintaining the integrity of the supply chain is a challenge for many organizations as it involves ensuring that all stakeholders in the supply chain act ethically and responsibly. This includes ensuring that suppliers adhere to labor laws, environmental regulations, and ethical business practices.</p>



<p>Risk Management: Supply chain risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential risks in the supply chain. This can include risks related to suppliers, logistics, and regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Operational Intelligence: Supply chain operational intelligence refers to the use of data and analytics to improve decision-making and enhance supply chain performance. This requires organizations to have access to real-time data, advanced analytics capabilities, and the ability to quickly respond to changes in the supply chain.</p>



<p>Supply Chain Security: Supply chain security is a critical challenge for organizations as it involves protecting the flow of goods, information, and resources from theft, damage, and other security threats. This requires organizations to implement robust security measures and to have contingency plans in place to respond to security incidents.</p>



<p>Overall, addressing these challenges requires organizations to have a strong understanding of their supply chain, as well as the ability to monitor and respond to changes in real-time. This can be achieved through open standards and with the support of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things.</p>

      <p>Decentralization is key to transitionate to Web3. Many voices are speaking up for a decentralized model in which users have the control over their digital assets and data. And this is so because each time that we interact on the Internet, copies of our data are sent to the server of a service provider.  We lose control over our data. We lose our digital sovereignty.

<p>The event will gather industry leaders, cybersecurity experts, and government representatives across the region to explore the latest developments in authentication technologies.</p>



<p>Singapore, June 26, 2023 — The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> announced today its first-ever FIDO APAC Summit 2023, the premier event dedicated to advancing and promoting phishing-resistant FIDO authentication in the region. The summit, co-hosted by Vietnam Ministry of Information and Communications, will take place in Vinpearl&nbsp;Nha Trang, Vietnam, on August 28 – 30, 2023.</p>



<p>For more information and to register your interest in the summit, please visit the website <a href="https://fidoapacsummit.com/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cybersecurity landscape in Asia-Pacific has undergone significant growth and transformation in recent years, driven by the rapid digitalization, increased internet penetration, and the rapid adoption of advanced technologies such as cloud computing, AI, and the Internet of Things (IoT). As businesses and governments become more reliant on digital infrastructure, cyber threats have grown increasingly sophisticated and widespread, resulting in a surge in prominent cyberattacks and data breaches. With Asia-Pacific accounting for <a href="https://in.newsroom.ibm.com/2023-02-22-IBM-Report-Asia-Pacific-Felt-the-Brunt-of-2022-Cyberattacks">31%</a> of all incidents globally in 2022, there is a crucial need for more robust authentication methods — and there is no better time than now for organizations to take the necessary steps forward.</p>



<p>The theme for this year’s event is “Connecting for a Safer Digital Future” which aims to highlight the importance of secure, phishing-resistant authentication methods, specifically focusing on FIDO standards and <a href="http://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>. The summit will bring together various industry leaders, cybersecurity experts, and government representatives from the region to discuss the latest developments and share best practices and success stories. Attendees can expect insightful keynote presentations, engaging panel discussions, comprehensive technical workshops, and ample networking opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The FIDO Alliance is excited to host its first Asia-Pacific Summit 2023 in Vietnam. Around the globe, we are witnessing an increasing number of cyberattacks and scams stemming from weak or stolen credentials — and this is no different in the APAC region. Fortunately, there has been a steady momentum toward adopting passkeys based on phishing-resistant, FIDO authentication by organizations here to combat these threats,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance. “Through this summit, we hope to facilitate knowledge sharing in the various areas of authentication, and we encourage anyone interested to learn more to join us.”</p>



<p>Deputy Minister of Vietnam’s Ministry of Information and Communications, Nguyen Huy Dung, said, “We are delighted to take part in organizing this event.” He emphasized, “We fully endorse the adoption of passwordless authentication technology to secure Vietnam’s digital economy.” He continued, “Our aspiration is to foster connections and collaborations with the FIDO Alliance and other APAC region countries for a safer digital future.”</p>



<p>The conference will feature more than 25 VIP guests and speakers from the APAC region, with over 300 attendees expected. Key summit speakers this year include member companies from the FIDO Alliance, such as VinCSS, Google, Mastercard, Samsung Electronics, NTT Docomo, SK Telecom, SecureMetric, AirCuve, ETDA and MK Group, among many others.</p>



<p>Registrations are now open to the public. While the event is offered free of charge, all delegates are required to book a minimum of three nights at the event venue, Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang. For more information and to register your interest in the summit, please visit the website <a href="https://fidoapacsummit.com/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About the FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

<p>In what it called the “beginning of the end of the password,” Google last month began&nbsp;rolling out its own passkeys, an effort that could help agencies go passwordless and embrace a “zero trust” approach with layers of authentication required. Google’s move could create a “positive snowball effect” away from passwords, said Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance, which works to develop open authentication standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The emergence of verifiable credentials (VCs), has paved the way for secure and reliable digital identification and authentication. Today, we stand witness to a significant milestone as verifiable credentials have reached a level of maturity that enables their practical application in various real-world use cases. In New Zealand, the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) Bill passed earlier this year, setting the legal basis, and rightly creating an open accreditation scheme for service providers to proliferate the use of VCs and digital identity more broadly in our everyday lives. What an exciting time to be in digital identity in New Zealand! The on-the-ground mahi and fun starts now.</p>



<p>I’m of the opinion that the conditions are ripe for enterprises to forge ahead with real world applications and we’re already seeing some great success especially from our DINZ members. As part of this newsletter I thought I’d use this opportunity to highlight some great Kiwi trailblazers paving the way for digital identity proliferation, and give them a platform to shine.</p>



<p>MyMahi –&nbsp;Bringing inclusion to our young rangatahi</p>



<p><a href="https://mymahi.com/">MyMahi&nbsp;</a>a Palmerston North based company epitomises listening to their customers, starting out as an NCEA credit counter in 2014, and very quickly solving and iterating on their learner users challenges, becoming a learning pathway and journey platform. Building on their learner’s feedback, MyMahi has developed a verified digital student ID, breaking down barriers in inclusion for our youngest Kiwis. Most recently putting out a petition to parliament urging financial institutions to recognise verified digital identities helping bank our youngest New Zealanders. MyMahi creates equity and inclusion for our future generations through digital identity.</p>



<p>JNCTN – Keeping lives safe through trusted health &amp; safety record keeping</p>



<p><a href="https://jnctn.nz/">JNCTN</a>&nbsp;a Petone based company is blazing the trail in real world use of Verifiable Credentials, solving a pertinent problem of workforce health &amp; safety record keeping assurance. Pen and paper methods of verifying health and safety records in high risk industries have been prolific, and pose existential risks to both workforce and employer.&nbsp;JNCTN’s credential management system allows for high assurance capture of workforce training and compliance records, assuring every worker that enters a high risk worksite not only the evidence of training, but the assurance that they have the practical training to respond. JNCTN saves lives through verifiable credentials.</p>



<p>These are just two wonderful DINZ members taking a lead in the world of digital identity, and from my personal interactions with organisations both large and small, 2023 will be a breakout year for digital identity, so watch this space and Kia Kaha!</p>

<p>Innovative technology that brings sustainability data from the physical world into a trusted digital environment is essential to global climate action. Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust provides digital trust solutions for the natural resource sector, empowering companies to prove their sustainability practices. Today, EMDT is moving from the research and development phase into production – making the process of sustainability reporting with digital credentials a reality for the mining sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EMDT was initiated by the Government of British Columbia, Canada, in partnership with TELUS to explore the use of digital trust technology for the natural resource sector. Throughout the project’s pilot phase, EMDT earned international recognition for the unique application of digital credentials for organizational identities using Hyperledger technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CHALLENGES IN SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING&nbsp;</p>



<p>To compete in a global market that prioritizes sustainably sourced products, mining companies must be able to prove where their products originated and how they were produced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current process for proving sustainability claims is inefficient due to:&nbsp;</p>



  Diverse regulatory models  Varied reporting standards  A lack of interoperable digital tools  



<p>EMDT’s pilot use cases demonstrate that digital credentials offer a solution to these challenges, driving a new approach to sustainability reporting, and empowering mining companies to share verified data that can be trusted.</p>



<p>Tamper-proof and verified in real time, a digital credential enables anyone viewing it&nbsp; to determine who the issuer is, that the credential is valid, and that it has not been revoked – regardless of where or to whom it is shared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MOVING TO PRODUCTION</p>



<p>As EMDT’s mining sector use case moves into production, mining companies, regulators, and governing bodies will experience the benefits of digital trust technology first-hand.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Participating mining companies will be issued two digital credentials:&nbsp;</p>



  Mines Act Permit – A credential issued by the Government of British Columbia that regulates all mining activity in the province. Using this credential, mining companies can confirm the legality of their operations to a multitude of recipients.  <a href="https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/">Towards Sustainable Mining</a> (TSM) report – A voluntary benchmarking standard governed by the <a href="https://mining.ca/">Mining Association of Canada</a>, a private-sector industry association, that recognizes environmental, social, and governance performance, enabling mining companies to differentiate themselves in global markets.&nbsp;  



<p>Currently, mining companies are forced to share data through insecure channels, such as email, and customize data to meet specific requests. Buyers, auditors, and regulators must take companies at their word that the data is accurate. These challenges have resulted in a lack of trust in reported data, especially in complex international supply chains.</p>



<p>Equipped with the Mines Act Permit and TSM report, a mining company, such as <a href="https://cumtn.com/">Copper Mountain Mining Corporation</a>, can easily prove that they are operating legally, and their sustainability claims are backed by audited data. Since digital credentials can be shared with multiple audiences with just a few clicks, Copper Mountain can immediately share this information internationally, increasing efficiency, transparency, and trust as they participate in&nbsp;</p>



 

 



<p>COLLABORATIVE ACTION: INTEROPERABLE TECHNOLOGY</p>



<p>Interoperable technology is essential to EMDT’s expansion. During the pilot phase, EMDT developed a tool called Traction, based on <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a>. Hyperledger Aries maximizes Traction’s interoperability with the technology solutions that exist globally. Traction will be utilized by the Government of British Columbia to send and receive digital credentials, including the Mines Act Permit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EMDT has built a network of technology partners offering wallet solutions that enhance information exchange even further. Any wallets built on Hyperledger Aries can seamlessly exchange digital credentials. Technology providers such as <a href="https://northernblock.io/">Northern Block</a>, whose enterprise wallet is also built using Hyperledger Aries, demonstrate how both private and public sector solutions integrate to maximize impact for end users. EMDT’s participants can leverage any interoperable tool of their choice, while maintaining security and efficiency in credential exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GOING GLOBAL: SCALING TO INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAINS&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust project will produce increasing value for participants as it grows in scale and scope. To facilitate this, EMDT is leading joint activities with the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (<a href="https://unece.org/trade/uncefact">UN/CEFACT</a>) through the <a href="https://uncefact.unece.org/display/uncefactpublic/Critical+Minerals+Traceability+and+Sustainability">Critical Minerals Traceability &amp; Sustainability project</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through this work, EMDT and UN/CEFACT will leverage the findings of EMDT’s use cases to showcase the value of digital trust technology. This collective action will build upon the UN/CEFACT’s capacity to develop and deliver digital standards and best practices for sustainable supply chains. A focus on interoperable open-source technology can help to overcome barriers to adoption and encourage global participation and collaboration in line with UN/CEFACT’s guidelines for successful traceability initiatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CONCLUSION</p>



<p>As EMDT’s ecosystem of participants grows, so do opportunities to digitize verifiable data from across various operations, streamline business processes, and collaborate towards climate action goals.&nbsp;EMDT demonstrates how digitalization has the potential to improve the international exchange of critical data while prioritizing privacy and data security for suppliers and operators.

<p>We just finished the pilot of our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/applications-are-open-learn-how-to-bring-a-responsible-data-approach-to-your-work-with-our-cohort-learning-programme/" title="">new cohort learning programme</a>, designed to equip social justice leaders with the knowledge and tools needed for implementing responsible data! Back in April, my colleague Bárbara wrote about <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/updates-from-our-responsible-data-cohort-learning-programme/" title="">the first half of the programme</a> and in this blog post, I’m sharing updates and learnings as we wrap up this pilot.</p>



 Getting practical&nbsp; 



<p>Our hope for this programme was for participants to not just understand why practising Responsible Data is important, but also to get a sense of what RD actually looks like in their day-to-day work. With this in mind, in the last two weeks of the programme we shifted to more practical applications of responsible data in participants’ work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the fourth session we <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">became ‘RAD’</a> and covered how to map an organisation’s data and set up&nbsp;practices for data retention, archival and deletion (RAD). Participants walked away with templates and processes that they can continue to iterate on with their teams and incorporate into their own organisational processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the fifth session we talked about how participants can begin to think about their data and RD practices at the systems level,&nbsp;using assessment frameworks to determine where they were at currently, developing plans for next steps, and determining progress made. We also took some time to talk about how participants will incorporate these new learnings into tech tool selection.&nbsp;</p>



 Where we are: a few takeaways from the second half of the programme 



<p>During the course, I was able to chat with some of the participants individually, through one-on-one calls. Originally, the purpose of these calls was to provide additional Responsible Data guidance outside of class time for those that were interested. However, these calls also opened my eyes to the amazing work already being done by our participants. More about this in our next blog post!</p>



 Making everyday tweaks to how teams work with data, and celebrating “tiny victories”, can be powerful moves toward establishing a sustainable RD approach &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>For some participants,&nbsp;their next step will be to get their team and peer organisations more involved and to get buy-in for moves towards more robust RD practices. For these organisations, sharing the importance of RD and implementing small, immediate actions that will give the organisation ‘tiny wins’ may provide the momentum for the organisation to continue to move forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, while thinking through their RAD plan in Module 4 – which asked participants to think about the what, who, how and why of their data processes – one organisation mentioned that simply acknowledging and looking at the potential unintended consequences of working with data was in itself an invaluable process and extremely eye-opening.&nbsp;</p>



 Not a checklist: seeing responsible data as an ongoing practice 



<p>As part of the final module, we asked participants to plan out the data journey they intended to take after completing the course. Participants planned out their short-, mid-, and long term goals, but more importantly also acknowledged that their participation in this programme was just a part of the journey, and that there was still much work to be done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One organisation planned to speak to their funders in order to make sure they were aligned when it came to data collection and sharing. By remaining cognizant of the fact that adopting responsible data practices is a continuous learning process, and by prioritising daily practice over achieving a final ‘endpoint’, organisations can continue to make progress.</p>



 Taking one step at a time and getting ready to dive deeper&nbsp; 



<p>I found that although many organisations have already begun practising responsible data (RD) in some capacity, they often lack clear guidance and resources to take their efforts to the next level. For example, while preparing RAD plans together in Module 4 we learned that many of our participants had already developed guidelines around the data they collect, but could benefit from more information on securing and deleting it. In Module 5, we dived further into what implementing these changes might look like when it comes to the platforms participants are using, or could be using, in their day to day work.</p>



 What’s next?&nbsp; 



<p>In the coming weeks you can expect to hear from us on how we put this programme together, as well as our learnings from the experience. We’ll also go into the factors that went into the selection of the topic and participants, as well as considerations around the technologies used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Energy Web will leverage Polkadot’s interoperable multichain technology to bring decarbonization to&nbsp;Web3 <p>LONDON, ZUG, June 20, 2023 — <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web</a>, the world’s largest ecosystem of companies using open source, decentralized technologies to accelerate the energy transition, is coming to <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a>, the next-generation blockchain network powering the movement for a better web. The move will allow Energy Web to create the framework for a new technology, Energy Web X, helping its partners — which include major players like Shell, Vodafone, Volkswagen, and RMI — accelerate their decarbonization strategies.</p><p>Having developed digital solutions with dozens of major energy companies and nonprofit organizations from more than 25 countries, Energy Web is focused on two key areas. One is to help electric utilities digitize and integrate distributed energy resources to the grid; the second is about bringing deep levels of transparency and verifiability to emerging green product supply chains — including 24/7 matched renewable electricity, sustainable aviation fuel, and sustainably produced&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><blockquote>Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web, said: “Energy Web and our global enterprise partners are collectively on a mission to make clean energy an integral and widely-accessible part of the global electricity system. To achieve this important goal, we decided to search for a blockchain platform that offers real enterprise-grade security and seamless upgradeability to ensure a safe and future-proof environment. Polkadot excels on both of these fronts with its shared security model and best-in-class core technology. We couldn’t be more excited to build out the energy transition vertical on Polkadot. Energy Web X will be based on worker node networks. Each of these is a decentralized group of computers jointly executing sensitive business processes that involve or impact multiple companies. Enterprises will be able to deploy thousands of independent worker nodes, coordinate them in cohesive networks, and allow the public to verify the results of their&nbsp;work.”</blockquote><blockquote>Björn Wagner, CEO of Parity Technologies, a leading contributor to the Polkadot network, said: “The energy transition vertical is a perfect use case to take advantage of the the benefits of blockchain technology, and it’s a space where Polkadot is well positioned to be a market leader. We’re especially pleased to see Polkadot bring competitive advantages to initiatives and enterprises making a positive environmental and social impact. In choosing to build a custom Polkadot parachain, Energy Web will get the performance and security its industry partners require, as well as faster time to market and access to Polkadot’s best-in-class interoperability. I’m excited to partner with the Energy Web team to accelerate the transition to clean&nbsp;energy.”</blockquote><p>Energy Web is launching a bid for a parachain slot on Polkadot with the joint aim of building a thriving ecosystem focused on the global energy transition. Further details about Energy Web X’s plans will follow at <a href="https://polkadot.network/ecosystem/events/decoded-2023/">Polkadot Decoded</a>, the network’s flagship summit, to be held in Copenhagen, June 28–29. Ana Trbovich, vice chair of the Energy Web Foundation, will also appear on a regulatory panel at the&nbsp;event.</p><p>This announcement follows hot on the heels of others involving big names from diverse sectors like music, gaming and accounting joining the Polkadot ecosystem. The Energy Web X parachain will join the many other projects that are already building on the Polkadot Relay Chain. By the end of Q1, a total of 42 parachains had joined Polkadot, representing sectors such as DeFi, privacy, social media, sustainability, NFTs, gaming, and the metaverse. Many of these parachains are platforms in themselves, collectively hosting hundreds of Web3 applications.</p><p>Parachains help projects expand at scale by leveraging each other’s strengths to unlock new use cases, and enjoy the shared security advantages provided by Polkadot.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>We recently interviewed Otto Mora, Business Development Lead in the Americas for PolygonID and discovered more about their platform and vision. The full interview can also be viewed on <a href="https://youtu.be/U7ObwVh5DAc?ref=blog.identity.foundation">YouTube</a></p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Thanks for joining us today Otto. Really glad to have you here today representing Polygon ID. Before we get further into the details of Polygon ID and what you guys are up to, I'd like to hear a little bit about yourself. Can you give our audience a little bit of an introduction of who you are and how you came to the decentralized identity space?</p><p>OTTO MORA: Yeah, Absolutely. I'm originally from San Jose, Costa Rica. My original exposure to decentralized identity, and I guess SSI was in early 2016 at a ConsenSys Conference in New York, where I remember Christopher Allen was first talking about identity 2020, and you know, bringing in the concept of SSI. It just became clear to me that solving identity on blockchain, specifically blockchain ecosystems was a hugely important thing that would really help out blockchain adoption.</p><p>So, I first became conscious of that back then. &nbsp;It kind of stayed in the back of my mind and I followed various decentralized identity projects such as uPort. &nbsp;I think I applied like seven times to work at uPort, but it didn't come through. I did eventually get into web3 full time around 2018. &nbsp;I was working at EY leading a team of developers, and I kind of got engaged with the community in Costa Rica and I was a founding member of the Costa Rican Blockchain Association.</p><p>We did the first Ethereum Hackathon and all that kind of eventually led into getting into Polygon. That original knowledge around identity and some of the things we did at EY helped me get into PolygonID and leveraging ZK (zero-knowledge) technology for identity.</p><p>That's a little bit about my story and yeah, I really feel fortunate to be in this space and it's been super interesting.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Yeah, great and I know I spoke to you a few weeks ago, and I asked you a little bit of the story of Polygon ID, but you didn't tell me the whole story. So I've been waiting for this moment to hear it, because it really is interesting, some of the background. Can you give us a little bit on that?</p><p>OTTO MORA: Yeah, absolutely. &nbsp;You know, back then it was called Hermez Identity and it’s actually quite fascinating. All three founders, Jordi Baylina, Anthony Martin and David Schwartz are all from Barcelona, Catalonia Spain. As you know there's some tensions between the regions in Spain and the central government, and Catalonia is no exception. Catalonia back then was heavily into this independence referendum that they were trying to do, and tried to make it kind of a demonstrable referendum to convince people that there was a chance to be independent.</p><p>They started playing with the idea of an online referendum using blockchain technology. So that's when the identity project was born. How do we do identity on top of a blockchain system to be able to do this voting that they wanted to do? All of that kind of came to “You know what? The blockchain actually doesn't scale quite well, the transactions per second are not that great.” That led them to founding another initiative, in addition to the Iden3 initiative which was called Hermez.</p><p>Both initiatives kind of matured over time, and eventually Polygon was looking to acquire companies. Polygon actually got started a little bit earlier than them. They got started around 2017 or so and they had been looking at scaling blockchains, they had looked at the original proof of stake blockchain. They were now looking for the next iteration of that. What's the next scaling solution that they can bring to the market? Then they kind of stumbled upon the Hermes project at a conference in Paris. Eventually they agreed to acquire Hermez and bring them into Polygon.</p><p>Then both of those things came together. So both the Hermez project, which is like the zkEVM scaling project that was there, as well as the Iden3 project, which is also kind of an a project that Polygon decided to just embrace and then build Polygon ID using all of the Iden3 technology that was really developed by Jordi and the team in Catalonia.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: That's so fascinating. That's why I really love hearing the stories of these various companies because a lot of times it's not a linear path. There was a problem they were trying to solve, and it led into a new enterprise. So that's really fascinating. One thing that I'm curious to hear, if I were someone coming to Polygon ID and I wanted to use your services, what would be my journey into the Polygon ID ecosystem?</p><p>[Link to video on youtube:<a href="https://youtu.be/U7ObwVh5DAc?t=332&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation"> https://youtu.be/U7ObwVh5DAc?t=332</a>]</p><p>OTTO MORA: &nbsp; There's various items that we have. I'll just share my screen to kind of show you a little bit of a walkthrough of what that looks like, and a little bit of the features of our DID method. The polygon ID protocol is a protocol that aims to keep user’s privacy. We have a DID method and our DID method has various features such as key rotation, it allows you to do a private revocation, it allows you to manage profiles so users can have multiple profiles that they can expose. If you're interacting with a verifier, you can choose which profile to use and independent of that, you can use any of the credentials that were issued to you. It also has CKQuery language which allows verifiers to ask questions about the profiles, and then present those credentials and generate proofs to respond to the questions from the verifier.</p><p>We have a couple of methods to issue credentials, one that is kind of gas-less, and another one that enables on-chain, which is the MTP Method. (Merkle Tree Proof) It also uses Baby JubJub keys for optimized generation of ZK proofs in mobile devices. And then an interesting thing for anybody looking to use our DID method is that It's EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible, the DID method could be used in any kind of EVM chain, and it's also fully open source under an MIT Apache license. The heart of the protocol is really that you have a verifiable credential, the credential will say, a few attributes about your identity. Maybe it'll have information about your date of birth. Maybe it'll have information about your country of citizenship, it could have information about your credit score. Then you'll interact with the verifier, the verifier will ask a set of questions around that set of credentials that you have in your wallet and then in order to answer those questions, you'll be generating a zero-knowledge proof directly from your device be it your mobile phone or be it your browser that you're using to interact with the blockchain at that point.</p><p>So you generate those proofs, and then in doing so, you present those proofs to the verifier. They can check the validity of those proofs. They can check that the data is correct. What you've done now at this point is that you reveal just enough information to answer the questions from the verifier instead of the whole credential data. So this is the famous thing in centralized identity. &nbsp;Show me that you're over 18 without telling me where you live, what's your full name and where you were born? All these things are just not revealed, but just the specific answers to the question that is being asked by the verifier. This is the heart of the protocol, this is kind of the innovation that we bring.</p><p>If it's okay with you, I can show you a brief video of what that looks like and kind of just a more practical use case.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Sure that'd be great.</p><p>OTTO MORA: Let me just jump into that. This is just a quick sample demo of what this looks like. [Link to demo: https://youtu.be/U7ObwVh5DAc?t=516] This is just showing you our polygon ID application. It's a sample application. We are enabling multiple wallet providers to integrate with us.</p><p>At this point this is just the wallet creation process. You’re creating your wallet. You're getting it set up for the first time. You have no credentials inside of your wallet. You're now going to go to a website that's going to issue you credentials. So the first step is connecting your wallet. You're connecting your wallet to get the basic authentication. &nbsp;Now that the authentication has been done, now your wallet is connected.</p><p>At this point, you may be asked to show some credential data. Maybe if it's a university, if you passed a test, maybe some other thing. Whatever set of data is required by the issuer in order to be able to offer you the claim. It could be an identity verification process, it could be any sort of thing. Eventually the verification is successful, and then you're offered a set of claims. So now you continue to add claims. You can see that QR code there that has the claims that you are now able to scan with your device.</p><p>You're seeing that now a set of claims are being offered, one is a proof of personhood. Another claim is showing you as a member of a DAO. Another claim is your date of birth and then another claim is your country of residence. These claims are just like a set of credentials or cards that are stored in your wallet at this point and the claims get added.</p><p>Now you can go into the wallet app and you can see these purple cards in there. These various credentials that were issued to you and the data that's inside of them. So now you have those credentials and now we're going to actually make use of the credentials. Now is that process of interacting with the verifier being asked the question and then satisfying that. So now we're going to go into this sample DAO interface, which is Grail. We're going to connect our wallet just like we did the last time.</p><p>Now we're going into voting for a proposal. So for voting for the proposal, here's a kind of proposal that we want to vote on, but before we can vote we have to prove our eligibility to vote. In order to vote we're now being asked, prove to me that you're a member of this DAO. So from the various credentials that we have, we're now going to use one of them, and we're going to answer the question, are you a member of this DAO? Yes or no. That is kind of what's going to trigger now, this cryptographic proof generation in which now you can generate the proof to answer your question from the verifier. Once the proof is generated, you can now vote.</p><p>Now you've successfully voted on the DAO. So that's just kind of illustrating a little bit of that process of, you have a credential that's issued to you, you go to a verifier, and you would get asked a bunch of questions about your credentials to generate some proofs on your device. Then you've successfully revealed data about your credentials without revealing the full credential. So that’s the main kind of innovation that we bring. That’s a little bit of the flow of what that looks like.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Okay, and this can be used in various contexts as well, such as credentials for workplace, credentials for education? Could also be applied in those cases as well?</p><p>OTTO MORA: Our intention is that you could go with the number of verifiers and reveal data about yourself. Prove to me that you're a graduate of a computer science degree, yes or no. That kind of question. Or prove to me that your credit score is between 500 and 600 and that makes you eligible for a loan or something like that.</p><p>Then we have other more elaborate ones. Maybe you're at a traffic stop and you're interacting with a cop, and you use your phone with an NFT and you quickly answer yes or no to a bunch of questions such as; is your car’s kind of insurance up to date? Do you have the proper registration? Is your license not expired? You're able to answer all those questions very quickly, generating a proof without revealing more data than what's required.</p><p>So yeah, it's use cases like that where we envision this being used. Both web3 and web2 use cases. Within web3 we think DAOs, these online cooperatives, would benefit a lot from this. Defi protocols as well, looking to do some KYC, things like that. But there's also web2 use cases. We’re starting with web3 that's our initial focus area, but we want to go further than that, if possible.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Can you share a little bit about your business model? I know people are always curious about that. How are you going to market at this point?</p><p>OTTO MORA: It's fully open source. We don't really charge for Polygon ID. At this point we see it more as a complement to the Polygon ecosystem. We're not intending to directly monetize the identity protocol, but it's more just a reason for people to build on top of the Polygon blockchain. We get additional incentives and revenue by more people using our blockchain, we get more fees, and that helps everybody in the ecosystem. So that's a little bit of why this is being released fully open source, and as a benefit to the community at Polygon.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: I know you have been involved in our community over the past few months. Polygon ID joined as a DIF member earlier this year, and you've been involved in some of the various work groups. Can you share a little bit about what are some of the work items that you followed and integrated into some of the work at Polygon ID?</p><p>OTTO MORA: We have various items from the DIF that we are already integrated with or are intending to do integration with or engagement. So one of them is the DIF Universal Resolver, [https://dev.uniresolver.io/] which we've already implemented and I know Marcus was nice enough to review it for us, so very thankful for that. We are intending to support the well known DID configuration. It's in our roadmap along with creating more trust in the ecosystem of who are the issuers, trust registries and things of that nature. We're also looking to get some support for Credential Manifest. [<a href="https://identity.foundation/credential-manifest/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://identity.foundation/credential-manifest/</a>] It's this thing called output descriptors that provide guidance for wallets on how to display the credential cards, what logo to use, what color to use when displaying. That was brought to our attention by Thierry from the AltMe wallet. We’re open to input on the product and adopting these standards is important to us where we see it makes sense.</p><p>Then from the last Internet Identity Workshop I saw this work around the standard wallet container that's being led by Sam Curren. That's also something that's of interest to us. We do have a growing ecosystem of wallets, and we ideally would want them to follow standards and bring data vaults and things of that nature.</p><p>So that's something that we're also looking to engage with. We're open to more, and it's all about building together in the community with the folks at DIF so we're looking forward to contributing.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Then my little side plug is to anyone who's viewing, you can get involved in these work items at DIF. We are an open-source community, and we also have membership options, so you can join and get involved in that. [<a href="https://identity.foundation./join?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://Identity.foundation/join</a>}</p><p>The other thing I wanted to ask is in terms of the vision of Polygon ID. Where do you guys see things going in the next 5-10 years? How do you see some of the work that you're doing, impacting the economy and the way we do things?</p><p>OTTO MORA: Absolutely, I think for us it's solving at least in the more immediate term the need for identity verification in the web3 space, solving identity for DAOs, solving identity for Defi protocols and getting more adoption from the various wallet providers. I think that the issue perhaps now is, people don't really care so much about privacy or keeping their data private as much. I think over time that'll change. So I think maybe we're a little bit early with this whole ZK Technology, that some people are happy to show their full credentials and be done with it, they'll say they'll have nothing to hide.</p><p>But I think over time privacy will become more and more relevant, and we see this as one tool that will get people to care about it and be able to implement privacy.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: If there are any companies out there who are interested in working with Polygon ID, should they get in touch with you? What would be the easiest way for them to do that?</p><p>OTTO MORA: They can get in touch with me, also on Twitter as well my handle is @ottomorac [<a href="https://twitter.com/ottomorac?s=20&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://twitter.com/ottomorac?s=20</a>] Also we have a Discord channel on the Polygon site that you can access. [https://discord.gg/0xpolygon]</p><p>If you want to get in touch with our Business Development team for Polygon ID, you can do so as well from the Polygon website. [https://polygon.technology/contact-us] You go to Polygon ID, and then there's a contact form there.</p><p>If you have specific questions, or if you want to engage with us because you have a project, or you have a wallet, and you would like to talk to us, that's another way to engage with us.</p><p>Then, finally we're also open to code contributions. It's fully open source, so if somebody has a unique feature they would like to contribute to us, we're definitely open to that. We can do a pull request on Github as well if you have something you want to contribute.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Sounds great, and for our viewers I'll make sure to have all those links in the notes on our Youtube Channel as well. It was great having you today Otto and hearing more about Polygon ID and your journey as well, and I'll &nbsp;also encourage our listeners if you get a chance, go to our website<a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> https://identity.foundation</a> as well to join and become a member.</p><p>Thank you so much once again Otto and if anyone else joins in the community you can you'll be able to see Otto there as well.</p><p>OTTO MORA: Awesome.

<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., June 16, 2023 –&nbsp; The <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3574062-1&amp;h=1964299261&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fidoalliance.org%2F&amp;a=FIDO+Alliance">FIDO Alliance</a> announced today that two of its specifications, FIDO UAF 1.2 and CTAP 2.1, are recognized as international standards by the <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/Pages/default.aspx">International Telecommunication Union’s Telecommunication Standardization Sector</a> (ITU-T). This milestone establishes these standards as official ITU standards (ITU-T Recommendations) for the global infrastructure of information and communication technologies (ICT).</p>



<p>ITU-T is the standardization arm of ITU, the United Nations specialized agency for ICT. The FIDO Alliance specifications were approved as official ITU-T Recommendations by ITU members including national administrations and the world’s front-running ICT companies. The new ITU-T Recommendations are under the responsibility of ITU’s standardization expert group for security, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=h2uksEW6vztNCZspihTRhrVWtNNbUo0tPRk0YHzGEM-yo7JS7O56YYzuluDXWTsE3QwhOCS2ujB3BqL8I8vjsBzZ5vQ-g61N2X2Q1NGRFbXag2fPyu3zqKwgvAwlSC-XUuE96CPNujODt2rdmRRpyg==">ITU-T Study Group 17</a>.</p>



<p>“The FIDO Alliance is improving online authentication through open standards based on public key cryptography that make authentication stronger and easier to use than passwords or one-time passcodes. One of the ways that we fulfill this mission is by submitting our mature technical specifications to internationally recognized standards groups like ITU-T for formal standardization,” said David Turner, senior director of standards development at the FIDO Alliance. “This recognition from ITU-T illustrates the maturity of FIDO authentication technology and complements our web standardization work with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).”</p>



<p>“Predecessors of these FIDO UAF and CTAP specifications were first adopted as ITU standards in 2018. ITU-T Study Group 17 will continue to strengthen its collaboration with the FIDO Alliance. These two FIDO Alliance specifications, adopted as ITU standards recently, are being widely used in various industries such as the financial sector to provide strong online authentication based on public key cryptography and various user verification methods,” said Heung Youl Youm, Chairman of ITU-T Study Group 17. “These new ITU standards will provide a concrete basis for the two FIDO specifications to be adopted across the 193 ITU Member States.”</p>



<p>“Our working group within ITU-T Study Group 17 was pleased to be able to collaborate with the FIDO Alliance to promote the standardization of state-of-the-art security technologies,” said Abbie Barbir, Rapporteur for ITU-T’s working group on ‘Identity management and telebiometrics architecture and mechanisms’ (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0vqmC84tYiwa2gXDiKhL_u0vrU7nmpak1cKMTTXa_gJl3VNJ7a-DU_yOSxi1IQTcZLP6bu27UY2s_UyrK5LVEvLN95Xl4vCtp9kwMjN_gUdRC29joDmh--9rjLN0BsVA">Q10/17</a>). “This work will help address and solve the security limitations of passwords and move the world closer to passwordless solutions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The specifications that are now ITU-T Recommendations are:</p>



 
 FIDO UAF 1.2 (Recommendation ITU-T <a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-x/recommendation.asp?lang=en&amp;parent=T-REC-X.1277.2">X.1277.2</a>). A mobile standard providing authentication without passwords by using biometrics and other modalities to authenticate users to their local device. 



 CTAP 2.1 (Recommendation ITU-T <a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-x/recommendation.asp?lang=en&amp;parent=T-REC-X.1278.2">X.1278.2</a>). Part of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2 specifications</a> along with the W3C Web Authentication standard,&nbsp; allows the use of external authenticators (FIDO Security Keys, mobile devices) for authentication on FIDO2-enabled browsers and operating systems over USB, NFC, or BLE for a passwordless, second-factor or multi-factor authentication experience.

<p>As we navigate the fallout of the global health crisis, governments worldwide have proposed solutions to ensure public health safety and restore normality. Among these, health passports stand out as a prominent tool in managing the pandemic. The planned Government-Issued Health Passport and the German Gesundheitpass are significant examples of this development. However, while these initiatives might seem beneficial, they raise considerable ethical, privacy, and equality concerns. In contrast, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) presents an alternative that could provide a more democratic, secure, and equitable solution.</p>


 
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/lionsgate.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/health-passport.jpg?ssl=1"></a> 


<p>Government-Issued Health Passport and the Gesundheitpass, although different in name, serve a similar purpose. They aim to document and certify an individual’s health status concerning COVID-19. However, the data collection, storage, and usage that these systems demand pose significant challenges.</p>



<p>A Government-Issued Health Passport system could potentially place immense power and sensitive data into the hands of governmental authorities. This data, beyond the control of the individual, could be susceptible to misuse, raising valid concerns about privacy and surveillance. This implementation may inadvertently result in an invasive surveillance system under the disguise of public health safety.</p>



<p>Similarly, the German Gesundheitpass, despite being well-intentioned, does not escape these privacy concerns. The scale of data collection and potential for tracking that it allows can also give rise to a surveillance state. Furthermore, being digital, it assumes an even level of digital literacy and access, which is far from reality, particularly for the elderly and socio-economically disadvantaged populations.</p>



<p>Moreover, both systems can lead to a divide between those who can access vaccines or tests, and thus the passport, and those who cannot. Consequently, this can result in a bifurcated society, where the passport holders enjoy more freedoms than those without.</p>



<p>The alternative solution to these issues lies in the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). SSI provides individuals with control over their personal data, offering a secure, democratic, and inclusive system for verifying health status. It upholds the principles of privacy and equity, presenting a significant advantage over the Government-Issued Health Passport and Gesundheitpass.</p>



<p>SSI operates on the principle of decentralized identities, with users retaining control over their personal data. In the context of health passports, an SSI-based system would allow individuals to prove their health status without revealing more information than necessary. The possibility of surveillance diminishes significantly, as the underlying health data remains private.</p>



<p>Moreover, SSI’s approach can help bridge the digital divide. It doesn’t require extensive digital literacy and can be adapted to various interfaces, making it accessible to a wider population. This inclusive solution respects the privacy and autonomy of all individuals, reducing systemic biases and discrimination risks.</p>



<p>The technology underpinning SSI, typically blockchain, provides a secure, tamper-proof system for verifying identities and claims. It enhances trust in the system, even in the absence of a central authority.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while the Government-Issued Health Passport and Gesundheitpass may seem to offer a solution to managing the pandemic, they carry the risk of increasing surveillance, perpetuating inequality, and undermining privacy. In contrast, SSI offers a promising alternative, putting the control of personal data back into the hands of individuals. This approach respects individual autonomy, promotes equality, and ensures privacy – a far cry from the inherent concerns of the health passports. As we navigate these complexities, we must prioritize solutions that uphold both public health and personal freedoms. SSI is a promising step in this direction.</p>

<p>Why PNC Opted for FIDO</p>



<p>Security is of critical importance to PNC and its customers. PNC’s approach to provide digital services is founded on a strong commitment to privacy protection to those who use its services. Multi-factor authentication is a key component to protecting customer identities and data, and FIDO’s standard helped provide a roadmap to implementation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, PNC has been able to provide customers authentication options that are easy to use but still afford consistency in terms of protection. This translates into high-quality identity assurance to verify and validate that the right customer is enrolled and minimize the risk of impersonation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We needed to find a way to create a user-friendly mechanism to improve customer security without creating a burdensome process that required so many steps that it dissuaded customers from enrolling or engaging,” said Susan Koski, Chief Information Security Officer at PNC.</p>



<p>Benefits Realized</p>



<p>By using FIDO standards, PNC has been able to manage the authentication experience in such a way that it leverages the security features of a customer’s device, applying industry best practices for designing this identity protection mechanism.&nbsp;Ultimately, FIDO standards have been a core component to PNC’s cybersecurity strategy to minimize the risk of authorized access to customer credentials.</p>



<p>“We continue to identify ways to improve security for our customers, ultimately reducing the reliance on passwords and other phishable credentials from our ecosystem is a critical aspect to protecting our customers” Koski said.</p>

<p>The OASIS Board of Directors are integral to the organization's success. Read our Q&amp;A to gain a better sense of who they are and why they serve the OASIS community.</p> 


<p>Meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bretjordan/">Bret Jordan</a>, an accomplished executive with 30 years of experience in the field of cybersecurity. Jordan has successfully led various global enterprises, startups, academic institutions and nonprofits. At OASIS Open, he has made significant contributions as a co-chair, editor, and advocate for numerous standards, including STIX, TAXII, CACAO, and OpenC2. In recognition of his expertise and the impact he’s had in his field, Jordan was honored as an OASIS Distinguished Contributor in 2020. Read more in our Q&amp;A:</p>



<p>Can you tell us about your current role?<br>I currently work as Chief Security Strategist at <a href="https://www.afero.io/">Afero</a>, a technology company building a secure by design or born secure IoT platform as a service (PaaS). We provide an enterprise grade, end-to-end secure solution for consumer IoT products. My role is to work on strategy, long-term horizon scanning, and those parts of the product that deal with end-to-end security.&nbsp;<br><br>What kinds of things is your company working on?&nbsp;<br>Afero was the first to build a comprehensive and managed IoT platform upon a foundation of Enterprise-grade PKI. Security is a “red thread” woven through and connecting every layer of the platform — it’s not just a feature, it is an intrinsic quality. We have made substantial advancements in this field, evident by our impressive portfolio of approximately 100 patents which serve as undeniable evidence of our continuous commitment to innovation.</p>



<p>There are several things that make us unique, one of which is our patented onboarding solution that does not require Bluetooth pairing. You simply scan the QR code for the product, turn it on, and it is done. This means, in most cases, devices are online and working in seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Afero’s customers is The Home Depot. Afero has built the secure IoT platform for all of their private label brands: EcoSmart, Defiant, Hampton Bay, etc. The program and ecosystem is called Hubspace, and that is also the name of the app. We provide an enterprise grade end-to-end secure solution for their IoT products all the way down to constrained light bulbs. Because of the Afero solution, The Home Depot has experienced a significantly lower customer call volume and product return rate for their Hubspace products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One simple but meaningful use case for smart and connected bulbs is that you can easily change the color temperature of the bulbs to make them all match or have them automatically turn on or off with the rising or setting of the sun. With Hubspace these pain points are removed. Ten years ago, this would’ve been viewed as a premium service or something that only tech enthusiasts would have utilized. Five years ago, if you wanted a smart and connected light bulb you would have had to pay a significant premium. Today, this functionality is available to everyone. You can even control these products directly from your phone or a voice assistant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we have seen is that the average user just wants to plug in their smart devices and have them just work. They do not want to try and cobble together a bunch of random products and technologies; they want a simple to use ecosystem. Afero has addressed this problem and these pain points and invented technology to solve it.</p>



<p>What can you tell us about your new podcast?&nbsp;<br>We’ve recently launched a podcast called <a href="https://www.afero.io/html/home/smartereverything.html">Smarter Everything</a>. The premise is to talk about the transition to a smarter and more connected world as we begin to bring more connectedness into our daily lives. I like to refer to it as the hyperconnected edge that we’re moving to. It’s where things are going, and there’s a lot that needs to happen before we can get there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the industry moves down this path and consumers deploy these technologies and products, there are many things that need to be considered to ensure that end users are protected, and their privacy is maintained. The widespread availability and minimal additional expense of IoT products has made the smart and connected world available to everyone; we’ve reached the point where people are eager to buy these products and we want consumers to be informed about not only the benefits they provide, but how they can utilize them in a more secure and productive way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did you get involved with OASIS?<br>My journey into international standards started many years before I joined OASIS, back in the late 1990s/early 2000s with the 802.1X protocol and its various EAP methods. Then in the mid 2010s I started working on the Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) and Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) work when it was still at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). I subsequently joined OASIS when DHS moved the STIX and TAXII work there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once STIX and TAXII were at OASIS I became heavily involved. I ended up chairing a lot of the STIX and TAXII work for about eight years. I also served as an editor of the documents and helped coordinate and orchestrate the comments and feedback that came in from the group. The STIX and TAXII community at OASIS was incredibly active with around 350 members at one point. I also worked on the Open Command and Control (OpenC2) when it was a National Security Agency (NSA) project and continued working on it when it was first brought to OASIS. These three projects really got me involved in OASIS. I have since gone on to co-start the Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) for Cyber Security work.</p>



<p>What inspired you to join the OASIS Board?&nbsp;<br>After working on STIX and TAXII, I knew that I wanted to enhance my contributions and better serve the OASIS community. My goal was to foster stronger connections between the board and the membership. My intention was to enable members to gain deeper insights into ongoing activities and enable them to provide valuable feedback to help drive change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once I joined the OASIS Board Process Committee, I helped facilitate not only my changes, but changes from everybody else. I wanted to address the issues that members cared about. As chair of the Process Committee, I have instigated a transition to an open model using GitHub for our document creation and tracking. This way, OASIS members can submit issues or even do pull requests. We’re really trying to connect the board back to the membership because ultimately the OASIS membership is the foundation of the organization.</p>



<p>How do you see your background and experience complementing the current board?&nbsp;<br>My background has been in cybersecurity; I have been working in this space for about 30 years on the academic side and the enterprise side. I understand how to run very large projects and programs – things that take months, quarters, or years to complete. My day-to-day experiences span from the operational side to the management side and to the research side, which adds a unique combination for the work we do here at OASIS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everybody has their own little bit of expertise that they bring to the board and it’s all incredibly important and valuable. I think my expertise stands out because I’ve had the opportunity to work closely with other standards development organizations (SDOs) and standards setting organizations (SSOs), gaining valuable insights into their problem-solving approaches, and learning what works and does not work at scale for standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is it about the OASIS community that you’re passionate about?&nbsp;<br>I like OASIS because it’s a true community with a sense of purpose and an organizational structure that lets groups get work done. Not every SDO or SSO is like that; a lot of them have controlling autocracies where a couple of individuals tend to drive the conversation and stomp out ideas they do not personally like. OASIS doesn’t tend to feel like that. Most of the groups here at OASIS are very true to the form of traditional standards that are driven by consensus. Meaning, it’s not unanimity, and not everybody gets a pony. The rules and processes at OASIS are much more conducive to getting people around the table and getting actual work done. OASIS processes are not heavy handed and do not lend themselves to having one person control everything; there is no benevolent dictator for life in a TC at OASIS. Also, at OASIS, there is a process and a plan for what it takes to actually get something done, and members understand this. They also understand the amount of work and effort that is needed to bring a standard to completion. In other SDOs and SSOs this can be vague and up to the whims of certain individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why do you think companies and organizations bring their projects to OASIS?&nbsp;<br>OASIS provides a mechanism for organizations to get like-minded people together and get work done in a meaningful way. Other SDOs have antiquated mechanisms that either prevent success, are designed to stall success, or enable a very small group of individuals to control the destiny of what gets started and ultimately worked on. OASIS is a bit more nimble. It is not perfect, but in a lot of ways it is better than many SDOs. The benefit of bringing work to OASIS is you get the great governance and IPR protections that come along with going through an official SDO, and OASIS makes it easy. If I have an idea and there are enough people interested and willing to support it, we can join forces and start working on it, it is that simple. Try doing that in another SDO or SSO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What do you think about the work being done at OASIS?&nbsp;<br>There’s a lot of great projects that people know about, but do not realize they come from OASIS. Things like SAML, XACML (the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language), STIX and TAXII, CACAO (the cybersecurity playbook or the Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations), and OpenC2. All of these things are focused around solving real world problems in operational cybersecurity – and they all came out of OASIS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can you share some examples of the impact of your work?<br>STIX, TAXII, and CACAO are the biggest projects that I’ve contributed to here at OASIS. But I have done work in the IEEE, IETF, and ITU-T. I have also written an RFC (RFC 8785) about JSON canonicalization, which enables digital signing of JSON data. I am also currently working on a contribution to the X series documents (e.g., X.500, X.509) at the ITU-T for the actual signing of JSON data. This is desperately needed as most of the data that’s transmitted today over the internet or through browsers is JSON based and there is currently no good way to digitally sign it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early on in my career I was involved in another noteworthy project. I worked on an 802.1X supplicant, the actual client piece of an 802.1X session, and we built the first widescale 802.1X roaming network which became the foundation for the idea of what is now called Eduroam. We wrote a white paper at the University of Utah about it, and the creators of Eduroam read our white paper and basically made a bigger version. We had this idea and called it out in our white paper. We talked about it in the context of Universities being able to crosslink authentication and do local authorization but remote authentication at the university of your choice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do you have any role models that helped you in your career?&nbsp;<br>There have been a few people over the years. I started my career in academia, designing, running, and building very large networks on high performance academic grid systems. I’ve also worked in startups and large enterprises. The three people that have inspired me the most and helped me early on in my career were two of my supervisors and one co-worker. One was Hugh Thompson, former CTO at Blue Coat and Symantec, and current chair of the RSA Conference. The second person was Joe Levy. I worked for Joe when he was CTO at Solera Networks and then at Blue Coat. Both helped me see a bigger picture early on in my career and really encouraged me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was working at the University of Utah in the College of Engineering, I remember having a discussion with a network engineer named Joe Breen at the Center for High Performance Computing. In that discussion, Breen figuratively opened a door just enough to let me see that there was not just another room on the other side of the door, there was a whole other world that existed. Joe opened my mind to the idea that this space is so much bigger and so much more involved than what I had previously conceived; the computer and cybersecurity spaces are so vast and so deep. Since that time I have become obsessed with learning new things. If I was independently wealthy, my dream would be to go to MIT and just do every degree program they offer, starting at A and working my way to Z.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What trends or changes do you see in the industry that are most exciting to you? How can OASIS prepare itself for what you think may be coming our way?&nbsp;<br>About eight years ago, I gave a talk at the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) meeting in San Diego. Hugh Thompson and I spoke, and I talked about the security of banks being ultimately derived down to the security of a light bulb. I knew this stuff was coming, but I did not yet fully grasp how pervasive it was going to be. Then in 2019, I went to the ITU World CTO Conference in Budapest to talk to all the CTOs of the various telcos about my view and vision for this hyperconnected 5g enabled edge. I had been working on this theory for quite some time, for about four years before I gave that talk in 2019. We are now starting to see that actually come to fruition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what excites me the most is this hyperconnected environment that we’re going to get to, where every computer and device will be interconnected, talking to each other, and making decisions in cyber relevant time. Everything will need to work together seamlessly. There is a lot of infrastructure, technology, and standards that need to be created to make sure this actually works. There are a lot of pieces on the cybersecurity side that we need to make sure stay secure. But there are also the actual communication paths and pieces that make it all work. We are going to get to this point where things need to communicate in a very different way than what has been done before. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Typically, we have a one-to-one relationship with technology. For example, you have one computer and one phone. But in this hyper connected world, when you start thinking of all of the sensors and all of the physical devices, you will have orders of magnitude more devices per person. A normal home equipped with IoT products may easily have 50-100 devices. Look around your home, by the time you add up all of your existing e-readers, computers, smart speakers, and all the other things that are internet connected it is very common to have 30+ devices and you have not even started deploying IoT. That excites me because it is going to fundamentally change the way we have to design, secure, and interact with our environment. Even in my office, where it’s just one person, there are probably 15-20 connected devices. We need to make sure all of that works seamlessly and is end-to-end secure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, everything that we have been doing in cybersecurity for the past while does not work all of the time. We have known this for a while, but we still just keep bolting on technology and putting oxygen on the fire. We’ve been utilizing the same model of security since I started doing this work back in 1993. Month after month, quarter after quarter, year after year, organizations keep getting compromised and breached, so we know the model is somewhat broken. What we need to do is step back, go to standards, and look at how we could redo this from the ground up to make this world a better and more secure place. Standards play a huge role and I see OASIS being able to do a lot of great things in this space, especially in coordination with other premier SDOs. I find all this very exciting.</p>



<p>What are some of your career accomplishments that really stand out to you?&nbsp;<br>Being part of the STIX and TAXII community really stands out to me because that was just such a monumental amount of work. There were weeks where the editorial group, John Winder, and Rich Piazza from MITRE, and I were resolving more than 500 comments and suggestions each week for weeks on end. It was normal for us to have 15-20 hours a week spent on working calls trying to address the number of contributions that were coming in. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s some valuable advice that you’ve received in your career?&nbsp;<br>Kindness goes a long way. I also think it’s important to have an open mind and not to jump to conclusions. Try to understand that, for the most part, everyone is doing the best they can with what they’ve been given. It’s important to understand another person’s perspective and their point of view before you jump into a rash decision. If you step back, listen, and try to understand an issue, you’re going to learn more than you ever realized. The more engagement you have and the more people you talk to, the more you can learn about the areas that you don’t know about. It is then up to you to actually go and do some research and try to understand things a bit better. But it is key to be a little kinder and a little more patient.</p>



<p>What’s a fun fact about you?<br>I love to cook. I approach cooking in a very scientific way and much to the chagrin of my family, I will make things over and over until my family says that I have deemed it perfected. I then document it and then I move on to something else. They keep asking me when I am going to make this or that again, and lately the question has been “when are you going to make that cheesecake again?” I also keep a logbook for cooking to keep track of when I made a specific dish, the results, and what I liked or didn’t like for the next time I make it. I also weigh all my ingredients and I view my recipes as replication steps, not just a simple recipe, because recipes have a lot of vagueness (a pinch of this and a pinch of that).&nbsp;</p>

<p>ComposeDB on Ceramic is a decentralized, composable graph database that empowers developers to store and interact with their application data efficiently and swiftly. By integrating Ceramic infrastructure with an indexer, reusable data models, and GraphQL, ComposeDB paves the way for the creation of truly interoperable and composable Web3 applications.</p><p>The core Ceramic team recently unveiled a new CLI tool named <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/set-up-your-environment?ref=blog.ceramic.network#installation-using-wheel">Wheel</a>. This tool simplifies the process of running Ceramic nodes locally. Moreover, it incorporates a straightforward Web3 social application that developers can utilize to interact with ComposeDB on Ceramic, or even leverage it as a foundation for their unique projects. This tutorial will guide you through using Wheel and the embedded example Web3 social application, enabling you to engage with ComposeDB on Ceramic in a matter of minutes.</p><p>By adhering to this guide, you will accomplish the following:</p>  Configure your development environment  Run a local Ceramic node  Operate a fully functional example dApp on your local machine  Understand the subsequent steps to continue building on Ceramic  <p>Let’s get started!</p> Requirements <p>For this tutorial, ensure you have the following tools and resources installed on your system:</p>  A code editor that suits your preferences (for example, VSCode)  A web browser that you're comfortable with (we'll be using Chrome for this guide)  <a href="https://nodejs.org/en?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Node.js v16</a> or a newer version  <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">jq</a>  <p>After you've installed the necessary dependencies and prepped your development tools as outlined above, you can dive into setting up your work environment with Wheel.</p> Configure your working environment <p>When it comes to building applications using ComposeDB, it's essential for every developer to run their own node. This step ensures your node can connect to the Ceramic Anchor Service to generate commits on a blockchain, thereby enabling seamless data composability between applications.</p><p>First, let’s create our project folder where we will keep all the files and directories used for this tutorial. Open your terminal and run the following commands:</p> <code>mkdir ceramic-getting-started
cd ceramic-getting-started
</code> <p>The most straightforward path to configure and run a Ceramic node is through Wheel—a user-friendly CLI tool. Wheel not only allows developers to run Ceramic nodes locally, but it also walks you through the entire configuration process with a clear, easy-to-understand prompt. </p><p>Note, for more visual walkthrough, check out this video which illustrates all of the setup steps written below:</p><p>To download the Wheel on your local machine, run the command below. This command will download the Wheel in your working directory:</p> <code>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceramicstudio/wheel/main/wheel.sh | bash
</code> <p>Once downloaded, start the Wheel by running the following command:</p> <code>./wheel
</code> <p>Executing this command will kick-start the environment configuration prompt. Here, you'll have the ability to select which Ceramic-specific dependencies you'd prefer to install, and how you'd like your Ceramic node to be configured.</p><p>If you're brand new to ComposeDB on Ceramic, we suggest you begin with the default setup. This configuration is lightweight and easy to manage.</p><blockquote>📌 The default configuration will run your Ceramic node in-memory, meaning it won't connect to the Ceramic Anchor Service or create commits on a blockchain. Therefore, your app data will only be saved locally on your machine. The indexed data will be housed in a straightforward and lightweight SQLite database, requiring no additional configurations on your part. This setup serves as an excellent launchpad to start engaging with ComposeDB on Ceramic and to experiment with its features.</blockquote><p>Simply follow the prompt and confirm the following default configurations by hitting <code>return</code> key on your keyboard:</p>  Project Type: <code>InMemory</code>  Project Name: <code>ceramic-test-app</code>  Project Path: <code>default</code>  Include Ceramic?: <code>Y</code>  Include ComposeDB?: <code>Y</code>  Include ComposeDB Sample Application?: <code>Y</code>  Admin DID Configuration: <code>Generate DID and Private Key</code>  File to save DID private key to?: <code>default</code>  Wheel config file location: <code>default</code>  Configure Ceramic?: <code>Defaults: Use default configuration based on network</code>  <p>At this point, the Wheel will start the process of installing dependencies. Once complete, you'll be prompted with the question, <code>Would you like Ceramic started as a daemon? (Y/n).</code> Choose option <code>Y</code>. This action will fire up your local Ceramic node and construct an example app for you to experiment with. You'll know everything is up and running smoothly if you see the following output in your terminal:</p> <code>Application demo is available at 
Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app. To run the demo application:

cd /Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app
npm run nextDev
</code> <p>Keep this terminal running and now let’s dive into the example Web3 social application!</p> Example Web3 social application <p>The example Web3 social app, a simple example of decentralized Twitter, is a creation of the 3Box Labs team. It's designed to offer developers a glimpse into how applications work with ComposeDB on Ceramic, and serves as an example of how to implement the basic core functionality using Ceramic tools.</p><p>The application comes packed with the following features:</p>  Sign-in using DID Key or your Metamask wallet  User profile creation  Post creation  The ability to follow other users  Access to the posts of those you follow on an 'Explore' page  <p>So, you may ask, how do you launch this application? At the end of the previous section, we noted the output you should expect to see in your terminal if everything is operating smoothly:</p> <code>Application demo is available at 
/Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app. To run the demo application:

cd /Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app
npm run nextDev
</code> <p>Follow the provided instructions to navigate to the example app directory and start the application:</p> <code>cd /Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app
</code>  <code>npm run nextDev
</code> <p>The output of this command will look similar to the one shown below.</p> <code>&gt; demo@0.1.0 nextDev
&gt; next dev

ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: &lt;http://localhost:3000&gt;
</code> <p>Copy the provided url <code>http://localhost:3000</code> and open it in your browser. This will launch the example application in your browser for you to interact with.</p> Interacting with the application <p>Once you open the URL that your application is running on, you should be greeted with the following user interface:</p><p>At this point ,you can start interacting with the application by choosing your authentication method. You can choose from the following options:</p>  Key DID—an authentication method using <code>did:key</code> method  Ethereum DID PKH—an authentication method that uses an Ethereum wallet (e.g. Metamask)  <p>Choose the authentication method that you prefer and start interacting with the application:</p>  Click on Profile tab and create your profile:  <p>2. After creating your profile, head to Home tab and create your first post:</p><p>3. Head to Explore tab and check out currently existing posts. You should see your own post posted there:</p><p>If other users started using your application, you would be able to see their posts in the Explore section as well. This would also give you an option to follow other users. You can simulate this behavior by logging out and signing up for the application using a different authentication method.</p> Explore what’s under the hood <p>One of the best things about this example application is that you can see everything under the hood, including all of the implementation, data models, and frontend components.</p><p>Remember the path that was provided to you by Wheel? You can find all of the application files there:</p> <code>Application demo is available at 
/Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app
</code> <p>Once you navigate to the project directory you should see the following files:</p><p>When you navigate to the <code>composites</code> directory, you'll discover all the data models utilized by this application defined using the GraphQL schema definition language. The application comes with four data models:</p>  <code>basicProfile.graphql</code> - This data model offers a GraphQL implementation of a fundamental user profile data model  <code>post.graphql</code> - This data model provides a GraphQL implementation of a user post. It also delineates a relation to the <code>basicProfile</code> model  <code>postsProfile.graphql</code> - This data model establishes a relation between the <code>basicProfile</code> model and the <code>post</code> model  <code>following.graphql</code> - This data model outlines a schema for preserving the data of the users being followed. Notably, this model also defines a relation to the <code>basicProfile</code> model, enabling user profile data retrieval  <p>Make sure to open these files to explore how data models are defined and how they tie to the details you see on the frontend. For example, if you open <code>basicProfile.grapqh</code> you’ll probably recognize the fields like <code>name</code>, <code>username</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>gender</code> and <code>emoji</code> you set when creating your profile:</p> <code>type BasicProfile @createModel(accountRelation: SINGLE, description: "A basic Profile") {
  name: String! @string(minLength: 3, maxLength: 100)
  username: String! @string(minLength: 5, maxLength: 255)
  description: String @string(minLength: 3, maxLength: 100)
  gender: String @string(minLength: 3, maxLength: 100)
  emoji: String @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 2)
}
</code> <p>In addition to data models, you can explore the the <code>pages</code> directory that contains the implementation of pages you see when you interact with the application. There you can see some examples of how <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides/data-interactions/queries?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Grapqhl queries</a> are used to retrieve and display the information you see. For example, if you open the <code>explore.ts</code> file, you will see an example query that is used to extract the data that is displayed once your open the <code>Explore</code> page on your app:</p> <code>query {
        postsIndex (last:300) {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              body
              created
              profile {
                id
                name
                username 
                emoji
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
</code>  Interact with the data using Graphiql server <p>As you engage with the example Web3 social app, you're creating user data that's stored on the Ceramic network (this depends on the project-type you selected when setting up your Ceramic node). You can smoothly interact with this data using a straightforward <code>Graphiql</code> server and crafting GraphQL queries. Here’s how you can accomplish this:</p>  Open a new terminal and generate a runtime representation of your composite:   <code>npx composedb composite:compile src/__generated__/merged.json src/__generated__/runtime-composite.json
</code> <p>2. &nbsp;Start the <code>Graphiql</code> server:</p> <code>npx composedb graphql:server --ceramic-url=http://localhost:7007 --graphiql src/__generated__runtime-composite.json --port=5005
</code> <p>You will know that the server is successfully up and running if you see the following output in your terminal:</p> <code>GraphQL server is listening on &lt;http://localhost:5005/grapqhl&gt;
</code> <p>3. &nbsp;Copy the provided URL and open it in your browser. This should open a Graphiql interface. This interface has 3 core parts:</p>  Top left terminal for writing the GraphQL queries  Bottom left section for providing variables and headers for your queries  Section on the right for displaying the query output  <p>4. Run the following query to get the first 2 records of the user profile stored:</p> <code>query{
 basicProfileIndex(first: 2) {
   edges {
     node {
       name,
       description
     }
   }
 }
}
</code> <p>The output of this query looks as follows:</p> Next steps <p>The integration of Wheel and the example Web3 app aims to provide developers with an easy starting point. It simplifies the process of running Ceramic nodes and offers a tangible application to experiment with. If you've followed this tutorial, here are some promising next steps to continue your journey as a Ceramic developer:</p>  Dive into the <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB documentation</a> to familiarize yourself more with the technical concepts discussed in this tutorial  Interact with the data by constructing more advanced GraphQL queries, or even update an existing record by executing a <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides/data-interactions/mutations?ref=blog.ceramic.network">mutation</a>  Launch the example app on <code>clay-testnet</code> which will connect your node to Ceramic Anchor Service and create commits on a blockchain. You can achieve this by selecting the <code>clay-testnet</code> project type when following the Wheel prompt  Improve the application—introduce a new feature or use it as a foundation for your own unique project. Here are some ideas for you to consider:    Add a feature to "like" a post.  Create more sophisticated queries to filter the posts displayed on the "Explore" page  Introduce a feature to comment on a post  <p>We're eager to see what you'll create!

<p>Oamo, a decentralized data broker, aims to revolutionize the data economy by allowing users to own and monetize the value of their data. It replaces the outdated cost-per-click model, compensating users directly for their attention. This creates a fair and transparent data economy aligned with the trend of zero-party data. The platform enables users to share their on-chain and off-chain data anonymously with trusted companies in exchange for exclusive token rewards and promotions. </p><p>Data privacy is a growing concern for individuals, organizations, and governments around the world. Scandals, such as those involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, have highlighted the need for greater data privacy protections. Data brokers, who make billions of dollars by collecting and selling user data without their consent, are facing increasing scrutiny and regulation. Oamo aims to address these challenges by giving users control over their data and empowering them to monetize it.</p><p>As more of the world’s economy moves on chain, organizations need a better understanding of their target audience across Web2 and Web3 to reach consumers directly. Oamo foresees a new paradigm where companies build consensual relationships with their audience, with users willingly sharing behavioral information and accepting offers.</p><p>Ceramic and <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB</a> are at the heart of Oamo’s architecture—as they gear up for their launch later this year, users will be able to build their Oamo Profile (a Ceramic DID), connect their wallets across chains and social profiles, and generate credentials based on their on-chain and off-chain behaviors. These credentials can be shared anonymously with trusted companies for rewards, opening up the potential for personalized offers.</p> User-Centric Design: Oamo's Use of ComposeDB on Ceramic for Data Ownership and Control <p>One of the significant challenges that Oamo faced in its mission was ensuring data privacy and user control. The founders wanted to create a data economy where users truly own their data in a private manner and share behaviors with selected companies without revealing any personally identifiable information. One key challenge was designing a data-sharing platform that allowed users to connect multiple wallets and social profiles to a single profile, while still maintaining ownership and privacy. Oamo also aimed to enable companies to send personalized offers without revealing personal information. These challenges required a robust and secure solution that could handle decentralized data storage, encryption, and messaging capabilities.</p><p>ComposeDB on Ceramic became the backbone of Oamo's architecture. Users create their Oamo Profiles as Ceramic DIDs and generate verified credentials that align with their on-chain and off-chain behaviors. User credentials are then stored in ComposeDB and encrypted with Lit Protocol, ensuring users have complete control over their data. This solution allows companies to send personalized offers to users without revealing personal information, ensuring user anonymity while reaching the target audience trustlessly.</p><blockquote>"Ceramic accelerated our product development process exponentially by providing a robust ecosystem of tools that covered all our design goals. We believe it’s the only solution that could power true private ownership of data spanning across Web2 and Web3," - Yannick Folla, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Oamo</blockquote><p>Oamo's founders had been following Ceramic's journey from the early days of SelfID to Ceramic's current all-in-one package of DIDs, verified credentials, multi-chain support, decentralized data storage, and encryption support via Lit Protocol—this array of tools and capabilities perfectly aligned with Oamo's core design goals.</p> Building a Secure Data Economy With Ceramic and Lit Protocol <p>In Oamo's architecture, when a user generates a DID, the data saved in that stream is in plain text and publicly accessible. Given the sensitive nature of user data, it's crucial to encrypt this data and set permissions to restrict access. To achieve this, a user creates a salt and generates a DID using that salt. Then, the backend creates the requisite dataset and sends it to the user for encryption using Lit and storage in Ceramic. During the encryption process, the user sets permissions so that only the Oamo smart contract has decryption rights. </p><blockquote>"Through our research, we saw Ceramic as the only viable solution that would package DIDs, verified credentials, multi-chain support, decentralized data storage, and encryption support via Lit Protocol. It’s an all-in-one solution that ticks all the core design goals at Oamo."</blockquote><p>This approach ensures user data privacy and gives users control over where their data is stored. Ceramic's unique capabilities, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), verified credentials, multi-chain support, messaging capabilities with ComposeDB, decentralized data storage, and Lit Protocol encryption, made it the clear choice for Oamo.</p> Get Involved <p>If you're interested in participating in the new data economy, where you truly own your data and its value, <a href="https://spearmint.xyz/p/oamo-beta-waitlist?ref=blog.ceramic.network">join Oamo's allowlist</a> today and prepare for the upcoming launch!</p>

 The Social Power of Open Recognition Badges Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>These days, it’s rare to come across a completely blank face when talking to people about <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a>. That’s because recently we’ve seen mass adoption, meaning that hundreds of millions of badges are now being earned every year. After 12 years, we’re no longer in the world of ‘potential’ use: badges are now helping people get&nbsp;hired.</p><p>However, as important as ‘getting hired’ is, it’s possible to go beyond badges as microcredentials for hiring. To use Douglas Rushkoff’s phrase, we can use badges to help ‘find the&nbsp;others’.</p><p>Who are these ‘others,’ you may ask? They’re the individuals who share our aspirations, interests, and intentions. They’re those with whom we align not only in our professional competencies but in the philosophies and values that drive us. Through this lens, badges become common symbols, connecting us over shared priorities and paving the way for deeper collaborations.</p><p>So, in this post, we’re going to explain how WAO is going through the process of identifying areas to create badges for <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a> in a bid to ‘find the others’. We hope that by reading this you might be inspired to do likewise for your organisation, group, or&nbsp;network!</p><p>We envisage this being a five step&nbsp;process:</p>  Identify priority&nbsp;areas  Badge the priorities  Find the&nbsp;overlaps  Create badge&nbsp;imagery  Find the&nbsp;others  <p>In this post, we’ll cover steps one to three. Once we’re further along our journey, we’ll check back in with a Part 2 which will cover steps four and&nbsp;five!</p> Step 1: Identify priority&nbsp;areas <p>In a previous post entitled <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/practical-utopias-and-rewilding-work-27c148d95b16">Practical utopias and rewilding work</a>, we showed the result of some work we’d done during a recent monthly co-op day. We outlined five thematic areas we see as ‘priorities’ for our&nbsp;work.</p><p>The result was the diagram above. But how did we come up with these&nbsp;areas?</p><p>While planning for our co-op day, we came across two prioritisation approaches that generated excellent results: <a href="https://medium.com/the-ready/even-overs-the-prioritization-tool-that-brings-your-strategy-to-life-e4f28f2949ac">Even-over statements</a> and the <a href="https://www.ns-businesshub.com/business/yancey-strickler-bentoism/">Bento box model</a>. Let’s have a look at what they generated.</p> Bento box&nbsp;model <p>We began with the Bento box model from Yancey Stricker’s book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/591594/this-could-be-our-future-by-yancey-strickler/#">This Could Be Our Future: a Manifesto for a More Generous World</a>. It’s a simple activity to run either using paper, or in our case, online using <a href="https://whimsical.com">Whimsical</a>. We adapted it very slightly to use the key question: What do you want to work on and&nbsp;how?</p><p>The Bento box model is a simple 2x2 grid which asks about wants and needs, for you and the organisation, both now and in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Here’s how we approached this activity:</p>  Asked everyone to work on their own grid by themselves and begin with NOW ME and then move on to FUTURE&nbsp;ME  Ran a round of feedback, including how easy/hard we found it. People shared their screens during this&nbsp;bit  Moved onto NOW US and FUTURE US again doing this individually  Ran a round of feedback and&nbsp;sharing  <p>After some (timeboxed) discussion, we started talking about how to collate the similarities between what we want/need. We decided upon a Venn diagram, and came up with some labels for the circles which changed multiple times as we discussed and moved virtual sticky notes&nbsp;around!</p><p>The idea wasn’t to get to perfection, but to be in ‘exploration mode’. We moved onto our next activity.</p> Even-over statements <p>It’s easy to define yourself and your organisation in opposition to something else. For example, as a co-op, we often define ourselves as a counterpoint to capitalist, shareholder-driven oligarchies. But that’s not a statement of what you’re in favour&nbsp;of.</p><p>Instead of pitting two things against one another, the even-over approach asks you to prioritise between two good things. So we used an <a href="https://etherpad.org/">etherpad</a>, each chose a colour, and wrote down some ideas. You can see what we originally came up with&nbsp;below:</p><p>We then did the following:</p>  Read through all of the statements  Marked the ones we had questions about with a&nbsp;?  Ran a round of questions to highlight statements we thought were confusing/unclear  Read through all of the statements again  Gave everyone five votes to mark the statements we agreed with most (with a&nbsp;+1)  Discussed all the statements had more than two&nbsp;votes  Decided on the statements to take forward, making them&nbsp;bold  <p>Just as with the Bento box activity, we knew this wasn’t ‘finished’ but rather an exploration. We let it percolate after the co-op day for a&nbsp;while.</p><p>Eventually, after some more discussion a week or so later, we made a page on our wiki: <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/misc/even-overs">Our principles even-over everything else</a>. Again, with it being on our wiki, it’s always subject to revision!</p> Step 2: Badge the Priorities <p>It was in our second time revisiting these statements that we ended up coming up with our priority&nbsp;areas:</p>  Sustainable Work  Open Recognition  Open Working  Climate Action  Worker Ownership  <p>It’s relatively straightforward to badge these, especially if you use an AI tool such as ChatGPT and describe what you want to&nbsp;achieve.</p><p>As a result, we came up with a name, description, and criteria for each priority area. Ideally, each of these would have smaller, more granular badges underneath them, but we can get to those&nbsp;later.</p> 🔁 Sustainable Work&nbsp;Advocate   Description: This badge is awarded to individuals who demonstrate a commitment to promoting sustainable work practices in their organisation or community.  Criteria: To earn this badge, individuals must submit evidence of their efforts to promote sustainable work practices. This could include initiatives such as promoting fair labour practices.   👍 Open Recognition Champion   Description: This badge is awarded to individuals who actively recognise and uplift the skills, knowledge, and competencies of others in a transparent and accessible way.  Criteria: To earn this badge, individuals must submit examples of how they have recognised others’ skills and competencies.

Criteria: To earn this badge, individuals must submit evidence of their commitment to open working. This could include examples of their contributions to open-source projects, or initiatives they have led to promote transparency and collaboration in their workplace.   🌱 Climate Action Enthusiast   Description: This badge is awarded to individuals who actively contribute to climate action initiatives, whether in their workplace, community, or personal&nbsp;life.  Criteria: To earn this badge, individuals must submit evidence of their contributions to climate action. This could include initiatives they have led to reduce carbon emissions, or involvement in campaigns or organisations focused on climate change mitigation.   ✊ Worker Ownership Advocate   Description: This badge is awarded to individuals who support and promote worker ownership and democratic decision-making in the workplace.  Criteria: To earn this badge, individuals must submit evidence of their efforts to promote worker ownership. This could include involvement in worker-owned cooperatives, or initiatives to promote democratic decision-making in their workplace.  <p>Reading through these badges representing our priority areas, it’s evident that there’s a lot of overlap. So instead of leaving it there, and because we want to ‘find the others’ working at the intersection between our priority areas, we decided to go further….</p> Step 3: Find the&nbsp;Overlaps Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/web-like-existence/">Visual&nbsp;Thinkery</a><p>It’s easy to find people who are working on Climate Action. It’s easy to find people who are working on Open Working. But who’s working openly on climate stuff? The same goes for the overlaps between all five of our priority&nbsp;areas.</p><p>With five different priority areas, there are 10 possible unique overlaps:</p>  Sustainable Work / Climate&nbsp;Action  Sustainable Work / Open&nbsp;Working  Sustainable Work / Open Recognition  Sustainable Work / Worker Ownership  Climate Action / Open&nbsp;Working  Climate Action / Open Recognition  Climate Action / Worker Ownership  Open Working / Open Recognition  Open Working / Worker Ownership  Open Recognition / Worker Ownership  <p>We’ve used descriptive names below so that you can see the overlaps. However, in practice we’re likely to use more whimsical names. Why? Because it’s more interesting and fun! Again, AI assistants can be really useful for sparking your imagination around&nbsp;this.</p> 1.

Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>As shown in the image above, the Open Badges standard has additional metadata that we could consider adding. For example, there may be a standard or framework we could align with such as the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a>. Also, it could be that we want to add evidence, or even make the badge&nbsp;expire.</p> Next steps <p>As mentioned in the introduction, we’re still working on this, but in the spirit of working openly wanted to share where we’ve got to so far. Next up will be badge design and then issuing our badges to people and organisations we come across who are working at the intersections and overlaps we want to&nbsp;target.</p><p>We’d love your feedback, especially if you try this approach yourself, so please do let us know in the comments, or on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@weareopencoop">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/weareopencoop">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/we-are-open-coop">LinkedIn</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/finding-the-others-1f43b48ceff1">Finding the Others</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Seamless Integration, Simplified Management: Enabling Rapid and Secure Deployment of Validator Nodes <p>ZUG, Switzerland — 13 June 2023, Energy Web, an independent non-profit that develops open-source software to accelerate the global energy transition, is pleased to announce a strategic partnership with <a href="https://www.zeeve.io/">Zeeve</a>, a leading Web3 infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) platform provider, to integrate the <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/ew-dos-technology-components-2023/trust-layer-energy-web-chain">Energy Web Chain</a> (EWC) with Zeeve’s enterprise-grade infrastructure stack.</p><p>Through this collaboration Zeeve is expanding the benefits of its automation platform to offer Energy Web member companies a managed, secure, and scalable service for running validator nodes on the Energy Web Chain as well as Energy Web’s testnet Volta. Zeeve’s IaaS solution is a significant step forward for companies seeking to develop solutions on and participate in the Energy Web Chain, as it enables companies to deploy validator nodes with a few clicks, or build complex energy solutions using Zeeve’s no-code web3 infrastructure.</p><blockquote>“We are immensely excited to offer this integration with Energy Web Chain, paving the way for businesses to seamlessly leverage the Energy Web Ecosystem.” said co-founder and CEO of Zeeve <a href="mailto:ravi@zeeve.io">Dr Ravi Chamria</a>, “In a sector where specific challenges demand nuanced understanding for impactful technology integration, Energy Web’s singular focus on the energy sector stands as a model. Zeeve takes pride in contributing the full power of its tech stack, offering easy onboarding, access to both the testnet and mainnet, one-click bootstrapping of validator nodes, all within a compliant framework ensuring security and data privacy.”</blockquote><p>The Zeeve IaaS offering presents two distinct options: Managed Service and BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) for both the main EWC and Volta test network. With Managed Service, Zeeve will run EWC nodes in their own dedicated infrastructure on behalf of member organizations, ensuring optimal performance, reliability, and security. Alternatively, BYOC empowers member companies to connect their preferred cloud provider’s API keys within the Zeeve system, enabling them to deploy nodes to their own cloud environment, including AWS, Google, Digital Ocean, and Tencent. Additional features for both options include the ability to perform automatic updates, real-time analytics and monitoring for node health, management of payout addresses and block rewards, and customizable alerts. By eliminating the operational complexities associated with deploying and maintaining validator nodes, companies can more efficiently contribute to the decentralized governance and operation of the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain.</p><blockquote>“The collaboration between Energy Web and Zeeve marks an important milestone in the evolution of validator infrastructure for our enterprise member community,” said Jesse Morris, Chief Executive Officer at Energy Web. “Infrastructure-as-a-service streamlines the process of participating as a validator, allowing companies to focus on their core business while helping maintain the integrity and security of the network.”</blockquote><p>Beyond the direct collaboration, both Energy Web and Zeeve are proud members of the Hyperledger Foundation, a global collaborative effort to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. This shared association within the Hyperledger community positions the partnership to gain enhanced visibility and foster further innovation within the decentralized technology ecosystem.</p><blockquote>“Energy Web is a wonderful example showcasing how web3 can bring transparency, and trust to a complex industry like Energy and bring tangible impact.” said co-founder and CTO of Zeeve <a href="mailto:ghan@zeeve.io">Ghan Vashishtha</a>. “Zeeve further enriches this experience by offering an unified dashboard for detailed monitoring of cloud resources, node performance, and blockchain-level parameters for EWC, with proactive alerts and notifications. By choosing to build with Zeeve, enterprises are bypassing several layers of infrastructure management, accelerating their time to production.”</blockquote><p>For more information about Zeeve’s IaaS platform or to explore partnership opportunities, please visit <a href="https://www.zeeve.io/">https://www.zeeve.io/</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>By<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylegrobinson/"> Kyle Robinson</a>, Senior Strategic Advisor, <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/learning/case-studies/energy-mines-digital-trust-pilot/">B.C. Government – Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>With various enriching sessions held by multiple ToIP members,<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/about/about-oss/"> Open Source Summit North America 2023</a> was a great opportunity for ToIP to engage with the open source community, exchange knowledge, and gain insights around the latest trends and developments in the open source world.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Hosted by the<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/"> Linux Foundation</a>, OSS North America 2023 brought together over 300 speakers and attendees across 15 micro-conferences, including CloudOpen, ContainerCon, and OpenJS World, among others. OSS allows open source developers and community leaders to come together and address the most important technologies, topics, and issues in open source today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the top attended sessions included talks on containers, the evolution of open source through design, and how quantum machine learning. A common theme shared across all events was the value of diversity and inclusion in the open source community, as demonstrated by the Diversity Empowerment Summit and the Emerging OS Forum, which focused on underrepresented groups and emerging technologies, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working in the digital trust space with the B.C. Government has continued to show me how dedicated B.C. is to open source solutions on their path toward innovative and easy-to-access digital services. John Jordan, Executive Director of Digital Identity and Trust, set the tone for B.C.’s presence at OSS with a keynote on how the government’s open innovation approach is allowing B.C. to take public service delivery to the next level. His keynote earned on-stage recognition as ‘the greatest government open source success story in the world’ from Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of the Linux Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other contributions from ToIP included a session by Steering Committee Member Wenjing Chu, Senior Director of Technology of Futurewei Technologies, Inc., highlighting OpenWallet and the strategic role an open digital wallet will play in many aspects of Metaverse services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Highlight sessions from ToIP members include:&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhd9vwQjGjQ">Keynote: Open to Innovation – John Jordan, Executive Director, BC Digital Trust Service</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>John took the stage at OSS to show how the B.C. Government’s open innovation approach is allowing B.C. to fast-track their tech projects and provide user-centric services for the digital economy. In his keynote, he highlights the value of close alignment with the tech industry to enable the provision of accessible and innovative government services. The key: utilizing an open-by-default innovation approach to modernizing teams, policies, procurement, and tools, allowing governments to harness the latest tech to create and deliver user-centric service solutions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Presenter&nbsp;</p>



 
 Wenjing Chu, Senior Director of Technology Strategy, Futurewei Technologies, Inc.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Wenjing is a strong advocate and founding member of the new LFEU OpenWallet Foundation with a mission to drive global adoption of open, interoperable, safe and privacy protecting digital wallet technologies. In this talk, Wenjing gave an overview of the new OpenWallet Foundation and its mission, highlight the strategic role an open digital wallet will play in many aspects of Metaverse services, and explore the opportunities it will help bring for consumers, creators, developers, and businesses in the Metaverse.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4EdHLjo-S4">Panel Discussion: Digital Trust and Sustainable Mining: Securing Global ESG Reporting</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Presenters&nbsp;</p>



 
 Aaron Unger, Director of Product Development, Digital Identity and Trust Program, Ministry of Citizens’ Services, Government of British Columbia&nbsp; 



 Kyle Robinson, Senior Strategic Advisor – Digital Trust Ecosystems, Briartech Consulting Inc.&nbsp; 



 Japjeet Khroud, Senior Sustainability Specialist, Copper Mountain Mining Corporation&nbsp; 
 



<p>I had the pleasure of joining Aaron Unger and Japjeet Khroud on stage to talk about the Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust project (EMDT) and our work in coordinating a digital trust ecosystem in the natural resource sector. Using digital credentials, EMDT enables companies to share environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data with just a few clicks. The conversation explored how EMDT is creating new tools that empower more secure and efficient voluntary sustainability reporting in the mining sector, enabling companies to prove their sustainable practices and better compete in global markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pteDNKEJUkM">Presentation: BC Wallet App – Powered by Hyperledger Bifold</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Presenters&nbsp;</p>



 
 Clecio Varjao, Product Manager, Government of British Columbia&nbsp; 



 Akiff Manji, Software Developer, Petri Dish Development&nbsp; 
 



<p>The<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native"> Hyperledger Aries Bifold</a> is an open source, community-driven mobile wallet for the digital credential ecosystem and serves as the foundation of the BC Wallet. In this session Clecio Varjao and Akiff Manji explored the overview of the architecture and the wallet’s key features. Their presentation showcased how the Province of British Columbia used Aries Bifold as a framework to build BC Wallet, and how others can leverage it to create their own wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhID5fuFpL8">Presentation: Online Identity with Verifiable Credentials and ZKPs Using High School Math</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Presenter&nbsp;</p>



 
 Stephen Curran, Open Source Community Lead and Senior Architect, Government of British Columbia&nbsp; 
 



<p>Privacy-preserving digital credentials built on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can be game changers for digital identity and trust as they enable online trust without tracking. In fact, ZKPs allow entities to prove something is true to another party without conveying any additional information. For instance, a person can prove they are over the age of 19 without revealing the date of birth. In this session, Stephen provided an overview of the AnonCreds project, a high school math level introduction into the magic of ZKPs, and how they enable privacy-preserving online identity solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journey goes on&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, the response we received in sharing the B.C. Government’s work on digital trust alongside contributions from other ToIP members from our home province is a testament to the power of open innovation and the impact it can have on public service delivery. As a resident of British Columbia, I am proud to see our home province recognized on a global stage for their leadership and innovation in open source.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This month we kicked off our collaboration with Education as a Vaccine (<a href="https://www.evanigeria.org/" title="">EVA</a>), a Nigeria-based organisation working on improving the health and development of children and young people in the country. Through our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/" title="">Matchbox Programme</a>, we will provide intensive support to EVA Nigeria for a period of six to eight months.&nbsp;</p>



 Get to know EVA Nigeria: Improving the health and development of children and young people 



<p>EVA is a young-women-led and youth-focused organisation that envisions a Nigeria where children, adolescents and young people reach their full potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EVA believes that adolescents and young people, especially young women and girls, should be provided with the skills, resources and opportunities to lead on matters affecting their lives. To this end, they work in partnership with children, adolescent girls and young people to advance their rights to health and protection from all forms of violence by strengthening capacities, providing direct services and influencing policies for improved quality of life.</p>



<p>EVA’s work focuses on young people’s and women’s rights, addressing their sexual and reproductive health and well-being as well as gender-based violence, other human rights violations, and discrimination they face. The organisation’s work ensures the legal, policy and sociocultural environment enables and supports the enjoyment of their sexual and reproductive health and rights, and their rights to freedom from violence.</p>



<p>Since its founding, EVA Nigeria has successfully contributed to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Reaching over 41 million individuals (offline and online), of which over 3 million are children or young people reached in person. 



 Trained over 4,000 individuals in providing services. 



 Strengthening the capabilities of 10,000 individuals and 98 groups, including those most marginalised and excluded, to participate in and give input into law and policy-making processes that uphold the human rights of children and young people.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Learn more about their work on <a href="https://www.evanigeria.org/" title="">their website</a> and social media channels (they’re on <a href="https://twitter.com/EVA_Nigeria" title="">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/education-as-a-vaccine/" title="">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/eva_nigeria/" title="">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJi5-L-klmJbiMnIYeGpQMg" title="">Youtube</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/evanigeria/" title="">Facebook</a>).</p>



 Working together on effective and responsible data management&nbsp; 



<p>Throughout Matchbox, The Engine Room and EVA Nigeria will work together to assess the organisation’s current practices for data collection, analysis, storing and sharing. This will culminate in strengthening EVA Nigeria’s capacity to work with data in more responsible and effective ways.</p>

<p>Creating global standards for disinformation data is a multifaceted and complicated process and requires the involvement of many stakeholders.</p>



<p>Tech giants or LLM (large language model) companies possess numerous advantages that make them ideal for taking a position of leadership in setting open standards on global data disinformation. These include dominance in data collection and handling, in-depth comprehension of their platform, technological expertise, global reach, and considerable economic influence.</p>



<p>Some might say that LLMs may have potential conflicts of interest, issues with data privacy, or may focus on control.&nbsp; OASIS Open believes that our collaborative solution is the best and only route in which tech companies have an active role while taking into consideration the needs of the rest of the public, small organizations, and individuals.</p>



<p>At OASIS Open, we believe that true open standards that are widely used and universally accepted should include LLM companies to provide a global viewpoint and act as unifying forces among countries.</p>



<p>Moreover, technology companies, such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter, must also be part of the discussion due to their involvement in the spread of disinformation. These companies have access to vast amounts of user data and are best positioned to implement the standards effectively. Academics who study the topics related to disinformation should also be involved to provide a theoretical foundation and well-tested recommendations for setting up the standards.</p>



<p>Additionally, non-profit organizations and NGOs, dedicated to digital rights, freedom of expression, and data privacy should be consulted to advocate for the interests of citizens.</p>



<p>Similarly, media organizations, given their role in sharing information, should be consulted for input on how the standards should be followed when disseminating data. Cybersecurity companies specializing in the technical aspects of data management should also be consulted to help ensure the safety and security of data. Lastly, individuals and consumers, as those who will be affected by disinformation, should be given a voice in these conversations through public consultations and surveys.</p>



<p>We invite all stakeholders to participate in developing global standards for information disinformation. This will guarantee that various perspectives and expertise are accounted for, which is key for producing efficient, fair, and reliable global standards for disinformation data.

<p>This May brought us two of the oldest and largest digital identity conferences: the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity Conference</a> in Berlin and <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a> in Las Vegas. Both were attended by ToIP Executive Director Judith Fleenor and a full contingent of ToIP members. In this post we’ll summarize our key observations and takeaways from each.</p>



 European Identity Conference, May 9-12, Berlin 



<p>EIC is the largest digital identity event of the year in Europe, running for four days every April or May for the last 16 years. Hosted by German-based analyst firm Kuppinger Cole, last year it moved from Munich to Berlin to give it even more room. This year had over 1,000 attendees and several dozen exhibitors.</p>



<p>While EIC has always had a major focus on conventional Identity and Access Management (IAM), Privileged Access Management (PAM), and Enterprise Cybersecurity, it was also the first conference to host a session on SSI and decentralized identity back in 2016. The following years that grew into an dedicated all-day track on SSI curated by Andy Tobin, formerly GM Europe for Evernym and now for Gen.</p>



<p>This year Andy and other ToIP attendees were amazed to see that half the conference was now focused on decentralized identity: digital wallets, credentials, exchange platforms, orchestration engines, and governance solutions. In retrospect this makes sense given the worldwide attention on the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">European Digital Identity Wallets initiative</a> (EUDIW). However even the KuppingerCole analysts were surprised by the level of interest. On Wednesday, the entire mainstage presentation track was devoted to Decentralized and Verifiable Credentials, and on Friday (the last day of the conference and usually the slowest day) the EU Digital Identity Wallet track curated by Andy was standing-room-only.</p>



<p>Equally encouraging was the level of interest in the OpenWallet Foundation (OWF). The conference opened on Tuesday with a half-day OWF deep-dive—seven sessions with over 40 panelists, including Andy, Judith, André Kudra (esatus), Dan Bachenheimer (Accenture), and Drummond Reed (Gen). These sessions covered the OWF mission, code contributions (including two SD-JWT libraries), technology (including OpenID for Verifiable Issuance, OpenID Verifiable Presentation, and ISO 18013-X mDL), and verifiable credential use cases in travel, finance, and government.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Judith facilitated the ToIP panel on<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.kuppingercole.com_sessions_5293_2&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=eIGjsITfXP_y-DLLX0uEHXJvU8nOHrUK8IrwNKOtkVU&amp;r=lkG7i97OmZFU0gIh3HpvAZd0UWN8W2EqVHo8fBfdWqr3likaTHZ12akxKlASQZz8&amp;m=4KH2D5qw2714mmH8RAyew31ySxL7Bg_u9_5cUHb00jJGwH5fhMRZ_Uk1ok0IDV9S&amp;s=tz0ndaLaAQYCR9ywwcuZs17y5EMr5tEgktXhdwJB9UM&amp;e="> Defining the Protocol for Internet-Scale Digital Trust</a> (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKZeXYDIgiI">YouTube video of panel recording</a>) with Andre, Daniel, Drummond, and Christoph Schneider (GLEIF) as panelists. At the start of the session the audience was polled if they were familiar with the topic of a trust spanning layer and the response was near 0%. After the panel explained how and why we were building such a layer and what this layer would do for interoperable digital trust (see the graphic we used below), we polled the audience a second time to ask if they felt a trust spanning protocol was valuable. This time the response was 100% affirmative.</p>







<p>On Thursday Judith delivered a well-received keynote presentation Decentralized Identity – Why is it all the Rage? The video is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhv5-xbcmkw">here</a>. But the ultimate highlight of the conference were the two ToIP members honored with the prestigious European Identity Conference Awards:</p>



 
 <a href="https://monokee.com/en/homepage/">Monokee</a> won the award in “Enterprise IAM” category for their work with Italian manufacturer Gibus, where Monokee implemented a secure, compliant, modern and future-proof single sign-on solution in a business-to-business environment with an estimated 5000 users. KuppingerCole noted that Monokee’s solution integrated a significant number of identity providers and in a highly regulated environment. 



 <a href="https://www.gleif.org/">Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation</a> (GLEIF) took home the award for “Future Technologies &amp; Standards” for their suite of organizational identity services leveraging the new verifiable LEI (vLEI) model of digital identity, offering a standard for organizational identities, a trustworthy governance structure for assigning these, and a secure and reliable way of verifying the end-to-end identity of an organization. 
 



 Identiverse, May 30-June 2, Las Vegas 



<p>Identiverse is to North America what EIC is to Europe—in fact even larger. Last year the conference was sold by Ping Identity to <a href="https://www.cyberriskalliance.com/">CyberRisk Alliance</a>, a business intelligence company serving the high-growth cybersecurity industry. This year CyberRisk Alliance moved the conference to the sprawling Aria Resort hotel in Las Vegas, ensuring plenty of room for over 2500 attendees and 125 exhibitors.</p>



<p>As always, the conference opened with a riveting talk from Ping CEO Andre Durand. This year it began with Andre coming on stage and sitting down as we listened to his pre-recorded voiceover narrative to a powerful three-minute slideshow about how generative AI was now about to impersonate almost anyone almost anywhere. It ended with this warning:</p>







<p>At which point Andre stood up and announced that every single bit of the voiceover narrative and slide show we had just watched—including his voice, the script, the slides, and all the images—had been generated by AI.</p>



<p>In keeping with that theme, the dominant topics at Identiverse were tilted towards the cybersecurity side of digital identity. <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">FIDO passkeys</a> were a particularly strong focus, featuring in at least a dozen of the 175+ sessions.</p>



<p>However decentralized identity and trust was far from absent. A number of sessions and exhibitors covered various facets of digital wallets and verifiable credentials. However, the difference between the North American and European perspectives on decentralized identity and trust infrastructure was palpable. For example, while the Wednesday keynote presentation from Alex Simons of Microsoft included their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-verified-id">Entra Verified ID</a> decentralized identity platform, it was just one of four major topics he covered. And the talk given by Jeremy Grant, coordinator of the Washington D.C.-based <a href="https://www.betteridentity.org/">Better Identity Coalition</a>, was titled, “The Four Horsemen of the SSI Apocalypse” (Jeremy assured several ToIP members that it was “constructive criticism”).</p>



<p>Thankfully, that skeptical view of decentralized identity was contrasted with a Thursday keynote session featuring the OpenWallet Foundation. Led by OWF Executive Director Daniel Goldscheider, that session helped paint a strong picture of the progress of digital wallets and credentials, leaving the impression that the EU is leading the world in digital wallet infrastructure much as the EU GDPR regulations have led the world in privacy.</p>



<p>To the ToIP members attending, this Identiverse was a clarion call that we need to advance our work on all aspects of the ToIP stack as quickly as possible and be prepared to shine a brighter light on it in the next season of digital identity conferences.</p>

<p>Adopting new tech tools is exciting and can benefit an organisation’s work. But there are also many <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/in-the-humanitarian-sectors-search-for-efficiency-are-we-falling-short/" title="">reasons to proceed with caution</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One tool in particular that we’ve seen <a href="https://www.unocha.org/sites/unocha/files/OCHA%20Technology%20Report.pdf" title="">growing uptake of is the chatbot,</a> especially in the humanitarian sector. So far, however, there has been limited research exploring risks, harms and opportunities related to their use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year we kicked off a project examining chatbot use in humanitarian work, with support from the IFRC and UNHCR. We looked into the types of chatbots used by humanitarian and civil society organisations across various contexts in more than 10 countries, including Ukraine, Ecuador, Kazakhstan and Libya. In this post, we share some of the key learnings for humanitarian organisations that emerged from our research –&nbsp;keep an eye out for the full report soon!&nbsp;</p>



 1. Problem first, solution second, tech third 



<p>At The Engine Room, we generally find that new tech tools are best approached in the following order: problem first, solution second, tech third.</p>



<p>In our research, we found that sometimes organisations wanted to use a chatbot for the sake of using a chatbot (i.e. a “solution-first” approach), and not because it was necessarily the best fit for addressing the problem they needed to solve – for example, addressing specific community needs or making up for gaps in staff capacity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This could lead to the chatbot being unsuccessful: In cases we encountered, community needs were sometimes better addressed through other means, such as hiring more staff to conduct site visits or answer queries, while the chatbots saw low usage or poor user feedback, or just didn’t answer the questions that people were actually coming to it with (in one case, for example, a Covid misinformation bot was used by people to try and access food aid).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of solving staff capacity issues, chatbots could sometimes instead create unforeseen double work. In some cases, for example, staff ended up having to manually transfer data from the chatbot into excel spreadsheets, or scan chatbot interactions to answer unaddressed questions.</p>



 2. Centring contextual considerations 



<p>Our research found that contextual considerations tend to play a key role in whether a chatbot helps an organisation achieve its goals or not. For example, a chatbot might not be a viable option in situations where smartphone saturation is low or where people share SIM cards. Likewise, some of our interviewees mentioned that younger community members are more likely to use a chatbot integrated into a platform they use regularly, like Telegram or Whatsapp, whereas older members of the community might prefer in-person interactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other factors to take into account included things like tech literacy, access to devices and the internet, and accessibility.</p>



 3. Checking operational &amp; user expectations&nbsp; 



<p>A key research finding was the need to adjust expectations of what humanitarian practitioners want a chatbot to do, versus what the chatbots they are considering using can actually do. This means adjusting monetary and staffing expectations, as well as critically thinking about <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/chatbots-humanitarian-field-concepts-uses-shortfalls" title="">the type of chatbot</a>&nbsp;(e.g. simple, FAQ or button based bots, mid-range bots, or AI-driven bots) that would be useful, if it is determined that a chatbot could be a useful tool in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to managing operational considerations, our research found that managing user expectations is essential in order to mitigate frustrating user experiences. For humanitarian organisations using chatbots, this means being transparent and upfront to affected communities about what their chatbot can do, and what it can’t.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, our research saw that many people desired a level of personalisation from chatbots that most chatbots currently deployed by humanitarian organisations cannot provide. This can result in a frustrating situation when users are sent on error loops, are repeatedly shown a predetermined script or can only ask questions rather than make comments. This frustration is worsened if it is not made clear that users are interacting with a bot and not a human.&nbsp;</p>



 4. Weaving in responsible data&nbsp; 



<p>Throughout this project we set out to understand what responsible data means when it comes to the use of chatbots in humanitarian contexts. Responsible data considerations that came up in our interviews and desk research touched on ongoing discussions around organisational data policies, GDPR compliance, and data sharing practices and agreements between humanitarian organisations, governments and corporations (among others).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though <a href="https://responsibledata.io/2018/01/24/rd-101-responsible-data-principles/" title="">responsible data is not a prescriptive practice</a>, the following questions could be a starting point for those considering deploying chatbots in humanitarian contexts:&nbsp;</p>



 
 What data is collected and how is it stored (and for how long)? Is this data shared?&nbsp; 



 How is consent achieved? Are there viable alternatives for impacted communities to access services without using the chatbot?&nbsp; 



 What data protection agreements are in place? Are risk assessments being conducted?&nbsp; 



 What platforms are the chatbots hosted on? What are the privacy policies of these companies (e.g., Meta, WhatsApp, Telegram, Viber, etc)?&nbsp; 



 What is the <a href="https://www.privacyinternational.org/report/2509/humanitarian-metadata-problem-doing-no-harm-digital-era" title="">metadata</a> used for improving the function of the chatbot? How is this data minimised and deleted?&nbsp; 



 What <a href="https://www.unicef.org/documents/safer-chatbots-implementation-guide#:~:text=The%20Safer%20Chatbots%20project%20intends,such%20as%20refugees%20and%20migrants" title="">safeguards</a> are in place (e.g.<a href="https://blog.chayn.co/trauma-informed-design-understanding-trauma-and-healing-f289d281495c" title=""> trauma informed design</a>)?&nbsp; 
 



 5. Centring the needs and priorities of affected populations is essential 



<p>A recurring theme in our research was the question of what role automation plays in a humanitarian context, and the need to <a href="https://datasociety.net/library/repairing-innovation/" title="">maintain human interaction</a> even with the adoption of automated tools like chatbots.</p>



<p>Another issue that arose in the research was the lack of participatory, user-centred design practices that are inclusive of language and cultural contextualisation. Oftentimes, the people making tech like chatbots are not from the communities users are from, including language communities (if using machine learning). Further, chatbots can be deployed on populations before being adequately tested (or soliciting feedback) by the people who will need to rely on the tech to receive necessary services or information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Situations where chatbots are linguistically and culturally incompatible or make it difficult to access services (due to tech illiteracy, device access, error loops, etc) can potentially be avoided by considering if a chatbot is the right fit in the first place, given the specific needs and contexts of each situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our analysis surfaced a common tension – from our research, effective chatbots require time and resources to set up, but both of these tend to be in short supply when working in emergencies. This tension could benefit from additional research specifically focused on emergency situations.&nbsp;</p>

 Generative AI: What should governments in Latin America&nbsp;do? <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/elisabeth-sylvan">Elisabeth Sylvan</a> and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/armando-guio-espanol">Armando Guio&nbsp;Español</a></p><p><a href="https://www.caf.com/es/conocimiento/visiones/2023/05/inteligencia-artificial-que-deben-hacer-los-gobiernos-de-america-latina/">Para leer en español, haga clic&nbsp;aquí.</a></p><p>Given ongoing concerns and discussions in Latin America about both labor and digital literacy, fear about how new generative AI tools will impact the region is both understandable and reasonable. Latin America’s <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/research/global-reports/weso/trends2022/lang--en/index.htm">unemployment rate is high</a>, seven percent on average. The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1787/e6e864fb-en">OECD has determined</a> that more than 25% of jobs in Latin America may be at risk of replacement from automation, one of the highest rates in the world. El Tiempo, a popular newspaper in Colombia, recently created a special edition with which people can <a href="https://www.eltiempo.com/tecnosfera/la-inteligencia-artificial-podria-remplazar-algunas-profesiones-749326">self-assess the risk</a> of their employment being replaced&nbsp;soon.</p><p>In October 2023, Latin American governments will reunite in Santiago de Chile to discuss regional measures regarding AI ethics and governance, including the emerging regulatory landscape for the deployment of generative AI systems and tools. This meeting will be organized by UNESCO and the <a href="https://www.caf.com/en/about-caf/who-we-are/">Corporacion Andina de Fomento (CAF)</a>, a Latin-America-based development bank, as a regional initiative to determine the future of AI governance in the region and to foster collaboration among different countries and organizations. The outcomes of this meeting will be highly relevant not just to policymakers charged with generating and enforcing emerging technology governance for countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and the Dominican Republic, but also to all those invested in jurisdictions and regulations that apply to the future of work, education, and regional cooperation in the Global&nbsp;South.</p><p>Any Latin American civic response will need to be proportional to the real risks to the region and not be reactive to hype and fear. Staunch measures, such as banning innovation entirely, will restrict the region’s ability to impact how new AI tools are designed and deployed. On the other hand, inaction may deepen existing problems, weakening competitiveness and wasting precious time in response to fast-moving technological innovations.</p><p>We propose six specific measures that can help governments and decision-makers in Latin America to develop a clear roadmap for navigating this complex environment:</p> 1. Continue with ongoing AI policy implementation while increasing public participation therein <p>All countries have an opportunity to share information about and increase public participation in AI policy implementation, regardless of where they are in their process. Countries that have designed AI national strategies and those that are considering updating their AI national strategies can increase stakeholder involvement. When people are included, they may be more likely to view their governments as responsive. Inclusive practices will have the added benefit of educating the public about both generative AI and policy decisions.</p> 2. Identify and share the benefits of generative AI to the public&nbsp;good <p>In Latin America, the narrative about generative AI has been, on average, negative, typically focusing on how tools will replace humans. Governments can work towards a more balanced dialogue by thoughtfully weighing the benefits against the risks and highlighting benefits to the public in an even-handed and fair manner. Generative AI provides governments with a real opportunity to improve the public services they offer through digital government and digital transformation programs. For example, generative AI tools could help to reduce agency response times and increase information access.</p> 3. Define societal guardrails <p>While the benefits of generative AI are great, so are the risks. Together, we need to define how new tools will be used and how to handle issues such as plagiarism and falsehoods. Countries will need to consider how they will address risks against other fundamental rights. Ethical discussions must be a priority and different models must be piloted to determine how basic principles may be secured. The US’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf">Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a> provides a good reference on how public entities can operationalize the principles that promote the responsible use of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Governments in Latin America should also promote ethical principles in the private sector. Companies and AI entrepreneurs who are developing or using AI tools must engage with governments on ethical design. In parallel, AI tools need to be vetted. Governments can explore how to effectively incentivize companies, such as <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/7/4157">ethical certifications for AI applications</a> and how to develop oversight mechanisms at all stages of design and deployment. Stakeholders, especially consumers and civil society, need to be actively engaged in discussions about ethical concerns and encouraged to demand ethical behavior. Thus, governments need to promote the participation of both the private and public sectors while consumer groups should have an active role in providing actions for consumers to&nbsp;take.</p> 4. Accelerate regulatory experimentation and develop a first draft of AI legislation for the&nbsp;region <p>Before enacting extensive regulations, Latin American countries can test controlled regulatory approaches. Ambitious policy prototyping projects will allow experimentation with innovative regulatory proposals before they are adopted by governments. Regulatory sandboxes and policy prototyping initiatives, for example, will help countries to measure the impact of proposals. Regulatory sandboxes are legal spaces, often temporary, in which companies aren’t subjected to all regulations. These approaches allow all stakeholders to test different models while simultaneously examining how our legal, technical, and social systems will&nbsp;respond.</p><p>A key next step is to develop the first draft of generative AI system regulation that will support sandboxes and other prototyping. Just as Europe published a <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/publications/white-paper-artificial-intelligence-european-approach-excellence-and-trust_en">white paper on AI regulation</a>, so should Latin-American countries begin to formalize their regulatory approaches. Though Latin American countries can examine existing models of legislation from elsewhere in the world, their legislation should suit the needs of the region. Countries in the region may wish, for example, to center human rights issues more than technical ones (as the US’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights has done) and on procedure rather than content. Using existing international and regional principles of human rights, governments can test procedures and actions that would implement those principles in AI&nbsp;systems.</p> 5. Increase AI skills across populations, especially among women and&nbsp;children <p>One growing concern for those considering education and learning ecosystems in Latin America is whether people will have the skills to thrive in a world redefined by generative AI. People have the right to understand generative AI’s influence on their choices, behaviors, and actions and to gain and apply AI-related skills. Government should prioritize educational initiatives not only to support employment but also to support people to think critically about the responsible use of generative AI. The good news is that even though generative AI is new, governments have available existing educational resources. For instance, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/finland-one-percent-ai-artificial-intelligence-courses-learning-training/">Finland’s ‘1 percent’ demonstrates</a> that education can both prepare people for employment and reduce their fears. Colombia’s platform, <a href="https://aprendeia.org/">Aprendeia.Org</a>, created through a <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2022-08/bkc-scholars-helped-guide-colombias-ai-policy-implementation-part-countrys-ai-expert">recent AI expert mission</a>, is a set of free Latin American educational resources that anyone can use. And Youth and Media’s <a href="https://dcrp.berkman.harvard.edu/">evolving collection of AI tools</a> empowers teachers and learners across geographies and communities. All three approaches can be adapted throughout Latin&nbsp;America.</p><p>Though all people have a right to meaningfully engage with generative AI, not all people are positioned well to do so. Significant digital divides persist. <a href="https://www.iadb.org/en/news/latin-america-and-caribbean-need-reduce-gender-gap-digital-transformation">Women in Latin America</a> have less access to technology training and have fewer technology-related jobs than men. Unless governmental efforts address these pipeline concerns, women will not be able to contribute to the ethical implementation of generative AI as much as their male counterparts. Also, educational programs need to be developed for young people, both in and outside of school since their lives will be impacted by generative AI over the long&nbsp;term.</p> 6. Make strategic alliances; collaborate rather than&nbsp;compete <p>Governments in the region do not need to work alone. For example, if countries share the outcomes of their regulation experiments, AI literacy programs, and community engagement approaches, they can learn from one another what will succeed within the region. This collaboration can help countries to avoid repeating one another’s mistakes, saving precious time and resources. And if the region were to build shared data infrastructure for exchanging knowledge, together, Latin America overall would be more globally competitive.

<p>Cybercrime is an enormous problem in today’s world and continues to grow at an exponential rate. In fact, according to Cybersecurity Ventures, the cost of cybercrime is predicted to hit $8 trillion in 2023 and will grow to a whopping $10.5 trillion by 2025.</p>



<p>One of the main enablers for the escalation in cybercrime is the over-reliance on passwords. According to the FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance, passwords are the root cause of more than 80% of data breaches. This is because passwords can easily be phished, intercepted in transit, and uncovered via a variety of attacks. Further, users are often overburdened with remembering passwords across, on average, 90 different online accounts. It’s no surprise then that 51% of people re-use non-complex passwords across multiple accounts. As a result, weak or re-used passwords are effortlessly accessed by criminals. So, rather than execute complex hacks, threat actors simply log in to accounts to execute cybercrimes. The good news is, there is a better way: passwordless authentication, also known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axiad.com/axiad-cloud/phishing-resistant-authentication/">phishing-resistant Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</a>.</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;Jonathan Van der Merwe, group lead product manager at&nbsp;Entersekt, one of the biggest stumbling blocks toward a passwordless future is the technological and behavioral hesitations that come with it. Van der Merwe suggests that moving away from static passwords toward one-time passwords (OTPs), in-app authentication and fast identity online (FIDO) is the way forward. “Moving on to newer technologies like FIDO, which allows for federated authentication ID within the application that you’re using to authenticate yourself, is effectively using the application using your device, whether that’s a laptop, a PC, or a mobile device,” he told PYMNTS.&nbsp;</p>

Ransomware attacks are often performed using stolen passwords,&nbsp;Axios&nbsp;reports.&nbsp;Passkeys are generally considered more secure than passwords because hackers would need both the user’s information and the information from the company. If 1Password’s beta testing is successful, its current business model will fade into obscurity, and modern-day passwords will be a relic of a past, less secure age.</p>

<p>At the 2023 Identiverse conference, the nonprofit standards organization FIDO Alliance unveiled its new user experience guidelines for passkeys, which are generated and stored securely on users’ devices after those individuals register for a web application or service via their biometric data or a PIN. Among the various benefits: Users do not have to remember any credentials, nor are they prone to losing them via phishing scams. Moreover, passkeys can be synched across multiple user devices without having to re-enroll each time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of FinClusive?</p>



<p>FinClusive is a global Compliance-as-a-Service (CaaS) infrastructure provider that enables increased financial engagement by facilitating traditional banking’s connectivity with emerging technology networks, existing and alternative payment rails and financial services providers.</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Identity supports FinClusive’s goal to empower its clients to confidently demonstrate compliance with global banking standards, while expanding their services and engagement to businesses, communities and alternative technologies that have been traditionally underserved or unwelcomed within in the global financial system.</p>
 



  
<a href="https://www.finclusive.com"></a> 


<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>FinClusive does this primarily by providing strong identity assurance tools, coupled with a global, full-stack, financial crimes compliance/anti-money laundering (FCC/AML)—CaaS, which provides a Compliance-Enabled Credentialing Environment (CECE ™) through its Gateway services, which seamlessly embeds digitally verifiable compliance credentials into both the customer onboarding and transacting processes.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada is a trusted member of the G7 and global financial network with its strong banking, insurance and securities sectors. Canada’s strong dedication to information security, privacy and fighting financial crime principles needs to be translated into interoperable international standards and practices to ensure that these principles are supported in technology evolution and future networks. Canada needs to be at the table for online evolution and actively participate for it to succeed.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>DIACC is the center of digital innovation in Canada and we look forward to contributing, networking and progressing the industry.</p>

<p>First public review of proposed errata ends June 15th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OSLC Open Project are pleased to announce that OSLC Change Management Version 3.0 Errata 01 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>This document incorporates proposed errata for the OASIS Standard “OSLC Change Management Version 3.0.” The specific changes are listed in Appendix C of Part 1, at&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/cm/v3.0/errata01/psd01/change-mgt-spec.html#errata">https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/cm/v3.0/errata01/psd01/change-mgt-spec.html#errata</a>.</p>



<p>The Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) specifications collectively define a core set of services and domain vocabularies for lifecycle management including requirement, change and quality management.</p>



<p>This specification defines the OSLC Change Management domain, a RESTful web services interface for the management of product change requests, activities, tasks and relationships between those and related resources such as requirements, test cases, or architectural resources. To support these scenarios, this specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.</p>

  <p>This Dashboard post is a guest contribution from the <a href="https://traent.com/">Traent</a> team. For more<br>
information about these topics, watch the webinar recording from 31 May 2023.</p>
                     <p>At <a href="https://traent.com/">Tr</a><a href="https://traent.com/">aent</a>, we develop hybrid blockchain technologies to bring real-time and data-intensive applications on blockchain while preserving the confidentiality and auditability of data. Traent has developed a Web3 ecosystem for sustainable and transparent enterprises, that offers an end-to-end solution to easily store, process, and share data visually on blockchain.</p>
<p>The research conducted by Traent has focused on overcoming the challenges and limitations that prevented the widespread adoption of blockchain technology by enterprises. Traent’s research efforts have yielded significant innovations, leading to the filing of eight patent applications as of March through May 2022 (currently pending). In this post, we will explore how Traent technology can enable the implementation of a complete Blockchain Product Passport of a vehicle and its battery.</p>
   Hybrid blockchains   <p>Before discussing the Blockchain Product Passports, it’s important to gain a better understanding of the key components of Traent’s ecosystem and the main difference with more traditional approaches:</p>
 
 A Hybrid Blockchain Infrastructure, able to create and manage billions of blockchains. This ensures scalability and enables us to handle billions of interactions securely and efficiently. 
 Traent Era, a collaboration platform on blockchain, suitable for real-time and data-intensive interactions. Our platform facilitates seamless communication and collaboration among users, allowing them to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology in their daily activities. 
 Our Portable Ledgers offer advanced flexibility for segregating confidential data. Thanks to our granular data disclosure feature, users have the freedom to select and share information from their blockchains, without compromising the auditability. After selecting the data, the user is able to share the ledger in different ways, through a dedicated App, or even with instant messaging services like WhatsApp. 
 Traent Viewer, a web app that allows the visualization of selected verifiable data, making blockchain content easily accessible to any audience, from auditors to end consumers. 
 
                     Blockchain Product Passport in the Automotive Industry   <p>The European Union is currently moving forward with the implementation of Digital Product Passports as part of the <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation_en">Sustainable Product Regulation proposal</a>, which was adopted by the European Commission in March 2022.</p>
<p>Under this regulation, companies selling products in the EU market will be obligated to provide a digital product passport for both the product itself and its individual components. This requirement aims to enhance transparency and sustainability throughout products’ lifecycles.</p>
<p>The Blockchain Vehicle Passport changes completely the way information related to ownership, car maintenance, and components is managed and accessed. The Traent Viewer allows users to effortlessly view and interact with the digital passport, providing a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle’s usage and specifications. This enhanced visibility empowers customers with trustworthy information about the vehicle’s history, enabling informed decision-making and promoting the resale value of the vehicle.</p>
                    <p>You can access a live demo of our product passport by scanning the QR code or visiting https://bit.ly/3yAqqPE with your phone.</p>
<p>The Battery Passport showcases a seamless integration between real-time data from IoT devices and interactive applications stored on the portable blockchain. The sensors periodically transmit data related to the battery’s performance and condition, facilitating proactive maintenance planning and giving a new meaning to what we know today as battery end-of-life. Now, the used battery can be securely sold and reused in a different environment, where it can be utilized to its fullest.</p>
<p>To offer a more practical understanding of the entire process, we prepared a video demo that showcases how data is collected from the car, stored on blockchain, and then visualized by the end user in the Vehicle Passport.</p>
<p>In a real-world scenario, data is directly ingested using Era APIs. However, for the purpose of this demo, we are leveraging the Traent Era user interface and its features to better explain some key concepts.</p>
<p>As shown in the audit log, car data is integrated using Traent Streams. This feature allows for real-time continuous ingestion of data, stored on blockchain every 50-100 milliseconds. When considering the battery passport, we have the option to reduce the data rate in order to conserve storage space. However, in situations such as car telemetry, it becomes crucial to maintain higher data rates. Therefore, we empower customers to make informed decisions by providing sensible defaults that suit their specific needs.</p>
<p>Because all data is stored on a portable ledger, a car owner can decide to share with a buyer information about the number of recharging sessions while excluding sensitive data like the location of the charging stations used. During the sale of the car, the product passport can be shared and ownership transferred through a simple app.</p>
<p>Lastly, data from the portable ledger is shown in a tailor-made, interactive application based on the Traent Viewer technology. This provides a gateway to an array of functionalities: from live insights into the battery’s usage history and health to quick access to car functionalities.</p>
           Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.           <p>The most attentive readers will have noticed that during the video data was selected from two blockchains. One blockchain concerns engine data and the other blockchain concerns battery data. This technique enables us to add blockchain to the product passport, allowing us to add data and services to the passport and making the solution scalable and future-proof.</p>
   Traent and MOBI   <p>At the beginning of 2023, we proudly joined MOBI, a prestigious community that shares our core values of sustainability, data verifiability, and privacy. We are honored and excited to work with some of the most renowned and well-respected companies in the automotive sector.</p>
<p>Being a part of MOBI allows us to actively contribute to the establishment of <a href="https://dlt.mobi/standards/">industry standards</a> and the development of a robust <a href="https://dlt.mobi/web3-infrastructure/">Web3 digital infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p>We appreciate the hands-on and pragmatic approach of <a href="https://dlt.mobi/community/">MOBI’s members</a> and hope with this article that we have contributed to making blockchain mobility closer to the user and easier to implement.</p>
   Conclusion   <p>Traent hybrid blockchain solution can offer a wide array of benefits to the automotive industry. We’ve shown how we create a complete battery and vehicle passport using Traent Hybrid Blockchain. Here are some important takeaways:</p>
 
 Deploying our complete blockchain solution is a streamlined process that takes less than a day. Unlike traditional implementations that may take months, our integrated approach ensures a fast turnaround time, saving you valuable resources and accelerating time-to-market. 
 Thanks to our granular data disclosure, you have the flexibility to choose which data to share and which to keep strictly confidential, without compromising the auditability of data. 
 Our apps are as easy as Web 2.0, but they are Web3. By leveraging the power of IoT and blockchain technology, in conjunction with a human-centric approach, our no-code ecosystem facilitates seamless collaboration among individuals, organizations, and connected devices. 
 Thanks to our hybrid architecture, Traent’s ecosystem enables the auditing of disclosed data even to people outside the network. Anyone with a simple web browser can verify the authenticity and integrity of information, overcoming the main limitations of private blockchains like Hyperledger.

<p>DNA can be used for more than just biology and genetics, but also for applications in fields such as information storage, object marking and traceability.</p>
<p>The extraordinary information density of DNA that can be used for storing data is particularly useful given the explosion of digital data.</p>
<p>Starting from a basic understanding of DNA and its components, let’s take a look at how digital files can be encoded in DNA using the correspondences between A, C, T, and G bases. The processes for writing and reading DNA still have some limitations particularly in synthesizing long strands of DNA, but the revolutionary potential is there.</p>
 DNA: Memory resisting the passage of time. 
<p>The oldest DNA in the world is 2 million years old. Found in sediments in Greenland, it revealed hundreds of plant species and mastodons which populated Greenland at a time when it was still covered with forest.</p>
<p>This discovery follows on from the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_P%c3%a4%c3%a4bo">Svante Pääbo</a>, an interpreter of ancient DNA and winner of the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/#:~:text=The%20Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine%202022%20was%20awarded,extinct%20hominins%20and%20human%20evolution.%E2%80%9D">2022 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine</a>, for his research work on evolutionary genetics and particularly sequencing the Neanderthal nuclear genome. DNA is infinitely small, yet extremely revealing and durable, with possible use beyond palaeontology, biology, genetics and human health.</p>
<p>Researchers in synthetic biology exploit the ability to read, edit and write DNA for products such as vaccines and drug delivery devices or genome engineering to generate organisms with specific properties. But applications for cryptography, information storage, object marking, and traceability are fast-moving innovation areas.</p>
 DNA structure. 
<p>DNA is made up of four nucleobases (or bases), A, C, T, G, which are connected as base pairs A-T and G-C. Oligonucleotides are short single or double-stranded DNA sequences that can be synthesized in single or double-stranded molecules. Plasmids are small circular DNA fragments found in bacterial and yeast cells that can be synthesized in the lab.</p>
<p></p>
 DNA alphabets. 
<p>When DNA is read in the cells, it produces proteins for the functioning and reproduction of living beings. Over 3 billion years of evolution, the cellular machinery has developed spellcheckers, word removers and copy-and-paste mechanisms for DNA. Today, synthetic biology allows the same thing to be done and any digital file can be encoded in the form of DNA: &nbsp;text, image, film, PDF, Excel, ZIP …</p>
<p>To convert data from binary format (with 0 and 1) to DNA format (with A, C, T and G bases), the two main options are :</p>




<p>1 bit/base : &nbsp;00 = A , &nbsp;01 = C , &nbsp;10 = T , &nbsp;11 = G</p>
<p>2bits/base : &nbsp;0 = A or C , 1 = T or G</p>




<p>Using the above codes, the word “hello” is converted in the corresponding DNA sequences :</p>
 DNA says “hello”

<p>Writing (or synthetizing) DNA is like telegraphy, where the transmitter made holes in a ribbon to code characters. Writing DNA involves attaching the letters A, C, T, G to each other, through base-to-base addition.</p>
<p>The length of synthesized DNA strands is limited, with oligonucleotide lengths of more than 200 bases (i.e. 200 ACTG bases) representing the current limit of “industrial” production.</p>
<p>Reading technologies are evolving very quickly and allow DNA sequences to be read base by base. One of the most recent techniques uses so called “nanopores”: The oligonucleotides pass through holes. When a base passes through, an electric current is measured. The current is specific to each base, which makes it possible to detect the sequence of the oligonucleotides … and therefore the text. As each fragment has an identifier, the original data can be reassembled in the right order. This technique has the potential to greatly speed up the process of DNA sequencing, making it faster and cheaper than current methods which are still time consuming and expensive.</p>
<p></p>
 DNA for the dataverse. 
<p>Data storage is a massively expanding domain, with an estimated 75 zettabytes (ZB) (75 1021 bytes) of data to be stored in 2023, 95% of which will never be read again.</p>
<p>It is estimated that in 2030 nearly 300 ZB of data will be stored and that in 2040 one thousandth of the earth’s surface will be used for data centres – 10% of the surface of Switzerland! – to store all these data…</p>
<p>It would take more than 100 million years to download such data with a fibre with a speed of 100 megabits per second, and a serious energy bill!</p>
<p>Data centres alone consume almost 150 TWh per year (150 1012 Wh per year), which equals to 2% of the world’s electricity consumption.</p>
<p>Storing data in DNA is a promising solution since it has an extraordinary information density. All the world’s digital data (i.e. hundreds of ZB) would weigh between 50 and 100 grams of DNA, roughly the weight of a Swiss chocolate bar.</p>
<p></p>
 DNA for storage and tracing. 
<p>Resistant under specific conditions, DNA remains a fragile molecule, sensitive to high temperatures, humidity, chemical compounds and ultraviolet radiation. To maintain its integrity, it must be protected from these aggressive agents. One way to do this is to encapsulate it for instance in silica microbeads before use. Thus protected, the DNA can be stored or inserted into objects for later reading.</p>
<p>Objects could therefore carry their own immutable memory. A DNA of Things (DoT) for everything and for ever.</p>
<p>However, for DNA to be used as storage, it not only has to be easily written and read, but also easily searchable or indexable in a molecular filing system. This is still at research level, but it has been proven that silica particles used to encapsulate data encoded DNA sequences can also be barcoded or tagged for standard Boolean search. This would complete the absolute potential of DNA as a data carrier other than for biology, but for information storage and traceability.</p>
<p>As with any promising technological development, the issues of privacy and security must be considered so that DNA encoded information does not get misused by unauthorised parties. This calls for a multidisciplinary approach to creating and using synthetic DNA. Just like paleogenomics ermerged as a new discipline following Pääbo’s research, new fields of research and new applications for gene synthesis are already on the way, powered by the need for cost and energy efficient, forever accessible data storage solutions.</p>

<p>A pesar de que las mujeres negras están al frente de algunos de los movimientos por la justicia social más importantes de nuestro tiempo, liderando iniciativas extraordinarias con compromiso y creatividad, la mayoría de las veces lo hacen con <a href="https://www.fundblackfeminists.org/" title="">financiamientos limitados</a>.</p>



<p>Reconociendo esto, estamos ofreciendo apoyo gratuito en las áreas de tecnología y datos para las organizaciones feministas negras. Sigue leyendo para saber cómo tu organización puede ser una organización aliada.</p>


 
 


 El estado de la financiación de las organizaciones feministas negras: ¿qué tiene que ver con la tecnología? 



<p>Hace unas semanas, Foundation for a Just Society y Wellspring Philanthropic Fund publicaron un informe sobre cómo la <a href="https://blackfeministlac.org/es/" title="">filantropía ha pasado por alto a los movimientos feministas negros en América Latina y el Caribe</a>. Un equipo de investigadoras feministas negras analizó el activismo en 17 países y concluyó que las iniciativas lideradas por mujeres negras en la región tienen un acceso extremadamente limitado al financiamiento y la mayoría depende de sus propios recursos para realizar su trabajo.</p>



<p>Estos resultados confirman <a href="https://www.hrfn.org/resources/the-dire-state-of-funding-for-black-feminist-movements-and-what-donors-can-do-about-it/" title="">investigaciones anteriores</a> del <a href="https://blackfeministfund.org/our-movement-partners/" title="">Black Feminist Fund</a> que mostraban que sólo entre el 0,1% y el 0,35% de las subvenciones de fundaciones concedidas en todo el mundo se destinaban a movimientos de niñas, mujeres y personas trans negras y que sólo el 5% de los financiamientos para derechos humanos se destina a organizaciones dirigidas por niñas, mujeres y personas trans negras.</p>



<p>En un contexto en el que el 81% de las organizaciones feministas negras no disponen de dinero suficiente para alcanzar sus objetivos, y – como vemos en <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-research-community-call-intersectional-approaches-to-data-and-digital-rights-advocacy/" title="">nuestra propia investigación</a> – la falta de acceso a financiación y redes fiables dificulta que las organizaciones de justicia social prioricen el <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/social-justice-digital-rights-during-covid-19-barriers-to-collaboration/" title="">fortalecimiento de su uso de la tecnología y los datos</a>, queremos reafirmar nuestra oferta de apoyo a las organizaciones, colectivos o grupos liderados por mujeres negras que trabajan por la justicia social.</p>



<p>En The Engine Room, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/TER-Strategy-July-2022-update.pdf" title="">nuestra visión</a> es que los movimientos por la justicia social utilicen la tecnología y los datos de forma segura, responsable y estratégica, mitigando activamente las vulnerabilidades creadas por los sistemas digitales. Esto incluye cosas como apoyar a las organizaciones que están repensando su uso de la tecnología y los datos, iniciando proyectos tecnológicos responsables y sostenibles, o mejorando su resiliencia digital, todo lo cual, aunque importante, puede llevar bastante tiempo (¡y recursos!).</p>



<p>Si formas parte de una institución dirigida por mujeres negras y te gustaría contar con nuestro apoyo en el uso de la tecnología y los datos para tu trabajo y organización, ¡nos encantaría colaborar contigo!</p>

<p>Documentar tu trabajo y crear tu archivo digital: “El Internet tiene mucha memoria, pero de alguna manera parece que no puede recordar que las mujeres negras fueron las creadoras de las cosas”. Esta cita de Antoinette Luna Myers en <a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479865109/misogynoir-transformed/">Misogynoir Transformed</a> es un recordatorio de la cantidad de trabajo, logros y conocimientos creados por las mujeres negras que a menudo se ignoran o no se registran (¡incluyendo el trabajo que <a href="https://www.meredithdclark.com/archivingblacktwitter">dio forma al internet que tenemos hoy</a>!). Podemos trabajar con tu organización en el proceso de documentar digitalmente su trabajo y compartirlo con tu público.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Fortalecer redes y conectar activistas de forma segura: En <a href="https://blackfeministlac.org/research/">Resourcing Black Feminist Organizing</a>, las feministas negras indicaron que establecer conexiones internacionales es una prioridad particular para poder construir movimientos autónomos en América Latina y el Caribe. Podemos apoyar a tu organización a encontrar las mejores herramientas digitales para conectarse con otros activistas y organizadores.</p>

 O estado do financiamento para organizações feministas negras: o que a tecnologia tem a ver com isso? 



<p>Algumas semanas atrás, a Foundation for a Just Society e o Wellspring Philanthropic Fund publicaram um relatório sobre como a <a href="https://blackfeministlac.org/pt-br/" title="">filantropia tem negligenciado os movimentos feministas negros</a> na América Latina e no Caribe. Uma equipe de pesquisadoras feministas negras olhou para o ativismo em 17 países e concluiu que as iniciativas lideradas por mulheres negras na região têm acesso extremamente limitado a financiamento e a maioria depende de recursos próprios para viabilizar seu trabalho.</p>



<p>Estes resultados confirmam <a href="https://www.hrfn.org/resources/the-dire-state-of-funding-for-black-feminist-movements-and-what-donors-can-do-about-it/" title="">pesquisas anteriores</a> feitas pelo <a href="https://blackfeministfund.org/our-movement-partners/" title="">Black Feminist Fund</a>, mostrando que apenas 0,1% a 0,35% das doações de fundações feitas a nível global foram destinadas a movimentos de meninas, mulheres e pessoas trans negras e que apenas 5% do financiamento para direitos humanos foi direcionado a organizações lideradas por meninas, mulheres e pessoas trans negras.</p>

Isso inclui coisas como apoiar as organizações parceiras que estejam repensando como elas têm usado tecnologia e dados, interessadas em embarcar em projetos de tecnologia de forma responsável e sustentável, ou dispostas a melhorar sua resiliência digital. E essas coisas, embora importantes, podem levar um pouco de tempo (e recursos!).</p>

Podemos apoiar sua organização no processo de documentar digitalmente seu trabalho e compartilhar com seu público.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Fortalecimento de redes e conexão entre ativistas de maneira segura: Em <a href="https://blackfeministlac.org/research/">Resourcing Black Feminist Organizing</a>, feministas negras indicaram que estabelecer conexões internacionais é uma prioridade específica, para que possam construir movimentos autônomos na América Latina e no Caribe. Podemos ajudar a sua organização a encontrar as melhores ferramentas digitais para se conectar com outras ativistas e organizadores.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Dados responsáveis: Se no seu contexto, faltam dados que seriam cruciais para o seu trabalho e para as pessoas com quem você trabalha, podemos apoiá-la na criação de um plano para a coleta e gestão responsável destes dados! Também podemos trabalhar juntas para estabelecer um processo responsável e simplificado de retenção, arquivamento e exclusão de dados que você usa no seu dia-a-dia.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Cuidados digitais e resiliência: Podemos trabalhar juntas para apoiar a capacidade da sua organização de se proteger de (e responder a) ameaças de segurança digital, garantir o bem-estar de sua equipe e adotar infraestruturas que respondam às suas necessidades e ao seu contexto.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Criação e implementação de projetos: Podemos apoiá-la na concepção de projetos realistas, sustentáveis e impactantes para enfrentar desafios complexos em seu contexto, incorporando dados e tecnologia em seu trabalho.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Fortalecimento da intuição técnica: Podemos trabalhar com sua equipe para fortalecer sua intuição técnica, sua aptidão para navegar pelas nuances do trabalho com tecnologia e ampliar a capacidade de equilibrar as oportunidades e desafios que a tecnologia traz.</p>
 
 



<p></p>



<p>Se você faz parte de uma organização feminista negra (especialmente na América Latina e no Caribe) e tem interesse em trabalhar conosco, <a href="https://calendly.com/the-engine-room/introductions?back=1&amp;month=2023-05" title="">agende uma chamada</a> ou escreva um email para hello[at]theengineroom.org.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/chamada-para-organizacoes-feministas-negras-apoio-gratuito-de-tecnologia-e-dados/" title="Português">Português</a> | <a href="http://theengineroom.org/convocatoria-para-organizaciones-feministas-negras-apoyo-gratuito-en-tecnologia-e-informacion-digital/" title="Español">Español</a></p>



<p>Though Black women are at the forefront of some of the most important social justice movements of our time, leading extraordinary initiatives with commitment and creativity, most of the time they are doing so with <a href="https://www.fundblackfeminists.org/" title="">limited funding</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing this, we are extending a targeted offer of free tech and data support to Black feminist organizers. Read on to learn how you can partner with us!</p>







 The funding realities of Black feminist organizing: what’s tech got to do with it? 



<p>A few weeks ago, Foundation for a Just Society and Wellspring Philanthropic Fund published a report on how <a href="https://blackfeministlac.org/" title="">philanthropy has overlooked Black feminist movements in Latin America and the Caribbean</a>. A team of Black feminist researchers looked into activism in 17 countries and concluded that Black women-led initiatives in the region have extremely limited access to funding and most rely on self-generated resources to enable their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These findings echo <a href="https://www.hrfn.org/resources/the-dire-state-of-funding-for-black-feminist-movements-and-what-donors-can-do-about-it/" title="">previous research</a> done by the <a href="https://blackfeministfund.org/our-movement-partners/" title="">Black Feminist Fund</a>, showing that a mere 0.1% – 0.35% of foundation giving globally went to Black women, girls and trans movements/initiatives and that only 5% of human rights funding went to organizations led by Black women, girls and trans people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a context where 81% of Black feminist organizations <a href="https://www.fundblackfeminists.org/" title="">do not have enough money</a> to meet their goals and – as we see in <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-research-community-call-intersectional-approaches-to-data-and-digital-rights-advocacy/" title="">our own research</a> – a lack of access to funding and trusted networks makes it difficult for social justice organizations to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/social-justice-digital-rights-during-covid-19-barriers-to-collaboration/" title="">prioritize strengthening their use of tech and data</a>, we want to reiterate our offer of support to Black women-led organizations, collectives or groups working towards social justice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At The Engine Room, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/TER-Strategy-July-2022-update.pdf" title="">our vision</a> is for social justice movements to use technology and data in safe, responsible and strategic ways, while actively mitigating the vulnerabilities created by digital systems. This includes things like supporting organizations’ rethinking their use of tech and data, embarking on responsible, sustainable tech-heavy projects, or improving their digital resilience – all of which, though important, can take quite a bit of time (and resources!).</p>



<p>If you’re a part of a Black women-led institution and would like our support with using tech and data for your work and organizing, we would love to collaborate with you!&nbsp;</p>



 How you can partner with us 



<p>At The Engine Room, we partner with groups whose work confronts power imbalances, injustice and rights abuses and support them in using tech and data in ways that meet the needs, politics and principles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are a non-profit organization with a distributed global team of experienced and committed activists, researchers, technologists and community organizers (many of whom are based in or have significant experience working in Latin America). Since 2011, we have worked with more than 700 organizations of all sizes, from different corners of the globe, to strengthen their tech and data strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We offer two types of no-fee support partnership: <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">Light Touch Support</a> (LiTS) and <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/" title="">Intensive Support</a> (Matchbox) and for other in-depth projects, we offer sliding-scale based paid support. We personalize our support to serve the needs of each partner, and our work can include things like:</p>



 
 

 



 
<p>Documenting your work and building your digital archive: “The Internet has a lot of memory, but somehow it can’t seem to remember that Black women were the creators of things.” &nbsp;This quote from Antoinette Luna Myers in <a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479865109/misogynoir-transformed/">Misogynoir Transformed</a> is a reminder of how much of the work, achievements and knowledge created by Black women often go ignored or unregistered (including the work that went into <a href="https://www.meredithdclark.com/archivingblacktwitter">shaping the Internet we have today</a>!). We can support your organization with creating tech/data processes for digitally documenting your work.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Community building and connecting with fellow organizers in safe ways. In <a href="https://blackfeministlac.org/research/">Resourcing Black Feminist Organizing</a>, Black feminists named cross-border organizing as a particular priority, so they can build autonomous movements across Latin America and the Caribbean. We can support you in finding the best tools to connect with fellow activists and organizers.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Responsible Data: If there is data missing in your context that would be crucial to your work and the people you’re working with, we can support you in coming up with a plan for collecting and managing it responsibly! We can also work together to establish a responsible and streamlined process for retaining, archiving and deleting data you use.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Digital care and digital resilience: We can work together to support your organization’s ability to protect yourself from – and respond to – digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of your team, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to your needs and contexts.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Project design and implementation: We can support you in designing realistic, sustainable and impactful projects to address complex challenges in your context, while incorporating data and technology into your work.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Strengthening technical intuition: We can work with your team to strengthen your technical intuition, aptitude for navigating the nuances of working with tech, and ability to balance the opportunities and challenges tech brings.</p>
 
 



<p></p>



<p>If you are part of a Black feminist organization in Latin America and the Caribbean or beyond, and are interested in working with us, <a href="https://calendly.com/the-engine-room/introductions?back=1&amp;month=2023-05" title="">schedule a call</a> or write to us at hello[at]theengineroom.org.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you’re organizing across social justice issues including anti-racism, decolonisation, feminism, reproductive justice, defense of land/territory, climate and/or economic justice (and more!), are using digital technologies to build community and connect with other activists, or are curious about how we could support your work and activism, get in touch!</p>

<p>The term ‘Digital Transformation’ has been echoing in the boardrooms of businesses, big and small, for the past decade. Despite its prevalence, its meaning and implications are often misunderstood or oversimplified. In essence, digital transformation is the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, fundamentally changing how you operate and deliver value to customers. This comprehensive guide aims to demystify what digital transformation entails, its benefits, and how to successfully implement it in your business.</p>



 Understanding Digital Transformation 



<p>Digital transformation is not merely about updating your IT infrastructure or adopting the latest tools; it’s about creating new—or modifying existing—business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements. It is an ongoing process of change, driven by the evolving digital landscape and the need for businesses to remain competitive and relevant.</p>



<p>Digital transformation can encompass a wide range of activities, from automating manual processes, leveraging data analytics for decision-making, embracing cloud computing, to adopting emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT).</p>



 The Benefits of Digital Transformation 



<p>1. Improved Efficiency: Through automation and streamlined processes, businesses can reduce operational costs and increase productivity.</p>



<p>2. Enhanced Customer Experience: By leveraging data analytics and digital tools, businesses can provide personalized experiences, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>



<p>3. Increased Agility: Digital transformation allows businesses to respond quickly to changes in the market or customer behavior.</p>



<p>4. Improved Decision Making: With the help of big data and advanced analytics, businesses can make informed decisions.</p>



<p>5. Innovation and Competitive Advantage: By embracing digital transformation, businesses can innovate their products, services, and processes, gaining a competitive edge.</p>



 Implementing Digital Transformation 



<p>Implementing digital transformation is a complex process that requires a strategic approach. Here are some steps to guide you:</p>



<p>1. Define Your Strategy: The first step is to define your digital transformation strategy. What are your business goals? How can digital technologies help you achieve these goals?</p>



<p>2. Assess Your Current State: Understand your current digital maturity. Evaluate your existing technology, processes, and skills.</p>



<p>3. Identify the Gaps: Based on your strategy and current state, identify the gaps that need to be addressed.</p>



<p>4. Prioritize Initiatives: Prioritize your digital transformation initiatives based on their impact on your business goals and the resources required.</p>



<p>5. Implement the Change: Start implementing the changes. This could involve adopting new technologies, training your staff, changing your business processes, etc.</p>



<p>6. Monitor and Adjust: Digital transformation is an ongoing process. Monitor your progress, measure the results, and adjust your approach as needed.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Digital transformation is a necessary evolution for businesses to stay competitive in the digital era. It is a comprehensive and ongoing process that requires a clear strategy, constant monitoring, and adjustments. Despite the challenges, the benefits it brings—enhanced customer experience, improved efficiency, increased agility, and competitive advantage—make it a worthwhile endeavor. As we demystify <a href="https://lionsgate.io/defense-policy/">digital</a> transformation, it’s clear that <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/">businesses</a> that embrace this change will be better equipped to succeed in the future.</p>

<p>LAS VEGAS, Nev., May 31, 2023 – The <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3574062-1&amp;h=1964299261&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fidoalliance.org%2F&amp;a=FIDO+Alliance">FIDO Alliance</a> today released new user experience (UX) guidelines to help accelerate deployment and adoption of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance UX Guidelines for Passkey Creation and Sign-ins aim to help online service providers design a better, more consistent user experience when signing in with passkeys. The guidelines are available at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/ux-guidelines/">https://fidoalliance.org/ux-guidelines/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on FIDO standards, passkeys are a replacement for passwords that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices. While far easier and more secure than passwords and legacy forms of 2FA, the research performed for these guidelines found that passkey sign-ins present a distinct user journey that service providers need to consider before providing passkey support. The FIDO Alliance UX Guidelines provide evidence-based best practices for key steps in the user journey for passkey creation and sign-in.</p>



<p>“As companies around the world accelerate their move toward passwordless authentication based on FIDO standards, the topic of user experience has risen to the forefront,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “Passkeys uniquely can provide a phishing-resistant sign-in as well as a superior user experience which can drive top-line growth by enabling more seamless access to online services and engendering stronger brand affinity. We encourage online service providers to use these guidelines in their journey to rolling out passkeys to ensure a consistent, thoughtful, and simple user experience for their users.”</p>



<p>Passkeys are supported in the vast majority of consumer devices: Apple and Google have readied their operating systems for service providers to enable sign-ins with passkeys that sync across devices; Windows 10 and 11 have long supported device-bound passkeys in Windows Hello – and passkeys from iOS or Android devices can also be used to sign into sites in Chrome or Edge on Windows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many leading service providers including Google, PayPal, Yahoo! Japan, NTT DOCOMO, CVS Health, Shopify, Hyatt, Instacart, Robinhood, Mercari and Kayak are providing their customers with passkey sign-ins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When it comes to providing passkeys to consumers, technical implementation is only one piece of the puzzle,” said Kevin Goldman, chair of the FIDO Alliance UX Working Group and Chief Experience Officer at Trusona. “Simply put, the UX is a critical component in helping consumers adopt passkeys as a password replacement. These guidelines are a carefully researched set of best practices that will help online service providers design a better, more consistent user experience when signing in with passkeys and ultimately maximize adoption.”</p>



<p>The guidelines were created by the FIDO Alliance UX Working Group in partnership with usability research firm Blink UX – with added underwriting support from 1Password, Google, Trusona and US Bank. This group collectively conducted formal research of FIDO user journeys and actively engaged with FIDO Alliance stakeholders to establish these UX best practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learn more about the FIDO UX Guidelines for Passkeys at Identiverse 2023</p>



<p>Attending Identiverse? Learn more about the guidelines today, May 31, during the session <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv23/session/1361549/">“Optimizing UX for Passkeys”</a> at 2:00 pm PDT.</p>



<p>Attend the Webinar Series</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance is hosting a three-part webinar series to educate on the findings and best practices developed through the intensive research for the UX guidelines for passkeys. Attendees will get actionable tools to accelerate and optimize deployments of passkeys for consumer sign-ins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>About the FIDO UX Working Group</p>



<p>In order to accelerate adoption of FIDO solutions and achieve the FIDO Alliance’s vision of helping reduce the world’s overreliance on passwords, the UX Working Group (UXWG) serves as subject matter experts and internal advisors within the FIDO Alliance on issues related to usability and UX. The FIDO Alliance UXWG is composed of 79 product, design, accessibility, marketing and technical leaders from 31 diverse companies. A full list of members who contributed to this project can be found in the guidelines.</p>



<p>About the FIDO Alliance</p>

  Strengthening tequila supply chain integrity from Mexico to the U.S.
 
 
     

 
             By uniquely identifying individual bottles with GS1 standards, Mexican exporters can better manage their inventory. 
     

 
              By scanning GS1 barcodes on boxes, they can assess whether the order was complete at the time of shipment, taking action early in the process, if needed. 

<p>Trading partners can also obtain information on a full-trailer load compared to lots shipped, along with a summary of the shipped boxes, significantly improving process efficiency.</p>

 Results 

<p>The tequila trade between Mexico and the U.S. can realise significant improvements in traceability as well as efficiency gains.</p>

<p>Processing time has improved by 30 percent and counterfeiting has been minimised.</p>

 Situation 

<p>The focus of this pilot was to ensure that the products were not stolen, altered or exchanged for counterfeit products. It was, therefore, based on monitoring the traceability of tequila shipments, knowing where specific products were located in the supply chain, at a specific point in time. Additional traceability information included knowing that the trailer had not been altered and that products had not been stolen or exchanged.</p>

 Approach 

<p>GS1 identifiers encoded in EPC/RFID tags uniquely identify each tequila product along with data such as the lot number and expiration date. The EzTrack EPCIS platform enables all stakeholders to track the movement of tequila shipments throughout the global supply chain. The Ministry of Economy and the National Chamber of the Tequila Industry chose the following tequila companies to participate in the project: Corporativo Destileria Santa Lucia S.A. de C.V.; the Patron Spirits Company; Proximo Spirits Inc.; Tequila Cuervo; and Pernord Ricard Mexico S.A. de C.V.</p>

 Trusted AI with OriginTrail: Join the fight against misinformation and participate in 1 million TRAC grants launched by Trace&nbsp;Labs <p>OriginTrail’s trusted knowledge foundation was launched in 2018 to improve trust and transparency in global supply chains. Similarly, OriginTrail’s new knowledge-based AI framework now aims to instill trust in AI solutions. Trace Labs — OriginTrail core developers are announcing a 1,000,000 TRAC token grant program for contributors to help advance ChatDKG — the open source framework for trusted AI to help fight misinformation.</p> AI Challenges: Navigating the Pitfalls to Unlock its Potential <p>According to Goldman Sachs Chief Information Officer, Marco Argenti, “the impact of advances in generative artificial intelligence on society could be comparable to the printing press” and with over 91% of top businesses currently investing in AI (NewVantage, 2022), those opportunities might be seized at a very rapid pace. However, with the internet already flooded with misinformation, AI is likely to amplify the&nbsp;problem.</p><p>One of the major challenges with generative AI models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, is the occurrence of hallucinations or errors in AI-generated outputs. These errors could lead to incorrect decisions and actions, which could have severe consequences for individuals and society. Ensuring information provenance in AI systems is also essential, as without it, bias, misinformation, and propaganda may&nbsp;arise.</p><p>Furthermore, it is essential to address the implementation of proper data governance approaches. In fact, some AI solutions have already been banned in the EU due to data governance issues (e.g., Italy’s ban on ChatGPT). This highlights the urgent need for precise data access management and equitable business models based on data ownership to ensure sustainable AI solutions.</p><p>Finally, AI’s value is currently being held back by the difficulty of finding and accessing data and knowledge that is locked in legacy systems and not being used as a contributing corpus of knowledge for AI-based solutions. Addressing these challenges will ensure the safe and effective implementation of AI and its benefits to&nbsp;society.</p> Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) — trusted knowledge foundation <p>OriginTrail leads the development for decentralization of knowledge by enabling its discoverability, verifiability and information provenance. Its core technology, the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), has already proven valuable by facilitating trusted knowledge sharing in international trade for companies like Walmart and Home Depot, ensuring safety of rail travel in Switzerland and increasing transparency of healthcare supply chains for donated medicine.</p><p>The DKG is an open source network that brings together two technologies — blockchains and knowledge graphs. It creates a trusted knowledge foundation which is particularly useful for AI solutions as it makes it easy to search the DKG for the right knowledge, verify its provenance and interact with&nbsp;it.</p> ChatDKG — an open framework for trusted AI based on OriginTrail DKG <p>To accelerate the use of OriginTrail’s DKG with AI solutions, OriginTrail introduces ChatDKG — a framework for efficiently searching, accessing and utilizing trusted knowledge with AI tools. The ChatDKG framework is designed as an open community project exploring its diverse possible applications.</p><p>Supporting this effort, Trace Labs, the core developers of OriginTrail, are making a 1,000,000 TRAC grant pool available for contributors creating components connecting OriginTrail DKG with existing AI&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Join OriginTrail <a href="https://discord.gg/RYVx7t3sdU">Discord channel</a> to keep track of the grant program details as they become available over the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by organizing trusted AI — grade knowledge assets. It leverages the open source Decentralized Knowledge Graph that connects the physical world (art, healthcare, fashion, education, supply chains,&nbsp;…) and the digital world (blockchain, smart contracts, Metaverse &amp; NFTs,&nbsp;…) in a single connected reality driving transparency and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Advanced knowledge graph technology currently powers trillion-dollar companies like Google and Facebook. By reshaping it for Web3, the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph provides a crucial fabric to link, verify, and value data on both physical and digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p><p>👇 More about Trace&nbsp;Labs👇</p><p>Trace Labs is the core developer of <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> — the open source Decentralized Knowledge Graph.

<p>We recently wrapped up our two <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/meet-our-new-matchbox-partners/" title="">Matchbox partnerships</a> for 2022, with Uganda-based Albinism Umbrella and Namibia-based Y-Fem.</p>



<p>Here are some reflections on what we worked on and learned together.&nbsp;</p>



 Working on Responsible Data with Albinism Umbrella 



 Responsible Data to protect the rights of persons with albinism&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://albinismumbrella.org/" title="">Albinism Umbrella</a>, based in Uganda, works to reduce the vulnerability of persons with albinism, and to promote and protect their interests and rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within Matchbox, Albinism Umbrella had three main priorities:</p>



 
 Developing a Responsible Data Policy for the organisation, to ensure that they are able to take a holistic approach to strengthening their data management practices. The policy is a practical way to ensure that Albinism Umbrella treats the data they hold with care, through guiding the management of both sensitive and non-sensitive data within the organisation.&nbsp; 



 Ensuring that the data about the communities they work with, collected during their projects, is protected. This was particularly important for them as persons with albinism are at increased risk of violence, making personally identifiable information particularly sensitive.&nbsp; 



 Engaging their partner organisations (working on similar issues) in conversations about the relevance of responsible data for their work. This stemmed from the recognition that greater protection for the data of marginalised groups would come from collaborative approaches.&nbsp; 
 



<blockquote>
<p>“Addressing the risks around data collection, storage and management is critical to our mission because the population we serve is very high risk.”&nbsp;</p>
– Olive Namutebi, Executive Director at Albinism Umbrella</blockquote>



  
<p></p>



 Committing to collective conversations 



<p></p>
  



<blockquote>
<p>“We were so eager to share the importance of securing data and using it in equitable ways that we planned a community call with The Engine Room and invited our partners and other organisations so they could start transforming their practices as well.”</p>
– Olive Namutebi, Executive Director at Albinism Umbrella</blockquote>



<p>Throughout our partnership, Albinism Umbrella stressed the importance of encouraging similar efforts among their peers. We held a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/takeaways-from-our-community-call-on-responsible-data-for-social-justice-organisations/" title="">community call</a> on responsible data for social justice organisations in June, and developed an introductory guide to responsible data for Albinism Umbrella to use to support their partners in embarking on their own responsible data journeys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This partnership was an important reminder that responsible data is something that the social justice sector as a whole needs to be thinking about.In walking this journey with their peers and partners, Albinism Umbrella pushed for the collective transformation it takes to better protect marginalised communities from potential harm.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We have learned a great deal from the people at The Engine Room and have appreciated how participatory their approach is.”&nbsp;</p>
–Janepher Nanyondo, Program Officer at Albinism Umbrella</blockquote>



<p></p>

 Developing a safer internal tech and data ecosystem with Y-Fem 



<p>The Young Feminists Movement (Y-Fem) Namibia is a feminist human rights organisation dedicated to advancing women’s human rights by promoting women’s access to health, education and justice. Y-Fem promotes young women’s representation, decision-making, visibility, creativity and transformative leadership.</p>



<p>Y-Fem was wary of surveillance and wanted to make sure that they have the knowledge to establish a more stable and safer tech and data environment for their team and for the feminist movement in Namibia. Together, we decided to work on strengthening their tech and data ecosystem, in order to make it more secure and resilient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the partnership we focused on three main areas:</p>



 
 Ensuring that Y-Fem is able to maintain their institutional memory through protecting their data and preventing data loss. This was particularly important for them, as they had dealt with the loss of devices before. 



 Establishing secure systems to manage organisational passwords and platforms, as Y-Fem works with a distributed team and rotational voluntary staff. This allowed them to strengthen the security of their digital environment.&nbsp; 



 Strengthening the knowledge of the Y-Fem team when it comes to responsible data management, and ensuring they can safely store sensitive data. 
 



<p>Together, we assessed risk, anticipated future challenges and equipped the Y-Fem team to respond in ways that will enable greater protection.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Y-Fem is so honoured for this technical partnership with The Engine Room. It has truly strengthened the work of Y-Fem in so many ways.”&nbsp;</p>
-Florence /Khaxas, Executive Director, Y-Fem Namibia</blockquote>

 Surveillance capitalism is a term that is increasingly becoming relevant in today’s digital age. Coined by Harvard Professor Shoshana Zuboff in her 2019 book, “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,” the term refers to the commodification of personal data by tech companies. Essentially, it’s a business model where companies collect, analyze, and sell user data to advertisers for profit.

<p>Surveillance capitalism is a term that is increasingly becoming relevant in today’s digital age. Coined by Harvard Professor Shoshana Zuboff in her 2019 book, “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,” the term refers to the commodification of personal data by tech companies. Essentially, it’s a business model where companies collect, analyze, and sell user data to advertisers for profit.</p>



 The Genesis of Surveillance Capitalism 



<p>The rise of the internet in the late 20th century brought about a new age of technology and connectivity. As we welcomed the digital age, tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, began offering their platforms for free. Users happily engaged with these services, seemingly receiving something for nothing. However, this exchange was far from one-sided.</p>



<p>These companies developed a business model where the product was not the platform itself, but the data it collected. Every click, every like, every share became an integral part of a massive data-gathering mechanism. This data is then analyzed, packaged, and sold to advertisers who use it to target consumers with an accuracy that traditional advertising methods could never achieve.</p>



 The Implications and Concerns 



<p>Surveillance capitalism raises various ethical and privacy concerns. Central to these is the lack of transparency and user consent. Most users are unaware of the extent of the data collected and how it’s used. The user agreements are often complex and difficult to understand, leading to uninformed consent.</p>



<p>Moreover, users have limited control over their data. Once collected, it can be sold, shared, or leaked without their knowledge. This poses significant security risks and potential misuse of personal information.</p>



<p>Surveillance capitalism also fosters a power imbalance. The companies with the most data become the most powerful, creating monopolies and limiting competition. They can shape user experiences and behaviors through personalized content, reinforcing existing beliefs and preferences, and potentially manipulating user behavior.</p>



 The Future of Surveillance Capitalism 



<p>As the digital landscape evolves, so does surveillance capitalism. With the growth of the Internet of Things (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city">IoT</a>), data collection extends beyond smartphones and laptops to smart speakers, wearable tech, and other connected devices. This means even more personal data is being captured, from our voices to our heart rates.</p>



<p>Addressing the challenges posed by surveillance capitalism requires a multi-faceted approach. Legal and regulatory measures, like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, are one step in ensuring greater transparency and user control over data. More such regulations need to be instituted globally.</p>



<p>Technological solutions, such as privacy-enhancing technologies, can also play a role. These include end-to-end encryption, anonymization tools, and decentralized data architectures that limit data control by a single entity.</p>



<p>Finally, there needs to be a societal shift in understanding the value of privacy. Users need to be aware of their digital footprint and the implications of sharing personal data online.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Surveillance capitalism is an inherent aspect of our digital lives. While it has facilitated personalized experiences and connectivity, it has also paved the way for unprecedented levels of data commodification. As we navigate this digital age, striking a balance between the benefits of personalization and the preservation of privacy is crucial. To do so, we must foster an ecosystem of regulatory compliance, technological innovation, and informed digital citizenship.</p>

<p>By Francis Beland, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>Open standards are the building blocks of open innovation by providing a common foundation for innovation and collaboration. Open standards ensure interoperability and compatibility between different systems, enabling the development of new products and services to be integrated into existing infrastructure and ecosystems. This can help to drive innovation by making it easier for new solutions to be developed and adopted and by enabling the creation of new markets and opportunities.</p>



<p>Open standards can also help to reduce the barriers to entry for new and innovative companies, making it easier for them to enter and participate in existing markets. By providing a level playing field for innovation and competition, open standards can help to foster a more diverse and competitive marketplace, enabling the development of new and innovative solutions that meet the needs of different stakeholders.</p>



      



<p>In addition, open standards can help encourage collaboration between different companies, organizations, and communities. Multiple organizations’ collective knowledge, expertise, and resources to solve complex problems and drive innovation.</p>



<p>Overall, open standards are the foundation of disruptive open innovation programs by enabling interoperability, reducing barriers to entry, fostering collaboration, and encouraging the development of new and innovative solutions.</p>

 Five miners onboard from&nbsp;launch <p>Zug, Switzerland, 24 May 2023 — Energy Web, an independent non-profit that develops open-source software for clean energy solutions, today announced the launch of<a href="http://www.gp4btc.org"> Green Proofs for Bitcoin</a> (GP4BTC), a<br>first-of-its kind initiative to establish an independent, standardized energy measurement system for the Bitcoin mining industry.</p><p>GP4BTC will provide transparency into the decarbonization efforts of Bitcoin miners and hosting companies, supporting the industry on its journey to net-zero. As part of the solution, certifications will be issued to Bitcoin miners based on their clean energy use and contributions to grid stability via demand response. By delivering verifiable metrics that are consistent across companies and geographies, GP4BTC will provide recognition and reputational benefit for companies mining sustainably, as well as improved access to institutional finance and other returns on their investments into sustainability practices.</p><blockquote>Speaking on the launch of the certification initiative, Amy Westervelt, Senior Delivery Lead and head of the GP4BTC initiative at Energy Web, said “Today Bitcoin is scrutinized for its electricity consumption and associated climate impact. While leading miners are pursuing strategies to reduce their carbon footprints, the industry lacks a unifying definition of sustainable mining, as well as a shared framework for assessing and verifying miners’ sustainability practices. Green Proofs for Bitcoin seeks to provide&nbsp;this.”</blockquote><p>Launched with five certified miners, the GP4BTC certification platform and registry assesses miners via a Clean Energy Score and a Grid Impact Score, each of which are calculated based on operational information<br>including location and energy consumption data. Together, these scores reflect miners’ procurement of renewable electricity, siting operations in regions with low grid carbon intensity, and their contributions to grid stability through demand flexibility. Developed in partnership with over 35 miners, NGOs, grid operators, and other energy and crypto market<br>participants, this approach to scoring is aligned with best practices for sustainability leadership in other industries, and to approaches to corporate ESG reporting in the financial sector and&nbsp;beyond.</p><blockquote>“Until now, efforts to standardize clean energy procurement practices and drive collective action across the Bitcoin mining sector have been siloed and inconsistent,” added Westervelt. “While other electricity-intensive<br>industries have benefited from custom decarbonization roadmaps, Bitcoin has largely been ignored, creating a negative feedback loop where climate-conscious miners are left to forge their own paths. Our goal is to create a virtuous cycle where clean mining is easier to define, pursue, and monetize — so that it eventually becomes the status&nbsp;quo.”</blockquote><p>For miners, GP4BTC offers a solution for miners to provide evidence of clean energy practices. Using Energy Web’s privacy-first Green Proofs technology, miners retain full ownership and control of their data. For<br>Bitcoin users and institutions, GP4BTC provides a one-stop-shop for discovering and validating miners’ sustainability credentials so they can make data-driven decisions regarding commercial strategy and policy.<br>At launch, certified miners and data centers include Argo Blockchain, Cowa, DMG Blockchain Solutions, Hive Blockchain Technologies, and Gryphon Digital&nbsp;Mining.</p><blockquote>DMG’s CEO, Sheldon Bennett, commented,“We are pleased to be included among the initial Green Proofs for Bitcoin miner participants. We believe Energy Web’s launch of Green Proofs for Bitcoin represents a real<br>first step towards recognizing a broad swath of industry participants for powering their data center equipment utilizing primarily carbon neutral energy sources.”</blockquote><blockquote>“This initiative will settle the basis for long term sustainability within the Bitcoin mining industry. We are proud to contribute to the growth of the ecosystem and to have the ability to certify our commitment towards sustainability,” said Fiorenzo Manganiello, co-founder of&nbsp;Cowa.</blockquote><blockquote>“Decarbonization represents one of the main priorities for the sector, and by providing standardized and verifiable metrics, as well as acknowledging best practices with certifications, initiatives such as Energy<br>Web’s Green Proofs for Bitcoin serve a fundamental role in driving industry standards. At Argo, sustainable mining has been at the core of our business model and growth strategy ever since our foundation. We are<br>proud of our GP4BTC certification, and we look forward to contributing to the impact and success of this exciting initiative.” said Seif El-Bakly, Interim CEO at Argo Blockchain.</blockquote><blockquote>President and CEO of Hive Blockchain Technologies Aydin Kilic commented, “In our commitment to be green energy focused — which has been our mandate since HIVE went public back in 2017 as the first<br>publicly traded crypto miner — we are glad to see the industry embracing this strategy, and advocates like Energy Web helping to validate and certify the renewable aspects of crypto miners. This makes our industry<br>stronger. We hope that the public, along with policy makers and utility companies, realize that a large contingent of crypto miners are utilizing renewable energy.”</blockquote><blockquote>Gryphon Digital Mining’s CEO, Rob Chang, urges the Bitcoin mining industry to start providing concrete evidence of sustainable mining practices. “We need to move past pandering press releases and start offering tangible, coordinated, third-party certifications that confirm clean energy use,” Chang emphasized. “We believe in GP4BTC’s mission and proudly announce that Gryphon is one of the first recipients of its<br>certification. As Bitcoin mining continues to grow, it is critical to prioritize sustainable practices and hold the industry accountable for its impact on the environment.”</blockquote><p>Energy Web is keen to work with any Bitcoin miner or other party interested in using Green Proofs for Bitcoin. Miners and data centers can learn more about the solution and apply for certification directly at <a href="http://gp4btc.org">www.GP4BTC.org</a> or by contacting gp4btc@energyweb.org.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

 Exploring the Future of Work and&nbsp;Learning Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Imagine a world where everyone has an equitable opportunity to showcase their skills and be recognised for them, regardless of whether or not they have a formal degree. A world where gatekeepers no longer control the keys, where learning and skills development are a natural part of life, and where recognition of these skills is open and transparent. This is the realm of <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>, a realm we would describe as a ‘practical utopia’.</p><p>In this utopia, universities and other institutions still play a role, but they are no longer the sole arbiters of who is ‘skilled’ and who is not. They are nodes in a broad ecosystem of learning and recognition that includes employers, co-ops, communities, and self-directed learners. The power of recognition has been democratically distributed, with every individual having an active stake in&nbsp;it.</p><p>Learning, in this world, has been ‘rewilded’. It happens everywhere, all the time, fuelled by curiosity and the desire to improve rather than the mechanical necessity of earning a degree. Workplaces are transformed into vibrant learning hubs, with employees being recognised for the skills they develop on the job. Communities are engaged in recognising the skills and contributions of their members, fostering a culture of mutual support and lifelong learning.</p> The Limits of Microcredentialing <p>There’s been a <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2023/5/educause-and-wcet-quickpoll-results-current-trends-in-microcredential-design-and-delivery">huge growth in interest</a> around microcredentialing in the last few years as an approach offering distinct, focused qualifications. It’s great for ‘brands’. It’s certainly useful to start reimagining what’s possible, especially when coupled with national <a href="https://credentialasyougo.org/">incremental credentialing initiatives</a>. However, the trend aligns with the neoliberal view of education as another ‘marketplace’. Students, due to high fees and a need for job security, increasingly resemble customers. Those who can’t pay are crowded&nbsp;out.</p><p>Microcredentials are usually based upon a standard known as <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a>. The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf">original dream</a> for this standard was to solve the problem that lifelong learning happens everywhere, and but isn’t always recognised. Microcredentials tend to solve a subset of this, on students getting a ‘return on investment’ for their tuition fees by securing decent employment upon graduation. Inevitably, this has led universities to form partnerships with employers and incorporate microcredentials into their educational offerings.</p><p>Helping people into employment is an important thing to do. Microcredentials are indeed integral elements of the emerging new learning ecosystem, providing a flexible means for individuals to demonstrate their competencies. But they are not the only pieces in play. In our practical utopia, recognition is diverse and multifaceted, taking various forms from community awards, peer recognition, to self-assessment and reflection.</p><p>What happens if, instead of dividing the boxes of credentials into ever-smaller boxes of microcredentials, we… get rid of most of the boxes altogether?</p>Image CC BY&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> Open Recognition is a Better&nbsp;Lens <p>Open Recognition offers an alternative that could potentially disrupt the educational status quo. It’s an approach that facilitates recognition of lifelong learning and development, extending opportunities beyond the confines of traditional education.</p><p>“Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.” (<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">definition</a>)</p><p>In recent years, our understanding of diversity has expanded significantly. We recognise and celebrate differences in ethnicity, neurodiversity, gender, as well as abilities and experiences. This broadened conception of diversity has enriched our communities and workplaces, leading to greater inclusivity and understanding. It’s high time we applied this expansive view of diversity to the recognition of learning and&nbsp;work.</p><p>We need to acknowledge the myriad ways in which people learn and the diverse skills they bring to their work. A person’s value should not be measured solely by their degrees or formal qualifications, but also by their unique abilities, experiences, and contributions. Open Recognition invites us to embrace this diversity, allowing everyone’s learning journey to be seen, appreciated, and valued. This is a key step towards a more equitable and inclusive society, where everyone has the opportunity to&nbsp;thrive.</p><p>When we apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrad_of_media_effects">McLuhan’s tetrads</a> to Open Recognition, we gain insightful perspectives into its potential societal and educational impacts. This approach looks at what is enhanced, retrieved, obsolesced, and reversed due to an innovation.</p>  Enhances: Open Recognition enhances the visibility and accessibility of skills and achievements. It amplifies the ability of individuals to showcase their talents and competences in a way that’s verifiable and portable across different platforms and communities.  Retrieves: Open Recognition retrieves the concept of peer-to-peer validation and communal acknowledgement of skills and achievements, similar to how guilds or apprenticeships operated in the past. It also revives the importance of informal and experiential learning, as these forms of learning can now be recognised and valued alongside formal education.  Obsolesces: Open Recognition could potentially render obsolete traditional, centralised systems of recognition and accreditation. For example, it might diminish the importance of formal degrees or certificates issued by educational institutions, as people can now receive recognition from various sources and in various&nbsp;forms.  Reverses: If pushed to its limits, Open Recognition might flip into a situation where traditional forms of accreditation are disregarded or devalued. If the recognition landscape becomes fragmented or chaotic, the value and reliability of recognition could be diluted. It might become more challenging to discern the validity and worth of various forms of recognition, and this would likely make it difficult to ensure that people have the necessary skills for particular job&nbsp;roles.  <p>The transition to Open Recognition carries profound implications for individuals and society. It eliminates barriers to entry for many jobs, fostering a more diverse and inclusive workforce. It encourages individuals to follow their passions and interests, rather than being herded into a narrow set of ‘approved’ careers. It acknowledges that learning is a lifelong endeavour, recognising that everyone has valuable skills and knowledge to contribute. While there are certainly some challenges that come with such a recognition utopia, the ultimate goal is a world in which people contribute to society in ways that are both meaningful and&nbsp;healthy.</p><p>It’s important to note that we are not against microcredentials. WAO hasn’t created the Keep Badges Weird community and evolved it into <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-recognition-is-for-everybody-time-for-a-bigger-tent-41dbdb4babbe?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------">Open Recognition is for Everybody</a> merely so that we can critique institutions. Our members are products of these institutions, with multiple degrees to prove it. We’ve worked with many institutions since our founding seven years ago, and we see value in alternative credentialing.</p><p>Instead, we are advocating for a society where institutions form just one part of a broader, more diverse ecosystem. We support the idea that young people should be able to access the workforce and secure decent jobs without being entirely dependent on traditional educational institutions. Not everybody has the same access to the institutions that shape our society, which is why society isn’t shaped in a way that benefits all of us. We need to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/practical-utopias-and-rewilding-work-27c148d95b16?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">rewild work</a> and learning to give more people the ability to participate in&nbsp;society.</p>Image CC BY&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> Conclusion <p>Open Recognition requires a substantial shift in mindset, a transition from viewing education as a commodity to be consumed, to understanding it as a process to be engaged with. It demands us to challenge the status quo, to question the authority of gatekeepers, and to establish new, open systems of recognition.</p><p>The rewards of this transition, however, are immense. A world where everyone’s skills and knowledge are recognised and valued is a world of greater equality, opportunity, and fulfilment. It’s a world where work and learning are inextricably intertwined, a world where we are all simultaneously teachers and learners, and a world where the journey of discovery is unending. This is the world we envisage with Open Recognition, and it’s a world worth striving&nbsp;for.</p><p>Why not join a community discussing these ideas?

 How Bitcoin Mining Can Apply Lessons From Other Industries to Promote Clean Energy and Align with a Net-Zero&nbsp;Future <p>In the early 2000’s a new digital system emerged that promised to revolutionize the way people interacted online. Though it started small, over the subsequent decade it was adopted by millions of people in nearly every country on Earth. As its popularity soared, so too did its value. But there was a hidden cost lurking beneath the surface: to enable its growth, it had to consume ever greater amounts of electricity. Between 2011 and 2021, its annual electricity consumption increased by 3500%. Today it consumes <a href="https://sustainability.fb.com/2021-sustainability-report/">over 9,400 GWh</a> each year — roughly the same amount as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption">small country like Costa&nbsp;Rica</a>.</p><p>Of course, this is the story of Facebook. But it’s also largely the story of Google (<a href="https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/google-2022-environmental-report.pdf">18,287 GWh</a> in 2021, on par with Iceland), and Amazon (<a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2021-sustainability-report.pdf">30,880 GWh in 2021</a>, on par with Serbia), and yes, Bitcoin. Fundamentally, all four do the same thing: convert electricity into bits of information. Indeed, whether it’s posts, search results, cloud services, or cryptocurrency, this is the core business model for the technology sector as a whole. Yet when it comes to energy use, Bitcoin attracts disproportionate scrutiny.</p><p>In recent months especially, the discourse surrounding Bitcoin’s energy consumption has reached a fever pitch, and mining has been singled out with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/05/02/cost-of-cryptomining-dame-tax/">punitive taxes</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html?searchResultPosition=1">hand-wringing analysis</a>, and even <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/07/new-york-cryptocurrency-mining-ban-00072564">outright regulatory bans</a>.</p><p>Why is there so much focus on the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining relative to that of mainstream technology firms?</p><p>The answer boils down to two factors: a philosophical argument over the social value of crypto, and a practical lack of transparency into the energy management practices of the mining sector. Too often the focus is on the former, but addressing the latter in a credible way is the key to overcoming the current hysteria.</p><p>Unfortunately the rancorous debate over the energy and climate impacts of Bitcoin is full of hyperbole and finger-pointing.</p><p>On the one hand are those who believe Bitcoin (and crypto more generally) has no social value, and therefore any and all electricity consumption is “bad” (even <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/podcasts/catalyst-with-shayle-kann/the-great-bitcoin-energy-debate">well-researched, nuanced analysis</a> seemingly reflects this implicit assumption). A less extreme but common view is that because some Bitcoin mining operations demonstrably consume fossil-derived electricity, Bitcoin mining as a whole is an illegitimate end-use; even some degree of consumption of clean energy is not enough to justify its existence.</p><p>On the other side are Bitcoin proponents, many of whom make <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/this-earth-day-analysts-say-bitcoin-mining-is-naturally-gravitating-to-green-energy">exaggerated or overly-simplistic claims about Bitcoin’s role as a clean energy solution</a>, or deflect legitimate questions by highlighting the energy intensity of other industries and the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-uses-56-times-less-energy-than-classical-system/">traditional financial system</a>.</p><p>Extending one’s worldview of crypto to either excoriate or glorify Bitcoin’s energy consumption is not productive. When it comes to real-world impact, attempts to shame or regulate Bitcoin out of existence are just as ineffective as defensive posturing and whataboutism. The reality is that Bitcoin <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci">does in fact consume a significant amount of electricity</a>, and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eager-to-work-bitcoin-switch-to-proof-of-stake-remains-unlikely">likely will for the foreseeable future</a>. Like any energy-intensive industry it has the potential to hinder or advance the clean energy transition, depending on where, when, and how it is&nbsp;mined.</p><p>Asking whether the carbon footprint of Bitcoin — or other industries — is justified is the wrong question. A better way forward is to ask how Bitcoin can follow the trajectory of other established industries to become an active partner in the energy transition. In other words: What are the concrete actions that Bitcoin miners can take to promote clean energy and decarbonization?</p><p>Over the last twenty years, <a href="https://rmi.org/the-power-of-agreement/">voluntary purchasing of clean energy by large corporate buyers was a catalyst that drove deployment and economies of scale for renewable electricity</a>. Lessons learned and best practices are now socialized through <a href="https://cebuyers.org/">established industry groups</a> that provide decarbonization playbooks, procurement tools, and sustainability reporting mechanisms; as a result, it’s easy for companies to demonstrate climate leadership even if they consume significant amounts of electricity.</p><p>Unfortunately, no such thing exists for the Bitcoin community. Because Bitcoin lacks a shared framework to measure and recognize sustainability commitments and practices by miners, mining companies are left to fend for themselves and the industry cannot respond to criticisms about its climate impacts in a meaningful, data-driven way. What’s needed is an initiative to standardize clean energy procurement practices and drive collective action across the Bitcoin mining sector. That’s why we started Green Proofs for Bitcoin (GP4BTC).</p><p>GP4BTC is a solution to bring consistent metrics and much-needed transparency into the climate impacts of Bitcoin mining so industry stakeholders can make better decisions to align with a net-zero future. The GP4BTC certification spotlights climate-conscious miners who contribute to grid decarbonization through purchasing renewable energy, strategically locating mining operations in low-carbon grids, and participating in demand flexibility programs. Developed in partnership with over 35 miners, NGOs, governments, grid operators, and other energy and crypto market participants, GP4BTC criteria align (and will evolve) with best practices for sustainability leadership in other industries.</p><p>By showcasing miners operating sustainably, we aim to create a virtuous cycle where clean mining is easier to define, pursue, and monetize. Ultimately, our goal is to make sustainable Bitcoin mining ubiquitous and to make the Bitcoin industry an active supporter of the clean energy transition.</p><p>The notion that continued growth and adoption of Bitcoin automatically spells climate disaster is popular but false. Climate-conscious miners with sophisticated energy management strategies exist. Decarbonizing Bitcoin doesn’t require bans, taxes, or Proof-of Stake. By rolling up our sleeves and committing to transparency, we can scale these strategies, make carbon-free mining the new normal, and truly make Bitcoin a leader in the energy transition.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/less-talk-more-action-a-productive-approach-to-decarbonizing-bitcoin-9f48aa9bf6b6">Less talk, more action: A productive approach to decarbonizing Bitcoin</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As we grapple with the global health crisis, several nations have implemented health passports, digital documents showing an individual’s health status. While they may seem like a practical solution to ensuring public health safety, these passports are not without concerns. In fact, they raise numerous ethical, legal, and privacy issues. Critics argue that such passports are inherently sinister, contributing to surveillance states and perpetuating inequality. An alternative solution, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), could address these concerns, providing a more democratic, secure, and efficient system for verifying individuals’ health status.</p>



<p>Firstly, it’s crucial to delve into the darker side of government-issued health passports. Their design inherently grants governments unprecedented access to personal health information. The collected data could be used for purposes beyond pandemic control, making them a potent tool for surveillance. In an era where privacy is becoming increasingly scarce, the question arises – should we further enable governments with such profound access to personal information?</p>



<p>Moreover, these health passports can exacerbate social inequalities. Access to vaccines or tests is not universally equal; many communities, especially in developing countries, lack these resources. Hence, a health passport system could perpetuate global inequality, creating a world divided into health ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’.</p>



<p>This inequality is also significant within nations. Marginalized communities often have reduced access to healthcare and, consequently, could face limitations in obtaining these health passports. It potentially bars them from engaging fully in society, further entrenching systemic inequities.</p>







<p>These inherent issues within health passports call for an alternative solution, and SSI can be the answer. SSI, or Self-Sovereign Identity, provides individuals with control over their personal data. It offers a digital identity that the person owns and controls, rather than a <a href="https://liberal.ca/our-platform/proof-of-vaccination/">third-party entity</a> or government.</p>



<p>With SSI, a person can prove their health status without revealing more information than necessary. For example, instead of showing a detailed health passport with sensitive health information, a person could provide a verifiable claim like, “I am vaccinated,” or “I have tested negative.” The underlying health data remains private, reducing the risks of misuse or surveillance.</p>



<p>Furthermore, SSI is a more inclusive solution. By decentralizing identity management, it can empower marginalized communities who often lack official documents or are distrustful of government systems. It offers an identity system that respects privacy and autonomy, reducing the risk of systemic bias and discrimination.</p>



<p>On the technical front, SSI is built upon blockchain technology, providing a secure, tamper-proof system for verifying identities and claims. This technological backbone ensures that SSI can be trusted, even in the absence of centralized authority.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while government-issued health passports might seem like an appealing solution for managing public health during crises, they can contribute to surveillance states and perpetuate inequality. We must consider these sinister aspects before embracing such a system. Instead, alternatives like SSI provide a more secure, democratic, and inclusive solution. SSI puts personal data back in the hands of individuals and offers a nuanced and privacy-preserving way to prove health status. As we navigate these complex issues, it is clear that we need solutions that prioritize both public health and personal freedoms. Self-Sovereign Identity is a promising step in that direction.</p>

 New toolkit provides the underlying digital infrastructure for Australia’s Project EDGE and enables utilities, aggregators, and digital solution providers to harness the full potential of distributed energy resources <p>Zug, Switzerland, 18 May 2023 — Energy Web, an independent non-profit that develops open-source software to accelerate the global energy transition, today open sourced the <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/solutions-2023/data-exchange/use-cases-and-reference-implementations/digital-spine-for-electricity-markets">Energy Web Digital Spine toolkit</a>, the software powering Australia’s Project EDGE distributed energy resource (DER) marketplace.</p><p>This toolkit was developed to help electric utilities and DER aggregators configure and deploy Digital Spines — digital infrastructure that makes it secure, efficient, and simple for distributed energy resources to be fully integrated into local and regional electricity markets — on electric grids around the world. As described by the <a href="https://es.catapult.org.uk/news/energy-digitalisation-taskforce-publishes-recommendations-for-a-digitalised-net-zero-energy-system/">United Kingdoms’ Energy Digitalization Taskforce recent report on digitizing the grid</a>, Digital Spines have been identified as a powerful tool to “Facilitate efficient system operation, improve access to new markets, and support development of new services for a smart and flexible energy&nbsp;system.”</p><p>Over the past year the Digital Spine toolkit has been operating in a production environment to support <a href="https://aemo.com.au/en/initiatives/major-programs/nem-distributed-energy-resources-der-program/der-demonstrations/project-edge">Project EDGE</a>, an initiative focused on demonstrating the value that DERs can deliver to both wholesale energy markets and distribution networks. The Digital Spine powering Project EDGE enables DERs, via aggregators, to sell services (such as capacity and voltage support) to distribution utilities while simultaneously participating in the wholesale energy market. Bids and offers between DERs and utilities are constrained by <a href="https://utilityanalytics.com/2021/11/dynamic-operating-envelopes-can-enable-ders-in-wholesale-market-without-endangering-grid-reliability/">operating envelopes</a> — 5 minute voltage, frequency, and power limits DERs must follow to connect to and interact with the&nbsp;grid.</p><p>The Digital Spine toolkit currently offers <a href="https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ddhub-client-gateway">a self-hosted integration gateway</a> as well as cloud-based integration for electric utilities and DER aggregators on <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-US/marketplace/apps/energywebdevhubgmbh1670375546257.ewf-data-exchange-client-gateway?ocid=GTMRewards_WhatsNewBlog_ewf-data-exchange-client-gateway_032323">Microsoft’s Azure marketplace</a>, and is compatible with a variety of communications protocols including IEEE 2030.5 utility server implementations. Energy Web plans to integrate the Digital Spine toolkit with more cloud marketplaces and release additional configurations to enable secure gateway devices and/or individual DERs, such as smart inverters, to directly integrate with Digital Spines. The Digital Spine toolkit is also designed to help electric utilities construct and launch new solutions focused on digital twinning of distribution networks, advanced distribution planning, demand forecasting, and optimizing DER dispatch.</p><blockquote>“If we want to decarbonize the grid, we have to grow a Digital Spine,” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web. “Utilities today simply do not have the tools needed to fully harness grid flexibility from DERs — flexibility that grid operators will need in order to accommodate more electric load, more solar, and more wind. Digital Spines give utilities that capability.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Open source Digital Spines will make it easier for innovative companies to deploy advanced applications on top, “ said Audrey Zibelman, former CEO of AEMO and long-time advocate for the value DERs can bring to the grid. “If we can get companies who deliver DER optimization, forecasting, and other digital solutions to utilities around the world to embrace a consistent, open source template for Digital Spines, it will go a long way towards accelerating digitization — and by extension decarbonization — of the&nbsp;grid.”</blockquote><p>The Digital Spine toolkit has five key components:</p>  A data and message exchange module that enables grid operators to configure and deploy a centralized transport layer in order for market participants to securely exchange messages and datasets (ranging from real-time telemetry to bulk file uploads).  A client gateway that provides a standardized interface for market participants to interact with the data exchange&nbsp;module.  An identity and access management solution built-on self-managed, sovereign digital identities to give market participants the ability to mutually authenticate each other’s identity and authorize selective disclosure of data based on roles and responsibilities.  A governance tool, enabling market participants to encode and enforce rules, roles, and responsibilities that must be met in order for companies to integrate with the&nbsp;spine  The ability to jointly process data using Energy Web’s open source <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/proof-of-good-work-energy-web-releases-worker-node-toolkit-to-the-public-e67a9d8a2973">Worker Node</a> technology. For Project EDGE, Worker Nodes are used to ingest and process data from AEMO, distribution utilities, and DER aggregators prior to partitioning and communicating operating envelopes to DER aggregators in order to maintain network integrity without disclosing sensitive data.  <p>Making Digital Spines reality is at the top of Energy Web’s agenda. In addition to conducting additional related open source technology releases, Energy Web will soon publish thought leadership further defining the value and inner-workings of Digital Spines and is actively convening an ecosystem of digital solution providers to build commercial applications on top of&nbsp;them.</p><p>If you are an electric utility interested in learning more or growing a Digital Spine in your market, please <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/book-a-demo/">contact us&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>If you are a digital solution provider or DER aggregator interested in joining our ecosystem of innovators building commercial solutions on top of Digital Spines, please <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/book-a-demo/">join us by following the link&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>By Francis Beland, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>Disinformation can have serious negative impacts on individuals, communities, and society as a whole. It is important to be aware of the dangers of disinformation and take steps to address it.</p>



<p>The deliberate spread of false or misleading information can have serious and far-reaching consequences. Disinformation erodes trust in institutions, government, and the media. This can lead to a breakdown in social cohesion and make it harder for people to make informed decisions. It can amplify existing divisions within society, creating polarized opinions and attitudes. This can lead to increased social unrest, conflict, and even violence. </p>



<p>Disinformation can cause people to believe things that are not true. This can lead to harmful behaviors, such as refusing to take necessary health precautions or making important decisions based on false information. In addition, it can be used to manipulate people’s opinions and beliefs for political or financial gain. This can undermine democratic processes and lead to the spread of harmful ideologies.</p>



<p>Finally, disinformation can be used as a tool to spread malware or phishing scams, leading to data breaches and other cybersecurity risks.</p>



<p>We can help solve these challenges by preempting and responding to disinformation by enabling information to be shared at machine speed and scale. </p>



<p>We can bring the counter-disinformation community together to define a common data model that describes disinformation, influence and harm campaigns.</p>



<p>OASIS will be announcing a new open source project soon addressing disinformation threat sharing. Want to join us in tackling this grand challenge? For details on being a founding sponsor, contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:join@oasis-open.org">join@oasis-open.org</a>.</p>

Please join us as Kevin and Vicky dive into the challenges the healthcare industry faces in managing recalls for medical devices and how automation and data standards like Unique Device Identification (UDI) can address these issues.&nbsp;</p> <p>Key takeaways:</p>     <p>The Internet is a powerful tool for collaboration and problem-solving, with significant untapped potential. There is a clear affinity for the Internet, citing its ability to connect people from different backgrounds and enable collaborative problem-solving. We are only starting to scratch the surface of what is possible with this technology, but there is still much to be discovered and leveraged in the years to come.</p>     <p>Automation and UDI hold promise for improved recall management. Despite the challenges of recall management in healthcare, there are several promising advancements in the field. Automation has increased in recent years, improving efficiency in the recall management process. The implementation of UDIs (Unique Device Identifiers) has likewise shown promise, as they can help to quickly locate products during a recall and provide more specific information beyond a catalog number.</p>     <p>Enriching medical records with specific product information can lead to more detailed analytics. There are a variety of potential benefits of enriching medical records with specific product information, such as catalog numbers and lot numbers. This data can provide medical professionals with more detailed analytics on patient outcomes and device performance, leading to better research opportunities and ultimately, better patient care.</p>     <p> </p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p>Our website - <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1 US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with guests:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-capatch-0b44b47/">Follow Kevin Capatch on LinkedIn</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vicky-lyle-60bb673/">Follow Vicky&nbsp;Lyle on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">John Perry Barlow</a> was a man of many titles—a lyricist, poet, essayist, cyberactivist, and, most importantly, a pioneering advocate for digital rights and freedom. His contributions to the realms of online privacy and open source have laid the groundwork for much of today’s Internet landscape. His vision of the Internet as a sphere of liberty, unbounded by the restrictions of the physical world, has shaped the discourse around digital rights and freedoms in ways that resonate even today.</p>



<p>Born on October 3, 1947, in Sublette County, Wyoming, Barlow’s early life was rooted in rural conservatism, a stark contrast to his later cyberlibertarian ideals. From writing lyrics for the Grateful Dead to co-founding the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Barlow’s eclectic life path has consistently underscored a deep commitment to freedom—in music, in speech, and in the digital realm.</p>



<p>In the early 1990s, as the Internet began to permeate everyday life, Barlow recognized its transformative potential—and the potential dangers. His first significant move into digital rights advocacy was his co-founding of the EFF in 1990 with digital rights activists Mitch Kapor and John Gilmore. The EFF was born out of a recognition that the burgeoning digital realm was ripe for abuse—by both governments and corporations. Barlow’s vision for the EFF was to ensure that the Internet remained a space for freedom of expression and privacy, fundamental rights he believed should extend to the digital world.</p>



<p>One of Barlow’s most noteworthy contributions is his 1996 manifesto, “<a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</a>,” which became a seminal text in cyberlibertarian thought. In it, Barlow argued for the Internet as an inherently free space, unregulated by the governments of the physical world. He wrote, “We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.”</p>



<p>Barlow’s advocacy for online privacy was deeply intertwined with his support for open source. He believed that the tools of the digital realm should be accessible to all, not locked away behind proprietary barriers. Barlow saw open-source software as a democratizing force, allowing users to understand, modify, and control the technology they use, thereby enhancing both their privacy and their freedom.</p>

<p>Through the EFF, Barlow contributed to major court cases that set the precedent for digital rights. He fought against restrictive legislation like the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which sought to impose stringent censorship regulations on the Internet. His belief in the power of open-source software led him to support the development of cryptographic tools like Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), which provides users with the means to protect their digital communications from unwanted surveillance.</p>



<p>Barlow’s untimely passing in 2018 did not halt the impact of his life’s work. His concepts of online freedom and privacy continue to underpin debates on digital rights and shape the evolving landscape of the Internet. His recognition of the Internet as a new frontier of human interaction, requiring unique norms and protections, remains as pertinent today as it was three decades ago.</p>



<p>Despite criticisms and challenges, Barlow’s steadfast belief in the emancipatory potential of the Internet continues to inspire new generations of digital rights activists. His dedication to online privacy and open source is a testament to his vision of the Internet as a realm of freedom, where creativity and innovation can flourish unhindered.</p>



<p>In conclusion, John Perry Barlow’s legacy lies in his profound contribution to the discourse on online privacy and the open-source movement. His tireless efforts and unwavering commitment to digital freedom have etched his name into the annals</p>



<p>In conclusion, John Perry Barlow’s legacy lies in his profound contribution to the discourse on online privacy and the open-source movement. His tireless efforts and unwavering commitment to digital freedom have etched his name into the annals of cyberlibertarianism. His vision, outlined in foundational texts and legal battles, has helped shape the Internet as a domain of free expression, privacy, and community participation. </p>



<p>As we navigate the digital frontier, Barlow’s principles remain our guiding compass, reminding us that the Internet should be a space of liberty, creativity, and open collaboration. His foresight and advocacy continue to challenge us, urging us to uphold and expand digital rights and freedoms for all Internet users. Barlow’s life and work embody a powerful message: that the digital realm is a new frontier of human potential, and it is our collective responsibility to ensure it remains open, free, and respectful of our privacy.</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>Trust is a fundamental component of human relationships. There are many ways to define trust, often depending on whether the relationship is personal or professional. One definition which resonates with me comes from leading expert on trust in the modern world, Rachel Botsman, who said ‘trust is a confident relationship with the unknown’. It means trust is key to giving people the confidence to try new things, from new technology to systems and processes. Earning trust is continuous, not a one-time thing.</p>



<p><a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final-1.pdf">Recent DINZ research</a>&nbsp;reveals that New Zealanders are nervous about digital ID and feel they do not have sufficient understanding of these services to truly assess the impact on their privacy, legal rights and freedoms. It’s within this trust gap that digital ID service providers and legislators may find an opportunity to build trust into digital systems, which would then bridge the gap that enables people to move into the unknown with confidence.</p>



<p>Ethics and inclusion are the foundations of building that trust bridge in a digital environment, as they can create a virtuous cycle in which user trust leads to increased adoption and usage. These two principles should be at the heart of all phases of digital ID development, including governance and accountability frameworks, design, and implementation. Ethical considerations like privacy, security and informed consent can enable the creation of transparent and accountable systems that respect the rights of all users and build trust. Inclusion ensures that these services are accessible to all regardless of their background, abilities or circumstances.</p>



<p>In my capacity as&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">DINZ Executive Councillor</a>&nbsp;and Co-Chair of its&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/inclusive-and-ethical-uses-of-digital-identity/">Inclusive and Ethical Use of Digital Identity (IEUDI) working group</a>&nbsp;I’d like to encourage those interested in our work to join and participate. We’re currently exploring strategies to shine the light on ethics and inclusion and ensure they are a key consideration of any digital identity legislation.</p>

<p>Limari Navarrete, DIF’s Senior Director of Community Engagement and Stephen Curran from the British Columbia Government’s Digital Trust Team gave a presentation on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) 101:</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIF members and friends of DIF led sessions including:</p>
 
 ABC’s of Writing DIDs with Universal Registrar (and how it’s different from Universal Resolver) (Ankur Banerjee of cheqd and Markus Sabadello of Danube Tech): 
 
<p></p>
 
 Advanced Topics in DID Resolution (Ankur Banerjee and Markus Sabadello) 
 Interoperable Trust Registries with DID-Linked Resources (DRLs) (Alex Tweeddale of cheqd and Andor Kesselman of Benri.io) 
 30 days from Web5: A preview of the stack and Developer Preview release next month (Daniel Buchner and Gabe Cohen of TBD) 
 Using HUMOR (ha ha ha) and Visual Communication To Gain TRUST (Chance McGee and Zack Jones from Trinsic). 
 
<p>Notes from these and other proceedings will be published on the IIW website shortly. In the meantime here's a few post-event reflections from DIF members:</p>
<p>“I saw three major themes: Trust Registries/Trust Establishment, AI (and how decentralized identity may help us sort things out) and Government (many representatives in attendance and leading sessions)” Mike Ebert</p>
<p>“Some of the topics I found most interesting: SD-JWT - not necessarily related to any work item, but was a great topic and super informative session. Advanced Topics in DID Resolution - might want to reach out to Markus / Ankur for a synopsis, but as you might guess it covered some aspects of DID Resolution other than simply getting a DID Document (e.g. querying the historic state of a DID). Fun with DIDComm Protocols - I led this session where we brainstormed what some fun DIDComm protocols could look like. I hope to discuss this in one of the upcoming DIDComm User Group calls, but some of my favorite ideas were: Transform - a protocol for transforming DIDComm messages (e.g. from one language to another, or from text to audio); Shout - a lightweight social feed based on DIDComm; Chess - we're gonna make Chess over DIDComm happen!” Nick Reynolds</p>
<p>At this IIW we were fortunate to be joined by Chance McGee who brought a unique look at humor, visual representation and storytelling to the SSI space:</p>

<p>DIF recently announced the formation of the new DIF Korea Special Interest Group (SIG).</p><p>We invited group Chair Park Kyoung-Chul, CEO of K4-Security.inc, to share some insights into the decentralized identity landscape in South Korea, and the purpose for forming the DIF Korea SIG. </p><p>How advanced is the adoption of Decentralized Identity in South Korea?</p><p>Blockchain and blockchain applications in Korea have been continuously underway since 2018, and PoCs for 5 to 8 blockchain applications (including decentralized identity) are in progress every year through KISA under the Ministry of Science and ICT. &nbsp;However, we are still at the proof of concept of decentralized identity, and national standards for decentralized identity for specific applications (e.g. driver's license) are being made.</p><p>Does the government support decentralized identity in South Korea?</p><p>In Korea, technical verification and small-scale business verification of decentralized identity are continuously progressing. However, there is a lack of standardized technology application, and we are in the process of preparing a government-level control tower. The Yoon Seok-yeol government has announced and is carrying out a national task called "Digital Platform Government". The core technical issues are materializing in the direction of a decentralized identity ecosystem, and additional research funds and related business funds plans are being established.</p><p>What do you want to achieve through the Korea SIG?</p><p>We understand that DIF creates specifications, profiles, and reference implementations which are incorporated into standards at standards development organizations including the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p><p>Domestic research on decentralized identity will be discussed at Korea SIG, and technical standardization will be carried out through the Korean standardization organization TTA (Telecommunications Technology Association) and DIF.</p><p>In addition, DIF's technical standards are consulted with NIA, KISA, and BOK through Korea SIG so that they can be applied to the establishment of a Korean-style decentralized identity ecosystem, and ultimately loaded into NIA's e-government standard framework, so we want to contribute to expanding the business to supply e-government standard framework to underdeveloped countries through the UN.</p><p>What types of organizations are you looking forward to participating in the Korea SIG?</p><p>We are trying to involve all the institutions (universities, research institutes, enterprises, and government departments/regulatory institutions) included in the 5-year blockchain project of the Ministry of Science and ICT.</p><p>In particular, efforts will be made to involve the National Information Society Agency (NIA), Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency (KISA), Bank of Korea (BOK), and Korea Minting &amp; Security Printing Corporation (KOMSCO). NIA is carrying out "Digital Platform Government" project, "e-government standard framework" and "u-City" project, KISA is promoting "MyData" project, BOK is in charge of Korea CBDC, and KOMSCO is in charge of Digital Identity project.</p><p>In addition, ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunication Research Institute), &nbsp;which researches decentralized identity together, will participate as a research institute to verify decentralized identity technology.</p>

<p>We are proud to announce the launch of the <a href="https://findy.fi/en/findynet-test-network/">Findynet Test Network</a> – the first milestone in our roadmap to build a national trust network of verified data. Digital credentials are the cornerstone of future trust-based business, and the Findynet Test Network is the perfect place to explore and familiarise yourself with their potential future business opportunities.</p>
 
 An excellent development platform for digital wallets and proofs 
<p>The newly announced Test Network provides a flexible and secure platform for the development and testing of digital wallet use cases. Digital wallet service providers can use it not only to develop wallet implementations, but also to test the interoperability of different wallets without the efffort and time of setting up and maintaining a trust registry.</p>
 Focus on simplicity, security and scalability of technologies and services 
<p>The Findynet Test Network is based on open source Hyperledger Indy technology, which supports the issuance, management, sharing and verification of digital credentials. The use of the test network, maintained by Findynet, is facilitated by a web-based wallet management portal. To ensure performance and fault tolerance, the Test Network operates in a Microsoft Azure environment, providing a secure and reliable cloud service.</p>
 Welcome to the pioneer ecosystem! 
<p>Your organisation does not need to be a member of the Findynet Cooperative to use the Test Network. Instead, we welcome users from other organisations, even outside the cooperative, to join the Test Network. Joining the Findynet Test Network offers a unique opportunity to develop, test and productise new services using digital wallets as part of a pioneering ecosystem.</p>
<p>Learn more about the service here or contact our team directly (info@findy.fi) and we will take you on a fast-paced journey into the world of digital wallets!</p>

<p>Safety and security have long been at the heart of&nbsp;identity and access management, and indeed the trends report states that “indications are that there will be a renewed focus on access control, entitlements, and permissioning over the next few years.” In keeping with the trend of the death of passwords equaling better authentication, the Identiverse report also celebrates the deployment of&nbsp;passkeys, the Apple-Google-Microsoft system that lets you log into websites with a smartphone instead of a password. We ourselves have had some trouble using passkeys — and the report hints at “the successes and learnings of early deployments” — but there’s no denying that passkeys will be a major step toward a&nbsp;passwordless future.</p>

<p>About 57 percent of US consumers expressed interest in using passkeys to replace passwords, according to new survey data from the FIDO Alliance. According to FIDO Executive Director and CMO Andrew Shikiar, that points to rapidly growing excitement, given that only 39 percent of survey respondents said they were familiar with the passkey concept in a FIDO survey released last October. Passkeys essentially store complex passcodes for a user’s various online accounts on their mobile device, locking them behind a PIN or biometric scan. Google recently launched passkey support for its own Account login process, garnering considerable media attention in the process.</p>

<p>Passkeys are intended to be more secure and easier to use than passwords. Instead of typing in a password (or letting a password manager do it) and verifying with a multi-factor authentication method, passkeys only require a trusted device and either biometric or PIN verification. Part of why passkeys seem likely to replace passwords is that they’re designed by a consortium called the FIDO Alliance and championed by Apple, Google, and Microsoft. These three companies have already baked support for passkeys into their browsers and ecosystems, which means that for the first time, there’s a viable alternative to passwords. That said, passkeys have yet to see widespread adoption.</p>

<p>I no longer need a password to sign into Google. From now on, it’s “Adios, passwords…Hello, passkeys!” Sort of.&nbsp;This new form of login is like a digital lock and key.&nbsp;&nbsp;For sites and apps run by financial institutions and other slower-moving, ultracareful services, the shift will take more time, said Andrew Shikiar. He’s executive director of the FIDO Alliance, which creates the standards for online authentication technology such as passkeys. But there are already dozens of services where you can use passkeys to sign in.</p>

 WAO expertise and focus now and into the&nbsp;future <p>On May 1st, 2023 We Are Open Cooperative turned seven years old. Like no seven year old ever, we used our birthday to reflect on who we are, what we want, where we’re going and all the other existential questions that a collective of ethical thinkers and makers might&nbsp;expect.</p><p>In our conversation, we realised that we often explain what we do in opposition to something else.</p>  Cooperative, worker-owned democracies in opposition to capitalist, shareholder-driven oligarchies.  Sustainability in opposition to grind&nbsp;culture.  Recognition in opposition to credentialing.  Community engagement in opposition to consumer marketing.  Climate consciousness in opposition to consumption and value signalling.  <p>We don’t want to set ourselves in opposition all the time, but would rather define ourselves by our own terms. We have thus identified some areas of focus for We Are Open. These areas both explain our expertise and our vision for the&nbsp;world.</p> Sustainable work <p>One of the areas we believe it’s important to advocate for has to do with the future of work. Whether it’s helping organisations like the <a href="https://weall.org/">Wellbeing Economy Alliance</a> integrate community well-being into their digital strategy or advising <a href="https://localgovdrupal.org/">LocalGov Drupal</a> on the governance and form of a new entity, WAO works to ensure that organisational growth is paired with healthy cultural initiatives and ecologically conscious advice. We know that a healthy culture surrounding an organisation or community is absolutely essential to having impact, and we work with ethical organisations that care about the kind of impact they&nbsp;have.</p><p>What do we mean by sustainable work?</p>  Our work practices promote environmental, social, and economic sustainability  We pay attention to the resources we use and we promote fair labour practices.  We aim to balance the needs of collaborators, organisations we work with, and the environment to create long-term viability and well-being.  <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/org-strategy/">Learn how to create a sustainable organisational strategy that takes culture into&nbsp;account.</a></p> Open Recognition <p>WAO is well-known for our work around Open Recognition, partially in thanks to a lovely and productive partnership with <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a>. Did you know that we believe in recognising others even without badges? We build recognition into all our work because we know that recognising the talents, skills and behaviours of others helps people feel motivated, appreciated and supported. What a better world we’d live in if positive, constructive feedback were a normal part of&nbsp;society.</p><p>What do we mean by Open Recognition?</p>  We recognise the skills, knowledge, talents, behaviours and competencies of our collaborators and networks through transparent and accessible means.  We challenge traditional forms of recognition to promote inclusivity and&nbsp;equity.  We use digital technologies and verifiable credentials such as Open Badges, with the goal of empowering individuals and promoting lifelong learning.  <p><a href="https://badges.community">Join the global conversation around Open Recognition.</a></p> Open Working <p>Working openly underpins so much of what we believe in. The clue’s in the name of our co-op! We believe in the five principles of open organisations — transparency, community, adaptability, inclusivity and collaboration. We have always worked to spread the benefits and culture of openness, and we offer everything from introductory to the most in-depth, contextual advice on this topic. Open working has given each of us the ability and opportunity to ‘jump over our own shadows’ and help others jump over&nbsp;theirs.</p><p>What do we mean by Open&nbsp;Working?</p>  We use collaborative approaches to working that involve sharing openly-licensed knowledge, resources, and results to create&nbsp;impact.  We use and recommend Open Source software and transparency in development processes to promote collaboration and innovation.  We prioritise communication, transparency, and collaboration between coworkers and between levels of management.  <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/open-course/">What we talk about when we talk about&nbsp;open.</a></p> Climate Action <p>We see ourselves as part of nature not the rulers of it and acknowledge that there is a climate emergency. We are conscious of the lost lessons and spirit of the indigenous and strive for climate justice, both individually and through the work that we do. We take steps to reduce our own and other human beings’ impact on the planet. We prioritise climate focused organisations and campaigns whenever possible because our service to our planet has been historically, well, a disservice.</p><p>What do we mean by climate&nbsp;action?</p>  We support organisations making efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change&nbsp;impacts.  We work to ensure that climate action groups are working in ways that promote diversity and inclusion, and we are committed to working together for the greater&nbsp;good.  We find creative ways to address the climate crisis using the skills and talents that are part of our&nbsp;DNA.  <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/">Listen to the Tao of WAO for more on how climate action underpins our&nbsp;work.</a></p> Worker Ownership <p>We promote democratic workplaces, values and behaviours to empower people and support a collective movement to change the status quo. In our seventh year, we remain enthusiastic and confident that worker-owned cooperatives and the co-op economy can have a positive impact on all of our lives. Working together towards a better future was always on our&nbsp;mind.</p><p>What do we mean by worker ownership?</p>  We’re a cooperative, and our members have ownership and agency in terms of the current running and future direction WAO.  We promote democratic decision-making and empower people to have a greater say in the direction of their organisation.  We adhere to <a href="https://ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles">the seven principles</a> set forth by the International Cooperative Alliance which list everything from cooperation among co-ops to concern for community  <p><a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Cooperative</a></p> It’s all about the&nbsp;overlaps <p>We work in these five areas with thoughtful, ethical organisations and partnerships that help us clear a space in the forest of modern noise. The most interesting work for us happens in the overlaps. While we do projects focused in one area, we are always keen to bring our values and understandings of other areas to the foreground.</p><p>While we are happy to work on climate campaigns, we will likely recommend working on them openly with the communities those campaigns will impact. While we’re happy to advise leadership on sustainable work practices, we’re even happier to start recognising people in the organisation for their contributions!</p><p>Does this sound like a good fit for you and your work?

<p>On Thursday, June 1, we’re hosting our first ever video-conference AMA (ask me – us – anything)! From 5-6pm CET, members of our team will gather in a video conference to answer your questions about responsible data.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://responsibledata.io/">Responsib</a><a href="https://responsibledata.io/" title="">l</a><a href="https://responsibledata.io/">e data</a> refers to our collective duty to prioritise and respond to the ethical, legal, social and privacy-related challenges that come from using data in advocacy and social justice work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At The Engine Room, we work with social justice organisations to ensure that their use of tech and data is safe, responsible and strategic. In our day-to-day, we help our partners assess and mitigate the potential risks and consequences of using data for their work, while continuing to do the exciting, relevant work they do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this AMA, we’re inviting social justice organisers who have questions about using data for social justice work. This can include practical questions like:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 What is responsible data and how can I put it in action in my organisation? 



 How can we responsibly manage and store the data we already have?&nbsp; 



 How can we tell stories with data? 



 What are some responsible data best practices for research projects?&nbsp; 



 What are some strategies and tools that can help us manage data and keep it safe? 
 



 Join us 



<p>Our “Ask Us Anything” session is happening on Thursday, June 1, starting 5pm CET. Our team members – experienced and committed activists, researchers and technologists – will be available to answer your questions!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The digital age has brought immense convenience and efficiency to our daily lives, but it has also introduced new challenges when it comes to verifying the authenticity of documents. PDFs are a widely used format for sharing important information, but the ease with which they can be altered leaves room for fraud and misrepresentation. This has led to a demand for a more secure way of sending and receiving PDF documents.

<p>Maybe history will defeat itself.</p>
<p>Remember FreePC? It was a thing, briefly, at the end of the last millennium, right before Y2K pooped the biggest excuse for a party in a thousand years. <a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/02/a-free-pc-gimme/">This may help</a>. The idea was to put ads in the corner of your PC’s screen. The market gave it zero stars, and it failed.</p>
<p>And now comes <a href="https://www.freetelly.com/">Telly</a>, hawking free TVs with ads in a corner, and a promise to “optimize your ad experience.” As if anybody wants an ad experience other than no advertising at all.</p>
<p>Negative demand for advertising has been well advertised by both ad blocking (<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">the biggest boycott in human history</a>) and ad-free&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5tObaoAimbLiA7vtj3f7RS">“prestige” TV</a>, (or SVOD, for subscription video on demand). With those we gladly pay—a lot— not to see advertising. (See numbers <a href="https://www.kantar.com/inspiration/technology/us-streaming-market-growth-continues-despite-changes-in-the-industry">here</a>.)</p>
<p>But the advertising business (in the mines of which I toiled for too much of my adult life) has always smoked its own exhaust and excels best at getting high with generous funders. (Yeah, some advertising works, but on the whole people still hate it on the receiving end.)</p>
<p>The fun will come when our own personal AI bots, working for our own asses, do battle with the robot Nazgûls of marketing — and win, because we’re on the Demand side of the marketplace, and we’ll do a better job of knowing what we want and don’t want to buy than marketing’s surveillant AI robots can guess at. Supply will survive, of course. But markets will defeat marketing by taking out the middle creep.</p>
<p>The end state will be one <a href="http://cluetrain.com">Cluetrain</a> forecast in 1999,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/intention-economy">Linux Journal named in 2006</a>, the VRM community started <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work">working on</a> that same year, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge-ebook/dp/B007UPDH5S">The Intention Economy</a> detailed in 2012. The only thing all of them missed was how customer intentions might be helped by personal AI.</p>
<p>Personal. Not personalized.</p>
<p>Markets will become new and better dances between Demand and Supply, simply because Demand will have better ways to take the lead, and not just follow all the time. Simple as that.</p>

 A Brief History of zk-SNARKs 



 zk-SNARKs, an acronym for Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, are a form of cryptographic proof that allows one party to prove to another that they know the value of a specific piece of information, without revealing the information itself or requiring any interaction between the prover and the verifier.

 A Brief History of zk-SNARKs 



<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zk-snarks-practical-applications/">zk-SNARKs</a>, an acronym for Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, are a form of cryptographic proof that allows one party to prove to another that they know the value of a specific piece of information, without revealing the information itself or requiring any interaction between the prover and the verifier.</p>



<p>The roots of zk-SNARKs can be traced back to the early 1980s when the concept of zero-knowledge proofs was first introduced by Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff. This revolutionary concept proposed the idea of proving knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself.</p>



<p>In the ensuing years, researchers worked to improve the efficiency and practicality of zero-knowledge proofs, leading to the development of non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs in the 1990s, a variant which did not require back-and-forth communication between the prover and the verifier.</p>



<p>The term “zk-SNARKs” itself was introduced in a 2012 paper by Nir Bitansky, Ran Canetti, Alessandro Chiesa, and Eran Tromer. This marked a major milestone in the development of practical zero-knowledge proofs, making them significantly more efficient and thus more suitable for use in <a href="https://lionsgate.io/main/">real-world applications</a>.</p>



 zk-SNARKs and Cryptocurrencies 



<p>The introduction of zk-SNARKs has had a profound impact on the world of cryptocurrencies. The most notable implementation of zk-SNARKs in cryptocurrency is in Zcash, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that was launched in 2016.</p>



<p>Zcash uses zk-SNARKs to provide enhanced privacy to its users. With zk-SNARKs, Zcash transactions can remain fully encrypted while still being verified as valid under the network’s consensus rules. This is a significant departure from Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, where transaction details are transparent and visible to all network participants.</p>



<p>In addition to Zcash, several other cryptocurrencies have integrated zk-SNARKs into their protocol to improve privacy, efficiency, and scalability. Ethereum, for instance, has incorporated zk-SNARKs into its protocol to enhance transaction privacy and improve scalability. zk-SNARKs are used in Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solutions, like zk-Rollups, which bundle multiple transactions into a single proof that can be verified quickly.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Horizen (formerly known as ZenCash) also uses zk-SNARKs to enable private transactions. Similarly, Coda Protocol (now Mina Protocol), uses zk-SNARKs to keep the blockchain size constant, ensuring high scalability.</p>



<p>While it’s difficult to give an exact number of cryptocurrencies using zk-SNARKs, as of 2023, it’s estimated that dozens of projects use some form of zero-knowledge proofs, with many specifically choosing zk-SNARKs due to their efficiency and non-interactivity.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>zk-SNARKs represent a powerful tool in the realm of digital privacy and have already seen significant adoption within the cryptocurrency sector. As privacy and scalability continue to be pressing issues in the blockchain space, it’s likely that zk-SNARKs and related technologies will only grow in importance. Despite the technical complexity, the promise of efficient, non-interactive proofs of knowledge that maintain user privacy is a compelling proposition for many in the digital world.</p>

<p>In today’s interconnected world, the concept of digital identity is becoming increasingly significant. One revolutionary approach that is gaining traction is Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs), a cornerstone of decentralised identity technology. In this context, we’re going to focus on one key aspect of DIDs – DID Delegation.</p>
 What are Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)? 
<p>To understand DID Delegation, we first need to grasp the concept of DIDs. DIDs are globally unique identifiers that are created, read, updated, and deactivated by their owner without requiring a central registry or authority. They are typically associated with a set of cryptographic keys, allowing the owner to prove control over the DID.</p>
 What is DID Delegation? 
<p>DID Delegation is a concept that allows the owner of a DID to delegate certain rights or capabilities to another entity. This delegation is done in a cryptographically secure and verifiable manner. It’s like handing over a digital power of attorney, where the delegator assigns some of their authority to another party, known as the delegatee. In the W3C DID Core Specification DID Delegation is described as:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <code>capabilityDelegation</code> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verification-relationship">verification relationship</a> is used to specify a mechanism that might be used by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects">DID subject</a> to delegate a cryptographic capability to another party, such as delegating the authority to access a specific HTTP API to a subordinate.</p></blockquote>
 Why is DID Delegation Important? 
<p>DID Delegation is crucial for several reasons:</p>
 
 Flexibility: Delegation allows DID owners to flexibly manage their digital identities. They can delegate specific tasks to other parties without giving up total control. 
 Scalability: DID owners can delegate responsibilities to multiple parties, making it easier to manage larger systems and networks. 
 Security: Delegation maintains security by ensuring only authorised parties can perform specific tasks. The delegator can also revoke access if necessary, maintaining control over their digital identity. 
 Privacy: DID Delegation can help enhance privacy by enabling the delegator to limit the information shared with the delegatee to only what is necessary to perform the delegated task. 
 
 How Does DID Delegation Work? 
<p>DID Delegation for did:oyd involves a few key steps and are described below using the <a href="https://github.com/OwnYourData/oydid/tree/main/cli">command line utility <code>oydid</code></a>:</p>
 
 Creating a Delegation Record: The delegatee creates a delegation proof using their private key and publishes it in the DID Log. This entry in the log record includes the public key and explicitly states the rights or capabilities to be delegated.
 oydid delegate --doc-enc z6M... did:oyd:zQm... 
<p>Note: the response of the command is the log reference (hash value) of the newly created records</p> 
 Confirming the Delegation Proof: While the first step only publishes a delegation record (that can be done by anyone) the DID owner needs in the next step to confirm / sign the delegation record for inclusion
 echo '["log-reference"]' | oydid confirm did:oyd:zQm... 
<p>Note: the input is an array of log-references to be included&nbsp;</p> 
 Using the Delegation: The delegatee can now act on behalf of the delegator within the bounds of the delegated rights. When a delegatee performs an action, he/she provides the delegation proof, which can be verified using the delegator’s public key. To retrieve all currently active public keys you can use the following command:
 oydid pubkeys did:oyd:zQm... 
<p>Examples for the use of delegation in the did:oyd method infrastructure are retrieving Verifiable Credentials from the online wallet or updating a DID Document itself.</p> 
 
<p>Here is an example DID Document with delegation information (for <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:oyd:zQmRTHTMPvbaEuvSDfsZZhWkMdaJNS2Zzy73sg3g4BzJo95"><code>did:oyd:zQmRTHTMPvbaEuvSDfsZZhWkMdaJNS2Zzy73sg3g4BzJo95</code></a>):</p>

 Findings Along the Way 
<p>Implementing delegation for the did:oyd method provided some insights and learnings that might also be relevant for other DID methods:</p>
<p>Describing Capabilities</p>
<p>While the W3C DID Core Spec has dedicated Verification Methods for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#capability-invocation">Capability Invocation</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#capability-delegation">Capability Delegation</a>, I could actually not find a way to describe a capability itself. In the did:oyd method there is the possibility to delegate the capability associated with the document-key (to be used e.g. when establishing a secure communication channel with DIDComm) and for the revocation-key (necessary to publish an update of the DID Document). In addition it would make sense to have dedicated cryptographic material in a DID Document associated with service endpoints and consequently allow delegation for accessing a service.</p>
<p>This might be addressed in upcoming versions of the DID Specification to allow a more explicit referencing of capabilities.</p>
<p>Available Capability Delegation in Other DID Methods</p>
<p>When searching for Capability Delegation in other DID methods I found surprisingly litte information. Reading the specifications in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">DID Method Registry</a> actually made me aware that the use of Verification Methods is not part of the typical DID Method Specification and I assume that those are interpreted quite differently in the various implementations. Which brings us to the final finding:</p>
<p>DID Rotation</p>
<p>Migration between different DID methods is hard – at least I’m struggling for a while now to implement such a functionality for did:oyd. And with implementing more functionalities like Capability Delegation it becomes even harder since it would require to research and develop peculiarities for each other DID method. This might be an area that the upcoming <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/">DID Resolution Specification</a>&nbsp;could address.</p>
<p>For now I made the design decision for did:oyd that any capability delegation needs to be explicitly renewed upon updating a DID Document, i.e., the default behaviour when publishing a new DID Document is to automatically disable any previous delegations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, DID Delegation is an essential component of decentralised identity systems, providing flexibility, scalability, security, and privacy. This blog posts described how DID Delegation works for the <a href="https://ownyourdata.github.io/oydid/">did:oyd method</a> and explained the various mechanisms involved in the process.</p>

<p>By Francis Beland, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>Why is participating in open standards essential?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the most common question I am being asked. The answer is quite simple: do you want to help write the rules of the game, or do you stand back and let the market and your competitors do it for you?</p>



<p>Here the metaphor refers to shaping the market, industry norms, and regulatory environment in which your company operates.</p>



<p>Here are several reasons why this can be beneficial:</p>



<p>Influence over Market Conditions: If you’re actively setting industry standards or influencing regulations, you can shape these to align with your business strategy.</p>



<p>Competitive Advantage: By helping to create the rules, you’re likely to have a deep understanding of them and can therefore design your business strategies to leverage them effectively.</p>



<p>Predictability: Being involved in rule-making can provide insights into future changes, allowing you to anticipate and prepare for them rather than react.</p>



<p>Reputation and Trust: Businesses shaping industry norms and regulations can enhance their reputation.</p>



<p>Innovation: In many cases, regulation can spur innovation. By being part of the rule-setting process, a company can better understand where opportunities for innovation might lie.</p>



<p>As with any open standard, this opportunity comes with responsibility. We must create fair, sustainable, and beneficial rules for all stakeholders and our global community.</p>

<p>By Harm Jan van Burg, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>My role as a Senior Policy Advisor on International Standards at OASIS Open often takes me to various conferences and meetings around the world. These days, many are conducted remotely, but sometimes it helps to be in the same room as your colleagues. This week, I’ve had the honor to help lead <a href="https://unece.org/info/events/event/371951"></a>the third working meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) <a href="https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/ToSTraceability">Team of Specialists (ToS) on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Traceability of Sustainable Value Chains in the Circular Economy</a>.</p>



<p>The conference (at UNECE’s historic and gorgeous Palais des Nations headquarters in Geneva) is attended by ESG experts from all corners of the globe. Government representatives, trade associations, industry professionals, and other international organizations were all present, demonstrating the significance of the topic at hand. I had the privilege of serving as vice-chair and moderator of a session on ESG traceability in supply chains.</p>



      



<p>During the meeting, I emphasized the importance of integrating ESG reporting and monitoring into existing industry practices. Our goal was to ensure that these new requirements, which serve important goals. wouldn’t create additional reporting burdens but instead become a natural part of existing trade and transactional frameworks. We also stressed the need for transparency and responsiveness to evolving customer demands regarding circularity efforts. By aligning these practices with established reporting mechanisms, we can achieve more effective and efficient traceability in supply chains. The work we do here is essential for shaping the future of ESG traceability and contributing to a more sustainable and circular economy.</p>



<p>One aspect that made this particular meeting unique was the way I chose to travel. I decided to make the journey south from my home in the Netherlands to the meeting in Geneva in my campervan. Not only is this a more sustainable choice, but it also provided me with a cost-effective solution in the notoriously expensive Swiss city. It has been quite an adventure, so far, navigating the roads and having my own office on wheels.</p>

<p>Author: Mélissa M’Raidi-Kechichian. Additional contributions made by members of DIACC’s Outreach Expert Committee.</p>


 
 
 
<p>Digital identity aims to make our life easier, avoid long waiting lines to prove who we are, and access online spaces in a secure way while safeguarding our personal data. It also enables organizations to establish their online identity and protect users against online threats. Falling under the umbrella of the broad tech ecosystem, digital identity is evolving along with the responsible tech movement, itself growing and already impacting Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance, as seen in the principles of the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence and the EU AI ACT. According to the US based think tank dedicated to grow the responsible tech ecosystem <a href="https://alltechishuman.org/what-is-responsible-technology">All Tech Is Human</a>, responsible tech is ensuring that technology is aligned with the public interest, concerned with reducing the harms of technology, and promotes diversity in its space. The responsible tech movement may not be a framework but rather a school of thoughts, it brought many practitioners to wonder about the question of responsible tech practices regarding users’ data privacy.</p>
 



  
  
 
 


<p>Along these lines, a growing number of citizens (i.e., users), became aware of how precious and sensitive their personal data is, how it is being used, for better (easier and faster access to bureaucracy) and for worse (the centralization of individual identifiers in insecure and opaque systems, data shared without consent with data brokers, or fuelling Weapons of Math Destruction*, for instance), especially thanks to the work of scholars and data activists. The latest shed light on the social implications of AI in a vulgarized and accessible way. Scholars and activists explained the risks of technology and lack of regulations over personal data in plain English and by using relatable use cases, through <a href="https://alltechishuman.org/all-tech-is-human-blog/responsible-tech-documentaries">documentaries</a> and workshops.<br><br>The concept of “good” digital identity aligns with DIACC’s mission to provide the framework to develop a robust, secure, scalable, and privacy enhancing digital identification and authentication ecosystem for Canadians, but is yet to be defined and standardized by this industry. Building on Kim Cameron’s digital identity work legacy, better known as the <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">Laws of Identity</a>, this blog aims to explore the possibilities and meanings behind the concept of “good digital identity”.</p>


 
 
  
  



 
<p>“Good” is an adjective that seems to carry a subjective meaning depending on the point of view of a practitioner (or user, for that matter). Since the term has not yet been defined and standardized by the digital identity industry, we are interpreting the word good as a digital identity practice that is beneficial for most and does not harm or disadvantage any users. Before getting into the principles of good digital identity, let’s note that “consent” is a recurring term in this blog piece. In this case, consent refers to the clear and informed decision of a user to permit access to their data to a third party. This consent should not be transferred from one third party to another without the knowledge and consent of a user.</p>
 
 
 


<p>Principles. </p>



<p>The first principle of good digital identity is privacy, and gathers the first 3 laws of Kim Cameron on identity. Users should have control and consent over how their data is being used, and minimize data sharing to the minimum required to access a service depending on the context of use.</p>



<p>Interoperability, which echoes law 5 of Kim Cameron, should be a core component of good digital identity. Users should be able to choose between different providers of digital identity solutions, and these distinct entities should be able to trust each other in a common framework.</p>



<p>Digital identity should have a social and collective benefit rather than a solely individual benefit. Therefore, digital identity must be inclusive and serve traditionally marginalized communities that have been excoded** rather than encoded in digital “solutions” in the past. That means moving consciously and with care rather than moving fast and breaking things, until or alongside a legal framework that guarantees protection of users’ rights, integrity, and privacy.</p>



<p>Digital identity should be optional, as an alternative to traditional identity verification, until the widespread use of digital identity is proven efficient, safe, and secure for every user so that our traditional identity verification process gradually falls into disuse on its own. It is important to recognize that a number of people are worried about digital identity, what it means for them, and what it implies. In some cases, it is due to personal experiences as minorities (in the Canadian context, an example would be Indigenous communities specifically, who have a record of having been the victim of crimes committed by public entities), in others it is due to disinformation and unfounded narratives, or even lack of accessible public resources about digital identity. One might argue that it would be an avoidable financial cost if the traditional methods had a sunset date, rather than to invest in maintaining both processes. However, users should be left with a choice regarding digital identity.</p>



<p>Digital identity should be understood by any user, regardless of their background, in order for them to make informed decisions and consent, meaning that resources to understand digital identity and how it impacts a user must be available in plain English and use relatable use cases as examples. Explainability not only empowers users, it also gives less space for speculations that feed disinformation.</p>



<p>Fairness and trust should be the red line guiding good digital identity. Fairness and trust come from acknowledging and fixing mistakes. To do so, good digital identity should have a mechanism that bridges the gap between users and providers in order for users to share feedback and adapt its practices when needed and avoid ongoing unnecessary harm that have historically correlated with the implementation of a new technology.</p>



<p>Good digital identity should promote transparent data processes, storing, and use. Transparency allows for greater accountability and therefore also aligns with fairness and trust.</p>



<p>Scalability was previously formulated by Kim Cameron in his seventh law of identity. Good digital identity should allow users to share only the desired and necessary parts of their identity, and therefore be scalable across contexts and needs, i.e., following data minimization principles.</p>



<p>Regularly auditing digital identity solutions should be part of good digital identity practices. These audits should be comprehensive but also meaningful and relevant for the users.</p>



<p>Take Aways</p>



<p>In this blog, we explored what the concept of good digital identity could mean, following principles that would lead to a practice that is beneficial for most and does not harm or disadvantage any user. However, the concept of good digital identity should be collectively defined by practitioners in the field in order to standardize and adopt a definition. Beyond actionable principles, good digital identity should also promote a culture where a diversity of voices participates, and where users’ consent, choice, and control over their personal data prevails.<br><br>Definitions</p>



 
 * Weapons of Math Destruction is a term coined by data scientist Cathy O’Neil in her book “Weapons of Math Destruction: how Big Data increases inequality and threatens democracy”. The term describes mathematical models (algorithms) that attempt to quantify human traits and characteristics and have an opaque data sourcing and processing that, as a consequence, leave big scale damages on one or several communities. 



 ** Excoded is a term coined by Dr. Joy Buolamwini, MIT, in her work conducted at <a href="https://www.ajl.org/about">The Algorithmic Justice League</a> that she founded, that refers to the minorities excluded from the data that composes the code of models powering technologies. The excoded are usually the most negatively impacted from said technologies.

<p><a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/x/kp7QB">Cardea</a>, a complete open-source verifiable credential ecosystem for sharing health information in a way that preserves patient privacy, has been accepted as a <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/participate/labs">Hyperledger Lab</a>.</p>



<p>Cardea emerged from a project to <a href="https://youtu.be/iTp8-MqL-Kw">share proof</a> of Covid 19 test status for entry to Aruba. Developed by <a href="https://indicio.tech">Indicio</a>, a leading developer of privacy-first decentralized identity and verification solutions, for <a href="https://www.sita.aero/">SITA</a>, the leading global supplier of IT to the air transport sector, the solution went on to win an <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-award-ceremony">EIC</a> and <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/events/supernova/2022">SuperNova</a> award for advancing decentralized identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cardea contains all of the necessary components to issue, share, and verify a variety of health information using decentralized identifiers, a mobile application, and a distributed ledger. The unique parts of the codebase were built on Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries and originally donated by SITA as the Cardea Project to Linux Foundation Public Health, where it was further developed to address the broader need for a complete open source solution for sharing health data in a privacy-preserving and secure way. (Read <a href="https://cardea.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cardea-White-Paper-V1.0.pdf">this white paper</a> for a deep dive into how Cardea works and some of the initial use cases.)</p>



<p>_____<br><br>Be sure not to miss our <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings">next meeting</a> on 5/11/2023 at 12 noon Eastern Time featuring <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-samis-31190a/">Sarah Samis</a>, VP of Public health Products and Platforms of GCOM, on vital records!<br>_____</p>



<p>Preserving privacy is a critical need both for digital health credentials and travel passes. A recent poll from IATA highlighted that 78% of passengers who took part in the survey will only use a travel health credential app if they have full control over their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data privacy and security are equally critical in healthcare. In 2021, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/03/31/2413675/0/en/Largest-Healthcare-Data-Breaches-Reported-in-February-2022-Confirms-Need-for-Network-Security-Based-on-Zero-Trust-Microsegmentation.html">93% of healthcare organizations experienced a data breach, while 57% of healthcare organizations have had more than five breaches</a>. By using a decentralized approach we are putting control of the end user’s data back into their own hands to store locally on their own verifiable credentials, reducing both the impact of these breaches and the incentive for bad actor’s to attempt them.</p>



<p>By becoming a Hyperledger Lab, Cardea aims to empower public health authorities to design, build, and deploy open-source, privacy-first, and simple-to-use digital health solutions. With this technology, the community can work together to reopen economies without people having to give up their privacy.</p>



<p>“With the migration of Cardea to Hyperledger,” says Heather Dahl, Indicio’s CEO&nbsp; “Indicio has taken the lead on privacy-first decentralized identity technology. And as a Public Benefit Corporation, we believe that open sourcing decentralized identity technology through Hyperledger Foundation will lay the foundation for a better, fairer world to come.”</p>

<p>About a year ago, we started a three-year project to examine and strengthen our own digital resilience and, in doing so, increase our capacity to support others. Since then, we’ve been <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/building-digital-resilience-is-an-ongoing-effort/" title="">reflecting about digital resilience</a>, making <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/" title="">changes to our tech infrastructure</a>, and <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/mapping-digital-resilience-challenges-in-social-justice-organisations-learnings-from-our-partners/" title="">supporting several partners</a> as they strengthen their own systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing I’ve noticed while talking to partners about digital resilience is that the term “digital resilience” can sound really appealing to some social justice organisations; while seeming a little too jargon-y, unattainable and even unclear to others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital resilience” has many definitions (including our own current <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-strengthening-our-digital-resilience/" title="">working definition:</a> “a set of practices that support the ability of an organisation to protect itself from – and respond to – digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of its members/individuals, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to the ever-changing needs and contexts of the organisation and its members.”), but the term doesn’t necessarily spark a crystal clear image for those who hear it for the first time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing what digital resilience looks like can be an important step for groups who want to strengthen their tech infrastructures. More than a jargon-y definition, digital resilience should be an achievable reality for social justice organisations.</p>



<p>So, in order to help make digital resilience a little more tangible, I asked my coworkers to tell me what came to their minds when they thought about it. Here’s what they had to say:</p>



<p>For Cathy and Lesedi, digital resilience involved having a plan for when things don’t go as planned:</p>



 
 

 



 
<p></p>



<p>“Digital resilience is knowing what to do next in case systems fail. It’s investing in our future selves while going about our day to day now.”</p>



<p>Cathy, Tech Lead</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p></p>



<p>“I see digital resilience as a dynamic process, in which organisations and individuals collaborate to create robust action plans: after identifying vulnerabilities, developing holistic strategies to address them.”</p>



<p>Lesedi, Technical Engagement Coordinator</p>
 
 



<p>Olivia talked about the ongoing process of choosing tools and practices that support safety and wellbeing:</p>



 
 

 



 
<p></p>



<p>“I see digital resilience as a process of continually strengthening online tools (and access to these tools) and digital security practices to stay safe online”</p>



<p>Olivia, Research &amp; Engagement Assistant</p>
 
 



<p>Laura emphasised how digital resilience is about building processes and culture within an organisation, focusing on increasing protection from risks and making values-aligned tech decisions:&nbsp;</p>



 
 

 



 
<p>“When I think of digital resilience, I think about building the processes and culture that enable an organisation to: anticipate risks, work more smoothly with technology, and align technology choices more closely with their values. It’s about weaving in holistic ways of using – and sometimes not using – digital technologies in the process of doing our work.”</p>



<p>Laura, Co-deputy Director</p>
 
 



<p>For Quito, digital resilience is about working your way towards being more adaptable and responsive to challenges:</p>



 
 

 



 
<p></p>



<p>“Digital resilience is about building the muscle of digital security, responsible data practices and broad-based digital literacy to be able to respond to a changing landscape of digital challenges.”</p>



<p>Quito, Research Manager</p>
 
 



<p>Lesedi and Steffania highlighted the importance of building sustainable infrastructures and engaging in long term thinking:&nbsp;</p>



 
 

 



 
<p></p>



<p>“For me, digital resilience is about having a proactive and adaptive approach to digital security. This includes learning from past experiences and anticipating future challenges in order to protect ourselves and build robust, sustainable infrastructures in the long term”.</p>



<p>Lesedi, Technical Engagement Coordinator</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p></p>



<p>“Digital Resilience to me is the ability to prepare for unexpected events in the present and in the future. It is the “behind the scenes” work that allows the digital day to day to run smoothly. It’s the ability to navigate through digital challenges in a smooth, informed and prepared way.”</p>



<p>Steffania, Resilient IT Infrastructure Manager&nbsp;</p>
 
 



 Reflecting about what digital resilience looks like to you 



<p>After reading what my coworkers had to say about digital resilience, you might be curious about what that would look like for your organisation. Reflecting about your tech infrastructure can be a good place to start.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can start with questions about the tools you use:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Are they aligned with your values?&nbsp; 



 Are they supporting you in doing your work,or are they creating more challenges for your team?&nbsp; 



 Are they the most appropriate options for keeping you, your team and the people you work with safe?&nbsp; 
 



<p>Other steps organisations can take to strengthen digital resilience include learning about <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/civil-society-digital-security-new-research/" title="">why digital security matters to your work</a>, adopting internal <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">policies for data retention, archival and deletion</a>, shifting to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/">privacy-</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/" title="">respecting</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/"> tools</a>, figuring out how to stay online through emergencies, getting more familiar with <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/takeaways-from-our-community-call-on-responsible-data-for-social-justice-organisations/" title="">responsible data</a>, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, building up your digital resilience can be a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/building-digital-resilience-is-an-ongoing-effort/" title="">messy process</a> – but <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/bringing-political-values-into-practical-tech-decisions-learnings-from-our-partnership-with-frida/" title="">so worth it</a>! If you’d like support in that journey, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">schedule a call with our team!</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Verifiable credentials can revolutionize how we store and share personal information. This technology promises greater privacy, security, and convenience in many contexts by enabling individuals to control their data. However, as with any new technology, there are significant challenges to be addressed by developers, implementers, and adopters if society is to realize its potential fully.</p>



<p>The comments and findings presented in this report reflect interviews conducted with representative organizations concerning the level of interest in using verifiable credentials in their respective organizations and industry sectors as part of their identity management offerings. This report does not examine or consider enabling technologies related to the generation, use, and management of verifiable credentials (e.g., blockchain, digital wallet, and public key cryptography components) except in broad terms.</p>

Such an increase in membership means we have a greater impact both within our own field and beyond. Community members are collaborating on projects and initiatives that have helped to advance our shared goals. We’ve also been able to raise our profile through events, community calls, and other forms of outreach. We feel that we are part of something bigger than ourselves, and that our collective efforts are making a meaningful difference in the&nbsp;world.</p> Increased participation cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>We’ve also seen an 11% increase in “active” engagement.

We have worked to have more structured opportunities for people and our pointed cadence has help us mature as a community. Our goal is always a more vibrant and dynamic community, with a wider range of perspectives and experiences represented.</p> Improved governance and decision-making cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>A key aspect of community maturity is the ability to make decisions and govern ourselves in a way that is transparent, inclusive, and responsive to the needs of all members. We’ve held off on establishing a more formal governance structure, choosing instead to work collectively, mostly in our monthly community call. There’s been a small increase in participation in this call, so clearly word is getting around that all members have a voice in shaping the direction of the community. We’ve become better at documenting our decisions and sharing information about our activities, which has helped to build trust and foster a sense of collective ownership.</p> Community maturity is an ongoing&nbsp;process <p>There is always more work to be done, and we know that community maturity is an ongoing process rather than a destination.

<p>In IDunion we develop concepts for wallet security with verifiable credentials. In the PDF below, you will learn about the three pillars of wallet security, the attestation process and trust model, and much more.</p>

<p>The three pillars of wallet security are:</p>

<p>1. Integrity of the Credential</p>

<p>2. Authenticity of the Holder</p>

<p>3. Authenticity of the Wallet</p>

<p>These pillars are important because they ensure that the credentials issued by an issuer are secure and cannot be tampered with, that the holder is who they claim to be and can prove it, and that the wallet itself is authentic and trustworthy. By maintaining these three pillars, trust can be established in the SSI triangle between the verifier, issuer, and holder/wallet.</p>

<p>More security-relevant use cases demand new requirements for trust in the holder/wallet relationship. One example of such a use case could be a situation where a holder is required to present their credentials to access sensitive information or perform a critical action, such as accessing medical records or transferring large sums of money.</p>

<p>In these cases, it is important to ensure that the holder’s authentication is strong enough to meet the requirements of the regulated use case and that their wallet is authentic and trustworthy.</p>

<p>This document was created by Paul Bastian from Bundesdruckerei in the context of developing a secure attestation service based on OpenID4VC flows. This flow was tested and presented at the Internet Identity Workshop with the Lissi Wallet.</p>

<p>OpenID Foundation is pleased to announce that the first set of FAPI 2.0 self-certifications have been published and can now be viewed on the <a href="https://openid.net/certification/#FAPI2">Certification Listings</a>.</p>
<p>We congratulate Authlete, Cloudentity, ConnectID, Ping Identity, and Raidiam for achieving compliance with the current FAPI 2.0 certifications and for being thought leaders on the leading edge of this important work. We are grateful to ConnectID in Australia who adopted FAPI 2.0 for their ecosystem and funded the FAPI 2.0 conformance test suite development, as noted in <a href="https://openid.net/2023/03/21/fapi-2-conformance-tests-available/">our announcement</a>. We expect further announcements of FAPI 2.0 adoption and additional certifications later in the year.</p>
<p>We also thank all these members and the FAPI Working Group for their valuable feedback on the FAPI 2.0 specifications and the certification tests. The conformance tests and certification programme are a vital part of ensuring interoperable, secure Open Banking and Open Data ecosystems.</p>
<p>The FAPI 2.0 specification has been through formal security analysis by the University of Stuttgart as <a href="https://openid.net/2022/12/19/fapi-2-0-announcement/">previously announced</a>. The Foundation encourages existing and future implementers to consider their adoption plans for FAPI 2.0 now as the current Implementor’s Draft 2.0 is mature and stable, and Implementor’s Draft’s are commonly selected by public and private entities to implement against. The working group expects the specification advance to Final before the end of the year.</p>

We believe that everyone should have access to recognition, no matter where they come from or what their background is.

<p>Andrew Shikiar, FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CMO</p>



<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-password/">Google announced support for simple and secure sign-ins with passkeys</a> for all Google Account users. This is a huge milestone in our journey towards a passwordless future. Why?</p>



<p>It’s been only a year since Apple, Google and Microsoft announced their commitment to passkeys with plans to expand support for a common passwordless sign-in standard created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium. Since then, Apple and Google have readied their operating systems for service providers to enable sign-ins with passkeys that sync across devices; Windows 10 and 11 have long supported device-bound passkeys in Windows Hello – and passkeys from iOS or Android devices can also be used to sign into sites in Chrome or Edge on Windows.</p>



<p>Additionally, service providers like PayPal, Yahoo! Japan, NTT DOCOMO, CVS Health, Shopify, Mercari, Kayak, SK Telecom and more are committed to or already providing passkey sign-ins. Google now joins them, and will serve as a great way for large swathes of consumers to become familiar with passkeys, while also helping accelerate deployments from other service providers.</p>



<p>Consumer Readiness On the Rise<br>The growing number of service providers supporting passkeys matches a growth in consumer awareness and readiness.</p>



<p>According to a new survey released today by FIDO Alliance, over 57% of U.S. consumers said they are interested in using passkeys to replace passwords, compared with 39% who said they were familiar with the concept of passkeys in FIDO’s <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/barometer-2022/">2022 Online Authentication Barometer,</a> released in October 2022.</p>



<p>Recovering or resetting passwords is one of the many hassles that consumers face. Only 9% of those surveyed report that they never need to recover their password – with 13% having to recover passwords daily or several times per week and nearly 60% reporting several password resets per quarter.&nbsp; It is little wonder then that 29% of consumers prefer signing in with biometrics (e.g. fingerprint or face scan) versus 19% who prefer to enter a password manually.</p>



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys are resistant</a> to threats of phishing, credential stuffing and other remote attacks often used to take over online accounts. Based on the survey, approximately 65% of people who prefer to use biometrics to sign in would be interested in using a passkey and nearly half (45%) of people who prefer to use passwords to sign in would be interested in using a passkey. This is another clear signal telling us that consumers want less friction and greater ease of signing into their online accounts.</p>



<p>Passwords Create More Friction for Online Transactions</p>



<p>Consumers are tired of the hassle and complexity of passwords and are ready to embrace passkey sign-ins, which enable them to access online services simply and securely. Passkeys can help reduce shopping cart abandonment and turn the tide against the ongoing plague of data breaches and identity theft.</p>



<p>In addition to security implications, passwords continue to be costly for online retailers – according to the survey, nearly 60% of consumers said they have abandoned their carts due to a forgotten password in the past six months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simply put, passkeys stand to dramatically improve consumers’ online shopping experiences – as well as their service providers’ bottom lines.</p>



<p>Perceived Password Risk<br>Despite the large number of breaches and warnings, many consumers maintain poor password hygiene, unmoved by the risks passwords pose to their digital lives. According to the survey, 70% of people use passwords that are at least one year old. Despite the known risks of phishing attacks and other security breaches, the survey shows that 21% of respondents believe entering their password manually is the most secure authentication method.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly 60% said they would not pay for increased security measures or official verification on social media platforms. Earlier this year, Twitter warned users they would lose the ability to secure access to their account via text message two-factor authentication unless they pay to subscribe to Twitter Blue. It seems clear from this data that consumers would naturally look to passkeys as a seamless and secure alternative.</p>



<p>To review the FIDO Alliance’s full survey results, click <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/research-findings-consumers-are-ready-to-embrace-new-authentication-methods/">here</a>.</p>



<p>What’s next?<br>Both the data and the increasing number of organizations rolling out passkeys shows that the future of authentication is here. But this does not mean the work is done. The FIDO Alliance and its members continue to iterate to improve the experience of passkeys. Be on the lookout for upcoming UX research and guidelines to further increase the adoption and usability of passkeys.&nbsp;The FIDO Alliance is also continuing to provide education, UX guidance, adoption perspectives and more through upcoming industry events. Attend our <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/event/fido-alliance-at-identiverse-2023/">sessions</a> at Identiverse and be sure to attend the FIDO Alliance’s conference, <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/event/authenticate-2023/">Authenticate</a>, in Carlsbad, CA (or virtually) on October 16-18, 2023.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased announce the final publication of the white paper on “Government-Issued Identity Credentials and the Privacy Landscape,” published here (<a href="https://openid.net/Government-issued-Digital-Credentials-and-the-Privacy-Landscape-Final">https://openid.net/Government-issued-Digital-Credentials-and-the-Privacy-Landscape-Final</a>). The Foundation joins with five other non-profits (the Kantara Initiative, ID4Africa, Open Identity Exchange, Secure Identity Alliance, Better Identity Coalition, and the Trust Over IP Foundation) along with a wide range of experts from civil society, government, and the private sector for this thorough assessment of the global privacy landscape in the context of government-issued digital identity credentials.</p>
<p>This paper is an especially timely as governments around the world seek to scale their existing digital identity credential implementations, or chart a path to deliver new digital identity credential programs. It seeks to offer a balanced, global view of privacy concerns by exploring laws, implementations, gaps, and tradeoffs facing the people developing these new ecosystems. It builds on the thoughtful work of other studies and concludes with tangible recommendations in three areas:</p>
 
 
 The Basics of Security and Privacy 
 Addressing Ongoing Concerns 
 Getting Ahead of Emerging Concerns 
 
 
<p>Beyond identifying issues, the contributors to this paper seek to point our concrete areas that will inform how to build more privacy preserving ecosystems, and what issues the community needs to continue working on together. This is a final paper, but&nbsp;&nbsp;those interested in taking part in future discussions and papers on this topic are welcome to share your interest to <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to lead editor Heather Flanagan, who has distilled a complex and rapidly changing domain space for the benefit of lay people and experts alike.</p>

<p>“Eventually, it’s going to be like World Horse and Buggy Day, I think,” Shikiar says. “For the time being, it’s a good reminder of the challenge we have to get rid of passwords.”</p>

 A conversation with Elodie Vialle, affiliate at the Berkman Klein Center and Senior Advisor on Digital Safety and Free Expression at PEN&nbsp;America Photo courtesy of <a href="https://medium.com/u/9bf278485c05">Elodie&nbsp;Vialle</a><p>Death threats. Defamation campaigns. Doxxing.</p><p>These are just some of the threats journalists face in their day to day, especially women and journalists of color who are disproportionately targeted for their work. Online harassment remains one of the largest threats to world press freedom, with 73% of women journalists worldwide experiencing online violence in their course of work, <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unescos-global-survey-online-violence-against-women-journalists?TSPD_101_R0=080713870fab2000cebe8667e99a2979fc19b93b58b373fc77c69ded596f1527bfb7d18430e7dd3d087d106cc51430006e57bd6929665b27b4aea72ae8d136bd810b56d8454e9655add857ae7d41bef1bc5e69af718262623fe125321b82bc1b">according to UNESCO and ICFJ</a>. To combat this issue and preserve press freedom around the world, it is crucial to increase safety measures for journalists in online&nbsp;spaces.</p><p>In her work as a 2022–2023 RSM Assembly Fellow with the Institute for Rebooting Social Media at the Berkman Klein Center, journalist and press freedom defender <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/elodie-vialle">Elodie Vialle</a> proposed creating an escalation channel within social media platforms to better support journalists and human rights defenders harassed online. While social media platforms do have features like “reporting” and “blocking,” Vialle’s proposed system would provide customized support in emergencies and situations of severe online abuse such as doxxing or coordinated attacks. The “Escalation Channel 2.0” would act as customer service for journalists and human rights defenders, making targeted, trauma-informed support more accessible to journalists around the world with a focus on protecting marginalized voices.</p><p>“What I felt in my own experience is the feeling of being powerless when your peer journalists reach out to you being traumatized, facing a situation that no one can help with or that no one is listening to. I wanted to listen to them, and I wanted to find a solution,” Vialle said when I asked her about what led to the creation of Escalation Channel&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>As we talked, I thought about my own experiences as a young woman of color, GenZ journalist, and a student press freedom activist. Malicious online comments about my age, race, and gender are not unique to me, as these proliferate for young women and journalists of color everywhere. Online harassment is creating a chilling effect on free speech, not just through censorship but also through self-censorship.</p><p>I sat down with Vialle to further discuss her proposal, her work preserving press freedom online, and challenges with press freedom around the&nbsp;world.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/ja/@joeldevriend?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Joël de Vriend</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>Pratika Katiyar: How do you approach women, people of color, or younger, student journalists facing harassment? These are three different groups who receive uneven support and attention when it comes to harassment online. Do you find that focusing on women or other marginalized groups is effective?</p><p>Vialle: Women and marginalized groups are <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/5/2/mr-musk-we-need-twitter-guardrails-that-protect-lives-and-free">becoming deplatformed</a> because of online harassment. And, we have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">research in the US</a> showing that journalists of color are particularly targeted. Trying to build solutions to tackle this issue is a way to better enhance diversity. There’s a lot of interest in promoting diversity, but actually, it’s only a layer of communication if you don’t create the conditions to make sure that people can work safely within the newsroom. So acknowledging that women and marginalized groups are disproportionately targeted by online harassment, newsrooms that are committed to work on enhancing diversity can put in place better safety measures.</p><blockquote>There’s a lot of interest in promoting diversity, but actually, it’s only a layer of communication if you don’t create the conditions to make sure that people can work safely within the newsroom.</blockquote><p>Katiyar: In your presentation, you briefly discussed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/19/student-journalist-harass-arizona/">Taylor Lorenz’s article on how online groups and mobs are coming for student journalists</a>, who already don’t have a lot of protections. Aspiring journalists or younger, GenZ journalists are dropping out of the journalism industry in large numbers because of both online harassment and the tumultuous nature of the media industry right now. How can solutions combating online harassment help bring some younger journalists back into the field or encourage them to continue pursuing journalism?</p><p>Vialle: We cannot do our work as journalists without being on Twitter or on Facebook. We have to be visible and engage with our readers. As journalists, this is a tool we have to use for our work. I cannot just stop tweeting; freelancers need to be visible. The same goes for young journalists entering the field; they need their work to be&nbsp;visible.</p><p>I spoke with student journalists in the US facing death threats, and they didn’t have any idea how to deal with that. There’s two layers of action here. One is institutions. The institution or organization has to set up and implement safety protocols and training. And as always, we acknowledge that newsrooms today are struggling to survive, and that it is difficult to implement additional costs. So when we have these discussions about safety, we really want to acknowledge the limited [financial] constraints for student newspapers too. In universities, building connections between the existing support helplines to get access to therapists or getting a special connection with safety hotlines for students in journalism, because we do know that they face a higher level of risk. Students can also learn how to better protect themselves <a href="https://onlineharassmentfieldmanual.pen.org/?_gl=1*1jm7o6p*_ga*NDg3NDgzMDIwLjE2Nzc3Njc3MTI.*_ga_0RQGYGDH22*MTY4MjYyMTY5OS4zNC4wLjE2ODI2MjE2OTkuNjAuMC4w">using PEN America’s resources</a>.</p><p>Katiyar: There is a lot going in terms of press freedom around the world. The recent arrest of WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich in Russia is an example of a physical violation of press freedom, but there’s also a lot of online censorship in countries like India, where the government is blocking access to information. Additionally, in the United States, there’s so many news outlets shutting down or laying off staff, with BuzzFeed News being one of them recently. The landscape for the future of journalism looks very uncertain right now. What challenges do you anticipate in preserving press freedom around the world right now, and is there any&nbsp;hope?</p><p>Vialle: Today, journalists are facing, I will say, a new array of threats, between arbitrary detention, physical attacks, arrest, murder, online harassment, intimidation, and defamation campaigns. The situation is really bad for the journalism field. The fact that in democracies now, we are facing threats that are similar to the one we’re used to in authoritarian regimes, that’s also a signal that things are going&nbsp;badly.</p><blockquote>The fact that in democracies now, we are facing threats that are similar to the one we’re used to in authoritarian regimes, that’s also a signal that things are going&nbsp;badly.</blockquote><p>The rise of disinformation and the lack of trust in the media normalizes attacks against journalists. All these narratives developed by governments and enemies of the free press, trying to use journalists as scapegoats, leads to direct physical attacks. I observed this in France because we had some protests, of course during COVID. The rise of disinformation led to attacks on journalists and attempts to censor content. A <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news-powerful-and-privileged-how-misrepresentation-and-underrepresentation-disadvantaged">Reuters Institute report </a>saw that there’s a lot of disinformation that exploits the fact that underrepresented communities don’t feel served, they don’t feel represented well in the media&nbsp;outlets.</p><p>I want to give you a sign of hope though. We’ve mentioned the social media platforms relating to my project. These platforms are being used to amplify online abuse and gender-based violence, but but they can be a part of the solution as well, <a href="https://pen.org/report/no-excuse-for-abuse/">if they implement features to mitigate the impact of online abuse</a> and <a href="https://rebootingsocialmedia.org/2022/12/01/from-emergency-to-prevention-protecting-journalists-from-online-abuse/">proactively work with civil society on code signing solutions</a></p><p>Katiyar: Thank you for that answer and for your time&nbsp;today.</p><p>The theme for World Press Freedom Day 2023 is “Freedom of expression as a driver for all other human rights.” When freedom of expression is suppressed, access to information and all other human rights are put at risk. It is more important than ever to ideate and implement sociotechnical solutions to better support journalists who are attacked and abused online beyond the traditional methods within social media platforms. That rings especially true with the recent layoffs of trust and safety roles in the tech industry, specifically at Twitter, a platform known extensively for the presence of journalists.</p><p>Centers like Berkman Klein showcase how to best combat this pervasive issue: by putting practitioners — civil society folks, technologists — and academics together. But more attention needs to be paid to including young journalists. GenZ is chronically online, and solutions to combat online harassment should start at the university/journalism school level. That includes advocating for classes on online safety, working on public policy efforts in conjunction with social media companies to educate GenZ on online abuse, and pressing news organizations and journalists to prioritize hiring young journalists of color. Newsrooms highlight their innovation and diversity efforts, but those efforts cannot succeed if journalists are currently under threat and if the next generation is dropping out of the industry altogether.</p><p>Pratika Katiyar is a research assistant at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University, a student at Northeastern University, and a board member for the Student Press Law Center, a nonprofit that defends students’ press freedom rights. She is a GenZ free expression activist that has been profiled in Teen Vogue, NBC Washington, and ABC for her work and has spoken on panels for the United Nations, PEN America, and Georgetown Law&nbsp;School.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/online-harassment-threat-to-world-press-freedom-540adb768c54">Online harassment makes world press less free</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Michael Pytel has years of experience in the manufacturing world from developing wheelchairs, greeting cards, shoes, poultry and meat products, and even rockets. Through all of this, he felt like there wasn't a lot of innovation in warehouses. His aim to change that is by building a platform that uses machine learning and AI from the ground up, rather than antiquated warehouse management systems that were built 15, 20 years ago. So what are these cutting-edge technologies that Michael has created and how do they lead to efficiency and success?</p> <p>Michael Pytel, Co-Founder &amp; CTO at Fulfilld, explains the importance of technology in the warehouse for mapping products, eliminating fork truck traffic, and how it all leads to success.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Key takeaways:</p>     <p>An optimized warehouse is one that focuses on reducing waste. Wasteful time, wasteful travel, wasted movements, and focusing on where you want employees to feel engaged and successful in the day. Fulfilld is focused on creating technology to structure the ballet in the warehouse where movement is optimized and there is no wasted travel.</p>     <p>Fulfilld is focused on creating a ‘digital twin’ for mapping out products in the warehouse. They take the CAD drawing of a manufacturing space, of a warehouse space, and load it into a computer model, and essentially generate their own version of Google Maps. It can create routes for employees to optimize their travel on a forklift or on foot.</p>     <p>Transparency creates efficiency. By having something be visible, you can optimize more! Fulfilld’s technology has given customers the ability to see where their order is in the process so they aren’t constantly wondering when it’s going to ship. This creates a great consumer experience.</p>     <p> </p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p>Our website - <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1 US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with guest:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelpytel/">Michael Pytel’s LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gitcoin Grants Beta Round kicked off last week, providing an opportunity for developers and creators to raise funds for their projects by connecting with potential donors. The platform has been instrumental in supporting open-source projects and fostering innovation in the Web3 ecosystem over its past grants rounds, with over<a href="https://impact.gitcoin.co/?ref=blog.ceramic.network"> $50,000,000</a> donated toward public goods.</p><p>Gitcoin created <a href="https://passport.gitcoin.co/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Passport</a> in 2021—a reputation system integrated with <a href="https://docs.passport.gitcoin.co/get-started/how-it-works?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>—to ensure that each vote cast during the Gitcoin Grants rounds are linked to a unique human. Since then, the use cases have expanded to help a plurality of communities better detect when a wallet is linked to a unique human. Gitcoin Passport offers critical scoring mechanisms to keep Web3 communities safe from malicious actors. So far, Gitcoin Passport has been used in conjunction with a number of other data science analyses to prevent<a href="https://impact.gitcoin.co/?ref=blog.ceramic.network"> $3M</a> of fraud during the grants rounds.</p><p>As part of Gitcoin's efforts to decentralize and democratize the grant funding process, they are transitioning from a centralized grants platform to a decentralized protocol—<a href="https://gitcoin.co/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Gitcoin Allo</a>. This protocol and the accompanying dApps in Gitcoin’s Grants Stack will enable multiple grants rounds to run concurrently on-chain, empowering any community to permissionlessly coordinate its own grants program and create a more inclusive and community-driven funding ecosystem.</p><p>We're excited to see how developers leverage the decentralized Grants Stack, with tools like Gitcoin Passport, to launch and manage their own projects. Passport enables developers to verify the 'unique humanity' of a wallet that wants to access an application or project. The data collected is intended for broad interoperability for any system that wishes to issue or consume VCs to establish the unique humanity of an individual through their direct ownership of multiple accounts (Twitter, BrightID) or Web3 assets (ENS).</p><p>To determine who gets access to a developer's application, the new and improved Passport Scorer App gives users a 'Unique Humanity Score'. Developers can check out this<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bfkalDSvRDc&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network"> starter video</a> to integrate it into their application—helping to increase the trustworthiness of Web3 and onboard more users.

<p>A new analysis by password manager NordPass stresses that major companies open themselves up to security risks by using passwords that lack creativity. While password trends slightly vary each year across different audiences, the general take is that people continuously fail with their password management, and the world desperately needs to switch to new online authentication solutions such as passkeys. Various progressive businesses such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, PayPal, KAYAK and eBay have already adopted passkey technology and are offering their users password-less logins. It is thought that in no time at all, other online companies will start following this trend.</p>

		<p>How Institutions Can Take the Lead on their Digital Education Future</p>
<p>Long before remote learning became part of the norm amid the higher education community, many institutions were seeking solutions to expand their digital education capabilities. For several years, Online Program Managers (OPMs) have provided a suite of services, including course design and technology solutions, marketing and enrollment services, and academic coaching. This industry has grown substantially since the early 2000’s and quickly expanded during the pandemic when colleges and universities needed to bring their courses and services online quickly. Unfortunately, the digital learning options provided by OPMs are often costly and cannot be customized to meet the unique needs of each institution. Plus, many organizations have made investments in their own digital learning capabilities in recent years and no longer wish to outsource their online program management. Add in tightening federal guidelines and regulations on OPM providers, and we are seeing greater opportunities to foster successful home-grown digital learning programs.</p>
<p>Origin and Growth of OPMs</p>
<p>Outsourcing online program management and recruitment to OPMs often does not require upfront costs, but their educational and backend services are in exchange for 40-60 percent of student tuition payments. “The U.S. law bars colleges that receive financial aid from giving incentive-based compensation, which includes commissions or bonuses to companies or employees that recruit and enroll students into their programs,” explains Edge Chief Digital Learning Officer, Josh Gaul. “The Education Department considers tuition sharing to be incentive compensation, however, agency guidance released in 2011 allows OPMs that provide recruiting services to have such arrangements with colleges if they meet certain criteria. Without this loophole, OPMs would have a hard time existing at the current way they are built.”</p>
<p>In addition to the services they provide, many OPMs offer the upfront capital necessary to launch an online program. “After the OPM has built the program and an institution begins receiving student enrollments, they will take a percentage of those dollars as part of a revenue sharing agreement,” says Gaul. “In the beginning stages, OPMs faced the uphill battle of providing online students with services on par with what they receive on campus, so they had several risks to consider. Twenty years ago, launching an online program was expensive, with all the instructional, technology, and marketing costs associated with this endeavor. From an educational standpoint, many institutions were also concerned if the online education program would be on par with a traditional campus experience. In addition, an online program raised a host of operational questions and concerns. How is this program managed? How does it compare with in-person classes? For faculty that teach online, do they get paid the same amount for teaching in person? How does load look for faculty in terms of teaching online courses versus in-person courses? How does IT manage online programs versus in-person classroom digital technology?”</p>
<p>When online programs were beginning to expand in the early 2000’s, many institutions were also concerned of how this would affect their reputation. “Many people perceived online education as second rate,” says Gaul. “There was a worry that key constituencies, alumni, foundations, and hiring corporations would see an entry into the online world as a symptom of institutional weakness. Thankfully, these unknowns are not as mysterious today. While the OPM pitch was appealing over two decades ago, they have become a larger part of the problem, rather than the solution.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“Edge does not take a dollar from your tuition and all intellectual property and content that we create in collaboration with you is yours to keep, reuse, and repurpose however you want to in the future. Many institutions have similar needs, but we can customize your solutions based on your organization’s culture and unique processes, and our goal is to provide the services you need at as low a cost as possible. OPMs will continue to face regulatory risk and evolving federal rules, while Edge, being a non-profit organization, is solely focused on serving the needs of its member institutions.”</p>

		<p>Drawbacks of OPMs</p>
<p>Using an OPM partner can offer benefits, but with the evolution of the online education space, the challenges have begun to outweigh the advantages. “The cost of technology and services to build and run an impressive online program have dropped, but OPMs still expect schools to part with a huge percentage of their tuition,” explains Gaul. “High tuition is a critical problem in higher education and OPMs are adding to this issue. If you work with a traditional OPM, your students will pay $20,000 to $40,000 in loan repayments just to cover its profit. This is becoming increasingly hard to justify imposing that burden on your students and that cost locks you into a long-term competitive disadvantage and could cause your rankings to potentially drop.”</p>
<p>“Schools that find ways to go online at lower costs will be able to reduce their tuition costs and invest more in compelling programs and great staff and faculty,” continues Gaul. “Typically, an OPM’s contract with a college or university allows it to continue sharing tuition revenue for several years, even after the relationship ends. These long-term restrictive contracts can be very difficult to terminate and can extend between five and ten years with limited remediation options for institutions if enrollment objectives are not met. Many traditional OPMs also operate in a silo, so when they build an online program, they are not incorporating input and involvement from faculty and other departments. Instead of moving towards a more agile future, the OPM structure reinforces rigidity and does not support the high-flex models that are becoming increasingly popular among current and prospective students.”</p>
<p>Among the drawbacks of outsourcing an online program management to an OPM is the increased risk. “A traditional OPM invests its marketing dollars where it can make the greatest return, typically the programs are the least selective and most expensive,” says Gaul. “If an OPM discovers they can steer a student elsewhere with less expense or more revenue, your enrollment can suffer. Given that online programs are increasingly core to institutional missions, working with an OPM can mean adding an existential risk. A more subtle risk is when a traditional OPM represents schools in different parts of the country and will steer students in each region to their nearest client. This cuts the OPM’s marketing costs, while making it impossible for you to grow your school’s reach geographically or demographically.”</p>
<p>Due to the nature of revenue sharing contracts, there is no incentive to share the OPM’s strategies and data, particularly in marketing admissions. “There is a complete lack of transparency around what tactics are driving performance,” says Gaul. “This prevents a school from learning the operational analytical nuances of operating at scale and understanding why certain decisions are made and what is effectively attracting students to the institution. In addition, OPMs typically focus their efforts on the specific programmatic offerings with the highest profit margin and are highly selective in what they’re willing to support—which often does not align with an institution’s mission and individual needs. OPMs also may not align with a school’s culture. Some OPMs’ tactics taken on behalf of an institution may be seen as aggressive or not in line with the school’s ethos. Furthermore, some strategies can be in direct competition with tactics the institution is already employing to recruit students from non OPM-supported programs.”</p>
<p>Without access to the strategies and technology benefits, many institutions can be left without the capabilities, expertise in recruiting pipeline, as well as the data and insights into what worked and what it took to launch their online programs and grow their enrollments. “In a revenue shared agreement with an OPM, the company often has ultimate decision-making authority on non-academic processes,” shares Gaul. “This can cause friction with faculty and leave schools with no way to intervene and lead to less revenue generation over the long term.”</p>
<p>Launching Sustainable Online Programming</p>
<p>Since no one knows an institution and its business objectives better than its own organization, setting up and running a program management system in house without third party support can be an appealing prospect. “There are obvious benefits of saving money and retaining full control of developing your online program, but not every school has the resources, whether it is human, time, or financial to organically create and maintain online programs,” says Gaul. “Not everyone has a fleet of faculty and staff, instructional designers and technologists, enrollment management, and recruiters who are all working together toward a common goal with no delineation and no other responsibilities on their plate. This is why OPMs have had such success. Unfortunately, this is not a true partnership and you’re unable to gain access to a fully scalable system wherein you only pay for the services, features, and functionalities that you need.”</p>
<p>To help institutions launch and maintain sustainable online programming, Edge can support a successful shift away from OPMs. “Our team of expert instructional designers understand the methodologies, rubrics, and standards that go into creating high-quality curriculum rooted in industry best practices and research,” says Gaul. “This includes understanding compliance and instructional design and helping you grow your own methods and vision, not offering a cookie-cutter solution. Teaching and learning online is far different from traditional classroom learning and we help support your institution through faculty and student development. We can prepare your staff and students for this challenge through engaging student-centered experiences built to encourage online presence and active learning methodologies. Working in collaboration with your leadership, faculty, and current employees, we can help you scale up and build out more detailed programs that can be self-paced and supplement your current training.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Accelerating Digital Learning Efforts</p>
<p>Edge’s Digital Learning &amp; Collaboration solutions also include course and curriculum evaluation services to ensure courses meet all the standards for technology-enhanced education. “These assessments offer risk management and quality assurance for your online program,” says Gaul. “Through EdgeLearn, you can also receive learning space design assessments to evaluate and analyze campus learning spaces. Every face-to-face classroom now has an online or digital component, and we can offer assessments and project management services to help your institution build and support 21st century classroom spaces that meet your academic goals and technology strategies. When you partner with Edge, we work with facilities, academic affairs, IT, and enrollment management to determine the best use of the classroom space and how it fits into the larger infrastructure of the organization. Our goal is to find solutions that best fit into your current processes and procedures and find ways to improve quality and efficiency.”</p>

		<p>When Brandon Wagner joined The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) as a systems administrator in 2017, cloud technology was only beginning to be incorporated into their IT strategy. Two years later, the need to move more systems to the cloud became necessary. “Cloud migration began as one-off projects, but then the pandemic happened and our Basic Data Infrastructure (BDI) at the time was no longer sufficient for our engineering groups,” explains Wagner. “We needed an environment that could handle heavier processing, including graphical processing. As we explored our options, we decided on Amazon AppStream 2.0, and I was tasked with heading up this transition. I earned the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification and part of my current role as Cloud Operations Manager is managing the services we provide within AWS.”</p>
<p>Connectivity and Network Infrastructure</p>
<p>Cloud migration is an ever-evolving journey for many institutions and TCNJ continues to expand its strategies for leveraging the cloud for technology applications. “Originally, we were running all of our applications on-premises,” says Wagner. “Now we use Amazon Route 53 for our external Domain Name System (DNS) which responds to user requests for both AWS-hosted and local resources. When we expanded to AppStream for our engineers, it was to give them the necessary GPU availability to do modeling as well as other tasks that require a more powerful system. We expanded AppStream with additional fleets for special courses, and we also have a campus-wide deployment that has general applications available for students, faculty, and staff. Our team also deployed a storage gateway that we have linked to some of our Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets to conduct important backups. This high-speed, web-based service allows for online backup and archiving of our critical data and applications.”</p>
<p>Using S3 can offer a variety of benefits, including being highly scalable, highly available, secure, cost-effective, and provides unlimited storage capabilities. “Choosing to use S3 has provided cost optimization and many options for redundancy as well as storage object lock,” says Wagner. “In our Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) environment, we have additional domain controllers, so we’ve expanded our network and our Active Directory (AD) infrastructure out to Amazon. In the event campus is closed or in-person classes are suspended, we can maintain functionality within AppStream and offer single sign-on capabilities.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“We’ve deployed our direct connects through EdgeNet, which has increased our speed substantially,” continues Wagner. “This is used for our workspaces, AppStream, and we’re currently working towards using this for S3 and other Amazon public services. Once we’ve established these routes, we’ll be able to access&nbsp; many Amazon services over the direct connect and can move even further with systems like Amazon FSx, which allow you to run high-performance file systems in the cloud and support a wide range of capabilities. Edge provides our internet connection, Dark Fiber, and direct connects. My networking team has been very happy with the internet service and support provided by Edge. Our questions are answered quickly and correctly, and the partnership has helped make our cloud transition very successful.”</p>
<p>Creating a Flexible and Focused Strategy</p>
<p>Migrating to the cloud is often a multi-layered process and can happen in phases, as the needs of an institution and its initiatives evolve. “Our goal was never to lift and shift our entire environment,” shares Wagner. “We do rely on systems and applications on-premises, and I don’t see that changing in the near future. Many organizations may look at cloud migration as an all-or-nothing process, but we’ve always tackled this transition with a piecemeal approach. If there is a need to fill, we analyze the costs and performance, and if it makes sense, we move that existing or new service to the cloud. By taking things one step at a time, approaching cloud migration slowly, deliberately, and exploring the costs closely, I think you can optimize costs and prevent runaway spending.”</p>
<p>AppStream allows secure access to applications and desktops from any location and allows an institution to deliver online learning. “Our AppStream deployments were very beneficial by providing the infinitely scalable resources of Amazon,” explains Wagner. “When the pandemic first hit, we couldn’t have predicted how many people would be needing to access applications. But by having the flexibility provided by AppStream, we could rapidly and dynamically scale higher. After extending our network to Amazon, applications that run in EC2 are essentially just virtual machines (VM) that act the same as they would on-premises.”</p>
<p>“Our scanning tools continue to scan and patch the systems that are running in EC2. Amazon has their best practices clearly defined and they consistently make improvements to these standards,” continues Wagner. “I’ve worked with many representatives from AWS to discuss best practices, ask them about the nuance in the networking, and receive recommendations for optimizing security. Combined with the expertise and experience of our own security team, we’re able to ensure a secure environment.”</p>

		<p>Overcoming Challenges of Cloud Migration</p>
<p>Shifting systems to the cloud can prove challenging, especially without a strong, well-planned migration strategy and the commitment of the entire organization. “Getting all necessary teams on the same page and distributing relevant information to everyone is essential,” says Wagner. “You must connect your enterprise infrastructure group, security and networking team, and enterprise app stakeholders to ensure your migration goes smoothly. Also, though Amazon support is very responsive, you do not have the same amount of visibility as you do when you’re dealing with on-premises networks or systems, so some of the challenges that can arise&nbsp; are not having hardware or software accessibility.”</p>
<p>Successful cloud adoption requires thorough planning and creating a roadmap to incrementally accomplish an organization’s goals. “Before you get started, it’s important to do the research and conduct detailed prep work,” says Wagner. “Talking to the teams at Edge and Amazon has been extremely helpful to gather information and provide insight into successful strategies. If you’re just starting out, instead of moving everything to the cloud at once, I think looking at it as a stepped process can be beneficial and more cost-effective. Concentrate on what you need in the cloud and what needs to be redundant. Taking on too much at once can easily lead to failure, so taking a step back and deciding where to focus can make your migration more successful and will allow you to stay aligned with your mission, budget, and future plans for expansion.”</p>

		<p>In an age of digital transformation, more and more institutions of higher education continue to incorporate new technology, migrate to cloud-based solutions, and expand their online learning curricula. With these growing changes, the need for bolstered practices around student privacy and data security has become paramount. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) is a federal law that requires financial institutions to have information security and privacy provisions that protect consumer financial data. This Act has recently been amended to strengthen data security requirements for nonbank financial institutions, including colleges and universities that provide financial aid to students.</p>
<p>Dr. Dawn Dunkerley, Edge’s Principal Virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO), says following security standards addressed in the GLBA is important and any necessary changes were required to be completed by June 9, 2023. “Throughout my years of experience in supporting higher education, I’ve seen the letters that are sent out that indicate if your organization is not in compliance. They state that if you do not make updates to your security practices, the ability to process financial aid will be terminated. Many of the GLBA provisions are also current or anticipated insurance carrier requirements, so GLBA compliance oftentimes aligns with maintaining a good standing with your insurance carrier.”</p>
<p>The GLBA has two components, the Privacy Rule and the Safeguards Rule. Under the Privacy Rule, institutions are required to ensure confidentiality of Nonpublic Personal Information and comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). As part of the recent amendments, the Safeguards Rule outlines several key elements that must be included in an institution’s information security program.</p>
<p>Key Changes Affecting Institutions</p>
<p>By complying with the GLBA, organizations lower their risk of reputational damage and penalties for unauthorized sharing or loss of student data. According to the Safeguards Rule, colleges and universities must secure and ensure the confidentiality of private and financial information by adhering to the following provisions.</p>
<p>Designate an individual who is responsible for implementing an information security program. According to the new amendment, a single qualified individual must have the sole responsibility of overseeing and enforcing an institution’s information security program. “The definition of ‘qualified’ has not been specified, but there are no particular requirements for education, experience, or certificates for this role,” explains Dunkerley. “This person is often the IT director or chief information officer who has the ability to enforce these safeguards.”</p>
<p>Integrate risk assessment into information security programs. The Safeguard Rule states that the individual assigned to implement their organization’s information security program must submit annual risk assessments in writing. “Assessments must include criteria to assess the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer information,” shares Dunkerley. “Customer information defined in the updated GLBA goes beyond financial information like credit card and bank account details. This can also include personal health and personal identifiable information, so I encourage institutions to explore what systems might include this information. Risk assessments are now required to be in writing and must describe how identified risks will either be accepted or mitigated. When Edge conducts risk assessments for example, we look at the risks to customer information and identify the impact. For instance, does the risk have a confidentiality impact? This means that if an organization had a data breach of sensitive information, would this cause harm to the customer and cause harm to the institution?”</p>
<p>“Risk will never be zero,” continues Dunkerley, “But once we’ve applied controls, we’re accepting a level of risk and trying to mitigate it further. We must remember that risk assessments need to be reviewed and updated at least annually. If an institution changes systems or implements a new strategy, they must understand how their risks have changed and reassess the controls associated with them. Risk assessments are living documents and must grow and change as our environment changes.”</p>

		<p>“Implementing multi-factor authentication can be time consuming and expensive, but now there is a mandate that requires this security measure to be put in place,” says Dunkerley. “We’re also seeing some insurance carriers not renewing policies unless and institution has MFA. In regards to inventorying and classifying data according to sensitivity, each organization must know the location and sensitivity of their data, especially to effectively create access controls for customer information. Not every faculty member needs to have access to every piece of student information, and not all staff members need to have access to financial aid or the human resources information.&nbsp; We must take the principles of least privilege and apply access controls to include physical storage.”</p>
<p>“If your institution has a room where they house servers and store information, there must be physical controls on those doors to limit access,” continues Dunkerley. “The security control, encryption of customer information in transit, refers to the data flowing between an institution and external entities and having encrypted connections. Customer information at rest, meaning it’s not being processed or transmitted, must also be encrypted in an organization’s internal systems. Institutions must also use a secure change management process for both adding new software and making changes within their environment. If they are adding a new system into the environment, for example, they must make sure they have reviewed that system and the security associated with a new piece of software. Again, each institution must know and have inventoried the location of their data; understand what is on their network; and have controls in place that protect sensitive information.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Logging and system monitoring practices allows an organization to review logs and monitor traffic in and out of their network. “If someone breaches or attempts to breach your institution, you need to have a system in place that alerts you. Edge has been working with organizations to implement these measures, including annual penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. Vulnerability assessments differ from vulnerability scans, where external scans should be conducted at least monthly, and assessments are much larger and encompass the actual vulnerabilities associated with an organization. Edge conducts these assessments quite regularly and they include a closer look at people, processes, and technology, including documentation requirements and network traffic, not just a vulnerability scan.”</p>
<p>As part of the newly revised GLBA, institutions must also have requirements outlined for disposing of customer information. “We must consider what we do with information after a student graduates, or if a student steps away from school for a few years and then comes back,” says Dunkerley. “This requirement is causing a lot of challenges in higher education, because in many cases, there are policies stating not to get rid of that information. The GLBA document indicates that if you are not going to dispose of this information, you must have procedures in place that protect this information and policy details that explain the reasoning for keeping this information past the stated time frame.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ongoing security training for personnel. GLBA already requires security training for staff, but the new provision adds that training be continually updated to include relevant and timely information. “If you do not have a training and awareness program in place, you must now train your personnel at least on an annual basis,” explains Dunkerley. “Sometimes getting leadership and faculty and staff on board with this training can be challenging, but by providing sufficient training, an institution can address relevant security risks and ensure they have the most up-to-date knowledge necessary to successfully maintain their information security program.”</p>
<p>Oversight of service providers. Institutions must now “periodically assess” their service providers on an ongoing basis based on the risk they present and the continued adequacy of their safety measures. “When assessing new service providers that are brought on board, an organization must ensure the contracts have the same level of safeguards for the customer information they will be storing and processing,” says Dunkerley. “An institution must also periodically assess the risk being brought to them. Has the service provider had a breach in the past? If so, did they follow their requirement to alert us? To follow best practices, I would suggest these assessments be conducted at least quarterly.”</p>
<p>Tapping into Security Expertise</p>
<p>Many institutions seek to create a holistic security approach, but have difficulty finding expertise that aligns with their needs and budget. Edge offers security services to IT leaders that can help them set programmatic goals, identify and address vulnerabilities, and improve security outcomes. Depending on an organization’s current security profile and risk management needs, Edge’s team of vCISOs can help guide the improvement of cybersecurity planning, integrate proactive assessment and remediation practices, and ensure an institution meets GLBA compliance requirements.</p>

		<p>Facilitating Connections</p>
<p>EdgeNet’s direct connection to AWS can help speed migrations to the Cloud, allow a smooth and efficient flow of research data, and deliver a secure transit of data connections. To minimize service disruptions, all traffic entering the Edge network is monitored and any issues are mitigated to ensure the EdgeNet core and all connected members remain protected.</p>
<p>The transition from a commodity internet provider to EdgeNet and the network’s advanced layer 3 service capability allow for member-to-member connectivity and will support institutions like FDU and Rutgers as they continue to grow and enhance their education and research initiatives. In addition to meeting the growing data and network demands of students and faculty, the need for high-speed research and collaboration continues to rise across the higher education community. Having a network that facilitates these national and global connections will be an essential factor in driving innovation and discovery forward and giving current and incoming students a superior educational experience.</p>

		<p>Even before the frequency of remote and hy-flex learning greatly increased, many institutions were trying to keep pace with students’ growing technology requirements and network demands. From computers, smartphones, and iPads to gaming systems and video streaming, campuses can quickly be overloaded with the number of students and faculty connecting their devices to the network. In an Educause 2022 Students and Technology Report, unstable internet connections were among the top technology challenges stated by college students, with 35 percent saying this issue caused them stress. With these quickly expanding needs, existing networks may struggle to meet the demand of increasingly mobile students and staff.</p>
<p>Among the institutions facing this challenge was Edge member, Fairleigh Dickinson University (FDU). Having a greater number of students and staff looking to connect to their network for both personal and educational use, FDU knew they had to revisit their current technology strategy and determine how to update the approach to address both present and future needs. “We wanted to enable our students and staff to use technology, collaborate with other universities, and utilize external services at higher data rates,” explains Michael Reekie, Director of Networking, FDU. “We also wished to alleviate any of the bottlenecks in our current environment that could potentially slow down the user experience.”</p>
<p>Fairleigh Dickinson University</p>
<p>As FDU began to explore solutions to better manage network traffic and plan for the future, they first looked at installing traffic shapers at the Internet edge. This bandwidth management technique can be very useful in decreasing congestion, however, the cost and maintenance of these devices can be expensive, especially as bandwidth increases. Instead, FDU chose to upgrade their connection to the Edge optical fiber network, EdgeNet, from 2x 10 Gbps to 2x 100 Gbps—making them the first institution in New Jersey to connect to EdgeNet at this advanced speed. “We found that increasing our bandwidth and installing faster Internet edge routers and firewalls would be a more cost-effective investment and could provide a better user experience for our students and faculty,” says Reekie.</p>
<p>“Along with updating our core, we also upgraded our wireless and Internet edge to meet the upcoming demands of the new wireless capabilities,” Reekie continues. “Making the jump to 2x 100 Gbps will help us meet our bandwidth requirements over the next several years, and with Edge as an existing partner, it was a very easy transition to upgrade our existing connections, while still allowing a highly available networking experience. Edge was able to provide bandwidth to us at a better cost and value than installing technologies that would shape the use of Internet traffic.”</p>
<p>With a focus on promoting student and faculty success and opening the door to more future-forward opportunities, Neal Sturm, Vice President and Chief Information Officer, FDU, says they are committed to providing a superior level of network accessibility and connectivity. “This recent upgrade has not only created a more cost-efficient operating model, but will also help enhance the educational experience and better accommodate incoming students as the University continues to grow in the coming years.”</p>

<p>Similarly to FDU, Rutgers University began to explore solutions for increasing their bandwidth capacity to better meet student and staff needs and improve the overall user experience. Over the past several years, Rutgers and Edge have been well partnered with network services and collocate in data centers located in Philadelphia and Newark. Edge also provides the University with their guest wireless network Internet service. As part of their traffic optimization strategy, Rutgers chose to receive internet services directly from Edge, and at the end of 2022, Rutgers became the second institution in New Jersey to connect to EdgeNet network services at an advanced speed of 100 Gbps.</p>
<p>Despite initial supply chain issues, Edge helped Rutgers secure the hardware for the upgrade and successfully completed the migration in less than four months. “Edge has been our trusted partner for over two decades,” shares Adrienne Esposito, Director of Network Operations and Architecture, Rutgers University. “It was an easy decision to move one of our commodity internet 100Gb links to Edge. The cutover was seamless, and the move resulted in annual savings.” Through this network enhancement, Rutgers not only benefits from a reliable peering infrastructure with reduced latency that optimizes network performance, but they can also leverage the peering connection to Internet2 and a direct connection to the AWS cloud infrastructure.</p>

		<p>Facilitating Connections</p>
<p>EdgeNet’s direct connection to AWS can help speed migrations to the Cloud, allow a smooth and efficient flow of research data, and deliver a secure transit of data connections. To minimize service disruptions, all traffic entering the Edge network is monitored and any issues are mitigated to ensure the EdgeNet core and all connected members remain protected.</p>
<p>The transition from a commodity internet provider to EdgeNet and the network’s advanced layer 3 service capability allow for member-to-member connectivity and will support institutions like FDU and Rutgers as they continue to grow and enhance their education and research initiatives. In addition to meeting the growing data and network demands of students and faculty, the need for high-speed research and collaboration continues to rise across the higher education community. Having a network that facilitates these national and global connections will be an essential factor in driving innovation and discovery forward and giving current and incoming students a superior educational experience.</p>

		<p>Helping to Advance Research, Education, and Economic Development</p>
<p>Dating back to 1997,&nbsp;NJEdge.net, Inc., commonly referred to as Edge, has had a mission to serve as a valued and trusted partner to its members through secure high-performance optical infrastructure, network services, technology solutions, and expert support, training, and industry insight. That original mission continues to drive Edge to this very day. Over the years, Edge has grown its member community to include institutions of higher education, K-12 school districts, libraries, state and local government agencies, and healthcare facilities. As a nonprofit member-based research and education network, Edge spans New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, and New York, and looks to empower organizations with the tools and services they need on their digital transformation journeys.</p>
<p>Enhancing Connectivity</p>
<p>Edge’s origin story begins in 1994 when the New Jersey President’s Council was established by statute with the mission of statewide planning for higher education including research on higher education issues. Later in 1997, the Higher Education Technology Infrastructure Fund was enacted, creating a capital bond initiative to help New Jersey colleges and universities develop the integrated technology infrastructure important to increasing their effectiveness and efficiency, educational opportunities, and workforce training. The law established a fund with the New Jersey Educational Facilities Authority to build that infrastructure both within and among institutions and to help enhance connectivity with libraries and elementary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>Within the same year, the Commission on Higher Education convened its technology task force looking to the new millennium and New Jersey’s plan for higher education. The task force was integral in developing the state’s $50 million higher education technology infrastructure fund, setting aside $5 million for interconnectivity. A total of $45 million was committed to enhance individual campus infrastructure and required a dollar-for-dollar match. The funds for interconnectivity also required a combined institutional match by the members and were targeted to support the creation of a single broadband network utility to support the collaborative efforts of colleges and universities in the state.</p>
<p>After the taskforce completed its work, a technology advisory committee was established to assist the Commission and President’s Council in developing a statewide network and governing structure.&nbsp; As part of that effort, the New Jersey President’s Council commissioned a study by consulting firm Walsh Lowe to explore the need for a statewide higher education network. The study revealed that there are many benefits to this network and that establishing connectivity could bring the state into parity with over thirty other states in establishing research and education networks and connecting higher education to the Internet and the national research and education network, Internet2.</p>
<p>Supporting a Collaborative Community</p>
<p>In 2000, the network government structure was established with the President’s Council executive board serving as the board of directors for this not-for-profit corporation named NJEdge.net. The consortium, NJEdge, was developed as part of the state plan for higher education to provide collaborative resources and networked information services to its members and affiliates in support of education, research and development, outreach and public service, and economic development throughout the state. In providing a statewide network infrastructure, NJEdge began to establish standards for interoperability, achieved economies of scale, and supported new and emerging technology that could enable inter institutional collaboration among its member community. Over the years, the leadership structure has changed, including adding a board of trustees to provide leadership and oversight to the organization. In 2015, an amendment to the statutes codified NJEdge as a lead agency or contracting unit for the purposes of procuring technology on behalf of the members. One of the original requirements for institutional participation in the technology infrastructure fund was the commitment to support NJEdge through network connectivity.</p>
<p>Looking to create a collaborative national research platform where institutions could access advanced computing resources, leading-edge technology, and research training and partnerships, NJEdge created the research as a service (RaaS) solution, EdgeDiscovery, in 2019. This technology-based research and discovery framework also aimed to help member institutions fulfill prerequisites to attracting grants from preeminent research funding entities. In particular, the platform aimed to help more institutions in the community gain access to data and research tools and help under-resourced organizations who would otherwise be unable to invest in next generation research infrastructure. Combining a NJEdge research network DMZ with an optimized technology stack residing on their backbone, EdgeDiscovery is outfitted with hardware and software components which enable researchers to streamline their research projects, schedule compute cycles, and access applications, analytics tools, and storage resources.</p>
<p>NJEdge, now known as Edge, celebrated 20 years in 2020 and currently supports 46 connected members in higher education and research, K-12 districts, healthcare, and municipal governments. Since the beginning, Edge’s strategy has been to create network connections that drive additional value, lower costs, and support an institution’s capabilities, while offering technology solutions that help advance research, education, and economic development.</p>
<p>Designing a High-Performance Network</p>
<p>To deliver an exceptional connectivity experience to its members, Edge created the optical fiber network, EdgeNet, a purpose-built solution specifically designed for higher education in New Jersey. EdgeNet was designed to support 100 percent of member demand, so unlike traditional Internet service providers (ISP), Edge never oversubscribes the network where one member’s traffic competes for bandwidth with another member. More specifically, 80 percent of Edge member’s external traffic is exchanged to be private peering relationships as opposed to traversing the unsecure and best effort public internet.&nbsp; Within this 80 percent, there is access to critical cloud services providers, such as Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google, and Apple.</p>
<p>Designed with redundant nodes and Internet transit providers distributed throughout the state of New Jersey, the network minimizes service interruptions by never relying on any one service provider; delivering a highly survivable, highly available networking experience to connected members. This original design, and all subsequent iterations, has been driven by member input and to help institutions be better equipped to meet their changing needs. Specifically, many institutions needed redundancy in both the network architecture and member connectivity to effectively meet the needs of their students, faculty, and staff. In recent years, esports peering was added to support member organizations as they build and expand world-class esports programs to attract and retain students interested in this field.</p>
<p>Along with celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2020, Edge also extended their backbone footprint into two new points of presence at Princeton University, with added path redundancy to enhance the redundancy to the network. In addition, Edge expanded their capability and capacity for research computing by creating a dedicated research network segment within EdgeNet. The foundation of this Internet2 GigaPOP created a research network that is physically and logically separated from the production network that members use to get to the Internet. As a major interconnection point with Internet2, members can connect with both national and international research assets. During this same year, a new feature was added to EdgeNet where members can access real-time network utilization reporting that shows an organization’s own network connections to the Edge network. This allows an institution to proactively monitor the network and troubleshoot any issues more efficiently.</p>

		<p>During the pandemic when remote work and learning became a necessity, Edge established local broadband peering with major residential providers to improve the student and employee experience. The most recently added cloud connectivity supports members’ needs for digital transformation by deploying cloud infrastructure and software as a service capabilities with major cloud providers. This addition allows members to leverage Edge connections to move data center services into the Cloud, access all major cloud providers without additional access costs, and benefit from a shared services model that helps to reduce expenses.</p>
<p>With network engineers who have decades of experience building wide area network solutions that support members’ needs, Edge continues to expand the features and capabilities that EdgeNet has offered to help institutions meet their evolving needs and step into the future with confidence.</p>
<p>Expanding Solutions and Services</p>
<p>To ease the burden of the procurement process and speed members’ time to implementation and innovation, Edge launched EdgeMarket in 2021. Delivering the latest technologies at an affordable price, EdgeMarket was designed to be a solutions and service “easy button” that gives members access to the latest technology solutions. The cooperative pricing system delivers consortium purchasing agreements and helps minimize the time and resources spent researching, analyzing, and procuring essential tools. With solutions designed to support an entire digital ecosystem, EdgeMarket allows members to take advantage of existing contracts and strategic partnerships to speed the procurement process and shorten the time to implementation for advanced technology solutions.</p>
<p>Throughout Edge’s evolution, the consortium has expanded to not only deliver optimum value to members through network connectivity and technology procurement, but also by meeting the growing needs of its member institutions in the areas of digital transformation, cybersecurity, educational and digital learning technologies, cloud computing, research community engagement, and professional managed services. Edge also hosts signature events, like its annual conference EdgeCon, to allow community thought leaders, industry partners, and solution providers to learn, connect, and problem solve together.</p>
<p>Enabling opportunities for collaboration and technology transformation have always remained at the heart of the Edge consortium, even as the challenges of the pandemic quickly shifted priorities for many member institutions. Amid a rapidly-changing landscape, Edge further broadened organizational capacity to assist institutions with technology solutions and services related to digital transformation and helped them continue to meet the needs of their students, faculty, and staff.</p>
<p>The world has greatly changed in the last several years, where digital learning and collaboration has solidified its position in our everyday lives and classrooms have evolved in many new and exciting directions. In 2022, many member institutions looked to Edge for instructional design support, digital transformation strategies, and subject matter expertise in the development of new courses and programs. By remaining in tune with members’ changing needs and objectives and staying on top of the latest technology trends, Edge will continue to expand its value proposition and help institutions to achieve their strategic goals and capitalize on the opportunities that arise in this digital era.</p>

<p>A Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Trust Anchor is a trusted entity within an SSI ecosystem that is responsible for issuing and verifying digital credentials. In other words, a Trust Anchor acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that only legitimate and verified credentials are added to an individual’s digital identity.</p>



<p>To become an SSI Trusted Provider, a company must meet certain criteria set by the SSI ecosystem in which it operates. These criteria may include demonstrating expertise in the technology and processes involved in issuing and verifying digital credentials, complying with relevant data privacy and security regulations, and demonstrating a commitment to ethical and transparent business practices.</p>



<p>Becoming an SSI Trust-Anchor can generate revenue for a company in several ways. Firstly, as a Trust Anchor, the company can charge fees for issuing and verifying digital credentials on behalf of individuals and organizations. These fees can be based on a per-credential or per-user basis, depending on the Trust Anchor’s business model. Secondly, being a Trust Anchor can create new business opportunities for the company, such as providing consulting or training services to other organizations looking to become Trust Anchors. Finally, being a Trust Anchor can enhance the company’s reputation and visibility within the SSI ecosystem, which can lead to new partnerships, collaborations, and revenue-generating opportunities.</p>







 SSI Trust anchor companies 



<p>It is challenging to provide an accurate analysis of the earnings of SSI Trust Anchor companies as they are relatively new and not yet widely adopted. Additionally, as the SSI market is still in its early stages, there are only a few companies currently offering SSI Trust Anchor services.</p>



<p>However, here are some companies that can be considered as competitors in the SSI Trust Anchor market:</p>



 
 Evernym: Evernym is a leading SSI company that offers a range of solutions, including Trust Anchor services. The company has partnerships with several organizations and governments, and its products are used in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and education.

<p>Guest blog by Mathieu Glaude</p>







<p>I had the good fortune of attending the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop 36</a> in Mountain View, California this week. This event has become a must-attend for me, as it always leaves me feeling both inspired and intellectually stimulated.</p>



<p>The conference brings together a diverse group of individuals working on various aspects of standards, technologies, business, legal, governance, and other facets required to improve how our digital identities are managed today. I feel fortunate to have been able to not only attend on behalf of Northern Block alongside my UX specialist colleague Ariane Bordeleau, but also to have had sponsor the conference alongside many great peers in the field (as you can see in the banner image above).</p>



<p>With over 150 different sessions held across three days, it’s impossible to attend them all, and sometimes tough decisions must be made when multiple interesting sessions coincide. While I can’t provide a comprehensive overview of everything that happened at the workshop, I wanted to share a summary from my perspective, focusing on the subjects that interest me the most:</p>



<p>So, here it is:</p>



 
 OpenID4VC has legs – OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC) has gained traction due to its pre-existing dependency on OAuth 2.0, which provides a sense of safety and security for this credential exchange protocol, primarily focused on personal identity. The majority of the corporate world has existing investments in systems that leverage OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, making it easier for them to use these protocols to adopt verifiable credentials for interacting with their customers and employees. OpenID4VC is a protocol to watch out for as it is agnostic to credential types, supporting various W3C credentials such as mobile driver’s licenses and more. It’s also been included in the EU’s wallet architecture reference framework as a must for credential issuers to use. If you’re interested in learning more about OpenID4VC, I recently recorded a podcast with one of the specification’s authors, which I believe you’ll find insightful. You can listen to it here: <a href="https://northernblock.io/open-id-4-vc-openid-for-verifiable-credentials/">https://northernblock.io/open-id-4-vc-openid-for-verifiable-credentials/</a>. On the Northern Block side, we have recently incorporated OpenID4VCI support into our AFJ mobile wallet, and we’re exploring how we can contribute towards the presentation side of the protocol. 
 



 
 Digital Trust in the Age of AI – During the second and third days of the event, there were multiple sessions discussing the intersection of AI and digital identity. One session that caught my attention was “Digital Trust in the Age of AI,” led by Wenjing Chu, co-chair of the Trust over IP’s <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=19657312">AI and Metaverse</a> Task Force and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">&nbsp;Trust Spanning Protocol</a> Task Force. The discussion highlighted the dilemma of content authentication, as voice, video, and biometric authentication are dead. A recent viral AI-generated song showcases how easy it is to now impersonate voices [<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ai-generated-drake-and-weeknd-song-yanked-from-streaming-after-umg-statement">https://www.thedailybeast.com/ai-generated-drake-and-weeknd-song-yanked-from-streaming-after-umg-statement</a>].&nbsp; If content authentication is dead, the challenge is now to determine whether the content comes from a trusted source. With the rise of AI-generated deep fakes and the potential for abuse of public identifiers such as email addresses and phone numbers, the need for private and specific identifiers for our different relationships is reinforced. The session also raised questions for me personally about whether AI might incentivize the privatization of data and hinder the open-source movement or protocol-client separation (example of Reddit here: [<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/reddit-will-start-charging-ai-models-learning-from-its-extremely-human-archives/">https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/reddit-will-start-charging-ai-models-learning-from-its-extremely-human-archives/</a>]). Large proprietary data owners could have new ways to monetize their datasets through AI systems, potentially leading to more closed platforms – the opposite of what we’re striving to achieve. It’s crucial to engage in conversations about AI’s rapid disruption and its impact on digital trust, as this will help us stay ahead of the curve. I plan to record a podcast with Wenjing on this topic soon, and I believe it will be an insightful discussion. 
 



 
 The SPAC Tradespace – During the three days of the event, Sam Smith led a series of sessions on Security, Privacy, Authenticity, and Confidentiality, highlighting the challenges in achieving all these simultaneously. These discussions are closely related to the ongoing work at the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force">Trust Over IP Foundation’s Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force.</a> The aim is to build a layer that enables trust tasks, such as credential exchanges, interactions with trust registries, and secure messaging, to occur between any two clients across the internet. To establish trusted connections, a trust layer is needed. In the world of Hyperledger, our version of this is the DIDComm protocol. However, DIDComm doesn’t encompass every element required as defined by the ToIP specs. These ongoing discussions are fascinating and essential, and Sam Smith’s sessions at the event contributed to advancing the dialogue on these critical issues. 
 



 
 Trust Registries are hot – There were numerous conversations surrounding trust registries. Building upon discussions from last fall’s IIW 35, the role of governance in establishing digital trust was a central theme. The trust registry space is witnessing significant activity and innovation. During the conference, I attended sessions that covered the <a href="https://identity.foundation/trust-establishment/">trust establishment specification</a> recently defined by DIF. There was also mention of the trust registry work happening at the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">Trust over IP Foundation’s Trust Registry Task Force</a>. Interesting conversations took place about how the Domain Name System (DNS) could facilitate the discovery of trust registries or even host them on DNS servers. Additionally, examples of hierarchical trust registries being implemented by organizations like the UN were discussed. A consensus on the best approach has yet to be reached – I also think there will be many valid implementations. Questions remain about using verifiable credentials to determine authority and the legitimacy of the credential issuer within a governance framework. At Northern Block, we are remaining abreast of all innovations happening in this space and have recently concluded a proof of concept alongside CIRA [<a href="https://www.loom.com/share/57db10ddc9f448bf8ff2fb7b10138283">https://www.loom.com/share/57db10ddc9f448bf8ff2fb7b10138283</a>]. Here are a couple other resources that you may find interesting: video demo of a UN Universal Postal Union use case we worked on: [<a href="https://youtu.be/8Lnx-PTzrK0">https://youtu.be/8Lnx-PTzrK0</a>], and a recent blog post: [<a href="https://northernblock.io/leveraging-dns-in-digital-trust-credential-exchanges-and-trust-registries/">https://northernblock.io/leveraging-dns-in-digital-trust-credential-exchanges-and-trust-registries/</a>] describing the work above I mentioned with CIRA. 
 



 
 Many KERI sessions – There were several discussions about KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) during the event, and one session I particularly enjoyed was “KERI for Dummies,” led by Timothy Ruff. The main objective of this session was to emphasize that KERI’s primary purpose is to ensure authenticity, rather than focusing on privacy or confidentiality. Authenticity in KERI centers on two main aspects: provenance and integrity. KERI allows for the authenticity of keys during rotations, maintaining the provenance and integrity of the keys. This enables continued authenticity between two endpoints interacting with each other, as they agree on a protocol to exchange keys instead of relying on a central place like a verifiable data registry.<br>&nbsp; 



 DNS for digital trust &amp; Creating a credential exchange protocol comparison matrix – During the event, I proposed two sessions. The first one, on the opening day, focused on using DNS for authenticating decentralized identifiers and discovering trust registries. You can find the link to the demo video showcasing our work and its integration into the Orbit enterprise during a credential assurance flow here (same link as above): [<a href="https://www.loom.com/share/57db10ddc9f448bf8ff2fb7b10138283">https://www.loom.com/share/57db10ddc9f448bf8ff2fb7b10138283</a>]. On the third day, I held a second session inspired by the credential profile comparison matrix created by some individuals over the past year, which is linked here: [<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z4cYfjbbE-rABcfC-xab8miocKLomivYMUFibOh9BVo/edit#gid=1590639334">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z4cYfjbbE-rABcfC-xab8miocKLomivYMUFibOh9BVo/edit#gid=1590639334</a>]. The goal was to explore the possibility of achieving similar outcomes with credential exchange protocols. This was a lively session and included a large group of people comparing credential exchange protocols such as Aries AIP 2.0, OpenID4VC, VC API, and ISO 18013-5. The session successfully kicked off the creation of a v1 table with criteria across both issuance and verification protocols. There was a consensus to continue working on this, as we believe it is an important exercise that will be valuable for implementers and decision-makers of digital identity systems. More on this to come!

<p>In the digital age, personal data has become one of the most valuable commodities. However, the traditional methods of managing digital identity have been fraught with challenges, such as data breaches, identity theft, and lack of privacy. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) offers a new approach to digital identity management, which gives individuals full control over their personal data. As such, it presents a unique business opportunity for companies that can provide a reliable and user-friendly SSI management solution. This essay explores the concept of SSI as a business opportunity and discusses some of the challenges and opportunities presented by this emerging trend.</p>



 What is Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)? 



<p>SSI is a decentralized and secure way of managing digital identity. In this approach, individuals control their digital identities and data, allowing them to share it with others securely. The concept of SSI is based on the principles of user-centricity, privacy, and security. It provides users with a private and secure digital identity that is not tied to any central authority or organization.</p>



<p>The traditional approach to digital identity management involves relying on third-party organizations, such as governments or social media platforms, to manage personal data. However, this approach has several drawbacks, such as lack of control, vulnerability to data breaches, and limited privacy. SSI offers a new way of managing digital identity, which gives individuals control over their data and the ability to share it securely.</p>



 Business Opportunities in SSI 



<p>The emergence of SSI presents several business opportunities for companies that can provide reliable and user-friendly SSI management solutions. The following are some of the potential business opportunities in SSI:</p>



 
 Identity Verification and Authentication 
 



<p>One of the main challenges of digital identity management is verifying and authenticating users’ identities. SSI provides a new way of verifying and authenticating user identities, which is more secure and reliable than traditional methods. Companies can offer identity verification and authentication services using SSI, which will enable them to create a secure and user-friendly identity management solution.</p>



 
 Data Storage and Management 
 



<p>SSI allows individuals to control their personal data and share it securely. Companies can offer data storage and management services using SSI, which will enable users to store and manage their personal data securely. This will create a new market for companies that can provide reliable and secure data storage and management solutions.</p>



 
 Digital Signatures 
 



<p>Digital signatures are becoming increasingly important in the digital age. SSI provides a secure way of creating and managing digital signatures, which is more reliable than traditional methods. Companies can offer digital signature services using SSI, which will enable users to sign documents securely and reliably.</p>



 
 Access Control 
 



<p>SSI allows individuals to control who has access to their personal data. Companies can offer access control services using SSI, which will enable users to control who has access to their personal data. This will create a new market for companies that can provide reliable and user-friendly access control solutions.</p>



<p>Challenges in SSI</p>



<p>While SSI presents several business opportunities, it also presents some challenges. The following are some of the challenges in SSI:</p>



 
 Lack of Standards 
 



<p>One of the main challenges of SSI is the lack of standards. Currently, there are no established standards for SSI, which makes it difficult to create interoperable and scalable solutions. This lack of standards also makes it difficult for companies to create reliable and user-friendly SSI management solutions.</p>



 
 User Adoption 
 



<p>Another challenge of SSI is user adoption. SSI is a new concept, and many users may not be familiar with it. As such, it may take some time for users to adopt SSI, which may slow down the growth of the market for SSI management solutions.</p>



 
 Technical Complexity 
 



<p>SSI is a technically complex concept, which may make it difficult for companies to create user-friendly solutions.</p>

 Energy Web’s IAM stack now supports SIWE authentication for all types of applications, enabling new use cases for developers. <p>At Energy Web we are strong believers that <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/identity-at-ew/self-sovereign-identity-introduction">self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a> is a key enabling technology for the global energy transition. Last year we took an initial step in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/unlocking-the-potential-of-self-sovereign-identity-for-enterprise-with-energy-web-switchboard-ab41499003a0">unlocking the potential for SSI within the energy sector</a> with the release of Switchboard, an enterprise identity and access management (IAM) solution.</p><p>Today we are pleased to announce the next step in our journey with the implementation of <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361#abstract">Sign In With Ethereum (SIWE)</a> in Energy Web’s IAM stack. SIWE is a <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/why-sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-2/">feature-rich, decentralized authentication mechanism</a> that enables users to log into any web application (not just blockchain-based dApps), set preferences, and manage sessions using their Ethereum address and private key instead of a username and password. Within the Energy Web ecosystem, SIWE offers another way to empower users with greater control over their digital identity and data while strengthening application security and improving user experiences.</p><p>SIWE is currently implemented in the <a href="https://switchboard-dev.energyweb.org/">Switchboard dev environment</a>, and will be released in <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/welcome">production Switchboard</a> in early May&nbsp;2023.</p><p>In this post we will explain why SIWE is being integrated into Switchboard, show how it works, and provide examples of use cases that SIWE unlocks for developers.</p> Why SIWE for&nbsp;EWC? <p>An application is only as useful as its ability to verify that users are who they claim to be (and thus grant access to the appropriate systems and accounts). As the sophistication, risks, and consequences of cyberattacks that exploit user credentials have increased, authentication mechanisms have evolved to augment or replace conventional passwords with more robust cryptographic signatures.</p><p>SIWE, which was originally <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361#abstract">proposed as a formal standard in 2021</a>, provides an <a href="https://docs.login.xyz/">open-source, standardized framework</a> to securely authenticate users with any web-based services using an existing Ethereum address and private key. Beyond simply enhancing security, SIWE also provides a much more feature-rich login experience by enabling users to set preferences, initiate and resume sessions across time, and log into multiple services with a single set of credentials — all of which are hallmarks of popular single-sign-on identity providers.</p><p>It has numerous benefits, including security and UX improvements, over other PKI based signatures, including:</p>  A standard human readable verifiable message to confirm signatures.  An EIP-standard message schema to incorporate all the information needed for a secure authentication.  Verification for domain and uri, this assures the authenticity of the requester / verifier. Users can validate the domain the transaction was initiated from and the URI to which the access would be provided to (redirection) upon signing for authentication / authorization.  Preventing replay attacks with a nonce, which could be a challenge from a server or a random&nbsp;token.  Sample SIWE&nbsp;Message<p>With all these benefits, SIWE was a logical upgrade for <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/unlocking-the-potential-of-self-sovereign-identity-for-enterprise-with-energy-web-switchboard-ab41499003a0">Energy Web’s Switchboard IAM solution</a>. Now any application using <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/welcome">Switchboard</a> (or the underlying <a href="https://github.com/energywebfoundation/passport-did-auth">passport-did-auth v2.0.0</a> repository) for authentication gets the benefits of SIWE. The diagram below explains how SIWE is currently implemented in Energy Web’s identity&nbsp;stack:</p> Lets see a quick demo to understand the&nbsp;flow <p>Note: The highlighted text from the first MetaMask pop-up for signing is the SIWE&nbsp;message.</p> How developers can use SIWE with Energy Web’s Solutions <p>SIWE offers a bridge to leverage Web3 authentication (i.e. signatures from Web3 wallets) in conventional Web2 applications and services. For application developers who want to offer users the option to login with an Energy Web account, SIWE now enables federated identity management via a single identity service that can be used across multiple services using OpenID Connect (OIDC) for user’s session management.</p><p>An example of implementing SIWE-OIDC is shown&nbsp;below:</p><p>Current scope for SIWE-OIDC</p><p>SpruceID has deployed an OpenID Connect Provider (OP) which has support for SIWE and is hosted under <a href="https://oidc.signinwithethereum.org/">https://oidc.signinwithethereum.org/</a>. This deployment is a DAO-governed OP supported by ENS DAO.To use the hosted OIDC server it is required to register the application as an OIDC client using the OIDC client registration of <a href="https://oidc.signinwithethereum.org/">https://oidc.signinwithethereum.org/</a>. Currently, no user interface for OIDC client registration is supported. For that reason, developers will need to use the REST&nbsp;API.</p>REST APIExample Response<p>A client can then be updated or deleted using the registration_client_uri with the registration_access_token as a Bearer token. The authentication could be similar to the following workflow:</p><p>Note: This flow is just a possible flow, it could be different for a different use case. In addition to the functionality already provided by SIWE, future extensions are possible such as support for Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials and support for EIP-712 (type structure data hashing and signing).</p><p>The Energy Web team regularly participates in open-source digital identity initiatives including the W3C Credentials Community Group and Open Wallet Foundation, and we’ll continue to support and adopt new features and frameworks as they become available.</p><p>About Energy&nbsp;Web</p><p>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>This article describes the benefits of the OpenID4VC standard and provides insight into its development and incubation within the IDunion project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://openid.net/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>&nbsp;(OpenID4VC) is a suite of standards for issuing and using digital credentials in online scenarios. IDunion has tested the suite and contributed to its evolution since 2021. Today, the standards have already found their way into products on a global scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June 2022, the OpenID Connect Working Group as part of the OpenID Foundation published a&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/06/OIDF-Whitepaper_OpenID-for-Verifiable-Credentials-V2_2022-06-23.pdf">whitepaper detailing the usage of verifiable credentials in combination with the OpenID Connect</a>&nbsp;communication protocol. In the document, the lead editors Kristina Yasuda, Torsten Lodderstedt, David Chadwick, Kenichi Nakamura and Jo Vercammen describe how trust will shift with increased control for end users, by putting them in the centre of the exchange between the verifier and the credential issuer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The whitepaper further describes what use cases OpenID4VC can be used for, such as employee onboarding, entitlement management, driver licences (mDL) or SMART health cards. The variety of scenarios illustrate the flexibility regarding the used credential standards as well as the issuer-verifier relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benefits of using the OpenID4VC specification family as a credential transport protocol:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Existing mass adoption of the OpenID Connect Standard with existing Single sign-on solutions (“Sign in with … ”)&nbsp; 



 Developers of decentralised identity applications benefit from the proven simplicity and security of OAuth and OpenID&nbsp; 



 Implementation flexibility of other components including identifier types, credential formats, revocation schemes, crypto suites, trust mechanism etc.&nbsp; 



 Incubation in a well known and recognized standardisation organisation.&nbsp; 
 







<p>The first time an implementation of the standard was demonstrated to the public was in 2021 when yes.com and Lissi did a prototypical implementation to enable a passwordless authentication to Nextcloud with verifiable credentials and demonstrated it at the European Cloud Identity Conference 2021. The implementation is based on Hyperledger Indy, using Anoncreds within the Lissi Wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, gematik’s Futurelab built a prototype based on Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python, which they extended to support Verifiable Presentation Exchange over HTTP and OpenID for Verifiable Presentations. The concept was presented to the public in April 2022 at the Internet Identity Workshop. Their proof of concept uses W3C Verifiable Credentials and allows for multi-format credential requests, ultimately making it easier for Relying Parties to ask for a credential without being aware of the format it was issued in. Further the concept demonstrated holder binding using a JWS.</p>



<p>Torsten Lodderstedt from yes.com and Kristina Yasuda from Microsoft&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2021/09/OIDF_OIDC4SSI-Update_Kristina-Yasuda-Torsten-Lodderstedt.pdf">presented a summary of the standard</a>&nbsp;at the same Internet Identity Workshop in April 2022. Videos of a demonstration of the user flow (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDg2ma7TwWU">on device</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3VQE-vMnQ">cross device</a>) are also available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The implementation was done as part of the IDunion Research Project. We are especially proud that OpenID for Verifiable Credentials has found its way into the A<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">rchitecture Reference Framework (ARF)</a>&nbsp;as part of the revision of the eIDAS regulation to create a European digital identity ecosystem. Currently the IDunion partners are developing the Tech-Stack 2.0 including OpenID4VC as communication protocol and SD-JWT as credential format to ensure alignment with the eIDAS Regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About IDunion</p>



<p>The IDunion research project builds an ecosystem for trusted identity credentials. The project is fostered by the Ministry of Economics Affairs and Climate Action of Germany and comprises more than 60 organisations. Recently a European Cooperative (IDunion SCE) has been founded as a governance entity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About yes.com</p>



<p>yes.com operates an Open Banking Ecosystem, where bank customers can use their identity data and login credentials with their financial institution to authenticate, identify themselves with 3rd parties, digitally sign with Qualified Electronic Signatures according to eIDAS and pay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>About gematik</p>



<p>Gematik is the German national agency for the digitalisation of the healthcare system. It develops the concept for the telematics infrastructure as an all-encompassing and secure data room, setting the standards for the use of this data room, and coordinating its reliable operation and establishment in line with market requirements.</p>

<p>Interoperability is crucial for developing efficient, sustainable, secure, and useful identity ecosystems. Identity interoperability is the ability to share identity standards, frameworks, or protocols between identity systems or models to allow computer systems or software to exchange and use identity information within and across organizational, regional, and national boundaries. Assurance frameworks in particular, like the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> (PCTF), help to establish an expected baseline and frame of reference for both public and private sector digital identity capabilities while prioritizing user-centered design, privacy, security, and convenience of use.</p>

<p>Despite exciting progress toward more secure and usable factors, the best MFA mechanism for consumers really isn’t MFA at all — it’s passkeys. Passkeys are a FIDO authenticator with the advantage of being backed up to the cloud, so if you lose your device or buy a new one, all you must do is sign into your iCloud or Google Play account to recover your passkeys. Passkeys use public key cryptography and device biometrics, making them resistant to many known attacks, and are easy for the user.</p>

<p>Toronto, April 20, 2023 – The Digital Identity &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) has released the results of its 2022 Digital Identity Perspectives Research. The study provides insight into Canadians’ attitudes and perceptions toward digital identity, privacy, and their adoption of digital wallets.</p>



<p>The research reveals a strong majority of Canadians believe they should be able to control the data about them held and issued by both governments and the private sector. In addition, while most respondents are concerned about protecting their privacy, they feel only somewhat knowledgeable about the subject, presenting an opportunity for education and awareness.</p>



<p>“The results of our Digital Identity Perspectives Research provide valuable insights into the attitudes and perceptions of Canadians towards personal data control and privacy,” said Joni Brennan, President of DIACC. “We are committed to working in partnership with the public and private sectors to secure, trusted, and privacy-enhancing digital benefits for all Canadians.”</p>



<p>One notable finding is that caregivers are among the most interested in the benefits and adoption of digital identity to meet their dependents’ caregiving needs related to school and health records for example. The study also revealed that most Canadians are concerned about their personal information being available online, with concerns about identity theft and senior scams at the forefront.</p>



<p>When creating a digital identity framework, most respondents feel that collaboration between the public and private sectors is the best approach, with a slight preference for the private sector. This sentiment has increased from 65% in 2021 to 71% in 2022.</p>



<p>Regarding digital wallets, familiarity with the concept continues to grow, with 59% of respondents being familiar in 2022, compared to 54% in 2021. In addition, the use of digital wallets is also increasing, with 41% of respondents using one in 2022 compared to 38% in 2021. Apple Wallet’s use has increased from 17% in 2021 to 24% in 2022.</p>



<p>Finally, the study found that 2/3 of Canadians feel that the COVID-19 pandemic has made secure, trusted, privacy-enhancing digital identity and verification solutions more critical to help Canadians who chose to use this technology, transact safely online, virtually unchanged from 2021.</p>



<p>“The PCTF offers a practical tool for meeting Canadians’ transparency and personal data control demands. The PCTF sets the basis for digital trust, clearly defining the duty of care people and partners should expect when utilizing digital verification solutions,” said Dave Nikolejsin, Chair of the DIACC Board.</p>



<p>“The public and private sectors have a unique opportunity to put the PCTF into action to help Canadians secure personal data control, reducing the threat of fraud while also promoting economic growth opportunities. A safe and secure data environment benefits everyone,” said Ibrahim Gedeon, Board Member of DIACC and Chief Technology Officer for TELUS.</p>



<p>About DIACC</p>



<p>DIACC (Digital Identity &amp; Authentication Council of Canada) is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the development and adoption of secure, trusted, and privacy-enhancing digital identity and access management solutions in Canada. DIACC works closely with the government, private sector, and academia to ensure Canadians access secure, convenient, and user-friendly digital identity solutions.

<p>Findynet Cooperative conducted an SSI technology survey to guide the selection of technologies for Findynet Test Network. Based on the conclusions drawn from this technology survey, the Findynet Cooperative will build its test network on Hyperledger Indy.</p>
<p>During March 2023, Findynet Cooperative conducted a survey on technologies supporting Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). We reached out to esteemed experts and thought leaders and asked them, what technologies they would use if they were to build an SSI ecosystem. In particular, we wanted to focus on tried and tested technologies that are usable right now.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted by an on-line questionnaire and follow-up meetings. We received 15 responses by the end of March.</p>
<p>The results are published in the report <a href="https://findy.fi/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Findynet-Test-Network-Technology-Survey-Results.pdf">Findynet Test Network Technology Survey Results</a>.</p>

<p>Other respondents wished to stay anonymous.</p>
<p>Based on the conclusions drawn from this technology survey, the Findynet Cooperative will build its test network on Hyperledger Indy. The test network will serve as a sandbox for our cooperative members and other stakeholders to test various wallet implementations and develop test use cases. &nbsp;We will announce the availability of our Test Network during H1 of 2023.</p>
<p>Later in 2023, we will select a technology stack for our pilot network. The technology choices for the pilot network will be more forward-looking and also aim to define the architecture for the production network. Pilot and production networks may be built on different technologies than the first version of the test network.</p>
<p>We continue to evaluate other standards, protocols, and technologies for the services we are planning to offer in addition to the current Test Network.</p>

<p>When Vishaal B. Bhuyan found himself with a seemingly insurmountable supply chain issue, he never expected his journey would lead to a revolutionary new approach to food safety. With the help of a synthetic biologist, they created traceable tags that not only allowed for better tracking&nbsp;but could also kill pathogens. But will this breakthrough technology be adopted?</p> <p>Vishaal B. Bhuyan, CEO of Aanika Biosciences, explains the importance of food safety, the potential that’s out there to enhance this safety, and more.</p> <p>Key takeaways:</p>    Food safety is not only important for people, but it’s vital for businesses. Vishaal says it’s important for companies to have insurance to cover incidents like this. In fact, a company he knows lost 30% of its top line revenue from this.   Aanika is creating cutting-edge technology to combat pathogens in food. They developed a probiotic microorganism that's been deactivated which contains a unique DNA sequence does things like addressing pathogen growth, killing pathogens, and many different secondary functions.   The value between biology and insurance is incredibly valuable. Aanika’s insurance program converts this thing that many people don't understand–but need–into a digestible narrative around cost savings.    <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p><a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1 US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>Connect with guest:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishaal-b-bhuyan-9053b0139/">Vishaal Bhuyan’s LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>If identity is the foundation of society, and the way in which we communicate shapes how our society operates, then I wonder how our society will change as our communication of identity changes?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some recent developments for identity communication are Decentralised Identifiers and Verificable Credentials (DID’s and VC’s), which make identity communication more efficient, accessible and effective (as most new technologies do). The use of DID’s and VC’s propose some new opportunities and challenges for us as an industry and a nation.</p>



<p>Earlier this month&nbsp;we had a great discussion about digital identity and what this means for Māori. And while we identified that Māori already have a long history of developed systems for communicating identity, there has been a need to develop new methods to communicate identity to different organisations and institutions for different purposes. Some examples of these being Tribal registries, Māori land court records, and Iwi or Hapū membership cards. This raises questions around whether Te Ao Māori will then adopt the use of DID’s and VC’s and how this technology could strengthen Māori identity and Tino Rangatiratanga.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also important for us as an industry and a nation to prepare for new identity issuers and credentials and ensure we avoid situations like this, where an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5419519">Indigenous grandfather and 12-year-old were handcuffed in front of a Vancouver bank after trying to open an account</a>.</p>

However, passwords are vulnerable to compromise through a variety of attack vectors.&nbsp;“Passwords are fundamentally flawed, because they can be hacked, forgotten, and stolen,” says Andrew Shikiar, executive director and chief marketing officer for the FIDO Alliance. “It’s also tough to enter passwords on keyboardless devices. Plus, more than 80% of data breaches can be tracked back to passwords.”</p>

<p>It’s nearly two decades since Bill Gates predicted the passing of the traditional username and password, warning that this archaic security combo simply wasn’t up to the task of keeping information safe and secure in the long term. Passwords will not be around forever and if we are ever to get serious about cyber security and <a href="https://www.comparethecloud.net/articles/the-value-of-colocation-data-centres-in-iot/">the protection of data</a>, we have to find another way. That’s one of the main reasons why passwordless authentication is gaining so much popularity as a more secure and convenient alternative to traditional passwords. And it seems the industry agrees. Tech giants Apple, Google, and Microsoft announced last May that they would support FIDO2 — authentication specifications based on public key cryptography and international standards — to enable passwordless authentication across devices.&nbsp;</p>

Especially digital ones. And it’s easy to remember! 3Ps: People. Process. Product*.</p><p>In practice, the 3Ps are a series of lenses we use with clients to ensure that we’re thinking through projects holistically. Below, we give an introduction on how to use it in practice.</p><p>*A note on the ordering — when we’re talking, we find it easier to say “People. Product. Process” rather than “People. Process. Product”, don’t you? But you can put them in any order, it’s up to&nbsp;you!</p> The Power of&nbsp;People <p>The foundation of any successful organisation is the people who are a part of it. When we talk about ‘People,’ we’re talking about the individuals who make up organisational teams, along with your stakeholders (such as your board), as well as the audience you serve. We also make sure to think about community members and volunteers who are furthering an organisation’s mission through their engagement. We place people at the heart of our approach to prioritise the building of meaningful relationships and also to promote diversity. After all, if we’re not working to strengthen connections and help people find purpose, what are we&nbsp;doing?</p><p>We find that people&nbsp;need:</p>  Common language — there are often too many buzzwords in business, so clear and effective communication ensures that everyone understands one another. Having a shared understanding of a problem or a solution starts with the language we use.&nbsp;Synergy!  Bias towards open — create a more inclusive and engaging environment by encouraging open communication and embracing diverse perspectives. That means not just letting your files languish in unshared folders and making sure people have an opportunity to engage with the&nbsp;work.  Established trust — improve decision-making by creating a positive working environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and supported. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">Nonviolent communication</a> strategies help here, even though the name is a bit&nbsp;weird.  <p>The anthropologist Margaret Mead is credited with&nbsp;saying:</p><blockquote>“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever&nbsp;has.”</blockquote><p>Behind every good project, initiative, and product are a group of talented people, working together. To harness the creativity and innovation of that group, we need to remember that they are humans with thoughts and feelings, as well as biases and complexities. Every group of people is different, so listening to the individuals you are working with and for is priority number&nbsp;one.</p> Streamlining Processes <p>By ‘Process,’ we mean the workflows and approaches that enable organisations to work effectively and sustainably. Efficient and well-structured processes play a crucial role in achieving an organisation’s strategic goals. It also leads to a more satisfying, productive, working environment.</p><p>We think that the following leads to better processes:</p>  Adaptability in teams — the world is always changing, so organisational processes should be flexible and adaptable enough to change with them, to respond to new opportunities and new people. Flexibility isn’t just for gymnasts.  Challenge assumptions — it’s important for us all to reassess our existing beliefs, assumptions, and practices so that we can identify areas for improvement and innovation. Just because you’re used to doing things one way doesn’t make it the best&nbsp;one.  Data driven decision making — while Gary from Marketing might have a great idea, what does the data say? Organisation should base decisions and strategies on objective data and evidence rather than relying on intuition or guesswork.  <p>A hugely important piece of developing effective processes is ensuring that they work for the people who will use them. More often than not, this includes documentation. Potentially boring? Yes. Skippable? No.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that you have to have rigid processes. In fact, adaptability is the key to all of this, and there should be an expectation that an organisation’s knowledge base is kept up-to-date by whoever used it&nbsp;last.</p> Embracing Innovative Products <p>The ‘Product’ component of our approach refers to the software platforms and tools we use and develop to support collaboration among internal and external stakeholders. You’re reading this on a screen thanks to several products. We use them all of the time, so it’s important to get the right&nbsp;ones.</p><p>The best products&nbsp;support:</p>  Iterative strategies — organisations have to evolve to keep pace with changing circumstances, so the tools you use should enable you to continuously improve processes and outcomes. If you feel like you’re having to fight your tools, then perhaps they’re no longer the best&nbsp;ones?  Distributed power / Autonomy — every tool has one or more ‘default’ ways of being used. So we should both use and make tools available that enable users to make decisions as independently as possible.  Learning by doing — the tools we use and develop should solve real-world problems rather than create new ones for users. I’m looking at you,&nbsp;Clippy.  <p>It should be fairly easy to find products that support processes that help people work well together. Sometimes, though, it involves taking multiple products and linking them together in new and interesting ways.</p><p>Although salespeople would like to tell you otherwise, there’s likely no ‘one platform to rule them all’, so we recommend making use of other techniques. You might like our <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop">Architecture of Participation</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/content-is-king-queen-and-everything-inbetween-3c2fc4b1e19c">System Ecosystem</a> tactics to help make sure your bases are&nbsp;covered.</p> Getting Started with this&nbsp;approach <p>If you want to use the ‘People, Product, Process’ approach within your organisation, consider the following steps:</p>  First, take a step back and have a good look at your organisation’s culture. Think about how you can improve things like people management, communication, and teamwork. This might involve taking your digital strategy out of the desk drawer. Or, indeed, writing&nbsp;one.  Next, check out your current processes and workflows. Find any points of friction and opportunities to make things smoother. A diagram might come in handy to visualise all the&nbsp;things.  Now it’s time to explore some tools and tech to help boost your team’s collaboration and productivity. Give them a test run and see which ones might work. Let other people try them&nbsp;out.  Following this, it’s all about crafting a plan to bring those changes and improvements to life. Make sure your team’s in the loop and excited about the process by being open and keeping them in the&nbsp;know.  Last but not least, keep an eye on how things are going with your new approach. Embrace the iterative mindset and tweak things as needed to keep things moving&nbsp;forward!   Conclusion <p>This approach provides a really simple but powerful series of lenses to unlock your digital strategy’s true potential. It’s designed to be a versatile approach, catering to organisations of all shapes and sizes. So, if you’re ready to embark on this transformative journey and could use some guidance, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">let us know</a>!

 We’re Skeptical of UN-sponsored Guidance for Content Regulation <p>Jessica Fjeld and Sol&nbsp;Bensadon</p><p>An arm of the United Nations has taken up the challenges of content moderation, aiming for a <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/02/1133827">September 2023 release</a> of guidelines to help countries regulate online platforms while protecting free expression. A great idea, in principle, but the devil is in the details — or in this case, the devil is in the implementation of vague language about “protecting democracy” that’s as likely to be weaponized against dissidents in some contexts as it is to curtail election misinformation in&nbsp;others.</p><p><a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/brief">UNESCO</a> was created in 1945 with the mission of contributing to peace and security by promoting “international cooperation in education, sciences, culture, communication and information” and “knowledge sharing and the free flow of ideas, to accelerate mutual understanding and a more perfect knowledge of each other’s lives”. As part of this mission, UNESCO is now engaging in consultations with multiple stakeholders with the objective of developing global guidelines for the regulation of digital platforms. UNESCO has already circulated two drafts and the <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000384031.locale=en">second one</a> of these was discussed at the <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/internet-conference?hub=71542">Internet for Trust conference</a> that took place last month. UNESCO has nearly 200 member states, representing a great diversity of cultures, ideas, and governance models. They also represent the full spectrum of internet freedom — both the lowest-ranked (China) and the highest-ranked (Iceland) countries in the most recent <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-net/scores?sort=asc&amp;order=Total%20Score%20and%20Status">Freedom House Freedom on the Net report</a> are&nbsp;members.</p><p>The law and jurisprudence around free expression are characterized by basic tensions, which can never be resolved, but are managed through the three-part test of legality, proportionality, and necessity. It’s not an area where bright lines can be easily drawn. Most basically in the context of content moderation, protections for free expression require both leaving content up (to allow a range of views) and taking content down (to ensure an environment that does not drive away marginalized folks).</p><p>This comes to a very fine point when we consider that the aim of the UNESCO guidance: “to support the development and implementation of regulatory processes that guarantee freedom of expression and access to information while dealing with content that is illegal and content that risks significant harm to democracy and the enjoyment of human rights.” These categories simply are not coherent across the range of UNESCO’s member states, and it’s not clear that there is one policy framework that could achieve them and accord with International Human Rights Law (“IHRL”).</p><p>There is a large risk that the guidance document will be misused by authoritarian states to legitimize existing arbitrary restrictions on freedom of expression and to justify new ones — and we’re not the <a href="https://ijclinic.law.uci.edu/2023/02/21/unesco-guidelines-for-regulating-digital-platforms-a-rough-critique/">only</a> <a href="https://www.article19.org/resources/unesco-digital-platform-regulation-guidelines-risks-free-speech/">ones</a> to make this point. Consider a few examples, all UNESCO member countries:</p>  In 2020, Nicaragua passed the “Special Cybercrimes Law,” prescribing imprisonment for whoever disseminated “fake news” online that risked “economic stability, public health, national sovereignty or law and order.” This regulation, also known as the “gag law,” was used as a tool to silence dissenters. The gag law was first applied in January 2022, after the government had already imprisoned dozens of opposition members based on their social media activity in the context of the November 2021 general election.  In Vietnam, internet content advocating for human rights and democracy is actively censored. In other words, content that promotes “democracy and the enjoyment of human rights” is illegal. Under the 2018 Cybersecurity law, intermediaries are forced to regulate content in cooperation with the state, preventing the sharing of information that opposes the republic, threatens national security and the social order, or defies national traditions, among other broadly worded provisions” and deleting information after government requests.  Finally, how the government of the Philippines has treated Maria Ressa — a keynote speaker at the UNESCO conference — further illustrates the use of the legal system and the spread of disinformation online to silence criticism. There were at least ten criminal cases filed against Maria Ressa, three of which were under the Cybercrime law, which has been criticized as threatening free&nbsp;speech.  <p>In authoritarian states, the coherence between national law and IHRL is extremely limited: the imposition of an IHRL-based framework to produce the result of limiting domestically illegal content may well distort that framework beyond recognition. The current UNESCO guidance does not give us any insight into the application of the proposed schema in contexts where the state itself is the preeminent actor in the repression of free expression. It is not enough to simply note that the application of the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (“ICCPR”) the guidance document does not impact the ICCPR’s enforceability in these states and is highly unlikely to make changes on the ground. Moreover, even so-called “advanced democracies” have adopted or are considering restrictions on internet speech that many digital rights advocates find troubling — the UK’s Online Harms Bill is a good&nbsp;example.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s a way to avoid the worst manipulations of UNESCO’s work: require procedural guarantees, which would ensure that they can’t be used to whitewash repressive laws. The current draft already includes some such elements, such as the opposition to hostage laws2 and upload filters3 and the support for broad media literacy investments from both states and companies. However, we think additional, well-tailored measures will be&nbsp;needed.</p><p>A guarantee of anonymity is an essential protection for individuals’ free expression, especially but not only in repressive contexts. As the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/thematic-reports/ahrc2932-report-encryption-anonymity-and-human-rights-framework">United Nations suggested</a>, anonymity provides individuals “with a zone of privacy online to hold opinions and exercise freedom of expression without arbitrary and unlawful interference or attacks.” In addition, the guidelines should include robust whistleblower protections, mandating states to ensure that government and private-sector whistleblowers are protected from any form of retaliation, and to create internal safe channels for employees to report concerns and potential harmful choices. This is essential, considering the important role that whistleblowers have in revealing biased enforcement of the law and general misuse of regulation to restrict freedom of expression.</p><p>Finally, under IHRL, restrictions on freedom of expression need to be sufficiently precise to enable individuals to regulate their conduct accordingly. Were any state to adopt the broad and overbroad language of the guidelines, it would lack precision, as it is not clear, outside of certain edge cases, what constitutes “content that risks significant harm to democracy.” Especially in the context of authoritarian or non-democratic states, regulations with vague and overbroad language can be used to censor dissidents.</p><p>Careful attention must be paid to the language of the procedural protections incorporated into the guidelines. A good illustration of this point is transparency requirements: the same processes for review of corporate policy and decision-making that can allow countries with relatively free information environments to promote free expression, can be used in less free environments to tighten an authoritarian hold. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/research/lumen">Berkman Klein’s Lumen Database</a> has shed light on the global climate of online expression, censorship, and rights enforcement for 20 years. Our Lumen colleagues have thought long and hard about designing transparency for the possibility of misuse and abuse, and have been consulted on the design of the <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/transparency-initiatives-in-the-dsa-an-exciting-step-forward-in-transparency-reporting">new database contemplated by the EU Digital Services&nbsp;Act</a>.</p><p>Sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information or materials that a state might seek to persecute groups or individuals, should still be considered for inclusion in a transparency data corpus, and made available for study, with increased security, oversight, and control. In more open contexts, this can be achieved with levels of restricted access, allowing only accredited researchers, who agree to be bound by relevant strictures, to see data that has a high risk of misuse. It would take some creative thinking to establish a data governance plan that would facilitate research where the state itself is part of the threat&nbsp;model.</p><p>If UNESCO is serious about protecting — and not further threatening — free expression in platform regulation around the world, the range of stakeholders who are invested in internet freedom that were represented at February’s convening was a step in the right direction, but not a destination in itself. Between now and the guidelines’ launch, the organization should have a laser focus on the thorny challenges of defining procedural protections that will be effective even in the least protective regulatory environments.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/one-law-to-rule-them-all-705e8c776e38">One Law to Rule Them All</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Since the launch of Hyperledger Indy, a DLT purpose-built for decentralized identity, in 2017, Hyperledger Foundation has been a proud sponsor, attendee and contributor to the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/about/">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) community</a>. We continue that commitment in 2023 and welcome new and existing Hyperledger community members to join us at IIW. Not only is it a good event with great people, but it is an event/space/community where the work is getting done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“IIW is not the place where CEOs gather to spread their feathers and show off. That’s one reason it’s the most leveraged conference in the world. Actual work happens at IIW, and all of that work is toward starting and moving projects forward. It’s where fully constructive people and organizations such as Hyperledger Foundation come to roll up sleeves and get together with participants old and new, to make new connections and leave knowing more, doing more and working faster on stuff that matters.” — Kaliya Hamlin, Doc Searls and Phil Windley, IIW Organizers</p>



<p>Identity, privacy, anonymity and agency have been intrinsic concepts for the blockchain and decentralized technology ecosystem since the beginning. Even before Satoshi’s whitepaper was released, the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) was a twice-yearly “gathering of the clans” for the identity space. It has a long tradition of being where connections are made, projects are presented, code is shared, (vigorous) debate occurs, and people of varied and diverse skill sets who are passionate about these topics work to bring these solutions to life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hyperledger Foundation’s presence at IIW means that the projects that we believe are central to advancing decentralized identity — Hyperledger AnonCreds, Hyperledger Aries, and Hyperledger Indy — have the presence they need to receive the attention they deserve from the community. As Indicio relies on these Hyperledger projects we, as a longstanding attendee of IIW, are grateful for Hyperledger’s presence and support.” — Sam Curren, Senior Architect and Deputy CTO, Indicio</p>



<p>Hyperledger Foundation is a sponsor of IIW because it is a rallying point for the decentralized identity community, including those contributing to Hyperledger and other LF Identity projects as well as standards and technologies such as W3C Verifiable Credentials and DIF. We look forward to attending for a number of reasons, including:</p>



  Potential users of and prospective contributors to Hyperledger projects are at IIW, and we want to meet them.&nbsp;  Stephen Curran and Timo Glastra, new members of the Hyperledger Technical Oversight Committee, will be there talking about Hyperledger technologies and community.&nbsp;  Contributors and maintainers working on Hyperledger identity projects like Hyperledger Indy, Aries, Ursa and now Anoncreds are there to gather, share, hear feedback and work. This list includes Char Howland, Sam Curren, Berend Sliedrecht, and many others.&nbsp;  For the Linux Foundation, IIW is an open forum where other LF Digital Trust initiatives like Open Wallet Foundation, Decentralized Identity Foundation and Trust Over IP can cross-pollinate ideas, get direct feedback from the community, find consensus on direction and build relationships.&nbsp;  IIW is where members of the ecosystem gets to roll up their sleeves. One great example of this is the <a href="https://hackmd.io/@_NzO6WTHQNqQ7DdYbcc2RQ/rk3-9q713">DIDComm Connect-a-thon</a>.  The most engaged and vocal thinkers and doers in the identity space are at IIW, and it is a critical opportunity for the team to collaborate with them in person, gather their insights and work that feedback back into our community.  



<p>Hyperledger Foundation’s sponsorship of IIW takes different forms for every event, but we as a team feel supporting this community is critical to the identity ecosystem in general and Hyperledger identity projects. We are thrilled to fund the incredible work that goes into putting on each IIW, the community that emerges and the work that results.</p>



<p>Please join us April 18, 19 and 20 for IIW #36. Hyperledger community members save 20% using this <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-iiwxxxvi-36-2023a-tickets-505685758717?discount=HL_XXXVI_20">link</a>.</p>

<p>The mission of the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation is to define a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust that combines cryptographic assurance at the machine layer with human accountability at the business, legal, and social layers. Part of that mission is to define generally accepted requirements for standard roles that play a critical part in accountability in digital trust.</p>



<p>Today our Governance Stack Working Group is forming a task force to define standard requirements for issuers of verifiable credentials. While many schemes in the US, UK and Canada have focused on elements of identity credential issue and use, this will be the first effort to define what are standard requirements expected of issuers of verifiable credential to ensure that their processes are transparent, consistent and meeting the needs of relying parties and ecosystem owners.</p>



<p>While we have a core team of spirited technologists and governance architects assembled, we need more voices from the verifiable credentials community to broaden our perspectives and solidify our expected deliverables. This task force could produce artifacts that have global implications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need your voice!</p>



<p>Meetings plan to start on Wednesday April 12 at 7:00am PT/10:00am ET.</p>



<p>In order to actively participate, you need to be a member of the Trust Over IP Foundation and a member of the Governance Stack Working Group.</p>

Additionally, we have undertaken numerous marketing initiatives and garnered significant media coverage throughout the year. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of all these achievements and highlights the substantial growth of our ecosystem. Notably, we have updated our <a href="https://twitter.com/DrevZiga/status/1561700574176989184">ecosystem map</a> reflecting the significant expansion of our ecosystem. Through this report, we invite the OriginTrail community and everyone interested to join us on a journey of exploration and discovery, as we delve into the various accomplishments of the OriginTrail ecosystem in the past&nbsp;year.</p> Decentralized Knowledge Graph adoption&nbsp;update  BSI solutions <p>In early 2022, Trace Labs gained recognition in <a href="https://twitter.com/TraceLabsHQ/status/1479087011835297798">Interface Magazine</a> for its partnership with BSI and the innovative solutions that the team is currently developing. These include <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/global-trade-and-customs-usa">SCAN</a>, designed to secure security audits for more than 21,000 factories in South-East Asia, <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/personal-credentials-and-identity-solutions">Training Certificates</a> solution, <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/pharmaceutical-supply-chains">AidTrust</a> for donated medicines, and several other notable projects.</p><p>Since its inception in 2021 <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/pharmaceutical-supply-chains">AidTrust</a>, the solution co-developed by BSI and Trace Labs, has been bringing transparency and trust to pharmaceutical supply chains. AidTrust utilizes the power of OriginTrail DKG, which transforms data related to events, locations, vaccines and more into verifiable and discoverable Web3 assets. To gain wider awareness, BSI’s Courtney Soulsby and OriginTrail’s Ziga Drev presented the AidTrust milestones and work behind the scenes at the WEF Davos adjacent conference held by Polkadot. While we were approaching the DKG V6 launch, we reached <a href="https://twitter.com/TraceLabsHQ/status/1564272803431464960">an important milestone</a> of 4000+ vials dispensed to patients in India and 25 locations active there, with the rollout to additional 40 countries. With the V6 release in December last year we started migrating AidTrust to the new network allowing the AidTrust data to become verifiable, discoverable and composable Knowledge Assets on the OriginTrail DKG. Learn more <a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/blog/healthcare-blog/building-transparency-into-pharmaceutical-supply-chains/">in this article</a> published on BSI’s blog on how AidTrust is building transparency into pharmaceutical supply chains with discoverable and verifiable Web3 assets, secured on the OriginTrail DKG. More information on the solution is available also&nbsp;<a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/pharmaceutical-supply-chains">here</a>.</p> Trace Labs - core OriginTrail team *Hiring now* on Twitter: "AidTrust uses @origin_trail #DKG v6 to transform data on donated pharma products into #Web3 assets.

After receiving an upgrade of auditors being able to verify that they have an up-to-date level of SCAN audit training in 2021, last year we observed the growing number of audit assets being secured on the OriginTrail DKG. Last summer it went up from 30K to 35K in only 3 months. As all other solutions, SCAN will be also migrated to V6 with its release in December, where the numbers of audits assets will have new capabilities.</p><p>Trace Labs and BSI joined the Innovate UK consortium to work on the <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/uk-customs">Trusted Bytes project</a> to develop new digital solutions for the food and trade industry utilizing the OriginTrail DKG. In 2022, the project reached its second year of maturity, as BSI and Trace Labs worked closely with the consortium to develop cutting-edge solutions aimed at improving supply chain transparency and security. This partnership has resulted in significant advancements in the food and trade industry, paving the way for a more secure and sustainable future for businesses and consumers alike. In September 2022 BSI published <a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2022/june/one-year-on-since-bsi-and-trace-labs-joined-the-innovate-uk-consortium-to-develop-new-digital-solutions-for-the-food-and-trade-industry/">a blog post</a> showcasing how OriginTrail DKG is used to facilitate international trade of goods crossing borders and digitize UK’s fresh produce supply&nbsp;chains.</p><p>In 2022, Trace Labs and BSI continued to make significant progress with the <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/personal-credentials-and-identity-solutions">Training Certificates</a> solution, which uses OriginTrail technology to transform BSI training certificates into Web3 assets secured on the DKG.Trace Labs announced in March 2022 that 12.5K certificates had already been secured on the OriginTrail DKG, and by September, the number had increased to 30K certificates. Towards the end of 2022, Trace Labs announced that the solution would be migrating to DKG v6 and would be empowering over 200k individuals annually by issuing their certificates as Web3 assets on the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>Trace Labs and BSI continued their collaboration with <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/sustainable-brands">Church of Oak</a> in 2022, building upon the progress made in 2021 with the completion of the immersive experience application and collection of farm data as part of the NGI Atlantic data marketplace project. The distilling process began in 2022 after the construction of the distillery in Monasterevin was finalized in 2021, with OriginTrail DKG serving as the backbone for ensuring trust and transparency for each bottle of whiskey, from grain to&nbsp;glass.</p><p>The supporter for all these solutions is the new version of nOS launched at the end of 2022, that allows siloed and poorly interoperable data be transformed into real world knowledge assets on the OriginTrail V6 network, where assets are made discoverable and verifiable. Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY7JRYD2AIs&amp;t=3498s">nOS demo</a> that was presented by the Trace Labs team as part of the DKG V6 launch&nbsp;event.</p> GS1 <p>In 2021, Trace Labs continued its engagement in the GS1 EPCIS and CBV 2.0 working group, contributing to the development and validation of the new supply chain event visibility standard. As predicted, the EPCIS 2.0 standard was finalized and officially released. In Q1 2022, Trace Labs deployed the first OriginTrail DKG solutions utilizing EPCIS 2.0, delivering enhanced supply chain transparency and traceability for&nbsp;clients.</p><p>Trace Labs has since partnered with several other organizations to implement the new GS1 standard. For example, Swiss Railways SBB worked with Trace Labs to improve the DKG-based GS1 EPCIS repository initiative. The initiative was enhanced with increased interoperability, additional features, and onboarding of more suppliers to drive network effects. <a href="https://twitter.com/DrevZiga/status/1545376668755394560">The team deployed the AidTrust solution</a>, which applies GS1 EPCIS 2.0 in the pharmaceutical industry to capture events along the supply chain of donated medicine, ultimately ensuring that donated products reach their intended patients as well as Trusted Bytes to apply GS1 EPCIS 2.0 for facilitating international trade by providing UK Customs with shipment risk profiles.</p> Trace Labs - core OriginTrail team *Hiring now* on Twitter: "Enterprise solutions of @TraceLabsHQ combine the power of @origin_trail #DKG &amp; global data standards. @gs1 #EPCIS standard is used to enable event-based supply chain visibility &amp; our solutions are one of the first to employ the latest EPCIS 2.0 standard in production setting!1/3 / Twitter" <p>Enterprise solutions of @TraceLabsHQ combine the power of @origin_trail #DKG &amp; global data standards. @gs1 #EPCIS standard is used to enable event-based supply chain visibility &amp; our solutions are one of the first to employ the latest EPCIS 2.0 standard in production setting!1/3</p><p>Trace Labs also added support for RDF/SPARQL and other semantic technologies in OriginTrail V6, further increasing the capabilities and flexibility of its technological stack for builders seeking standardized, open-source tools. This integration with GS1 standards allows for even more powerful data integration, standardization, and interoperability.</p><p>Trace Labs’ General Manager, Jurij Skornik, and BSI’s Global Healthcare Director, Courtney Soulsby, attended the <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/gs1-healthcare-conference-paris-was-more-than-just-croissants-89ad2b7fedd9">GS1 Healthcare Conference</a> where they discussed how Web3 technology and OriginTrail DKG-based solutions can be leveraged to address humanity’s biggest challenges, with even more power after the V6&nbsp;release.</p> TheFSM <p>In 2022, <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/eu-food-safety-compliance">TheFSM project</a> entered its final year. Trace Labs’ impact on TheFSM platform was of great significance at this stage. The implementation of blockchain services was performed in a blockchain neutral approach, enabling utilization of different blockchains, and has been successfully tested in different environments. Trace Labs participated at several international events presenting and promoting the project. The team attended one of the largest <a href="https://twitter.com/TraceLabsHQ/status/1562795689729351683">Internal fair of agriculture and food</a> in Central Europe whose exhibitors come from more than 30 different countries. Among others, the company organized a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PX9FoULdo0">webinar</a> at the beginning of the year, where founder and CTO Branimir Rakic presented how DKG works and its role in the TheFSM marketplace. This webinar enabled us to bring OriginTrail technology closer to the wider audience interested in the agri-tech sector, especially the food safety&nbsp;experts.</p><p>In October, TheFSM consortium held a plenary meeting in Athens, where Branimi Rakic presented the next and final steps of project implementation. As the project draws to a close in Jan 2023, many activities have intensified, especially in the final quarter of the year. Just before the completion of the project, the results of the mission to transform the European food certification market with the power of big data and the support of blockchain technology are very satisfactory.</p> Trace Labs - core OriginTrail team *Hiring now* on Twitter: "Last week @TheFSMeu🇪🇺consortium partners held a successful meeting where they discussed the next steps of project implementation. @BranaRakic showcased how will @origin_trail #DKG v6 transform #agri industry &amp; boost food certification.More👉https://t.co/v6AbJBdyqK#Data2Assets pic.twitter.com/L5bb7Vv3Em / Twitter" <p>Last week @TheFSMeu🇪🇺consortium partners held a successful meeting where they discussed the next steps of project implementation. @BranaRakic showcased how will @origin_trail #DKG v6 transform #agri industry &amp; boost food certification.More👉https://t.co/v6AbJBdyqK#Data2Assets pic.twitter.com/L5bb7Vv3Em</p> OriginTrail DKG: Decentralized and Scalable Knowledge Graph Economy Tools Supporting the “Trusted, traceable and transparent ontological knowledge on blockchain — ONTOCHAIN” <p>In 2022, OriginTrail DKG played a crucial role in <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/knowledge-economy">the ONTOCHAIN project</a>, which is funded by the European Union’s Next Generation Internet initiative. As part of the project, DKG-based Knowledge Economy tools were developed and integrated into the ONTOCHAIN technology stack, allowing for the creation and exchange of trustworthy, transparent, and traceable ontological knowledge. Trace Labs worked alongside other innovative developers, contributing to the ONTOCHAIN distributed storage, core protocols, and application protocols stack. During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/19bM8WoTKZo?feature=share&amp;t=236">the ONTOCHAIN Summit</a> held In June 2022 in Berlin, OriginTrail’s CTO Branimir Rakic showcased the Knowledge Tools to the ONTOCHAIN partners and community, and highlighted their capabilities and how they enable the creation and exchange of reliable, transparent and traceable ontological knowledge in a decentralized manner. As the ONTOCHAIN project ended last year, the <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1545000019035672576">capabilities of the OriginTrail DKG continue to be valuable for new ONTOCHAIN participants</a>, enabling them to leverage the platform to transition towards a proven, trusted, semantic, human-centric, and privacy-by-design knowledge economy.</p> OriginTrail on Twitter: "[SNEAK PEEK] @origin_trail core team just completed an important milestone towards the knowledge economy, as the @ONTOCHAIN - supported knowledge tools development reaches completion and are ready for #v6 integration.

An <a href="https://h2020-demeter.eu/trust-and-transparency-of-data-in-the-agri-food-supply-chain-with-origintrail/">article on trust and transparency of data in the agri-food supply chain</a> was published, which explains how OriginTrail contributes to reshaping and building a more interoperable, data-driven, innovative, and sustainable European agri-food sector. Together with DunavNET, Trace Labs participated at <a href="https://twitter.com/TraceLabsHQ/status/1574787881092235265">Synergy Days</a>, which was held during the SmartAgriHubs final event in Lisbon in early autumn 2022. As a proud employer of women, Trace Labs was invited to deliver a <a href="https://twitter.com/TraceLabsHQ/status/1575052109271437314">workshop</a>, which addressed gender inequality in the agro&nbsp;sector.</p> Ekopakt <p>In 2022, Trace Labs achieved a significant milestone by successfully establishing a traceability model for organic beef in Slovenia as part of the EU-funded <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/sustainable-agriculture">EKOPAKT project</a>. The project’s primary focus was on developing a traceability framework that utilized the OriginTrail DKG for reliable data exchange and data integrity. In August 2022, the Trace Labs team presented a <a href="https://twitter.com/TraceLabsHQ/status/1560167435227086849">Provenance tool at the AGRA fair,</a> demonstrating how data can be transformed into discoverable, verifiable, and valuable Knowledge Assets on the OriginTrail DKG. The Provenance tool and traceability model built on top of the OriginTrail DKG were presented at the <a href="https://twitter.com/TraceLabsHQ/status/1595024764095328257">final project conference</a>, marking the culmination of the project activities. The successful integration of the Provenance tool with the OriginTrail DKG was met with interest and appreciation from attendees, highlighting the project’s impact and&nbsp;success.</p> Buildchain <p>In 2022, Trace Labs joined the <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/european-union-supports-sustainability-of-construction-industry-with-the-buildchain-project-fcd8253b74ed">EU-funded BUILDCHAIN project,</a> which seeks to enhance efficiency, transparency, and trust within the construction industry and create a more sustainable built environment across the European Union. To achieve these goals, the project will utilize the capabilities of the OriginTrail DKG to develop new solutions for trusted data exchange and transparency. As part of the BUILDCHAIN project, Trace Labs will integrate the OriginTrail DKG with the EU Digital Building LogBook system. This integration will create a tamper-proof and decentralized knowledge base, promoting transparency and ensuring data integrity across the construction industry. By leveraging the DKG’s capabilities, Trace Labs aims to promote trust, transparency, efficiency, and sustainability in the construction domain and make a positive impact on the built environment.</p> Technology development <p>In 2022, we witnessed significant milestones in terms of technological development, including the deployment of the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot and the release of the latest version of the DKG network, V6. Please read on for further&nbsp;details.</p> Decentralized Knowledge Graph&nbsp;updates <p>In 2022, the OriginTrail network underwent significant advancements with the launch of the DKG V6 — a vastly more performant and versatile next generation Internet engine that ushered in a new knowledge economy&nbsp;era.</p><p>The launch of V6 was <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/launching-the-origintrail-v6-stages-explained-3997797d44c0">divided into three stages</a>. The first stage involved the deployment of the V6 testnet, where developers could test and refine the new version before it was ready for public release. This stage was crucial in ensuring that V6 was stable and reliable before it was released to the broader&nbsp;network.</p><p>The second stage of the launch involved the release of the DKG V6 on the OriginTrail Parachain, where it was feature-locked and ready for full-scale deployment. This stage marked a significant milestone for the network, as it marked the completion of the development process and readiness of V6 for deployment. During this stage, V6 was feature-complete and ready for mass adoption by users and businesses.</p><p>Finally, the third and final stage involved the migration of the entire network to V6. This stage was carefully planned and executed to ensure a smooth transition from the old version to the new version. The migration process was designed to minimize any disruptions to the network’s operations and ensure that users could continue to access the network without any&nbsp;issues.</p><p>In July 2022, the OriginTrail team announced the completion of the second stage of the V6 launch. The new version had several key features, including an improved consensus mechanism that helped increase the network’s security and scalability. Additionally, the new smart contract layer allowed for more complex data processing and analysis, while the implementation of a decentralized identifier (DID) system enabled secure and verifiable data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>The launch of the DKG V6 led to significant growth and adoption of the OriginTrail network. The enhanced security and scalability features of V6 made it more attractive to individuals and businesses. The addition of the smart contract layer and DID system opened up new possibilities for data processing and analysis, allowing businesses to derive insights and value from their&nbsp;data.</p><p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1603766981416689664">successful launch event marked the release of the DKG V6</a> at the end of the year. At the event the team touched upon the global economy and trust challenges, and looked at how trusted knowledge will be grown within the OriginTrail ecosystem. At the event the team launched the newest version by creating the first asset on it and demonstrated the application of real world Knowledge Assets using the brand new Network Operating System (nOS) by igniting the creation of the first 40K Knowledge Assets on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Overall, the launch of the OriginTrail V6 was a significant milestone for the network. As the network continues to grow and evolve, it is expected that the V6 will play a crucial role in its ongoing success and development.</p> Polkadot integration updates <p>In 2022, the DKG-tailored blockchain, OriginTrail Parachian was launched. For this to happen, the team first released a new, <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1512523128387350534">comprehensive whitepaper</a> covering advancements to the OriginTrail ecosystem, specifically, those introduced by the OriginTrail Parachain. With the OriginTrail Parachain as a layer 1 network coming to life, the team also introduced a native OriginTrail Parachain token (OTP) — a utility asset that is not only used for blockchain gas fees and inclusive governance, but also enables a way to incentivise the growth of DKG&nbsp;usage.</p><p>To aid with contributions for the OriginTrail Parachain crowdloan, support was opened on platforms including Parallel, Bifrost, and Kraken. To support the success of the OriginTrail Parachain and the growth of the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph, it was announced that OTP (OriginTrail Parachain tokens) would be <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain/status/1526244450661326849">distributed to community members</a>. The distribution to both <a href="https://twitter.com/OriginTrailDev/status/1556679202409271296">v5 node runners</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain/status/1584910942470537216">TRAC token holders</a> was successfully completed.</p><p>The OriginTrail Parachain was officially confirmed as the winner of Polkadot’s 17th parachain auction on May 18th, 2022 and in early June OriginTrail successfully launched with its first genesis block being validated. This marked the beginning of a new era where AI-grade Knowledge Assets can be brought to Polkadot, and other Polkadot parachains can integrate the OriginTrail DKG with their blockchain networks.</p><p>A few months after the launch, Security Research Labs started executing their automated static and dynamic testing suite for the OriginTrail Parachain in an attempt to identify vulnerabilities with the implementation and we were happy to report that they completed the security review of the OriginTrail Parachain with no issues discovered. The number of blocks on the OriginTrail Parachain started growing fast and the year concluded with 1.4M blocks being validated.</p><p>In order to transfer TRAC tokens from the Ethereum blockchain to the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot, a “one-way Teleport” system was implemented, which was described in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-12-v2-teleporting-trac-to-the-origintrail-parachain-on-polkadot-de535a9d2693">RFC-12</a> with 15 teleport batches set in place. At the end of 2022 10th teleport batch was completed.</p><p>After the RFC-12, also the <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-13-trac-token-deployment-on-polkadot-c709347583cc">RFC-13</a> was published discussing the proposed implementation of the TRAC token on the OriginTrail Parachain, a move that could provide significant benefits to the OriginTrail ecosystem. This implementation would result in a number of important improvements, including enhanced security, reduced transaction fees, and improved scalability. In addition, the implementation would enable OriginTrail to take advantage of Polkadot’s cross-chain interoperability, allowing for seamless interaction with other blockchain networks.</p> Key ODN adoption&nbsp;metrics <p>Exciting developments took place in the OriginTrail Ecosystem during 2022, leading up to the highly anticipated release of the OriginTrail V6 at the end of the year, first implemented on the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot. OriginTrail V6 is a major upgrade to the way the DKG functions, introducing new primitives such as Knowledge Assets and UALs, and runs as a separate network alongside OriginTrail V5.</p><p>This requires a rethinking of how network activity and adoption are measured. Starting with 2023, some of the existing metrics will be retired and replaced with more relevant ones focusing on the OriginTrail V6, for example the number of Knowledge Assets on the OriginTrail DKG. As a result, the current metrics show a slowdown in activity on the OriginTrail V5 in the second half of 2022, as network activity transitions to the more powerful OriginTrail V6.</p> Total graph size&nbsp;(TGS) <p>Total Graph Size (TGS) is a fundamental metric developed to assess the expansion of the OriginTrail Decentralized Network. It quantifies the volume of knowledge accommodated by the Decentralized Knowledge Graph by integrating two crucial elements of a knowledge graph: data objects and their interconnections. In more precise terms, it combines the aggregate number of graph vertices (alternatively termed as graph cardinality or the order of the graph) and the complete number of graph edges (known in graph theory as graph size) of a decentralized graph. The term vertices encompass all the distinct objects appended to the graph (e.g., identifiers or specific details of supply chain events, products, attestations, locations, and certificates), while edges signify the connections among these&nbsp;objects.</p><p>In 2022 we observed a steep growth in TGS, with an increase from 116 million to over 248 million TGS mark. TGS is one of the metrics that remains relevant as we fully transition to OriginTrail V6, and we expect to see accelerated growth due to the enhancement in network efficiencies and expanded usability of the technology in a variety of industries.</p> Other metrics — New publishings on the&nbsp;DKG <p>The number of publishings on the V5 network experienced a decline during the latter part of 2022 as network activity transitions to the new and vastly more powerful OriginTrail V6. This metric will be retired starting 2023 and replaced by a more relevant one to measure activity on the OriginTrail V6.</p> Other metrics — TRAC&nbsp;Staked <p>Due to the OriginTrail V6 release and related winding down in activity on the V5 network, there was a decrease in total TRAC staked in 2022, starting the year at 11.42 million and ending at 4.04 million. However, with 100 million TRAC teleported to the OriginTrail Parachain and ready to power the V6 network with millions of Knowledge Assets, as well as the upcoming V6 staking capabilities, we expect this metric to increase significantly going&nbsp;forward.</p> Marketing &amp; communications  DKG version&nbsp;6 <p>The year began with the launch of stage 1 of the version 6 Decentralized Knowledge Graph Beta. Notably, V6 represents the biggest advancement to the network since its inception. This includes performative improvements as well as new, Web3-focussed, functionality which will enable the DKG to act as the central building block for all future Web3 activities.</p> OriginTrail on Twitter: "🔔ICYMI🔔 Stage 1 of v6 Beta has now officially been live for one week &amp; we couldn't be happier with how it's progressing.

<p>The two companies will integrate their respective technologies and services to develop new products on the Rebuschain platform and the decentralized exchange Verto Trade launching in April 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schio, Italy: Today Rebuschain and Commercio.network announce a blockchain partnership. The two Blockchains based on the same Cøsmos technology, IBC and Bridge Ethereum, operate in the decentralized financial technology (DeFi) sector, and will collaborate to integrate their respective technologies and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rebuschain, uses a Native Token utility, $REBUS, to allow a channel of asset managers and other financial institutions to manage and sell DeFi instruments alongside their traditional instruments (TradFi), will make use of the technology and services of Commercio.network. In particular, Rebuschain will become a validator node of Commercio.network and will use the technology of Commercio.network to implement KYC, and notarization needed in the TradFi sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commercio.network, an eIDAS Compliant Blockchain that uses a Native Token utility, $COM to allow members of its network to sign and exchange documents with legal value, will take advantage of the Rebuschain technology. In particular, Commercio.network will become a Rebuschain validator and will use DeFi products Vertotrade.com, NFTID, and Rebus Vault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership envisages that both parties make themselves available to exchange information relating to their technologies available in their portfolio, in order to better understand their technical-commercial interaction and achieve common objectives. The partnership will aim to develop new DeFi and TradFi products and solutions on the Rebuschain platform and on the decentralized exchange Vertotrade.com, using the Commercio.network blockchain as a support infrastructure for the exchange of legally binding documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership represents an important step forward for both blockchains, which will be able to benefit from their respective technological skills and knowledge, opening up new business opportunities and consolidating their position on the market of Cøsmos, IBC and Bridge Ethereum technology and decentralized technologies.</p>

 eIDAS Architecture Reference Framework 1.0 
 Thoughts on ARF from DIDAS Technology Working 
<p>Earlier this year, the eIDAS Expert Group published the first version of the Architecture Reference Framework (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/93678">ARF</a>), which lays the foundation for the future European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet Infrastructure. For us at DIDAS, it represents a very exciting moment, as we are facing the final phase of the Swiss E-ID Law development and already work on pilots to explore and showcase what is possible.</p>
<p>We strive for the broadest interoperability between all European Digital Identity (and hopefully worldwide) initiatives. Beyond pure technical interoperability (e.g., at the protocol level), it’s crucially important to highlight potential differences in approaches to ensure that the ideas and principles that went into our input to the Swiss E-ID Law are also reflected in the eIDAS work.</p>
<p>After all, our raison d’être – and our responsibility – is to advocate for the advancement of digital processes in society while respecting the privacy and digital sovereignty of Swiss citizens.</p>
<p>First, we’d like to point the interested reader to the excellent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eu-wallet-depth-1-trusted-lists-andrew-tobin/">series</a> published by Andrew Tobin , where he goes in-depth into the ARF and highlights, in an easy-to-understand language, a few aspects that require special attention, e.g., the potential complexity of managing the ecosystem and ensuring trust at national levels, correlation of credentials’ usage, etc.</p>
<p>We also would like to thank the authors of the document for the demanding work that went into its creation. We believe that many good choices have been made. The proposed approach does pave the way to an exciting future where everyone can take full advantage of the continuously evolving digital services in a privacy-preserving manner and be in control of their data!</p>
<p>We realize that this is version 1.0 of a framework, and a lot of work went into making it acceptable for a variety of players.</p>
<p>In this Blog post, we’d like to share our view on some of the critical aspects of the ARF, considering both the technical and user-experience implications of the proposed Reference Framework.</p>
 The Trusts Lists – minimizing complexity. 
<p>Let us start by looking at a foundational topic: how will wallets and their users know if they are dealing with a trusted issuer or a verifier? This is where the so-called “Trust Lists” come into play. They are meant to be directories where wallets can look up a counterparty’s identifier and determine their status. The ARF proposes many lists, mainly to allow flexibility and accommodate the unique requirements of the member states.</p>
<p>This, however, will potentially lead to hundreds of them and will, arguably, make the overall system less secure and confusing. From our standpoint, a better approach would be to use credentials: each issuer and verifier must present a credential (e.g. EBSI <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSIDOC/Data+Models+and+Schemas">proposal</a>) , which will certify to the user’s wallet that they are authorized to issue or request a particular set of credentials with a known schema. This way, the system becomes much more manageable and resilient and is built of the same building blocks throughout. While, at the same time, allowing for regional variations.</p>
<p>An essential enabling factor for this is going to be a robust governance framework, which should regulate and enforce the rules for these credentials, including the attributes of the schemas.</p>
<p>The user wallet then will have a much easier job of “advising” its users of whether a specific data exchange is a good idea, promoting trust and improving overall usability and acceptance.</p>
 
Lose your phone, lose your wallet? 
<p>Another foundational aspect currently not well highlighted in the document is the topic of what happens in case of a lost wallet or a need to upgrade to a new phone. Both are related to the issue of cryptographic key lifecycle management. From our standpoint, this is both a technical and a user acceptance topic.</p>
<p>Without clear guidance on what happens when a user wants to either upgrade their phone or deactivate the wallet on a lost phone, it’s hard to imagine that a wide adoption will occur. A well-thought-through user experience is necessary here.</p>
<p>The ability to move data between devices is not only a user-experience topic. It is also a question of Data Self-Sovereignty, which is one of the fundaments <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SSI-principles-english.pdf">principles</a> of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and a real need, or even a right of today’s and future citizens.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, this can be enabled via known techniques where keys can be migrated between secure elements (e.g., cloning/backup procedure for HSMs). Or more modern, scalable approaches, e.g., W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> or <a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a> (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure), where key rotation is built-in, and a stable identifier is independent of the underlying key material.</p>
 Are PIDs complete? 
<p>Personal Identification Data (PID) is clearly a big focus of the current version of the framework. When we consider which attributes fall under the definition of PID, we see that name and date of birth are mandatory. The current address is, however, optional, and a photo is missing. The latter should be added to make a PID-carrying wallet an equivalent of a conventional ID card (user experience again).</p>
<p>When we return to the optionality of an address, we notice that it creates uncertainty. If a given use case requires an address (such as onboarding at a bank), then the verifier’s system cannot rely on PID to provide that information since it is optional. This means that a separate proof request (and a corresponding credential) will have to be made, complicating the system’s overall design.</p>
<p>A better way from our viewpoint would be to plan for a more fine-grained approach from the very beginning and allow additional, “high-resolution” PID credentials such as “Proof of Residence” (“Wohnsitzbestätigung”) to be provided at the ecosystem level from the start.</p>
<p>The beauty of an SSI ecosystem, after all, is that multiple credentials and their attributes can be combined for a particular use case. A highly desirable outcome!</p>
<p>With that in mind, we recommend that a mechanism be put in place to allow the ecosystem players to onboard new types of “PID” credentials and thus continuously expand the EUDI’s capabilities. A good example of this is an “Official Organizational Role” (OOR) credential that has been pioneered by <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">GLEIF</a> (Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation).</p>
 Privacy by Design? 
<p>This is perhaps one of the most significant areas of concern for us. The non-negotiable, essential requirement for an electronic identity/verifiable credentials solution is to ensure that the users can’t be tracked as they conduct their daily life.</p>
<p>For that to be true, two key assumptions must be guaranteed:<br>
• First, validity verification must occur without any data being leaked about the presenter or the circumstances of a credential’s usage.<br>
• Second, there should be no data in the credential itself or in the verification protocol, which allows to correlate the user across touch points.</p>
<p>ARF mentions the first aspect in the section on qualified verifiable credentials (aka QEAA). Still, it is missing from the sections that define PID Providers and non-qualified credentials’ issuers (EAA). We interpret that omission as a signal that both latter categories are not subject to this requirement. This is, in our opinion, an unacceptable proposition.</p>
<p>The second aspect is also not well represented in the document. The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">SD-JWT</a> and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">mDL</a>, the first couple of technologies proposed to carry verifiable credentials, can’t guarantee that the users won’t be correlated across their activities.</p>
<p>One of the good things about the framework is that it settles on OpenID Connect for <a href="https://openid.net/openid4vc/">Verifiable Presentations</a> as its primary enabling technology. A key feature of that specification is that it is agnostic to the format of a verifiable credential. So, more privacy-friendly credential technologies can be used.</p>
<p>As we think about alternative credential formats, we also need to consider the thorny question of revocations. It is unclear how revocations, beyond just a simple expiration mechanism, will be made functional under the framework. However, it is, without a doubt, a must-have feature for many use cases.</p>
<p>Scalable, privacy-preserving revocation mechanisms are notoriously difficult to implement. The momentum created by this much-needed EU-wide initiative gives us a chance, however, to accelerate and advance the research that has been taking place in the last few years. The rush to market and “pragmatic” conventional choices that can be made to enable it should be reconsidered. Our societies deserve a truly person-centric, privacy-preserving solution, which will finally help us to get rid of paper credentials and thus lay a solid foundation for truly seamless digitalization.</p>
<p>That is what SSI is all about, and that’s what we at DIDAS passionately strive to enable!</p>

<p>Policymakers, technologists, and privacy advocates are invited to offer their feedback on the new white paper, <a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/04/DRAFT-Government-issued-Digital-Credentials-and-the-Privacy-Landscape-publiccomment.pdf">“Government-issued Digital Credentials and the Privacy Landscape.”</a> This paper, published in part by the OpenID Foundation, Kantara Initiative, and the Secure Identity Alliance, and including contributions from several individuals, seeks to engage and inspire thought leaders from government, civil society, and standards and technology. You are encouraged to come together to discuss how to close the policy and protocol gaps between today’s disparate solutions and services and the vision of a privacy-preserving, globally viable privacy landscape.</p>
<p>The paper is a result of six months of due diligence that started with public listening sessions at Authenticate, the November 2022 OIDF workshop, and IIW IIWXXXV, and many interviews with active people in this space.</p>
<p>We start by examining a few of the influential regulations and standards in the privacy and digital credential space and a few areas in the works where government-issued digital credentials play a significant role in society. It continues by reviewing the core technologies that are in use by these credential systems.</p>
<p>The Gaps and Risks section highlights those uncomfortable limitations of the regulations and current technologies. Privacy-enhancing services require laws and technology to support each other, and understanding where each has limits may suggest areas requiring further work.</p>
<p>The remainder of the paper does just that by offering recommendations on where governments, civil society, and technologists may focus their efforts to bridge the gaps and grapple with the uncomfortable intersections of competing requirements. For example, considering new ways to enable consent, supporting systemic transparency for the individual, and encouraging greater support for advanced cryptographic algorithms.</p>
<p>Your feedback will help ensure this paper serves as a strong platform to inform further dialog with governments, civil society, and technologists.</p>
<p>The comment period will be open until 24 April 2023. You may submit your feedback to <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a>. Please reference specific line numbers for your proposed changes where appropriate.</p>
<p>We will share more on the final outcomes and recommendations at the <a href="https://openid.net/2023/03/17/registration-workshop-at-microsoft/">OpenID Foundation Workshop</a> (17 April 2023), <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5330/1">EIC</a> (11 May 2023) and <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv23/agenda/">Identiverse</a> (31 May 2023).<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By: FIDO Staff</p>



<p>Passwords are everywhere with both enterprises and e-commerce organizations feeling the pain as much, if not more, than most.</p>


 
 


<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit: Authentication in Financial Services and Commerce on March 29, industry experts and practitioners outlined The FIDO Fit for Enterprise and Customer Sign-ins. Throughout the half-day event, the topic of passkeys was a primary theme, with speakers outlining how they work, where they fit in and why they are essential to helping the world move away from legacy passwords and less secure multi-factor authentication.</p>



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance opened the event with some insights on the many positive benefits that passkeys can bring to enterprise and commerce users. Those benefits include helping users to get online faster with higher levels of satisfaction. Passkeys may also be able to help improve the bottom line for e-commerce vendors as well.</p>



<p>“If you’re an e-commerce vendor, imagine reducing the shopping cart abandonment rate by even 10%,” Shikiar said. “Our data shows that 50% of consumers that had to abandon a purchase in the past six months did so because they forgot your password and that’s a huge opportunity cost.”</p>



<p>While FIDO authentication has been available for anyone to use for over a decade, Shikiar noted that there have been some adoption challenges. Passkeys are, in part, a solution to some of those adoption challenges. With passkeys, there is a more recognizable set of common terminology and the technology also provides a familiar flow for users that aims to reduce friction.</p>



<p>In the enterprise, Shikiar said that passkeys are a very natural fit for things like BYOD [Bring Your Own Device] authentication, allowing employees to sign in with apps on their phones.</p>



<p>“This is becoming more the norm than the exception, and passkeys are just a very natural fit for that environment,” Shikiar said.</p>



<p>The State of Authentication 2023&nbsp;</p>


 
 


<p>Make no mistake about it, there are a lot of problems with passwords. To add some metrics to the argument against passwords, Jay Roxe, CMO at HYPR provided some insights from his firm’s <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-security-report">State of Passwordless Security 2023 report</a>.</p>



<p>Roxe noted that one of the things that really jumped out to him was that three out of five of the organizations that HYPR talked to for the report, had an authentication related breach over the past year. He added that each of those organizations had nearly $3 million dollars in costs associated with those breaches on a 12 month basis. Financial Services was the most highly attacked industry vertical with 81% of financial services organizations having recorded some type of attack or breach related to authentication.</p>



<p>The HYPR report also attempted to discover why organizations will move to deploy strong authentication passwordless approaches. Roxe emphasized that it’s critical to have a good user interface and flow, otherwise the technology won’t get adopted. In fact the report found the top reason why organizations are looking to adopt passwordless is to improve the user experience.</p>



<p>“Until we nail that user experience, we’re fundamentally not going to be any better off than we are today,” Roxe said.</p>



<p>Passkeys 101</p>



<p>Among the most interactive sessions of the event was one on the basics of how passkeys work, which kept moderator Megan Shamas, senior director of marketing at the FIDO Alliance very busy handling questions from the engaged audience at the end of the session.</p>


 
 


<p>The session actually got started with Tim Cappalli, identity standards architect at Microsoft outlining the historical path of FIDO standards. The big milestones along the path include the debut of the U2F specifications in 2014, FIDO2 in 2017, WebAuthn in 2019 and just last year the emergence of passkeys.</p>



<p>“It has been a journey,” Cappalli said. “We think that in the last two to three years, we really have been moving towards the last step to moving people beyond passwords.”</p>



<p>Cappalli outlined how passkeys works and what the primary advantages are for the approach. He explained that a passkey is fundamentally a FIDO credential with some new properties. Among the properties highlighted by Cappalli are:</p>



 
 Autofill. With Autofill, much like the experience users have today with a password manager, a passkey can be automatically injected into an authentication flow into existing websites. 



 Cross Device Authentication. Instead of a credential being tethered strictly to a single device, passkeys enable a credential to be durable across environments, enabling a phone for example to be able to bootstrap another device or ecosystem. 
 



<p>Championing FIDO adoption at scale</p>


 
 


<p>Few professionals have had as much experience deploying FIDO at scale as Marcio Mello, who has led efforts at PayPal, Intuit and eBay.</p>



<p>Mello outlined in great detail the steps that organizations can and should take to support FIDO strong authentication. In his view, the benefits are obvious.</p>



<p>“As soon as we could, we started doing WebAuthn deployment at eBay and saw the benefits almost immediately,” Mello said.</p>



<p>For Mello, passkeys are the next massive step forward as it’s an approach that will reduce consumer friction and hopefully enable adoption at scale. It is fundamentally the ease of use that passkeys promise that is literally the key.</p>



<p>“Consumers expect to see and use a password,” he said. “Yes, everybody’s tired of them, but it’s like smoking, most smokers would like to stop but they can’t, sure they know it’s bad, but you need to have the motivation and a very low bar of ability to be able to drive a habit change.”</p>



<p>FIDO and Zero Trust</p>


 
 


<p>In the security world, zero trust is an increasingly common concept that advocates an approach where users and entities need to be constantly validated to limit risks.</p>



<p>For Kurt Johnson, chief strategy officer at Beyond Identity, there is a clear intersection between FIDO authentication and zero trust. After all, a core foundation of zero trust is the need to constantly authenticate users and if organization’s aren’t using strong authentication, that’s a weak link.</p>



<p>Johnson said that with zero trust there is a need to assess and establish a high level of trust in the user identity. That just can’t be done effectively through passwords and that’s where there is a need for FIDO Certified authentication, that’s unphishable.</p>



<p>Helping Amazon’s drive to be customer-obsessed</p>


 
 


<p>Amazon operates one of the world’s largest e-commerce sites and it’s also a strong advocate and supporter of the FIDO Alliance.</p>



<p>Yash Patodia, principal product manager, tech, world wide consumer at Amazon said that his team is always looking to improve usability. One of the efforts to improve has been a move to remove passwords wherever possible. Patodia said that Amazon uses FIDO security keys for its own internal security which has worked well.</p>



<p>While security keys have worked for Amazon’s own internal needs, he noted that they can be difficult for consumers to adopt. That’s one of the many reasons why he’s particularly excited about passkeys.</p>



<p>“I think it’s a great leap forward from the password, OTP (one time passwords) and the security keys world,” Patodia said. “Some of the benefits I can see for passkey is that it really makes it very easy for the customer to use.”</p>



<p>Making it easier for consumers is critical for Amazon overall as it’s core to the company’s mission.</p>



<p>“We have this term at Amazon we use a lot called customer obsession,” Patodia said. “And this fits perfectly for us in that this is actually a customer obsessed product where we are making it very easy for the customer to do what they want to do.”</p>



<p>PNC BANK looks to protect its users with FIDO</p>


 
 


<p>Susan Koski, CISO of PNC Bank, knows all too well the challenges of password, that’s why she’s such a strong advocate and supporter of FIDO.</p>



<p>She noted that criminals are going after user passwords in a bid to take over accounts. Among the risks that she is trying to help limit is that of phishable credentials, such as passwords.</p>



<p>“We really do want to reduce those phishable&nbsp; credentials but we do it in a way that a customer wants to use the service,” Koski said. “Balancing security and the customer experience. I think that’s just been a mantra for us in information security in cyberspace for a while.”</p>



<p>Koski said that PNC Bank has embraced FIDO as a way to help move towards passwordless over time. The importance of taking a standardized approach that benefits from the support and participation of a broad array of participants is critical as well.</p>



<p>“Passwords have been around for 50 plus years and it’s time, it’s beyond time for us to move past passwords,” Koski said.</p>



<p>Enterprise guidance for passkeys is on the way</p>



<p>Looking forward, Megan Shamas of FIDO Alliance outlined a series of efforts that are underway to help provide more enterprise guidance for passkeys.</p>



<p>“We will be publishing a group of five papers that address what we hope to be the majority of the use cases that are out there on the enterprise,” Shamas said.</p>



<p>The five papers include:</p>



 
 Introduction to passkeys in the enterprise 



 How to replace password-only authentication with passkeys 



 How to displace password + SMS OTP authentication with passkeys 



 FIDO authentication for moderate assurance use 



 High Assurance Enterprise FIDO Authentication 
 



<p>“If you would like to be part of the conversation around enterprise requirements, please do get in touch with us,” Shamas said. “This is the time now really to give your input on how we’re looking at passkeys from an enterprise perspective.”</p>

<p>Opinion piece by the Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ) Executive Council Policy &amp; Regulation Sub-Committee</p>



<p>Summary<br><br>Current regulation requires some businesses to use and hold on to personal information when you use their services. These large datasets of sensitive personal information are highly attractive for cyber criminals and contribute to ongoing cybercrimes and identity theft that can have a devastating impact on those affected. Optus &nbsp;and Latitude Financial are recent examples but they are not alone and not likely to be the last. Even businesses like these with good reputations can put the personal information you give them at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>New technology exists that allows you to sign-up for a new service without needing to hand over physical documents or share more than what’s needed. Along with other countries, New Zealand is behind in adopting this new game changing technology but changes are afoot. Until then you need to be aware of who you are sharing data with, how it will be used and how that party will protect it.</p>



<p>Digital Identity NZ (DINZ) is Aotearoa’s only industry association specifically focussed on digital identity and is leading the way to a future where every New Zealander can easily use their digital identity to access services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Current regulation requires some businesses to use and hold on to personal information when you use their services&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you think about the recent high-profile data breaches of personal information due to hackers finding ways to break into computer networks, you might wonder if the awful consequences for people affected could have been significantly reduced or prevented if firms had not stored electronic copies of documents.</p>



<p>The thing is, many businesses like big appliance retailers selling you credit so you can buy the TV of your dreams, or mobile network companies selling you a phone or SIM card, must interpret and follow rules overseen by a regulator in order to do business. This typically leads retailers to electronically copy and store personal information.</p>



<p>While it was the cybersecurity exposures that caused the breaches of personal information in the recent instances, and not the requirements to collect personal information set down by any particular Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime, it did magnify the impact of a breach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-63056838">Optus</a>, the Australian telco giant, obtained identity information not only to satisfy AML/CFT obligations but to satisfy law enforcement agencies’ needs regarding criminals’ use of mobile phones, while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/27/latitude-financial-cyber-data-breach-hack-14m-customer-records-stolen">Latitude Financial</a> obtained identity information to undertake credit checks as well as to fulfil AML/CFT obligations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These regulatory regimes should not be inadvertently putting the mass population’s sensitive personal identity documentation in jeopardy, just because legislation does not reflect current technical capability to make electronic copying of physical documents redundant, be that the traditional centralised approach or the emerging modern decentralised approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Large datasets of sensitive personal information are highly attractive for cyber-attackers&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stuff wrote an <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/131623747/complaints-made-to-privacy-commission-as-latitude-admits-1037-million-new-zealand-drivers-licence-details-stolen">easily readable piece </a>on the most recent high profile breach, Latitude, while focussing on the impact for New Zealanders caught up in it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you buy something, even gift vouchers, at a store on credit, many shoppers will have experienced having had a sense of unease of having no choice or leverage to decline when the retailer asked for identification documents and proceeded to electronically scan or copy them. Sometimes even when credit wasn’t required, but the retailer urged you to open a credit account. And once the interaction has ended and the AML/CFT provisions fulfilled, the unease remains – did they delete my personal information?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reasons why they are doing this might range from needing to comply with regulation to instore incentives for retailers to gather personal information, for the marketing department for example, when typically the company’s cybersecurity teams don’t want the data held due to the potential risks it creates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Who wins that ‘tug of war’ usually comes down to an organisation’s culture, information security and risk posture and where in the organisation these decisions are made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>New technology exists that allows you to sign-up for a new service without needing to hand over physical documents or share more than what is needed<br><br>In the review of New Zealand’s AML/CFT regulation currently underway, we call for urgent prioritisation of the <a href="https://www.dia.govt.nz/pubforms.nsf/URL/AMLCFT_Amendment-to-IDVCOP-2013-FINAL-October-2013.pdf/$file/AMLCFT_Amendment-to-IDVCOP-2013-FINAL-October-2013.pdf">Amended Identity Verification Code of Practice 2013</a> (AIVCOP), which has outdated requirements relating to face-to-face verification and the use of copies of documents certified by the trusted referees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As inferred in our<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2021/11/Digital-Identity-New-Zealand-AML_CFT-Report_20-October-2020_FINAL.pdf"> report published in 2020</a>, we support a complete overhaul of AIVCOP so that it better supports not only the Privacy Act 2020, but also the use of robust and reliable digital identification services to achieve AML/CFT compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also must be complementary to and aligned with the upcoming opt-in Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) Act that accredits rules-compliant digital identity service providers should they opt-in to do so. <a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0078/latest/LMS459583.html">The Bill</a> had its third and final reading this week and is set for implementation in July 2024.</p>



<p>Capability has existed for over a decade to electronically verify claims about personal information from its applicable centralised authoritative source compliant with the Privacy Act 2020 and its 1993 predecessor. The problem is to do with scale and interoperability. Scaling New Zealand retail point of sale counters to send identification-related claims to the government agency authoritative registers to have them confirmed, or not as the case may be, and the scale needed by the authoritative source to process so many claims. The high level of interoperability needed to have multiple systems performing like payment networks is a significant and ongoing investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decentralised digital identity,the subject of <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/03-april-perspectives-on-decentralised-identity-summer-series-2023-webinar/">DINZ’s summer series of perspectives just completed today</a>, is a topic that offers the strongest hope for a brighter future. Because implicit in this privacy centric approach, is the notion that the individual holds their data inside a secure container such as a digital wallet on a digital device like a smartphone. This way the plethora of computer networks storing people’s personal information as is current practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Significant investment and the collective will to do so notwithstanding, a robust decentralised digital identification approach could allow individuals to access financial services at point of sale without the need for them to hand over physical documents for electronic copying. It could also accelerate financial inclusion if, as a nation, we can overcome obvious barriers such as ground level digital literacy and access to a smartphone/device of some kind which is a prerequisite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final.pdf">recent report published by Digital Identity New Zealand highlighted</a> that “Digital identity underpins the majority of our digital transactions and is the foundation for digital transformation”. The report’s recommendations called out the yearning need to increase awareness and education in many sectors of our society so that everyone in Aotearoa can enjoy the benefits of the digital economy if they choose to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most countries, New Zealand included, are behind the game. To minimise the risks we see from data breaches, right now we need trusted and universally accepted identification methods envisaged by the DISTF Act, that are compliant with privacy and AML/CFT regulations. These also need to allow people to identify, verify and authenticate themselves and to decide if they will share data or proofs and with whom without the need to hand over physical documents containing personal information for electronic copying by retailers with all the associated risks of it being stolen and used for criminal gain.</p>



<p>The AML/CFT Act is under review and parts of the legislation selected for amendment first are currently out for comment. But those parts are not the AIVCOP. Prioritising the AIVCOP can help not only bring compliance with the Privacy Act 2020 closer, but also reduce the unintended consequences of the current AIVCOP provisions that create personal information honeypots for hackers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the face of it, privacy legislation is trumped by AML/CFT legislation when they should be complementary.&nbsp; Regulatory regimes must support the use of technological advancements in digital identification where there is a demonstrable benefit to New Zealanders. Firms are not going to make the leap to digital identity services if they consider it will put them in breach of their regulatory requirements. But in hesitating, many New Zealanders’ personal information is at risk.</p>

<p>By Andy Parsons, Senior Director, Content Authenticity Initiative&nbsp;</p><p>This past month, the Content Authenticity Initiative achieved three major milestones representing the fast pace of progress toward our critical goal of making content more transparent and trustworthy, everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>First, we are thrilled to announce that the CAI has crossed the 1,000-member mark! After launching the CAI just over 3 years ago, we are incredibly proud to have grown a global coalition of leading tech and media companies, camera manufacturers, news publishers, creative professionals, researchers, NGOs and many more – all contributing their expertise, code, and energy to advance this mission. &nbsp;</p><p>This comes at a critical time as content becomes easier to manipulate and determining what’s authentic is challenging, to say the least. Specifically, generative AI has broken through as a creative technology for content inspiration and creation that is transforming the world. While AI has unprecedented potential to amplify human creativity, it also shines a light on the urgent need to restore trust online. 3 years ago, the CAI team and partners anticipated a future of powerful AI tools and eroding trust. And through hard work and deep collaboration, we are proud to see the day-by-day heightened call for authenticity at this key turning point in human history. Above all, we’re resolute in finding ways to deploy the techniques, tools, and standards that we have built together, so that everyone can benefit from them.&nbsp;</p><p>Leveraging Content Credentials in Firefly Beta&nbsp;</p><p>At Adobe Summit last month, Adobe’s new generative AI model, <a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2023/Adobe-Unveils-Firefly-a-Family-of-new-Creative-Generative-AI/default.aspx">Firefly</a>, was announced, and along with it our commitment to leveraging CAI’s Content Credentials to bring transparency to generative AI outputs. Every asset produced with Firefly has embedded a Content Credential indicating the model used and its version. This is significant—it not only builds on our mission to ensure tools like Firefly are used responsibly, but also gives viewers of this content important context to understand what they’re seeing or hearing, enabling them to make trust decisions when necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, to ensure creators have more control over their work, they can use CAI provenance technology and attach “Do Not Train” credentials that travel with their content wherever it goes. With industry adoption, this will prevent AI developers from training on content with “Do Not Train” credentials. With this universal standard now published in the latest C2PA technical specification, we believe this will be adopted quickly across industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Creative storyteller <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/hallease">Hallease Narvaez</a> showcased our Content Credentials features in the Firefly Beta at Summit, exhibiting an incredible display of how the CAI technology works with generative AI content – be sure to check out her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBaPWYhHRg">video here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>C2PA Releases Key Updates to the Technical Specification&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As the CAI and the non-profit standards development organization, the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), continue to engage in deeply complimentary threads of work—the C2PA honing the blueprint for the future of digital provenance while the CAI builds a massive community to put the standard to work—we are also excited about the just-released <a href="https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.3/specs/C2PA_Specification.html">version 1.3</a> of its technical specification that includes expanded support for an array of media types, as well as generative AI transparency capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>This is perhaps the largest update to the spec since its initial publication in 2021. Among the highlights are:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Support for additional file types, including WAV for pro audio and WebP for image delivery.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Extended metadata for media creation and modifications so AI-generated ingredients can be clearly captured and displayed.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Regions of interest” for explaining which parts of media were impacted by various actions, when appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Universal support for generative AI transparency and creators’ “do not train” intent.&nbsp;</p>  <p>I am so inspired and humbled by the recent accomplishments of the CAI ecosystem. I’m also reminded how much more work we all have ahead of us, to ensure digital provenance is available to journalists, creators, and consumers wherever and whenever they need tools for authentic storytelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As always, if interested in our work, you can join our expansive and ever-growing community <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/membership">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 La Suisse en route vers une nouvelle identité électronique — Lancement d’une sandbox publique pour tester l’écosystème des preuves numériques <p>Cet article donne un aperçu sur les développements de l’E-ID en Suisse et renseigne sur l’environnement Sandbox récemment lancé. (<a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/die-schweiz-auf-dem-weg-zur-neuen-elektronischen-identit%C3%A4t-public-sandbox-gestartet-99723a2e31bf">Artikel auch auch Deutsch verfügbar</a>.)</p> Contexte de l’E-ID suisse&nbsp;: ce qui s’est passé jusqu’à&nbsp;présent <p>Alors que le commerce électronique dans l’Union européenne est largement régi par le règlement eIDAS, il existe en Suisse différentes lois qui régissent des aspects comparables du commerce électronique. Actuellement, il n’existe toutefois pas de base juridique au niveau fédéral en Suisse pour une identité électronique émise par&nbsp;l’État.</p><p>Une première loi fédérale sur l’E-ID a déjà été adoptée en Suisse par le Parlement en septembre 2019, celle ci reposait sur des fournisseurs d’identité centraux et privés, mais elle a été abrogé lors d’une <a href="https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/fr/home/themes/abstimmungen/bgeid.html">votation populaire le 7 mars&nbsp;2021</a>.</p>Source de l’image: <a href="https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/fr/home/themes/abstimmungen/bgeid.html">https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/fr/home/themes/abstimmungen/bgeid.html</a><p>En mai 2021, le Conseil fédéral a chargé le Département fédéral de justice et police, le Département fédéral des finances et la Chancellerie fédérale d’élaborer, avec la participation des milieux scientifiques et des cantons, un concept sommaire pour un nouvel&nbsp;E-ID.</p><p>Une audition et une consultation publiques ont ensuite permis de discuter des trois solutions possibles suivantes pour un E-ID suisse&nbsp;:</p>  Self-Sovereign Identity  Infrastructure à clé&nbsp;publique  Fournisseur d’identité central de&nbsp;l’État  <p>En décembre 2021, <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/fr/home/aktuell/mm.msg-id-86465.html">le Conseil fédéral a annoncé une décision</a> orientée en faveur de la solution Self-Sovereign Identity pour l’E-ID&nbsp;suisse.</p><p>L’E-ID devra être émis par l’Office fédéral de la police (fedpol), qui est subordonné au Département fédéral de justice et police&nbsp;(DFJP).</p><p>L’infrastructure de confiance doit être développée et exploitée par la Confédération et permettre l’établissement de données et de justificatifs d’identité publics et&nbsp;privés.</p><p>Après la <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/fr/home/aktuell/mm.msg-id-89515.html">consultation sur la nouvelle loi E-ID</a>, qui a duré jusqu’en octobre 2022, le Département fédéral de justice et police devrait présenter la nouvelle loi E-ID d’ici l’été 2023. Parallèlement, l’expérimentation de la technologie dans une sandbox se poursuit.</p> Lancement d’un environnement d’essai public “Sandbox”. Source de l’image&nbsp;: Github repository “e-id-admin”.<p>La Suisse est en train de développer une nouvelle solution E-ID. La nouvelle solution E-ID poursuit l’objectif de stocker de manière décentralisée les données d’identité numériques et les justificatifs des citoyens. L’État conserve le contrôle de l’infrastructure de confiance nécessaire. Pour la mise en œuvre de l’écosystème E-ID, on mise, comme à l’avenir dans l’Union européenne, sur le concept des Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI).</p><p>Cette semaine, l’Office fédéral de l’informatique et de la télécommunication (OFIT) et l’Office fédéral de la justice (OFJ) ont mis en place une Public Sandbox afin de recueillir les premières expériences pratiques avec des ID-Wallets et des preuves vérifiables. L’objectif de la Sandbox est de travailler avec environ 40 partenaires participants&nbsp;:</p>  Permettre des applications pilotes SSI en Suisse De générer des expériences pratiques préliminaires pour l’ensemble de l’écosystème et de ses&nbsp;acteurs.  D’acquérir une expérience technique et organisationnelle par l’expérimentation  De faire progresser la construction d’une culture de collaboration au sein de l’écosystème.

Davantage d’informations sont disponibles via la newsletter. (<a href="https://www.eid.admin.ch/eid/fr/home/e-id-gesetz/partizipation.html">Inscription via la newsletter</a>).

Les entreprises et organisations intéressées ayant leur siège en Suisse pourront utiliser Lissi-Agent pour établir, gérer et vérifier les données d’identité numériques et les justificatifs dans la Public Sandbox suisse. Il est en outre prévu que Lissi-Wallet puisse être utilisé dans le cadre de la Public Sandbox Trust Infrastructure.</p>Séquence du point de vue d’un&nbsp;citoyen<p>Les personnes physiques reçoivent avec le Lissi Wallet un ID-Wallet très intuitif à utiliser dans différents cas d’application au sein de la Public&nbsp;Sandbox.</p>La plateforme Lissi Agent permet différents cas d’application dans l’E-ID Sandbox&nbsp;suisse.<p>Si vous représentez une organisation suisse et que vous souhaitez participer à la Sandbox avec un cas d’application, n’hésitez pas à remplir notre <a href="https://r82hs8os9o6.typeform.com/to/ArRDi3I7">formulaire de contact</a>. Nous vous assisterons volontiers dans la mise en&nbsp;œuvre.</p> À propos de&nbsp;Lissi <p>Lissi propose des applications simples pour les organisations afin d’établir, de gérer et de stocker des preuves numériques.

<p>Tell us a bit about Konfir – what do you do and why?                                                                              Konfir was established to revolutionize the employment verification process by securely removing companies’ administrative burdens when requesting or completing employment and gaps in employment verifications. We achieve this by leveraging our certification under the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF) and streamlining the process in a GDPR-compliant way. We aim to accelerate all corners of the modern UK economy, from those switching jobs to those renting a property or obtaining any type of credit.</p>



              



<p>Our unique focus is on protecting and enabling consumers by ensuring transparent and secure access to their own income and employment records. We’re dedicated to helping UK-based workers get approvals faster while controlling their data flow and helping relying parties verify employment faster. By offering instant results, improved candidate experience, and faster turnaround times, we make it a no-brainer for employment screening teams to choose Konfir.</p>



<p>What makes Konfir unique?<br>Konfir stands out from other providers in the employment and income verification space for several reasons. The antiquated and insecure solution of contacting previous employers takes days or weeks to process and only verifies what a candidate has said, not necessarily the reality. In contrast, Konfir provides instant employment data from authoritative sources using payroll integrations and open banking. This allows us to offer comprehensive results in a flash, which is especially helpful for employment verification and gap in employment validation checks that can often be time-consuming and cumbersome.</p>



<p>We also focus on improving the candidate experience, evidenced by our conversion rate of over 80%. Candidates appreciate the convenience, speed, and security of our service, which helps them complete what is sometimes a stressful and time-consuming experience so they can get to work quicker. As the only method of employment verification underpinned by certification, we’re continuously innovating to make the employment verification process even smoother and more efficient.</p>



Team Konfir



<p>What was the key driver for choosing certification under the UK DIATF?<br>The primary driver for choosing certification under the UK DIATF was to foster trust by providing evidence that Konfir operates to the highest security standards. The certification serves as a springboard to open conversations about employment verification with public bodies and the market given it is already understood by many following the Digital ID rollout. By establishing digital trust in the employment screening process, we can ensure that personal data is used responsibly and that individuals have control over how their data is used. This certification helps set the standard for employment and income verification in the UK; placing Konfir as a pioneer in the industry.<br><br>What made you choose Kantara Initiative (KI) as your certification body?<br>We selected Kantara Initiative as our chosen certification body due to their responsiveness, support from start to end, and their experience in this space in the UK and abroad. Furthermore, Kantara’s in-depth approach to ASP certification has complemented our ISO 27001 journey, ensuring a robust and comprehensive certification process that demonstrates our commitment to security and data protection.</p>



<p>What did you learn about your business as you went through the certification process?<br>Going through the certification process, one of the first major external full-company audit processes we’ve experienced, validated that we’re doing many things right. We also identified a few areas for improvement and learned a lot about how to standardise our rating of the identity and employment attributes we make available to our clients. The process emphasised the importance of digital trust and our commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals in the employment screening process.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to other start-up organisations considering certification?<br>Our advice to other start-ups considering certification is to start early and engage with organizations that have already gone through the process. Understand the requirements and benefits of certification, and ensure your business is well-prepared. Certification not only helps establish trust with your clients and partners but also strengthens your company’s internal processes and security standards.</p>



<p>How have you used certification to support your business development strategies?<br>Certification has been instrumental in enhancing our business development strategies. It has opened doors to partnership opportunities with key players in the trust framework, such as OSPs and IDSPs, as well as relying parties. As Konfir employs novel technologies like open banking and payroll integrations to complete verifications, the certification instills trust in the secure and responsible use of these technologies.</p>



<p>This certification not only establishes Konfir as a credible and viable business partner but also fosters trust in our processes among candidates.

<p></p>     <p>Members of the Finance, Securitization, and Smart Contracts Working Group co-developed Citopia vinTRAK Zero-Knowledge proof of location verification for Dealer Floorplan Audit automation. </p>
          <p>Los Angeles — 30 March 2023: MOBI and its members have successfully demonstrated the first-ever Web3 digital infrastructure for privacy-preserving verification of vehicle track-and-trace, enabling lenders and auditors to automate Dealer Floorplan Audits (DFA). Currently, DFA is done manually, a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. The technologies piloted, MOBI Trusted Trip (decentralized identity linked with location into a verifiable trip) and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof of location, are foundational for many more applications, such as tolling, road usage charging, CO2 emissions tracking/reporting, and usage-based insurance.</p>
<p>Modern IT systems allow for the track and trace of connected devices with a big catch — the location of device users (Personal Identifiable Information, or PII) is exposed! Vehicles on dealer lots are filled with sensors that can provide accurate data about the vehicle’s condition, location, and other important information. While it is theoretically possible to use existing vehicle telematics to check location and automate the audit process, doing so can potentially reveal customer PII, for example, if the vehicle is sold or loaned to a customer. In addition, each dealer lot may contain vehicles from multiple manufacturers (OEMs) that do not share data with each other during the audit. As a result, lenders have continued with manual auditing.</p>
<p>MOBI’s DFA pilot uses Citopia vinTRAK ZK proof of location verification capabilities to safeguard vehicle location and other PII. The only public information required to verify the ZK proof and verification is the geofenced location of the dealership. During the audit process, the vehicle is asked “Are you in this geofenced location?” and the vehicle responds with the proof “Yes/No.” The proof does not contain any clear text information about a vehicle’s location or identity (e.g. VIN number).</p>
<p>An additional layer of privacy for the technology being demoed is the use of <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> standards to create <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Citopia Self-Sovereign Digital Twins (SSDT)</a>. An SSDT is a Digital Twin (DT) where only the owner/controller has access to the data stored inside the DT and can participate in autonomous transactions. In this pilot:</p>
<p>Vehicle geolocation resides in the vehicle SSDT and only the vehicle data owner/controller has access to this data. Lenders receive the ZK proof and MOBI and Lenders do not have access to vehicle C-SSDT.</p>
<p>ZK verification of vehicle location (does not contain a specific location or the VIN) resides in both the vehicle and the lender SSDTs (MOBI does not have access to this data).</p>
<p>The technologies used in this pilot enable the automation of Dealer Floorplan Audit for lenders and auditors without the complications and legal risks of handling PII associated with vehicles. This pilot is foundational for many track-and-trace applications powered by MOBI Trusted Trip and ZK cryptography. Building on this innovative groundwork, OEMs can monetize connected vehicle data in future applications such as vehicle maintenance traceability, battery cross-border compliance, and usage-based services.</p>
<p>The DFA Pilot using Citopia vinTRAK ZK proof of location verification is spearheaded by MOBI’s Finance, Securitization, and Smart Contracts (FSSC) <a href="https://dlt.mobi/mobi-working-groups/">Working Group</a>.

<p>Canada’s trusted digital ID leader, the DIACC, welcomes Budget 2023; applauds the government for investments in digital transformation and Canada’s shift to a digital economy</p>



<p>RONTO, MARCH 29, 2023 — Joni Brennan, President of the Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) released a statement following the tabling of the federal budget yesterday:</p>



<p>The DIACC welcomes the federal government’s investments for digital transformation and Canadian innovation to enable a thriving digital economy announced in yesterday’s budget.</p>



<p>Canada has an opportunity to be a global leader in digital ID, and unlock opportunities for Canadians, decrease costs for governments, consumers, and business, improve service delivery, and drive GDP growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A digital identity is a highly personal yet critical component to both serve and protect Canadians. From increasing data protection and privacy in the public sector to strengthening national security, public safety and child protection through effective authentication and authorization, digital ID is an important part of our transition to a digital world and a digital economy. Further, we know that an effective, safe and secure digital ID ecosystem will save manual operation costs and reduce fraud, saving an estimated $482 million for provincial and federal governments, and $4.5 billion for private sector organizations.</p>



<p>This budget announcement reinforces the government’s commitment to Canada’s digital transformation as it looks for ways to be a full participant in the global digital economy and shift to a digital-first mindset. The government has made some encouraging progress in adopting digital technology solutions to better deliver programs and services, and Canadians are benefiting from that progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were pleased to see the following commitments included in the budget:</p>



 
 A commitment to introduce legislative amendments to the Criminal Code and the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) to strengthen the investigative, enforcement, and information sharing tools of Canada’s AML/ATF Regime. 



 A commitment to improving Airport Operations and Passenger Screening, including $1.8 billion over five years to the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) to maintain and increase its level of service, improve screening wait times, and strengthen security measures at airports. 



 Commitments to improve service delivery for Canadians including $156.7 million over five years to reduce backlogs in Veterans Affairs Canada; $123.9 million over seven years for Old Age Security IT modernization; and a commitment to amend the Citizenship Act to enable the electronic administration of the citizenship program, automated and machine-assisted processing, and the collection and use of biometric information. 
 



<p>The budget provides an opportunity to further advance digital ID in Canada, and the DIACC remains committed to partnering with both government and industry to continue building a trusted digital ID ecosystem and educating Canadians to combat dis and misinformation regarding digital ID.</p>



<p>About Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC)</p>



<p>The Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) is a non-profit coalition of public and private sector organizations committed to developing research and tools to enable secure, robust, and scalable Canadian digital ID solutions and services. With privacy, security, and choice at the forefront of all DIACC initiatives, we aim to enable all Canadians to participate safely and confidently in the global digital economy.</p>

<p>We have long said there will not be one blockchain to rule them all. It will take a mix of blockchains and blockchain technologies to maximize the value of distributed ledgers, smart contracts, digital assets and self-sovereign identity between businesses, across industries and around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hybrid networks, which combine the capabilities of private and public blockchains, can deliver a number of advantages, including high levels of scalability and performance, and provide the right balance of security, privacy and transparency. The private blockchain offers secure, permissioned data storage—an essential feature that’s particularly crucial for highly regulated industries. Meanwhile, the public blockchain brings scale and immutability, enabling a more open and transparent ledger.</p>



<p>As part of our spotlight on #HyperledgerHybrid, we’ve compiled a sampling of production deployments and solutions leveraging Hyperledger technologies to deliver value across a mix of permissioned and public chains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain for Energy</p>



<p>Energy industry consortium, <a href="https://www.blockchainforenergy.net/">Blockchain for Energy</a> has launched a new decentralized and interoperable platform powered by <a href="https://www.kaleido.io/">Kaleido</a> and leveraging <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/firefly">Hyperledger FireFly</a>. The B4E Network &amp; Platform allows energy companies to access proven solutions and build applications that leverage Web3 constructs including smart contracts, digital assets, NFTs, and tokenization across both public and private chains. The first production-grade solution released on the new platform is from the B4E Commodity Transport Program, a collaborative effort led by Pioneer Natural Resources, that utilizes IIOT and blockchain technology to track chemical deliveries.</p>



<p>IPwe Digital Assets</p>



<p>In September 2022, <a href="https://www.casperlabs.io/">Casper Labs</a> and <a href="https://ipwe.com/">IPwe</a> developed and launched a dynamic NFT blockchain solution, IPwe Digital Assets. The solution uses the permissioned distributed ledger technologies of open source <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> and the public Casper Blockchain to securely store verified public and private information about each patent. The integration capitalizes on the data security and trust inherent on a Hyperledger Fabric network and enables Casper to securely bring assets locked on the private ledger to the public chain.</p>



<p>IPwe is now <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/02/02/ipwe-launches-revolutionary-platform-and-deployment-of-25-million-patent-nfts-on-hybrid-casper-blockchain-and-hyperledger-fabric-network">deploying 25 million patent NFTs</a> leveraging the hybrid Casper Blockchain and Hyperledger Fabric network. On top of that, IPwe’s solution includes <a href="https://ipwe.com/smart-intangible-asset-management/">Smart Intangible Asset Management</a> (SIAM), a comprehensive SaaS tool for IP valuation and management that allows enterprises to fully utilize these patent NFTs to transact, manage, and value their IP. This revolutionary implementation of blockchain technology will enable IPwe to bring liquidity to the IP space, where currently approximately 95% of IP assets are not transacted or commercialized</p>



<p>Palm Network</p>



<p>The <a href="https://palmfdn.org/#/network#network">Palm network</a> is an Ethereum sidechain dedicated to selling, purchasing, and trading NFTs that are associated with real-world and digital assets. It is built with <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu">Hyperledger Besu</a> and uses IBFT 2.0 proof of authority (PoA) consensus, with network validators being run by key stakeholders. IBFT 2.0 offers fast transaction speed and free minting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An automated bridge relay service connects payment tokens, like DAI, and NFTs on Ethereum and the Palm network, with bridging contracts deployed on both networks to manage the connection. Fees collected from this bridge are partially used to purchase carbon offsets.</p>



<p>Starling Lab&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.starlinglab.org/">Starling Lab</a> is a joint effort developed by the USC Shoah Foundation and Stanford University’s Department of Electrical Engineering. The initiative’s goal is to develop a set of tools and principles to be used across non-profit organizations, news outlets, and industry experts to solve challenges when it comes to the uncertainty of the media we see today and our enduring effort to preserve the truth. </p>



<p>Starling provides an open-source, end-to-end framework for the media generation and verification process. The framework consists of three modules: capturing the image, storing the information, and verifying its authenticity. It leverages multiple blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. Each metadata record, such as the caption or photographer byline added by an editor to a photo’s record, is relayed to a Hyperledger Fabric peer for notarization on a private permissioned ledger. Each transaction posted to Hyperledger is recorded on <a href="https://hedera.com/consensus-service">Hedera Consensus Service (HCS</a>) using a hashgraph that rapidly orders and stamps each entry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Toko</p>



<p>Global law firm DLA Piper developed its <a href="https://www.dlapiper.com/en/about-us/law-and/toko">TOKO</a> tokenization platform to issue non-fungible tokens across asset classes including real estate, fine art, debt and even intellectual property. Toko is a digital asset creation engine to solve inefficiencies in today’s capital markets by using DLTs to distribute, trade and settle transactions rapidly, bypassing the need for trusted third party intermediaries that are both expensive and slow. It is built using the combination of a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric network and the Hedera Consensus Service.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/l/cp/0BXjjcnX">Privacy-Enhancing Mobile Credentials Working Group</a> within <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> is working to develop the necessary privacy-related guidance for those organizations issuing, verifying, and developing the technologies to hold digital credentials such as mobile drivers’ licenses (mDL) when in person. This work has been underway since November 2021, and the lessons learned in that time have resulted in the revision of the PEMC WG charter.</p>



<p><a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PEMCP/pages/2097569/WG+Charter">Revised Charter</a></p>



<p>The revised charter provides a new Background section to help people new to the space understand the impetus behind the work and a clear description of the target audience for the specifications that this group will produce. The goal of all Kantara Initiative working groups is to be open and accessible to all, and providing a clearer background for the work will enable those new to the space to be more confident when engaging with the group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Purpose and Scope have also been clarified, moving the timeline to its own section with revised dates and offering a bit more detail on both what is in scope and out of scope for our work.</p>



 
 In Scope: Credentials issued by both public sector and private sector issuers are in scope of this document. 



 Out of Scope: Collection, use, and maintenance of identifying attributes by the Issuer are out of scope of this document. Decisions made by an Issuer could be set by policy or regulation regarding what information they collect for the credential itself. 
 



 PEMC Implementors Report 



<p>The next official output of the PEMC WG is the Early Implementors Draft Report. The Implementors Report offers the necessary framing, guidance, and description of appropriate evidence that will allow the PEMC WG to develop the requirements and profiles needed for implementing the best practices described by the PEMC WG. It will also provide much-needed initial guidance for Holders (the people and/or organizations that provide technology to store mobile credentials and support the necessary consent models for its use), Issuers (the people and/or organizations issuing the credentials), Verifiers (those entities that must verify the credential as valid or legitimate).</p>



<p>The goal is to have this report published by the close of Q2 2023.</p>

   Practical steps for better business decisions using decentralized identity SSI infrastructure

<p>This new ToIP white paper sets out practical steps for better business decisions using decentralized identity SSI infrastructure.</p>



<p>Although this new ToIP white paper, publishing jointly by the ToIP Ecosystem Foundry, Governance Stack, and Concepts and Terminology Working Groups, is entitled <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Decentralized-SSI-Governance-V2.0-2022-01-06.pdf">Decentralized SSI Governance</a>, the focus of the paper is actually on how governance can be used to specify business logic and workflow and hence the contextual validity of what qualified data:</p>



<p>Qualified data: data that comes with assurances, e.g. regarding its provenance and integrity (immutability), such that it qualifies as ‘valid to be used for specific purposes of individual parties’.</p>



<p>In the world of TCP/IP it is argued, any data can be transmitted, whereas SSI is specifically exchanging qualified data that is contextually relevant for decision-making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper first distinguishes between verification and validation — a critical distinction which interestingly challenges traditional identity and verification models. In traditional ID&amp;V workflow, validation comes before verification. For example, at an airport when a traveler presents at passport control, the passport is first scanned to check that it is a valid document, then the border officer will use human and/or machine tools to verify that the traveler presenting the document is also the passport holder.</p>



<p>With SSI, this workflow is reversed. At the time of presenting their credential, the traveler is already verified as being the document holder (for example, using biometric verification and/or zero knowledge proof cryptography). Then the document’s data contents need to be validated as relevant for the purposes of that particular context— in this case, passing over an international border.</p>



<p>The paper lays out the business drivers and business process challenges of changing this logical flow. It shows how the benefits of SSI can be realized by following a clear roadmap at three levels:</p>



 
 Participatory governance for all three roles in credential exchange (holder, issuer and verifier) to set policy for their respective contexts. 



 Automating decision-making based on arguments (business logic). 



 SSI assurance communities that are built on the existing accreditation, certification and audit regimes. 
 



<p>While it is billed as a white paper about governance, it is really a pragmatic guide for business people can make the most of SSI infrastructure, streamline their business processes, and implement new workflows for qualified data. The result is a clear path for transitioning from validation first to verification first, based not on future technological capabilities (although the roadmap proposes tools such as cryptographically enforceable policies for the future), but on existing business and assurance processes.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Decentralized-SSI-Governance-V2.0-2022-01-06.pdf">paper (PDF)</a> is available to read.</p>

<p>By Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>SK Telecom, a leading mobile phone service provider in Korea, is taking a big step forward in terms of user authentication by adopting passkeys for their online users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys are a replacement for passwords that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices.&nbsp;Unlike passwords, passkeys are always strong and phishing resistant.&nbsp;They eliminate the need for users to remember complex passwords and the authentication process is much faster.&nbsp;Passkeys are based on FIDO authentication, which is proven to be resistant to threats of phishing, credential stuffing and other remote attacks.&nbsp;</p>



 







 



<p>SK Telecom has introduced passkeys as a means of user authentication to PASS, their identity verification services with over 18 million users.&nbsp;Customers using iOS16 or higher devices can use the passkeys for PASS login, identity verification through PASS, and electronic signature.&nbsp;Depending on the device, user authentication is performed using Face ID and Touch ID.&nbsp;Android users can now use FIDO2 based authentication methods and perform authentication by utilizing screen locks (biometrics, PINs, patterns, etc.) provided by their devices.&nbsp;In the future, SK Telecom plans to make sign-ins with passkeys available to Android users as well.&nbsp;SK Telecom will introduce new user scenarios in a variety of ways to better protect customers’ assets and identity through the introduction of the passkeys.</p>



 


 
 


 



<p>[Passkey Registration Process on SK Telecom PASS]</p>



<p>SK Telecom Developed support for passkeys through cooperation with platform operators, and the FIDO authentication server for processing sign-ins with passkeys was developed by SK Telecom’s own technology.&nbsp;By actively introducing not only PASS but also various services provided by SK Telecom, they hope that many customers who use SK Telecom services will be able to use the service more conveniently and without worrying about security.</p>



<p>This deployment represents a new milestone in SK Telecom’s journey with FIDO. In 2019, during the FIDO Alliance Public Seminar in Korea, SK Telecom reported zero credential stuffing once the company adopted FIDO Authentication for internal usage.&nbsp;They also claimed that their FIDO-based biometric authentication reduced the average authentication time to less than 5 seconds, which previously took more than 30 seconds on average, when the internal users tried logging in with ID and passwords. It is great to see that they continue to innovate and now provide the benefits of FIDO Authentication to the general public.</p>



<p>Through this milestone, many users in Korea will be safe from various threats stemming from passwords, and SK Telecom’s movement as an innovator will have a positive impact on spreading password-less authentication not only in Korea but also globally.</p>

You can also download the PASS apps by visiting the App <a href="https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/pass-by-skt/id1141258007">Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sktelecom.tauth&amp;hl=ko&amp;gl=kr">Google Play</a>.</p>
