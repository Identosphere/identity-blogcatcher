 Highlights from Season 7 of The Tao of WAO&nbsp;podcast <p>We’ve recently wrapped the seventh season of our podcast where we explored the complex and ever-evolving world of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p>From ethical considerations and societal implications to the nuances of AI literacy, the season offered a comprehensive exploration that went beyond the technical jargon. Laura and Doug engaged in critical conversations that aimed to demystify this transformative technology, offering listeners a balanced perspective on its potential and pitfalls.</p><p>This blog post serves as a retrospective, highlighting key moments and insights from a season dedicated to understanding AI in all its dimensions.</p> Relevant links   <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/">Season overview&nbsp;page</a>  <a href="https://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:938068006/sounds.rss">RSS feed</a>  <a href="https://pod.link/1568662122">Pod.link</a> (provides links to subscribe via your favourite platform)   Episode 1 — Curiosity is&nbsp;Human <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e01-curiosity-is-human/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>We discuss concept of curiosity with guests Paul Ashcroft and Garrick Jones. The conversation explores the historical evolution of curiosity, its role in innovation, and its impact on emotional and physical well-being. The guests explore into how curiosity can be nurtured like a muscle and its significance in the age of AI and digital transformation.</p>  Paul Ashcroft: “Essentially you can hack your own biological system just by being curious.”  Garrick Jones: “It’s fascinating how I think the curious and the innovative were relegated to the ninth level of hell, which is the worst hell in Dante’s Inferno. And because they want to mess with the structures.”   Episode 2 – Credentials &amp;&nbsp;AI <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e02-credentials-ai/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Tim Riches and Omid Mufeed join us to discuss the evolution and future of Navigatr, a platform focused on skills recognition through Open Badges. They highlight the role of AI in simplifying the badge creation process and its potential to personalise learning pathways. The platform aims to bridge the gap between skills and employment opportunities, offering a live jobs feed linked to&nbsp;badges.</p>  Omid Mufeed: “Why can’t we have the technologies that tell us what to learn next to change our&nbsp;lives?”  Tim Riches: “It’d be great if you could just kind of switch the app on wherever you were…and it could start to show you things which just got you interested first and got you engaged in learning and then started to open up opportunities for&nbsp;work.”   Episode 3 — Cognitive Liberty <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e03-cognitive-liberty/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Laura and Doug tackle the ethical and societal implications of AI. They discuss its potential as a ‘thought partner’ in decision-making, the concept of cognitive liberty, and the risks of AI entrenching existing power structures.</p>  Laura Hilliger: “How do we ensure that people keep cognitive liberty if they’re being manipulated by these algorithms or by&nbsp;AI?”  Doug Belshaw: “Our democratic and civic infrastructure is being replaced by decision-making tools which are beholden to a small&nbsp;elite.”   Episode 4 — Public Service and&nbsp;AI <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e04-public-ai/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Matt Jukes comes on the podcast to discuss his career journey, which spans various roles in the public sector, including his current (at the time) position at the Office for National Statistics. He talks about the challenges of digital transformation in the public sector, emphasising the importance of user needs and data. Matt also shares his views on leadership, AI, the role of blogging, and the need for a supportive culture to drive&nbsp;change.</p>  Matt Jukes: “Ministers particularly are fascinated with [AI] and are pushing departments and and digital teams and their policy people across every corner of government to to see how it can be&nbsp;used.   Episode 5 — Workforce development <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e05-workforce-development/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Prof. Krystal Rawls joins to advocate the importance of community involvement in technology adoption, particularly in bridging the digital divide. She emphasises that solving community issues is not just about providing devices but also about removing the fear of innovation and technology. Krystal argues for a more holistic, respectful approach to community needs, advocating for the use of AI and other technologies as tools for empowerment. She also touches on the ethical considerations of technology adoption, stressing the need to respect different cultures and perspectives.</p>  Krystal Rawls: “And so from my lens, things as simple as right, I have to train people on how to use this technology. How about I provide you with some prompts of AI and a training in AI and let you go and learn for yourself and interrogate for yourself the things that you need to know. And so I can be used in some really innovative ways to help close the digital&nbsp;divide.”   Episode 6 — AI&nbsp;Literacy <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e06-ai-literacy/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Doug and Laura wrap up the season by exploring the complexities of AI literacy, and emphasising the need for critical thinking and mentorship when interacting with AI tools. They discuss the limitations of AI, likening it to a “competent intern,” and discuss the ethical and societal implications of AI’s lack of transparency and potential for bias. The conversation also touches on the need for collective decision-making in AI governance and the importance of understanding the data on which AI models are&nbsp;trained.</p>  Doug Belshaw: “It’s interesting because one of the things that people have said is that it means that everybody gets a tutor now, but. Everyone doesn’t get a tutor as much as a research assistant.”  Laura Hilliger: “You know, when the when the printing press was was invented, it’s the time between the printing press being invented and like the masses being able to read because there is huge cultural and societal shift during like during these kind of in-between times. And I feel like with tech, we’ve been in that in-between time for 20, 30 years and with AI moving faster and faster, it feels like being web literate, information literate, media literate, tech literate, AI literate, anything that puts the literacy on it is, you know, is a it’s a moving target.&nbsp;Right?”   Next season <p>We’ve already begun recording Season 7 and are in the planning stages of Season 8, which will focused on Shaping a Media Literate Society: Exploring the Future Landscape of Media and Information Literacy.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shaping-media-literate-society-exploring-future-landscape/">Read more about Season 8&nbsp;here</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/a-deep-dive-into-the-ethics-literacy-and-application-of-ai-8536e1814017">A Deep Dive into the Ethics, Literacy, and Application of AI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>                <p>There is a growing unease about technology and its impact on our lives. Tech giants have grown too powerful. Our privacy is undermined. Social media is hurting our kids. Creators are not getting paid fairly. Disinformation and polarization are the norm.</p>
<p>While the solutions to these problems are largely human, (perhaps ironically) a new set of technologies can help to put us back on course: Blockchains, which enable individuals and businesses to move and store value, automate complex business processes are the first digital medium for value. AI is pushing the boundary of human and machine capability.  The Internet of Things connects everyday objects, robots and even self-driving cars to the web, forming an intelligent network for our connected world.  Augmented and virtual realities, extends our 2D web into a spatial web.</p>
<p>In this webinar, Alex Tapscott, author of the new book “Web3: Charting the Internet’s Next Economic and Cultural Frontier” explains how these technologies are not separate but related.  The Web is entering a new era and with it bringing a new internet and a new platform for the other technologies of a new digital age.   In much the same way as the term “Internet” has expanded from its original narrow inter-networking technical definition to describe an era that included many technologies, business models and social behaviors, so too is the term Web3 evolving to describe the next era with these technologies playing the defining role.</p>

<p>The following is part of an ongoing series by Elastos community leaders sharing key trends and takeaways from Token2049 and crypto events in and around Singapore. <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/hot-topics-at-token-2049/">Check out the last post</a> by Jonathan Hargreaves, Global Head of Business Development at Elastos. In this edition we hear from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sashmitchell/">Sasha Mitchell</a>, Founder of <a href="https://ela.city/home">Elacity</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the get-go, as soon as I landed at the Changi airport in Singapore, I had little time to spare before heading straight to the Bitcoin Layer 2 event hosted by <a href="https://elastos.info/digital-destiny/">Elastos</a>. Over the week, I came to learn extensively about the Web3 space at Token2049. This collective knowledge helped paint a picture of a future where data management is far more user-centric, secure, and efficient, and where governance can be transparent and accountable. For five key takeouts of Token 2049, you can read my article <a href="https://medium.com/@elacity2822/se-asia-is-pioneering-web3-five-key-take-outs-from-singapore-5135d212cd01">here</a>, in this piece, let’s discuss a little about Bitcoin Layer 2 and Elastos. Blockchain at its core is about bringing trust back into the system and creating trust in a trust-less environment, and I believe Elastos can deliver this alongside Bitcoin’s security, so let’s dive in!<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bitcoin remains the market leader with a $500 billion market cap, doubling its closest rival, Ethereum. Bitcoin’s hash rate measures the network’s computational power, serving as an indicator of its security and efficiency. It’s rising hash rate over the years signifies increased mining activity, making the network more resilient against potential attacks, despite price volatility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year, Bitcoin Ordinals has revolutionised non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by using Bitcoin’s architecture to transform “Satoshis” into unique assets through “inscriptions”. These shifts signal a future where Bitcoin’s role extends beyond a simple financial asset to become a versatile platform for various applications. This transformation is enabled by smart contracts and decentralized data management systems, which are components of scalable Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network and Elastos, which can settle back into the secure mainchain.</p>
<p>Something new I learnt about was Ricardian Contracts, which integrate legality and cryptographic verification, providing a digitally secure and legally binding agreement. By hashing the contract and providing a unique identifier, we can ensure that all parties can easily verify the most current and authentic version of the agreement. This approach addresses issues of document versioning and legality, thereby revolutionising the digital contract landscape. Ricardian Contracts blend smart contract features with traditional legal agreements, allowing for preset, executable actions across multiple blockchain architectures, including Bitcoin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It became clear to me that Elastos can redefine Bitcoin’s ecosystem with its <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/decentralized-identifiers-transforming-digital-identity-management/">DID</a>, <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/hivehub-evolving-decentralized-storage-in-the-elastos-ecosystem/">Hive</a>, and <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/carrier-2-0-an-evolution-in-connectivity/">Carrier</a> technologies, serving as the foundation for “Personal Knowledge Containers.” This next-gen Layer 2 storage solution surpasses traditional methods like NAS and Dropbox, using a robust tech stack including Istio, Docker, IPFS, Tor, and libp2p to enable peer-to-peer trading using Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols and decentralised web nodes. The objective is to categorise data assets hierarchically into files, pages, and services, thereby enabling peer-to-peer trading alongside Bitcoin Layer 2 payment protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Elastos can help facilitate this environment through its <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/how-dids-solve-issues-of-digital-identity/">decentralised identifier sidechain</a> which acts as a control hub, and support storage solutions through Hive, and Carrier for peer-to-peer networking. With <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/the-access-economy-decentralized-identity-digital-rights-and-ownership-in-the-age-of-web3/">Elacity DRM</a> enabling data packaging and <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/runtime-the-missing-piece-of-web3/">Runtime</a> innovation for secure playback, Elabox’s plug-and-play OS service, and <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/essentials-wallet-adds-bittorrent-chain/">Essentials</a> SuperWallet’s toolsets that incorporate Elastos and already support the Lightning Network, it becomes evident our ecosystem and innovations are all capable of converging to a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution.</p>
<p>To further explore Bitcoin Layer 2, it’s worth noting that Elastos’ mainchain is secured by Bitcoin miners’ hash power. This architecture enables a secure, decentralized ecosystem in which ELA, Elastos’ native currency, plays a pivotal role. ELA serves not only as gas to pay for transactions across the ecosystem but also as collateral and voting power to annually elect 12 DAO council members for governance. These council members vote on wide-ranging proposals, from funding to infrastructure, and also become supernodes that power Elastos’ sidechains. ELA-elected council nodes enhance the platform’s security beyond the mainchain and facilitate infinitely horizontally scalable solutions, such as its EVM sidechain for smart contracts.</p>
<p>Being directly connected to Bitcoin, our main chain offers additional avenues for innovations like Ordinal NFTs. These could alleviate congestion in Bitcoin’s NFT network through the potential use of sELA inscriptions. With a limited coin supply of 28.22 million and built-in halving mechanisms, ELA shares strong similarities with BTC. It leverages its role as a ‘Queen’ in security, complemented by a suite of innovative supporting services, DAO governance and sidechains.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Amidst past upheavals like FTX and Three Arrows Capital, the prospect of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs injects the tech space with much-needed liquidity and optimism. As traditional systems falter, the emerging Web3 landscape offers a parallel economy rooted in freedom. The excitement in Singapore showcases fresh thought leadership, transformative tech, and new economic models. I had the chance to meet many interesting people from many different fields. With continuous innovations, the sector inches closer to realizing Web3’s promise of a digitally interconnected world. And for Bitcoin and Elastos, don’t underestimate the power these two technologies and communities can bring as a merged mined solution. </p>
<p>All signs indicate that 2024 will be a pivotal year for the space!</p>

<p>This article describes the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/post-mortem-ceramic-discord-breach/">problem of session hijacking</a> and how you can create a more secure session by combining <a href="https://login.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Sign-in with Ethereum</a> and non-extractable keys from the WebCrypto APIs.</p> The Problem <p>A session is established in essentially all applications where users sign in. These sessions typically rely on cookies, JWTs, or similar technologies. The way they are established is roughly as follows: a user arrives at an application and authenticates in some way, usually through signing in with a username and password. The application's backend server verifies the login and creates a valid session for the user.</p><p>The session itself is stored locally in the user’s browser as a cookie or JWT. Unfortunately, this client-side data can be stolen. This is normally referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking?ref=blog.ceramic.network">session hijacking</a>—and this exact attack recently caused a <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/post-mortem-ceramic-discord-breach/">breach of the Ceramic discord server</a>.</p><p>Session hijacking works when a hacker is able to intercept the user's JWT (or other session ID). They can then use this locally on their computer to fool the application backend server into thinking that they are in fact signed in as the user. Once they are signed in, they could take all kinds of malicious actions not approved by the user.</p><p>An unfortunate fact is that in many cases, Sign-in with Ethereum is also vulnerable to this because the suggested way sessions are established is <a href="https://docs.login.xyz/sign-in-with-ethereum/quickstart-guide/implement-sessions?ref=blog.ceramic.network">through cookies</a>. So, what can we do about this?</p> Non-Extractable Session Keys <p>The main problem with the sessions outlined above is that the data that authenticates the session can be stolen. What if there was a way to have a session where this information was impossible to copy? Well, in fact, the &nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web Crypto API</a> provides provides such functionality. This API can (among other things) be used to generate cryptographic key pairs. By default, both the public and the private key for these key pairs live in memory on web pages, which wouldn't improve the situation at all.</p><p>However, the private key can be made “non-extractable” by setting the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CryptoKey/extractable?ref=blog.ceramic.network">extractable property</a> to false. This makes it impossible for any JavaScript code or browser extension to access the private key material, effectively making it impossible to steal it. These keys can also be persisted in your application by storing them in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API?ref=blog.ceramic.network">IndexedDB</a>.</p><p>It's worth noting that this solution is not perfect. If a malicious script somehow gets injected into the client, it may still use the user's key while they have their tab open. However, as soon as the tab is closed, the hacker could no longer use this key, which is a significant improvement from complete loss of a session.</p> How to use DIDSession <p>Ok, so how can we use this to make our Sign-in with Ethereum sessions more secure? <a href="https://did.js.org/docs/introduction?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DIDSession</a> is an open-source library that we created at Ceramic to make it easy to use non-extractable keys to secure Sign-in with Ethereum sessions. This library treats your Ethereum address as a <code><a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">did:pkh</a></code>and the non-extractable session key as a <code><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">did:key</a></code>. A SIWE signature is used to delegate permissions from your Ethereum address to the session key. A server can then verify that a message originated from a session key that has been granted permissions from the Ethereum account. To use DIDSession, you first need to install it in your application.</p> Creating a session <p>First we create a session. The code below will prompt the user to sign a SIWE message and finally a session will be created. This session will automatically be persisted in IndexedDB.</p> <code>import { DIDSession } from 'did-session'
import { EthereumWebAuth, getAccountId } from '@didtools/pkh-ethereum'

const ethProvider = window.ethereum // Metamask, WalletConnect or similar
const addresses = await ethProvider.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })
const accountId = await getAccountId(ethProvider, addresses[0])
const authMethod = await EthereumWebAuth.getAuthMethod(ethprovider, accountId)

const session = await DIDSession.get(accountId, authMethod)
</code>  Sign a message and send to server <p>Using the session, the application can now sign any arbitrary message and send this message and the object-capability (SIWE message) along to a server. All signed messages will happen in the background without any further action required by the user.</p> <code>const jws = await session.did.createJWS({ hello: 'world' })

const request = {
  capability: session.did.capability
  jws,
}

// send the request object to your backend server
</code>  Validate user action on server <p>Once the request is received on a server, its signature can be verified; simply looking at the object-capability we can see which user took the given action.</p> <code>import { DID } from 'dids'
import * as KeyResolver from 'key-did-resolver'

const did = new DID({ resolver: KeyResolver.getResolver() })

const result = await did.verifyJWS(request.jws, { capability: request.capability })

console.log('User account:', request.capability.p.iss)
console.log('User action:', result.payload)
</code>  Benefit of Using Ceramic <p>While DIDSession can improve security of SIWE, when interacting with a backend server, we can take applications one step further by storing user data on a decentralized network. This is the reason we built Ceramic, and DIDSession is the native way to write data into the protocol.

<p>Dear Community Members,</p>
<p>We have an important update regarding a class action settlement related to a securities lawsuit involving Elastos Foundation, Rong Chen, and Feng Han. This lawsuit alleges that these parties violated federal securities laws by selling unregistered securities in the form of ELA tokens during Elastos’ Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2018, as well as through their Lock-In Program and on secondary markets between January 1, 2018 and July 27, 2023.</p>
<p>The good news is that the parties involved have reached a proposed settlement of $2 million to resolve these claims. This means that you, as members of the community who purchased or acquired ELA tokens during the specified timeframe, may be entitled to a share of this settlement.</p>
<p>To claim your share of the settlement, here’s what you need to do:</p>
 
 Submit a Claim Form: You must complete and submit a claim form, which is available at <a href="http://www.elastossecuritieslitigation.com">www.ElastosSecuritiesLitigation.com</a>, before the deadline on December 6, 2023. This form is essential to ensure that you are included in the distribution of settlement funds. 
 Opt Out or Object: If you have concerns or wish to opt out of the settlement, you have until December 1, 2023, to take action. This is your opportunity to voice any objections or decide not to participate. 
 Stay Informed: Mark your calendars for the settlement hearing scheduled for December 22, 2023. This is where the final decisions regarding the settlement will be made. 
 
<p>The proposed allocation plan for distributing the net settlement funds to authorized claimants is also outlined in the notice, providing transparency about how the funds will be divided among eligible community members.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that class counsel intends to seek attorney’s fees and costs, which will not exceed 30% of the total settlement amount. This fee will be deducted from the settlement funds before distribution.</p>
<p>In essence, this is your opportunity to secure your rightful share of the settlement if you purchased or acquired ELA tokens during the specified period. You are welcome to take the necessary steps and visit <a href="http://www.elastossecuritieslitigation.com">www.ElastosSecuritiesLitigation.com</a> to access the claim form and stay updated on the proceedings.</p>

		<p>Despite evidence of the positive impact of female participation in leadership roles of corporations, women remain consistently under-represented in business ventures, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. For the U.S. economy to expand and produce jobs at an accelerated rate, women must account for a much higher percentage of entrepreneurial leaders throughout all phases of the innovation life cycle. Female academicians face disproportionately low engagement in the technology transfer process, both in the initial invention disclosure submission as well as in the patenting process (1-4). This investigation sought to both establish a baseline for measuring U.S. academic institutions’ tracking of inventors by gender and gain insight about the barriers keeping technology transfer offices (TTOs) from tracking gender in commercialization-related areas. The researchers also conducted an initial analysis on the leading software tools currently being utilized to track gender in academic TTOs. Raising awareness of this issue on a national level will help institutional leaders create strategies and mechanisms to help address the issue of gender disparity and increase the inclusion of women in the innovation lifecycle, particularly at the university disclosure and patenting level.</p>

		<p>Diversity is a key driver of innovation and a critical component of success on a global scale. Countries that deploy strategies to foster greater inclusion of all inventors in the innovation lifecycle will ultimately be best positioned to maximize their gross domestic product and ensure economic prosperity. The U.S. is losing ground because it is not fully engaging a significant portion of the inventive talent pool. According to a 2019 report from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the share of women among all U.S. inventor-patentees is only 12.8%.<br>
In an effort to understand factors that encouraged and discouraged academic women’s participation in technology commercialization, a group of technology transfer professionals conducted a survey of academic women involved in innovation, invention and/or entrepreneurship. The 168 respondents were from public and private research institutions of varying sizes from all regions of the U.S. This paper outlines the key findings from the qualitative and quantitative data around the themes that emerged. It also puts forth a set of recommendations based on the survey feedback, follow-up interviews, and the collective experience of technology transfer professionals who work daily with academic innovators. It is our hope that these recommendations will provide valuable insights into concrete actions that can be taken to ensure systemic changes that foster greater engagement of academic women and other under-represented populations in all stages of the innovation lifecycle.</p>

<blockquote><p>NIST’s Digital Guidelines are respected and referenced throughout the world so why does New York leave open the potential for ambiguous technology implementations which could be based on standards which are not parallel with efforts to support RON?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Michael Magrath, Director of Identity Policy and Industry Relations, Easy Dynamics Corporation</p>
<p></p>
<p>New York State, the financial capital of the world, undoubtedly sits at or near the top of most cyber criminals’ “hit list”. But it has fallen short when it comes to recent regulatory acts pertaining to identity and authentication.&nbsp; Two recent actions in different departments are alarming during this age of deep fakes and nation-state cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Identity Proofing for Remote Online Notarization (RON)</p>
<p>While RON has been available for a few years, the pandemic was the catalyst for wider spread adoption and use throughout the U.S.&nbsp; New York is no exception and recently revised its RON regulation.&nbsp; On January 25th the New York Department of State amended Title 19 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR), Chapter V, Subchapter E, Part 182 as it relates to RON. Section 182.7.a reads, “Identity proofing must meet, at minimum, the Identity Assurance Level 2 standard as outlined in the Digital Identity Guidelines of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), as referenced in subdivision (b) of this section, or any industry accepted standard that is at least as secure, or more secure, than that standard.”</p>
<p>“Or any industry accepted standard at least as secure, or more secure, than that standard?”&nbsp; Huh?!! “Secure” according to which certification body?&nbsp; NIST’s Digital Guidelines are respected and referenced throughout the world so why does New York leave open the potential for ambiguous technology implementations which could be based on standards which are not parallel with efforts to support RON? In addition, unforeseen risk and exposure may occur due to lack of “uniformity” needed for both RON service providers and all relying parties.</p>
<p>Identity Assurance Level 2, commonly referred to as IAL2 is defined in NIST’s the Special Publication 800-63-3 suite of documents, specifically 800-63a, which is part of the SP 800-63-3 suite of documents last revised in 2017 and currently in the process of being updated.&nbsp; Federal agencies must comply with NIST’s guidance and over the years many state, county and local governments as well as commercial entities have embraced 800-63-3.&nbsp; Many have written 800-63-3 certification as a requirement for vendors into RFPs.</p>




<blockquote><p>Regulations should be “black and white”, as far as is possible.&nbsp; In the case of IAL2 for RON, black and white was possible, but NY regulators opted for gray leaving vendors, state agencies and commercial organizations with questions</p></blockquote>








<p>No doubt, the regulation caught the attention of all RON vendors given New York’s population and position in the financial industry.&nbsp; To date, states that have enacted laws permitting RON have for the most part written portions of MISMO’s RON standards into their laws, which have no requirement to comply with NIST’s IAL2. MISMO is short for the Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Organization, according to its Wikipedia entry, MISMO is “a not-for-profit, wholly owned subsidiary of the Mortgage Bankers Association responsible for developing standards for exchanging information and conducting business in the U.S. mortgage finance industry.”&nbsp; With all due respect to the MBA, RON laws and regulations should not be developed by a trade organization’s subsidiary.</p>
<p>Most vendors meet IAL2 by combining the scan of a government issued identity document such as a driver’s license or a passport, a bank statement or utility bill, with a selfie that can be checked for liveliness. This provides assurance that it is really a live person’s face and not a recording or a mask that simply looks like someone else that is compared using biometric algorithms.&nbsp; The documents are also checked to be authentic and verified to provide confidence in the asserted identity’s validity.</p>
<p>Regulations should be “black and white”, as far as is possible.&nbsp; In the case of IAL2 for RON, black and white was possible, but NY regulators opted for gray leaving vendors, state agencies and commercial organizations with questions.</p>
<p>Proposed Amendments to the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Cybersecurity Regulation </p>
<p>The regulation, 23 NYCRR 500, places cybersecurity requirements on all Covered Entities (financial institutions and financial services companies).&nbsp; Last November, NYDFS <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/cybersecurity">proposed a second amendment</a> to 23 NYCRR Part 500 the regulation regarding cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies (the Second Amendment). After a public comment period, on June 28, 2023, a revised proposed Second Amendment was published in the New York State Register. Although the regulation still requires MFA, it is not so restrictive as to mandate a specific NIST Authenticator Assurance Level as defined in NIST’s Digital Identity Guidelines. Financial services organizations may select from a variety of authentication solutions.&nbsp; Under the proposed Second Amendment changes to multi-factor authentication (Section 500.1) include “Multi-factor authentication means authentication through verification of at least two of the following:</p>
 
 knowledge factors, such as a password, 
 possession factors, such as a token [or text message on a mobile phone]; or 
 inherence factors, such as a biometric characteristic” 
 
<p>Passwords?&nbsp; SMS?&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; At a time when federal agencies are mandated to implement zero trust and use phish-resistant authenticators (passwords, one-time password tokens and SMS are not), New York is amending a cybersecurity regulation to include phishable authenticators.&nbsp; Why do this when modern phishing-resistant authentication is available?&nbsp; Sorry New York. In 2023 no cybersecurity regulation pertaining to authentication should include passwords and SMS.</p>
<p>Due to security issues in 2017 NIST classified SMS OTP as a ‘restricted’ authenticator meaning organizations or users would be taking a risk using SMS as part of two-factor authentication, exactly how the proposed Second Amendment is written.&nbsp; Why take such a risk especially when we are talking about accessing financial systems? I would encourage the NYDFS to join the FIDO Alliance and Kantara Initiative.&nbsp; FIDO standards are mature and recognized and adopted across the world. Moreover, FIDO has a stringent product certification program and maintains a certified products list which will enable Covered Entities to procure phish-resistant authentication.</p>
<p>As with RON, NYDFS should leverage NIST’s Digital Identity Guidance – Special Publication 800-63B applies to Authentication and Lifecycle Management.&nbsp; As with enrollment and identity proofing, NIST has defined three authenticator assurance levels: AAL1, AAL2, AAL3.&nbsp; AAL1 does not require MFA (passwords are acceptable) and while AAL3 is per NIST, “is based on proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. AAL3 authentication requires a hardware-based authenticator and an authenticator that provides verifier impersonation resistance”, aka phishing resistant.</p>
<p>For some industries AAL3 may be too cumbersome. However for financial services, I would argue, AAL3 met with a FIDO certified security key would be appropriate.&nbsp; For many organizations, AAL2 is acceptable based on the level of risk should the account be compromised.&nbsp; Per NIST, “AAL2 occurs by the use of either a multi-factor authenticator or a combination of two single-factor authenticators. A multi-factor authenticator requires two factors to execute a single authentication event, such as a cryptographically secure device with an integrated biometric sensor that is required to activate the device.”</p>
<p>Trustmarks and Certified Products Differentiate the “Haves from the Have Nots” </p>
<p>NIST defines guidance but does not assess and certify vendors. &nbsp;The federal government no longer maintains an approved products list of credential service providers and instead recognizes Kantara Initiative, a globally recognized, non-profit certification body for NIST’s SP 800-63-3 under the Kantara Assurance Program.&nbsp; Kantara’s five-person Assurance Review Board (ARB) even includes a representative from NIST. &nbsp;The ARB is the body that reviews assessments and awards the 800-63-3 Trustmark to vendors.</p>
<p>I will note there is a distinct difference between a vendor claiming they meet IAL2 for RON or AAL2 or AAL3 in what I hope would be in the final version of the revised NYDFS cybersecurity regulation and being assessed and awarded a Trustmark.&nbsp; I have been employed by vendors that could claim that they technically met the IAL2 and AAL2 requirements but were never assessed or awarded a Trustmark.</p>
<p>Kantara’s Assurance Program goes well beyond technical requirements and includes non-technical requirements that vendors must first self-attest to and later provide evidence to a Kantara-accredited, independent, third-party assessor. They confirm that the service can actually do what the vendor claims. Some examples include:</p>
 
 Is the vendor financially solvent? 
 How long do they retain personally identifiable information (PII)? Where is it stored and how is it secured? 
 How do they obtain user consent? 
 Do they have a privacy policy in place? When was it last revised? 
 Does the vendor have a Security Awareness and Training Policy applicable to all employees? 
 Do they have an Information Security Management Plan? When was it last revised? 
 
<p>While many RON vendors may qualify for Kantara Trustmark, as of today, none have been approved directly. Some may, however, be partnered with credential service providers that have been certified.&nbsp; One exception is Proof (formerly Notarize) which was recently awarded a Trustmark and is listed on Kantara’s <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-status-list/">Trust Status List. </a>To thwart the ambiguity in identity and authentication regulations, I recommend that procurement officers in New York (and the other 49 states) require a Kantara Trustmark to meet the intent of the regulation.</p>

 Part 1: From Folksonomy to&nbsp;Taxonomy CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p><a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/What_Are_Open_Badges%3F">Open Badges</a> exist to democratise the means of credentialing: anyone can issue a badge for anything. The trouble is that it can be difficult to do so, because people tend to describe things using folksonomies: “Oh yeah, they’re a good listener”</p><p>This article expands on our recent posts about endorsement, offering a method for aligning <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/Open_recognition">Open Recognition</a> with skills taxonomies. For example, “good listener” is reframed as “active listening”.</p><p>The approach we outline helps you gather useful information by talking to people you know, both personally and professionally. It also helps you use an AI assistant to do some of the laborious work and do what machines do best: pattern-matching.</p><p>Here’s the 10-step&nbsp;process:</p>  Come up with questions for your contacts and put them in an online&nbsp;form  Share the online form with relevant&nbsp;people  Organise the answers you get in a way that’s easy to understand  Ask an AI assistant to review the answers and give you a&nbsp;summary  Instruct the AI assistant to review skills taxonomies  Compare the skills you’ve identified with taxonomies to see how they match&nbsp;up  Summarise your skills using a&nbsp;table  Come up with the metadata for Open Badges based on your skills (coming in Part&nbsp;2!)  Create badges using an online platform (coming in Part&nbsp;2!)  Ask contacts to endorse your badges (coming in Part&nbsp;2!)  <p>In our experiment, we gathered 20 responses within a 24-hour time period by explaining the process via social media posts. We’ll use this example to bring the process to&nbsp;life.</p><p>We’ll cover steps one through seven in this post and save steps eight to ten, which deal with turning skills into badges, for Part&nbsp;2.</p> 1. Come up with questions for your contacts and put them in an online&nbsp;form <p>The simpler the better. For this experiment, we started off with one contextual question which used checkboxes. We followed this with three diagnostic questions that allowed for free text&nbsp;entry.</p><blockquote>In what context do you know this&nbsp;person?</blockquote><blockquote>Tick all that&nbsp;apply</blockquote><blockquote>Professional — we have worked together&nbsp;directly</blockquote><blockquote>Professional — we have interacted but not worked&nbsp;together</blockquote><blockquote>Professional — other</blockquote><blockquote>Personal — I am a family&nbsp;member</blockquote><blockquote>Personal — I am a&nbsp;friend</blockquote><blockquote>Personal — other</blockquote><blockquote>What do they know a lot&nbsp;about?</blockquote><blockquote>This could be a subject area (e.g. ‘Geography’) or something more specific (e.g. ‘Identifying rare books’). Feel free to go into&nbsp;detail.</blockquote><blockquote>What are they particularly skilled&nbsp;in?</blockquote><blockquote>This could be a hard skill (e.g. ‘coding in Python’) or a human skill (e.g. ‘facilitation’). Feel free to give examples and&nbsp;context.</blockquote><blockquote>What behaviours do they exhibit which you, or others, find&nbsp;useful?</blockquote><blockquote>This is a catch-all for everything else that makes this person different/valuable to others. You might want to talk about their impact on the work you’ve done, or something you’ve observed that doesn’t fit elsewhere.</blockquote><p>We used <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms">Google Forms</a> to collect answers. Make sure the form is visually appealing and straightforward. Specify who should complete it, like people who know you well, and include links to any privacy policies.</p><p>Based on our experience, people are more willing to fill out forms if they’re anonymous, and this approach tends to yield better feedback.</p> 2. Share the online form with relevant&nbsp;people <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/">LinkedIn</a> is a good platform for sharing the survey, but we also posted on the Fediverse via our <a href="https://mastodon.social/weareopencoop">Mastodon&nbsp;account</a>.</p><p>You might want to email the form to certain people or groups as well. If you’re using LinkedIn, consider tagging individuals you’d like to hear from, especially those you’ve worked with recently.</p> 3. Organise the answers you get in a way that’s easy to understand <p>Google Forms has a handy way to export to a spreadsheet:</p><p>Go to ‘File / Download’ and generate a PDF which can be referenced by an AI assistant such as&nbsp;ChatGPT.</p><p>Ensure that you’ve turned word wrapping on so that none of your data gets&nbsp;hidden.</p> 4. Ask an AI assistant to review the answers and give you a&nbsp;summary <p>You can view the conversation I had with ChatGPT 4 at <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/e51b8ffa-a564-4ca8-9afa-09c66b7825cc">this link</a>. However, we’ll break it down and give you the prompts and if you want to use them yourself.</p> Give some context and upload your&nbsp;PDF <p>We used the <a href="https://askyourpdf.com/">AskYourPDF</a> plugin for ChatGPT. Here is the prompt we&nbsp;used:</p><blockquote>I’m going to share a PDF with you, so I’ll need an upload link. The contents of a PDF are responses to an online form. Here is the introductory text:</blockquote><blockquote>— — —</blockquote><blockquote>Open Recognition in your network [EXPERIMENT]</blockquote><blockquote>👋 Hello! Thanks for filling out this form, which should take less than 5 minutes. This will form an example for an upcoming article showcasing how Open Recognition can work in practice, mapped against skills taxonomies. We do not capture your name or identifiable details, so any words you enter will not be attributable to&nbsp;you.</blockquote><blockquote>Please complete this form as honestly as possible. Your results will be captured using this Google Form (privacy policy), combined with those from other people, and fed into ChatGPT (privacy policy) to map against skills taxonomies. WAO may also store the data on other platforms, in accordance with our own privacy&nbsp;policy.</blockquote><blockquote>We appreciate you taking part. This example is for Doug Belshaw. If you know and have interacted with Doug in a personal or professional context, please continue to fill out this form. If not, thanks for your interest but please do not continue. All questions are optional. 🙂</blockquote><blockquote>— — —</blockquote><blockquote>Once you’ve given me the upload link and I’ve given you the doc_id, we’re going to analyse the responses to the questions to:</blockquote><blockquote>1. Synthesise results</blockquote><blockquote>2. Discover&nbsp;patterns</blockquote><blockquote>3. Match attributes against skills taxonomies</blockquote><p>After you input this text, you should get a link to the AskYourPDF website, where you’ll be asked for the document ID of the PDF you upload. Just copy/paste it into the chat&nbsp;window.</p> Check the&nbsp;summary <p>AI assistants sometimes get things wrong, so check the summary ChatGPT generates. Ours looked like&nbsp;this:</p><p>You could ask ChatGPT for deeper analysis — for example, segmenting what your personal contacts said about you, compared with what your professional contacts indicated.</p> 5. Instruct the AI assistant to review skills taxonomies <p>To compare skills, we need a reference list. In this experiment, we used a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-skills-taxonomies-may-2022">review of skills taxonomies</a> on the UK government website. A direct link to the relevant PDF can be found <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078099/Review_of_skills_taxonomies_report_prepared_for_the_SPB_May_2022.pdf">here</a>. It references the <a href="https://data-viz.nesta.org.uk/skills-taxonomy/index.html">O*NET</a> (USA), <a href="https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en/about-esco/what-esco">ESCO</a> (EU), and <a href="https://data-viz.nesta.org.uk/skills-taxonomy/index.html">Nesta</a> (UK) skills taxonomies.</p><p>To upload the PDF, do as you did earlier: use ChatGPT to get a link that lets you upload the document through the AskYourPDF plugin. Here is the prompt we&nbsp;used:</p><blockquote>I need another PDF upload link. This is from the GOV.UK website and is an “Independent report. Review of skills taxonomies: May 2022. This paper, commissioned by the Skills and Productivity Board, assesses the usefulness of existing skills taxonomies in relation to the work of the&nbsp;board.”</blockquote><p>ChatGPT then summarises the paper, explaining what the different skills taxonomies are useful&nbsp;for.</p><p>We’re interested in all of the skills taxonomies, as O*NET focuses on skills at a higher level than ESCO and&nbsp;Nesta.</p> 6. Compare the skills you’ve identified with taxonomies to see how they match&nbsp;up <p>ChatGPT can now see data from two PDFs. The first has feedback from your contacts about your strengths. The second contains data about skills taxonomies. We can now use this information to match what people say you’re good at with lists of skills used by different organisations and platforms.</p><p>Here’s the prompt we&nbsp;used:</p><blockquote>So now that we’ve got some examples of skills taxonomies, I’d like you to take what we learned about Doug Belshaw from the online form and match it against a list of work-related skills.</blockquote><blockquote>List them all in bullet-point form with a justification for&nbsp;each.</blockquote><p>ChatGPT produced the following:</p><p>Some of these are obvious, but others are perhaps less so. It’s useful to have the specific terminology to use to describe your&nbsp;skills.</p> 7. Summarise your skills using a&nbsp;table <p>Having the list from the previous step is helpful, but it’s even better to compare the data in a table format. Here’s the prompt we used to do&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>Now create a table from this data in a way that I can copy/paste</blockquote><p>ChatGPT produced the following:</p><p>While we’re more than just words in boxes, having a structured way to be able to talk about our skills with people and systems is incredibly impactful.</p><p>Listing your ‘top 10 skills’ just became a whole lot&nbsp;easier.</p> Conclusion <p>Completing this process is highly valuable for understanding the skills your network attributes to you. However, sometimes people struggle with the confidence to reach out even to people they know and trust. So, ideally, the above workflow would consist of automated prompts for you and messages to your contacts.</p><p>The second post in this series will outline ways in which you can convert these skills into Open Badges. By doing this, you can showcase skills using any platform using skills taxonomies that are readable by both humans and machines.</p><p>If you use this approach, please share your results with us and your network! We’d love to see how this works for&nbsp;others.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/using-open-recognition-to-map-real-world-skills-and-attributes-1c1109c1b871">Using Open Recognition to Map Real-World Skills and Attributes</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Specifications 

<p></p>

<p>Creating specifications is one of the most important things we do at Blockchain Commons, because it allows developers to work together in interoperable ways, and thus creates a more resilient ecosystem for all of our digital assets.</p>

<p>IETF. In July we attended IETF 117 with the goal of advancing some of our specifications into standards that will allow their wider use.
We had a meeting on Gordian Envelope as well as a slot for talking about dCBOR as part of the CBOR meeting, and both allowed for notable advancement of those specs.</p>

<p>dCBOR. Our Internet-Draft for dCBOR has been changed from being “implementation details” to being an “application profile”, which makes it a description of how an application might implement a subset of CBOR —&nbsp;in this case to produce deterministic results. With this understanding in place we have released <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/05/">v05 of our dCBOR draft</a> and feel confident that we are zeroing in on a spec that will be accepted by the CBOR community.</p>

<p>More recently we also wrote a very short research paper on our preferred encoding of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-008-dcbor-date.md">dates in dCBOR</a>.</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope. Our discussions at IETF 117 also allowed us to finalize negotations for which CBOR tags we can receive from IANA. As a result, we’ve been able to tighten up the Envelope spec in a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-envelope/">new draft</a> by simplifying the core of Envelope and minimizing the tags we used. Simultaneously, we received the registration of <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml">CBOR Tag #200</a> for Gordian Envelope. Note this was a breaking change, but because of the official IANA recognition and the IETF guidance and support, we feel quite comfortable with the newest iteration of Gordian Envelope going forward.</p>

<p>The updated spec also trimmed a lot of features from Gordian Envelope, to allow for its more general use. However, we’re reintroducing those features through new research papers, which cover <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-003-envelope-known-value.md">known values</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-004-envelope-symmetric-encryption.md">symmetric encryption</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-005-envelope-compression.md">compression</a>.</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope Attachments. We’ve also developed a major new feature for Gordian Envelope: <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-006-envelope-attachment.md">attachments</a>. These encode vendor-specified data, allowing for the inclusion of specific, typed data, either in an open and interoperable way or in a private way, as an individual vendor prefers.</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope Keys &amp; Seeds. Finally, we published two more research papers, covering the storage of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-007-envelope-output-desc.md">Bitcoin output descriptors</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-009-envelope-seed.md">seeds</a> in Gordian Envelopes. We think these will again improve interoperability, and as a result Envelopes are now the preferred method for exchanging keys, seeds, and output descriptors in our reference apps.</p>

<p>If it’s not obvious, nailing down the fundamentals of Gordian Envelope allowed for a very creative period of expansion and extension for the format. We’re very grateful to IETF for working with us to reach this spot and are thrilled to have extended the community of Gordian developers to this larger organization.</p>

 Code &amp; Libraries 

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fyICk0lwL0#t=3143s"></a></p>

<p>Our specifications become reality through reference libraries and reference apps that we make available to developers interested in implementing our protocols. In addition to all our work on dCBOR and Gordian Envelope, we were able to make notable expansions here as well.</p>

<p>Rust Libraries. We have been developing new versions of all of our core cryptography libraries (including Envelope and SSKR) for Rust. Besides performance and type safety advantages, this also allows for easy usage on Android. The libraries are now in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions/116">community review</a>. We’re looking to see if they meet your needs, so please let us know!</p>

<p>Rust Envelope CLI Tool. Using our Rust libraries, we are also working on a new version of our Envelope CLI written in Rust. It’s a <a href="https://github.com/wolfmcnally/bc-envelope-cli-rust">Rust crate called <code>nvelope</code></a>. It’s very similar to our existing Swift CLI, but without default commands, requiring more precise usage. We’ll be continuing to work on this for full release next quarter.</p>

<p>GST 1.6. We also have done some continued work on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS">Gordian Seed Tool</a> to support both the changes in the Envelope spec and the ability to exchange Envelopes containing metadata with our <code>envelope-cli</code> as a proof of concept for how third-party developers can interchange data. An example of the functionality can be found in the video of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fyICk0lwL0#t=3143s">July Developers Meeting</a>. Participants in our public Testflight for GST should also be able to download GST 1.6 at this time.</p>

 Articles &amp; Discussions 

<p><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/self-sovereign-computing/"></a></p>

<p>We supplement our specs and apps with a variety of documents and articles, explaining our philosophies and documenting ways to support them.</p>

<p>Return to SSI. Self-sovereign identity was one of our first pushes, even prior to the incorporation of Blockchain Commons. Its ideals of independence and privacy remain some of our most important goals. This quarter Christopher followed up on his foundational <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">“Path to Self-Sovereign Identity” article</a> with a new look at <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">“The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>. Seven years on, self-sovereign identity has prospered and spread, but in some cases it’s moved away from its original intents, which the new article discusses. Christopher also penned a piece on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/self-sovereign-computing/">“Self-Sovereign Computing”</a> which talks about self-sovereignty in the larger computing ecosystem, and how we can be the captains of our own vessels on the digital seas.</p>

<p>The concepts of self-sovereign identity aren’t just philosophical musings. They’re very important ideals that affects the safety of their users. In the past, incorrectly used identity has literally led to genocide. Working to prevent this sort of misusage is another of the origins of self-sovereign identity, which Christopher wrote about in an advance reading for Rebooting the Web of Trust 12, called <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot12-cologne/blob/main/advance-readings/ssi-echoes-from-history.md">“Echoes from History: Designing Self-Sovereign Identity with Care”</a>.</p>

<p>Return to Musings. The article on “The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity” was part of Christopher’s “Musings of a Trust Architect” column, where he writes about many of the architectural, security, and privacy decisions underlying our work at Blockchain Commons. This quarter also saw the publication of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Least-Necessary/">“Least &amp; Necessary Design Patterns”</a>, where he discussed a few different ways to look at the protection of data through minimization. Varying viewpoints in this way is important because it can give us new insights into tough security problems.</p>

<p>Return to #SmartCustody. #SmartCustody is a cornerstone of self-sovereign identity because it supports the resilient control of self-sovereign assets. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md">multisig scenario</a>, which describes how to use simple tools to maintain digital assets using a multisignature, received an update this quarter to integrate it with the newest versions of <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/passport/">the Passport wallet</a> and <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">the Sparrow coordinator</a>.</p>

 Web Site Revisions 

<p></p>

<p>Websites help us to organize our documentation and make it easily available. They saw two major expansions in Q3.</p>

<p>Developer Website. We have created a new website at <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/">developer.blockchaincommons.com</a> that collects together all of our info on eleven different specifications and other projects, plus our architectural overviews — all of which was previously scattered across several different repos. The overviews of the specs are supplemented by FAQs, test vectors, use cases, and developer documentation. Take a look! And, if there’s a category of documentation that you want for a specific page, and it’s not there <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/issues">let us know!</a>.</p>

<p>As part of this work, we also created new pages for some of our specifications that had previously received less description. This includes pages on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/dcbor/">dCBOR</a>, <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/lifehash/">LifeHash</a>, and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/oib/">Object Identity Blocks (OIBs)</a>.</p>

<p>Life with Alacrity. Some of the foundational concepts behind Blockchain Commons were originally written for Christopher Allen’s <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/">Life with Alacrity blog</a>. That’s where “The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity” was originally published as well as articles on Dunbar’s Number, community sizes, collective choice, and more. This last quarter we converted the old site over to a GitHub Page using Minimal Mistakes, to make sure it remains a great resource for the future. (There’s still some clean-up of tags to do, and we want to make it look a little nicer!)</p>

 Coming Next 

<p>For the coming quarter we’re going to by trying out a new salon style similar to our <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salons</a> and <a href="http://www.tokenethics.com/">#TokenEthics</a> meeting: Expert Round Tables. These round tables will allow experts to both answer and ask questions about a specific area of expertise, to improve our joint understanding of the topic.</p>

<p>Our first Expert Round Table will be on Schnorr. We’ve already got a few experts lined up, but if you are currently studying or implementing Schnorr, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">contact us</a> to apply to participate. (The whole Round Table will of course be open for viewing too, just be sure you’re signed up to our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/">Signal channels or mailing lists</a> to receive notice when we lock down the date and guest list.)</p>

<p>For the fourth quarter we also plan to finalize the Rust envelope-cli, move GST 1.6 to release (mainly pending an update to restore PSBT compatibility with Sparrow), and continue work on our reference tools for Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR).</p>

<p>In early 2022, The Engine Room’s permanent ED, Julia, was still out on extended medical leave, as she underwent treatment for breast cancer, and our Acting ED (and long time Deputy Director, Zara) <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/transitions-at-the-engine-room-some-updates-on-whats-next/">was on her way out</a>. Our new interim ED, GIllian, was coming into the organisation with deep roots in community work but none in digital rights or tech. Laura and Paola, the new Deputy Directors had moved into these positions from programmatic management roles, but without organisational leadership experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this happened within the context of Covid-19 and the unstable ground it gave us to walk on. While there may have been ways for us to mimic a traditional vertical style of leadership, the idea fit poorly, like a bad outfit three sizes off. So these unexpected events and calls to build on shaky ground had us running towards co-leadership as an opportunity to claim health and well-being for everyone at TER and ourselves, while building strength and resilience.</p>



<p>At The Engine Room, we may have developed our current shared leadership model as much from happenstance and opportunity as we have from any specific plan, but over a year and a half into this work, we’re taking a moment to reflect. On what’s worked, what hasn’t, what we’ve learned along the way and where we’re casting forward into the future — with a whole lot of intentionality.</p>

 Our approach to building a co-leadership model 



<p>Co-leadership looks different for every leader (and every organisation) who is practising it. While the norm is still the single-leader model — whether in a corporate setting or small local NGOs — we believe that a shared-leadership approach can be more responsive to context, leverage the skills and capacities of individuals, and result in a more resilient organisation. For some, it may seem daunting. For us, the attention and dedication to the process has been worth it!</p>



<p>We believe co-leadership is transformative because:<br><br>It allows for talented people with diverse lived experiences and skill-sets to develop their own leadership style, while also having the space to rest and recharge. – Julia<br><br>It resides in a feminist understanding of collaboration that celebrates divergent thinking and the belief that what is created collectively is something no one person could have come up with individually. – Gillian<br><br>We can stand in solidarity with each other by supporting each others’ wellbeing, building on one another’s strengths, and complementing each other’s work and vision. – Paola <br><br>It builds muscles, practices and skills that we can then turn towards tackling and dismantling other hierarchies and inequities. – Laura</p>



<p>We’ve approached the evolution of our leadership model as a journey, not a set of rules written in stone. While we’ve read and borrowed from a number of resources (check out the list at the end of this piece for some of them), we’ve carved this path ourselves. This has enabled us to explore ideas in the open, practise our patience, solidarity and kindness to each other as we go, and stay humble as we navigate cross-cultural communications, build trust, and deal with a host of unexpected twists and turns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Relying on organisational targets and milestones to guide us, together with related (and clarified, and re-clarified) responsibilities and a refined list of organisational values, has helped us stay on track as individuals, sub-groups and as a collective. As you’ll see here and in the accompanying booklet, it’s brought greater organisational resilience and diverse expertise to TER’s leadership.</p>

 A few things we’ve learned along the way 



<p>Along our journey, we’ve learned endless lessons as a group, as individuals, with the rest of The Engine Room team, and with partners and peers. Though not all of these will be relevant to you and your journey (or curiosity!), dig into them below and in the accompanying booklet.</p>



 
 Organising our work and collaboration around organisational targets — the work we set out to do and the changes we want to see internally and in the world – gave us more grounding than sticking to static role descriptions. 



 It’s been possible to move quickly while collaborating, as long as we stayed flexible and trusted each other. While we had weekly meetings with all four of us, we also emphasised the importance of meeting as groups of three and every possible dyad (7, if you wanted to know). By trusting one another to move forward in a variety of clusters best placed to meet opportunities, responsibilities and organisational needs, we were able to keep projects and priorities moving and make space for rest. 



 There are actually four “I”s in our team (does that make us good leaders and bad spellers?). By which we mean, part of what kept things moving along was that we acknowledged, respected and celebrated what we each excelled at as individuals, rather than assuming we all had to do things the same way.&nbsp; 



 The promises of more resilience and wellbeing can be true. By trusting one another, we were able to actually leave our work at work when we stepped out of the office. For Julia and Gillian, who’d been single EDs before, this was truly noteworthy and impactful.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 If we feel something, we have to say something.&nbsp; A leadership team of four from four different sets of lived experiences can mean a lot of learning from our differences. Some of this surfaced in the leadership work we did on DEI alongside our organisational DEI initiative. We practised navigating disagreement or tension, regardless of scale or importance, by speaking up and listening closely when someone else spoke up. 



 There will be radical differences in the experience. Along the way, we learned more about the ways our experience as a leadership group was different from, or impacted, the experiences of team members. For example, we learned that it was important to communicate what we knew when we knew it, even when we didn’t fully understand something ourselves, which often meant prioritising transparency over our own comfort.&nbsp; 



 Cultivating trusting relationships and shared understanding – especially in multicultural and remote settings – takes time and intentionality. Give it the time that it needs, and take forward the efforts on a daily basis.&nbsp;

 If you’re looking to adopt shared or co-leadership 



<p>Go for it! While there’s a lot to learn, the journey is worthwhile. Some tips we’ve picked up include:</p>



 
 Communicate, communicate, communicate. And communicate some more. In particular:
 
 Share with the rest of the organisation (and your partners, peers, board and/or funders) what you mean when you’re talking about shared leadership, co-leadership and power-sharing, and what that will look like in practice. It can be tricky to be clear, but that clarity is fundamental for others to join the ride.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Double check on who is responsible for what among your co-leaders, and be open to being checked on. This requires not just a clear set-up of responsibilities — based around where each person’s strengths will have the greatest impact — but a routine practice of sharing what you’re working on. 



 Check your assumptions about what your co-leaders know versus what the wider team knows. Even though (or especially when) a decision has been discussed at length amongst co-leaders, the rest of the team wasn’t there, and transparency will require revisiting conversations about context, constraints, goals, visions and, only then, the decisions themselves. 
 
 



 Get comfortable sharing, and hearing, doubt and discomfort. It could be helpful to set up a process for voicing doubts, vetoing and/or for how decisions should be made (even when there’s no doubt or discomfort). 



 Scheduling meetings, especially across broad swaths of time zones, might be your nemesis. Approach it with proactiveness (try to get things on the calendar as early as you can), flexibility (get comfortable moving meetings) and, if you can, support (thank you Jen!).&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Build in time to adjust to diverse conversation styles, especially when leaders come from different cultures, language backgrounds and work environments. This can involve practices like getting comfortable with asking/receiving clarifying questions and building meeting agendas in advance so everyone can arrive with the necessary information.

 Looking at the path ahead 



<p>Where we sit now, we’re committed to co-leadership, power-sharing and exploring alternate ways of building strong and resilient organisations. In some ways, what this looks like going forward is much like what it has looked like until now: employing intentionality and care to navigate both the expected and the unexpected! In other ways, it will look different.&nbsp;In the short term, we’ll be saying farewell to Laura — who, after six years at TER, leaves the organisation with a deep love for and belief in the whole The Engine Room team!&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can’t wait to see what the future of sharing power and leadership looks like at The Engine Room,&nbsp;and even more so in the organisations and movements around us as we build technologies, digital spaces and, ultimately, societies that are more just.</p>



<p>If you want to learn more about what our process has looked like, reach out to Julia, Gillian, or Paola. We’d love to hear from you!</p>

 Three lenses to improve your digital&nbsp;strategy Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>“You’ve got to have a system”, as they say. At WAO, we’ve got one that we often apply to strategy projects of all shapes and sizes. Especially digital ones. And it’s easy to remember! 3Ps: People. Process. Product*.</p><p>In practice, the 3Ps are a series of lenses we use with clients to ensure that we’re thinking through projects holistically. Below, we give an introduction on how to use it in practice.</p><p>*A note on the ordering — when we’re talking, we find it easier to say “People. Product. Process” rather than “People. Process. Product”, don’t you? But you can put them in any order, it’s up to&nbsp;you!</p> The Power of&nbsp;People <p>The foundation of any successful organisation is the people who are a part of it. When we talk about ‘People,’ we’re talking about the individuals who make up organisational teams, along with your stakeholders (such as your board), as well as the audience you serve. We also make sure to think about community members and volunteers who are furthering an organisation’s mission through their engagement. We place people at the heart of our approach to prioritise the building of meaningful relationships and also to promote diversity. After all, if we’re not working to strengthen connections and help people find purpose, what are we&nbsp;doing?</p><p>We find that people&nbsp;need:</p>  Common language — there are often too many buzzwords in business, so clear and effective communication ensures that everyone understands one another. Having a shared understanding of a problem or a solution starts with the language we use.&nbsp;Synergy!  Bias towards open — create a more inclusive and engaging environment by encouraging open communication and embracing diverse perspectives. That means not just letting your files languish in unshared folders and making sure people have an opportunity to engage with the&nbsp;work.  Established trust — improve decision-making by creating a positive working environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and supported. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">Nonviolent communication</a> strategies help here, even though the name is a bit&nbsp;weird.  <p>The anthropologist Margaret Mead is credited with&nbsp;saying:</p><blockquote>“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever&nbsp;has.”</blockquote><p>Behind every good project, initiative, and product are a group of talented people, working together. To harness the creativity and innovation of that group, we need to remember that they are humans with thoughts and feelings, as well as biases and complexities. Every group of people is different, so listening to the individuals you are working with and for is priority number&nbsp;one.</p> Streamlining Processes <p>By ‘Process,’ we mean the workflows and approaches that enable organisations to work effectively and sustainably. Efficient and well-structured processes play a crucial role in achieving an organisation’s strategic goals. It also leads to a more satisfying, productive, working environment.</p><p>We think that the following leads to better processes:</p>  Adaptability in teams — the world is always changing, so organisational processes should be flexible and adaptable enough to change with them, to respond to new opportunities and new people. Flexibility isn’t just for gymnasts.  Challenge assumptions — it’s important for us all to reassess our existing beliefs, assumptions, and practices so that we can identify areas for improvement and innovation. Just because you’re used to doing things one way doesn’t make it the best&nbsp;one.  Data driven decision making — while Gary from Marketing might have a great idea, what does the data say? Organisation should base decisions and strategies on objective data and evidence rather than relying on intuition or guesswork.  <p>A hugely important piece of developing effective processes is ensuring that they work for the people who will use them. More often than not, this includes documentation. Potentially boring? Yes. Skippable? No.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that you have to have rigid processes. In fact, adaptability is the key to all of this, and there should be an expectation that an organisation’s knowledge base is kept up-to-date by whoever used it&nbsp;last.</p> Embracing Innovative Products <p>The ‘Product’ component of our approach refers to the software platforms and tools we use and develop to support collaboration among internal and external stakeholders. You’re reading this on a screen thanks to several products. We use them all of the time, so it’s important to get the right&nbsp;ones.</p><p>The best products&nbsp;support:</p>  Iterative strategies — organisations have to evolve to keep pace with changing circumstances, so the tools you use should enable you to continuously improve processes and outcomes. If you feel like you’re having to fight your tools, then perhaps they’re no longer the best&nbsp;ones?  Distributed power / Autonomy — every tool has one or more ‘default’ ways of being used. So we should both use and make tools available that enable users to make decisions as independently as possible.  Learning by doing — the tools we use and develop should solve real-world problems rather than create new ones for users. I’m looking at you,&nbsp;Clippy.  <p>It should be fairly easy to find products that support processes that help people work well together. Sometimes, though, it involves taking multiple products and linking them together in new and interesting ways.</p><p>Although salespeople would like to tell you otherwise, there’s likely no ‘one platform to rule them all’, so we recommend making use of other techniques. You might like our <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop">Architecture of Participation</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/content-is-king-queen-and-everything-inbetween-3c2fc4b1e19c">System Ecosystem</a> tactics to help make sure your bases are&nbsp;covered.</p> Getting Started with this&nbsp;approach <p>If you want to use the ‘People, Product, Process’ approach within your organisation, consider the following steps:</p>  First, take a step back and have a good look at your organisation’s culture. Think about how you can improve things like people management, communication, and teamwork. This might involve taking your digital strategy out of the desk drawer. Or, indeed, writing&nbsp;one.  Next, check out your current processes and workflows. Find any points of friction and opportunities to make things smoother. A diagram might come in handy to visualise all the&nbsp;things.  Now it’s time to explore some tools and tech to help boost your team’s collaboration and productivity. Give them a test run and see which ones might work. Let other people try them&nbsp;out.  Following this, it’s all about crafting a plan to bring those changes and improvements to life. Make sure your team’s in the loop and excited about the process by being open and keeping them in the&nbsp;know.  Last but not least, keep an eye on how things are going with your new approach. Embrace the iterative mindset and tweak things as needed to keep things moving&nbsp;forward!   Conclusion <p>This approach provides a really simple but powerful series of lenses to unlock your digital strategy’s true potential. It’s designed to be a versatile approach, catering to organisations of all shapes and&nbsp;sizes.</p><p>So, if you’re ready to embark on this transformative journey and could use some guidance, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">let us know</a>!

<p>Steering Committee Elections<br>
DIF’s new Steering Committee has been elected! The results will be revealed on the DIF Blog on 2 October and our new members will be invited to join the upcoming Steering Committee meeting on 5 October. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Human-Centric Digital Identity<br>
DIF is thrilled to contribute to a landmark paper, <a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Human-Centric_Digital_Identity_Final.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Human-Centric Digital Identity for Government Officials</a>, published this week.</p>
<p>The paper was announced during the OECD Panel on Recommendations for Digital Identity Governance on 26 September. It was commissioned by The OpenID Foundation and edited by Elizabeth Garber and Mark Hainewith, with input from 12 contributing organizations including DIF.</p>
<p><br>
Source: Human-Centric Digital Identity for Government Officials</p>
<p>DIF's Executive Director, Clare Nelson, commented: "DIF is honored and delighted to be a contributor to the Human-Centric Digital Identity white paper. Many DIF members work on national identity programs, and need a single source that spans everything from policy to threat modeling. We thank OpenID for taking leadership to commission and organize this effort, including collection of input from numerous industry experts."</p>
<p>ID Day<br>
DIF joined dozens of other organisations to celebrate Identity Day (ID Day) on 16 September. The campaign by ID4Africa seeks worldwide recognition of the fundamental right and practical necessity of having proof of identity in today’s digital age. The chosen date symbolizes UN Sustainable Development Goal 16.9, which aims to provide legal identity including birth registration to all individuals by 2030.</p>
<p>DIF is delighted to become an Official Coalition Partner of ID4Africa and is committed to supporting Executive Chairman Dr Joseph Atick and his team to raise awareness of ID Day, decentralized identity and key use cases.</p>

<p>Next Generation Authentication Workshop<br>
Members of the DIF Korea SIG and Steering Committee member Markus Sabadello were among attendees at the 2023 Next Generation Authentication Research Society Workshop in Yongsan, Seoul earlier this month.</p>
<p>The event was hosted by the Korea Institute of Information Security and Cryptology (KIISC). Strong interest in Decentralized Identity was evident, with Decentralized Identifiers, Verifiable Credentials, eIDAS, Digital Wallets, Selective Disclosure and Multi-Sig Credentials among the topics presented and discussed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>More about this event on the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/dif-attends-conference-on-next-generation-authentication/">DIF blog</a>.</p>
<p>JP Morgan Onyx Hackathon<br>
DIF is supporting a Digital Identity Hackathon sponsored by Onyx by JP Morgan. This 4 week innovation sprint challenges participants to reinvent the future of online identity security and privacy, with prizes for helping to improve the Onyx SSI SDK in 5 areas: add support for a new DID method or support the Universal Resolver, provide support for JSON-LD Credentials, implement a new Credential Revocation scheme, implement the SD-JWT spec for selective disclosure, implement support for OIDC, DIDComm or Presentation Exchange.</p>
<p>Our thanks to Steering Committee members Markus Sabadello and Sam Curren, who inspired many participants to dive into relevant DIF tools and protocols with workshops on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gKJDGKX21Q&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Universal Resolver / Universal Registrar</a> and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4Xtn1xWxfw&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Introduction to DIDComm</a> (you can view the workshops on YouTube by clicking the links).</p>
<p>GSM Association adds its support to BBS<br>
<br>
Image © GSMA</p>
<p>The GSM Assocation, which represents the interests of mobile network operators worldwide, has declared its support for the <a href="https://identity.foundation/bbs-signature/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">BBS Signature Scheme</a>. GSMA Europe highlighted the need for accelerated standardisation of BBS and definition of its end-to-end use in its <a href="https://www.gsma.com/gsmaeurope/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GSMA-Official-Response-Privacy-for-eIDAS-June-2023.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Official Response on eIDAS 2.0 and Privacy</a></p>
<p>Here is an exerpt from the paper: "In the context of eIDAS 2.0 this translates as follows: 1. Identification of “strictly necessary” information: there is a need for the definition / standardisation of requests and the acceptable attributes to be requested for each purpose (i.e., for each use case). We would welcome and participate to an EC initiative tackling this point.2. Technical means to provide only the “strictly necessary” information: protocols or technologies need to support the minimisation of shared information, including supporting Yes/No questions. To our knowledge, the only current technology that can achieve this is ZKP (particularly combined with a ZKP-enabled signature scheme of the BBS+ family)."</p>
  🛠️ Working Group Updates

In this edition we hear from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-hargreaves-18a6701/">Jon Hargreaves</a>, Global Head of Business Development at Elastos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://elastos.info/digital-destiny/">Elastos</a> was in Singapore recently for <a href="https://www.token2049.com/">Token2049</a>.

<p>Over the course of a week, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-hargreaves-18a6701/">Jon Hargreaves</a>, Global Head of Business Development at Elastos observed many trends, which we want to share with you here:</p>
 <p>Elastos Growth Lead, Fakhul Miah at Eth Singapore</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the key themes of Token2049 was regulation, highlighted at the show by the open hostility to the US regulatory mindset versus the praise for practical solutions in Singapore and other parts of Southeast Asia.&nbsp; Indeed this was not limited to Singapore but extended to announcements from the United Arab Emirates with perhaps Europe showing the most comprehensive regulation framework.&nbsp; Hong Kong too was chomping at the bit but with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-26/jpex-crypto-fraud-probe-in-hong-kong-tests-embrace-of-retail-trading?embedded-checkout=true">JPEX</a> being given a warning by the SFC and shutting their stand after day 2, it took away some of the anticipation!</p>
<p>A lot of the regulation talk was about getting it right as the sector changes shape over the next three years. Scams dominate the mindset in the US (thanks Luna/ FTX) and at the show, even Asian geographies such as Australia are indexing regulating scams as the primary focus for legislation.&nbsp; Yet there was also a ground swell of more innovative thinking perhaps led by Franklin Templeton.</p>
<p>During a panel aptly titled, “The Future of Crypto Currency as an Asset Class”, <a href="https://www.franklintempleton.com/profiles/jenny-johnson">Jenny Johnson</a> shared her conviction of Bitcoin’s ability to revolutionize traditional financial services. She forcefully outlined the limitations of traditional ETFs as prices are only updated twice during the trading day and explained how they are exploring the possibility of mutual funds that operate on blockchain technology.&nbsp; A move driven by the belief in the future of the technology as a creative platform that drives cost out of system as reflected in approval from the SEC for their on-chain fund that will use Stellar and Polygon blockchains to process transactions and record ownership.</p>
<p>This theme of new forms of crypto was everywhere from talk of ETFs to bitcoin ordinals and other complex tools linking to real-world assets such as carbon credits.&nbsp; These new encrypted digital assets that move beyond even traditional crypto formats also highlighted the need for payment rails between these assets and fiat currencies.&nbsp; We sounded out many partners on how Elacity was pioneering this transition and followed up with news on <a href="https://www.einpresswire.com/article/656681536/elacity-partners-with-the-metaverse-bank-to-bring-seamless-payments-and-nfts-to-the-world-s-creators">Elacity’s partnership with Metaverse Bank</a> to illustrate how open banking is central to this solution.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This highlights the other significant take away from Token2049 namely that the focus was on Web3 rather than just crypto. From the launch of the <a href="https://www.mocaverse.xyz/">Mocaverse</a> to CZ’s dial-in (literally) and exploration of adjacencies, the future was clearly about innovating in decentralised systems.&nbsp; The story that epitomised this more than any other was <a href="https://ton.org/">The Open Network</a> announcing an integrated wallet into the telegram messaging app enabling 800 million users to store, send and trade directly within the application.</p>
<p>Here, despite the best efforts of the SEC to block the original Telegram Open Network (TON) open-source developers have created 551 applications leading to the birth of TON – The Open Network.&nbsp; So enabling the self-custodial wallet, called TON Space, will further enhance the user experience by enabling direct access to the TON blockchain and Web3 ecosystem. Users will be able to send and receive TON tokens, BTC and USDT on the Tron Blockchain using the wallet and so facilitating the entry of mainstream users into the crypto world. This is another example of the importance of payment rails for the future or failure for Web3.</p>

 The revolution of unifying intelligent algorithms like ChatGPT will occur in the blockchain field 
<p><a href="https://www.token2049.com/">Token2049</a> Singapore was a wonderful opportunity for members of Elastos leadership, the Growth Team and some Ecosystem partners to explore the future of blockchain and Web3 in person. This article is the first of a series of features where our team share their revelations from the conference, consider technological advancements and discuss much-needed future developments for Web3’s continued expansion.</p>
<p>We start with Sunny Feng Han, Elastos’ co-founder and international academic, as he explores how Bitcoin and smart contract computation on public blockchains can coalesce to bring BTC to DeFi in a way that has hitherto never been possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The true meaning of blockchain is that it provides humanity with a unified “truth” algorithm for the first time.</p>
<p>We learned the above on September 12th, 2023, during TOKEN2049 in Singapore, at the “Web3 Asian Power” summit co-hosted by 1783DAO and BoLianCaiJing. Sunny Feng Han, a Columbia University exchange PhD student and visiting scholar, former blockchain consultant for Huawei’s Central Research Institute, and co-founder of Elastos, shared his vision for the blockchain industry – emphasizing the importance of a unified cognitive system and intelligent algorithms, and the key role of BTC blockchain in making this vision a reality.</p>
<p>Sunny Feng Han first highlighted the tremendous potential of blockchain technology in creating a unified cognitive system and intelligent algorithm. The immense success of ChatGPT in the AI field indicates that the unification of intelligent algorithms across disciplines is entirely achievable. Professor Ben Koo and Sunny Feng Han began offering a course titled: “Beyond the discipline’s Foundations of Cognition”, at <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University</a> as early as 2015.</p>
<p>He believes that by leveraging the development of BTC Layer 2, and basing it on BTC timestamps, it is possible to connect the algorithmic consensus and cognitive rules of smart contracts across various public chains, breaking the barriers of asset and transaction rights/recognitions between different public chains. This innovation in unifying the digital asset and transaction rights/recognition system will not only be a technical advancement, but will also bring revolutionary changes to the entire human economic and social system.</p>
<p>Sunny Feng Han pointed out that a key characteristic of the blockchain revolution is its ability to provide a “timestamp” for digital asset transactions. The Bitcoin network has ensured that no counterfeit coins have ever been produced over the past decade thanks to this robust mechanism, an achievement no other currency system in human history has accomplished. This is also the foundational assurance that Bitcoin can surpass the volume of gold by 2025 because it guarantees the absolute correctness of the causal order of asset transactions.</p>
<p>Along with this technical innovation, Bitcoin’s PoW mechanism will play a pivotal role in realizing a unified public chain rights recognition system in the future. Elastos, whose consensus design instigated by Jihan Wu (cofounder of BitMain) incorporates merge-mining with Bitcoin, currently ranks second in terms of hash power in the PoW system. Elastos is thereby naturally a strong supporter of the BeLayer2 (BeL2) test network being researched and developed at the moment.</p>
<p>The technical stack that the BeL2 team is working on is based on the results from the <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/">MIT Digital Currency Initiative</a>. This technology uses zero-knowledge proofs to unite the “timestamps” of different public chains and smart contracts, potentially enabling seamless connections between the Bitcoin public chain and smart contract blockchains. Therefore, different blockchains can share a unified “timestamp” from the Bitcoin network, so a combined asset rights and transaction system spanning Bitcoin and Ethereum public chains could potentially be established.</p>
<p>Sunny Feng Han believes that the true significance of blockchain is that it offers humanity a panoptic “truth” algorithm for the first time. In the past, people had to rely on various authorities to determine what is true and correct, but blockchain, through its distributed computing, timestamps, and consensus mechanisms, has established the authenticity and accuracy of transactions and assets as an indisputable computational standard.</p>
<p>This has profound implications for eliminating false narratives and deception like in the story, “Point at a Deer, Call it a Horse”[1]. Blockchain renders subterfuge and obfuscation by nefarious actors utterly moot as the timestamps are transparently available on the BTC ledger – proof is truth.</p>
<p>Learn how Elastos is <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastic-consensus-technical-overview/">uniquely placed</a> to lead the charge with BeL2, given our long history of AuxPoW, which enables <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQVuO0nT8pQ">merged mining&nbsp;</a>with Bitcoin, allowing the network to benefit from the security and mining power of Bitcoin while retaining its own integrity. As a result, miners can receive rewards in both ELA and the merged coin simultaneously.</p>

<p>[1]Point at a Deer Call it a Horse: Unreal Socialism in Chinese Performance &amp; Video Art.“</p>
<p>Cul De Sac Gallery (65 — 69 County Street, London, SE1 4AD) March 2 — April 21, 2013</p>
<p>“Point at a Deer Call it a Horse” is based on the Chinese idiom “Zhi Lu Wei Ma 指鹿为马”  – to confuse right and wrong, to distort reality through misrepresentation, to deceive.</p>
<p>Historically, it dates back to Zhao Gao, a prime minister of the Qin Dynasty who, in 207 BCE, used dissent to test the court, gauging their loyalty by presenting the emperor with a deer and saying, “This is a horse.” This metaphor for the curatorial rationale has a clear presence in all of the works on display, further reinforcing the show’s notion of “unreal socialism”.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This approach to VCs is innovative because it brings together different elements from several of the existing approaches to VCs. It is based on the usage of <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">BBS+ JSON-LD Signatures</a>, which is a subclass of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">LD Signatures</a>, in combination with a JSON-LD credential schema. The cryptography behind this mechanism is BBS+ Signatures, which require what’s called a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-03">pairing-friendly</a> curve. Existing implementations in the VC ecosystem use the elliptic curve <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-02#section-2.4">BLS12–381</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This specification defines a set of cryptographic suites for the purpose of creating, verifying and deriving proofs for BBS+ Signatures in conformance with the Data Integrity [VC-DATA-INTEGRITY] specification.</p>

      <p>In general the suites uses the RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm [RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION] to transform an input document into its canonical form. It then uses the statement digest algorithm to digest each statement to be signed individually, finally the digested statements are signed using the defined signature algorithm.</p>

      <p>BBS+ signatures [CFRG-BBS-SIGNATURE] are compatible with any pairing friendly elliptic curve, however the cryptographic suites defined in this document elect to only allow the usage of the BLS12-381 for interoperability purposes.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>BBS signatures were implicitly proposed by Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham (CRYPTO ’04) as part of their group signature scheme, and explicitly cast as stand-alone signatures by Camenisch and Lysyanskaya (CRYPTO ’04). A provably secure version, called BBS+, was then devised by Au, Susilo, and Mu (SCN ’06), and is currently the object of a standardization effort which has led to a recent RFC draft. BBS+ signatures are suitable for use within anonymous credential and DAA systems, as their algebraic structure enables efficient proofs of knowledge of message-signature pairs that support partial disclosure.</p>

      <p>BBS+ signatures consist of one group element and two scalars. As our first contribution, we prove that a variant of BBS+ producing shorter signatures, consisting only of one group element and one scalar, is also secure. The resulting scheme is essentially the original BBS proposal, which was lacking a proof of security. Here we show it satisfies, under the q-SDH assumption, the same provable security guarantees as BBS+. We also provide a complementary tight analysis in the algebraic group model, which heuristically justifies instantiations with potentially shorter signatures.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Selective disclosure via BBS+ signatures […]</p>

      <p>Like monoclaim credentials allow users to share specific claims from a VC, BBS+ Signatures is a multi-message digital signature scheme (named after its creators Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham) that gives users the possibility of sharing VCs with only specific attributes revealed. How does it work?</p>

      <p>BBS+ signatures allow a VC holder to derive proofs from the original signature:</p>
       
         Deriving a proof: When a holder takes the signed VC and hides one, several, or none of the containing claims, creating a new signature (a derived proof) using the Issuer’s public key. This derived proof can prove that the holder knows all of the original claims contained in the VC but chooses only to reveal the required ones. 
         Verifying a proof: The verifier validates the derived proof using the Issuer’s public key. This process enables the verifier to confirm the validity of the proof, proving that the subset of claims was part of an original message signed by the Issuer.

    <blockquote>
      <p>BBS+ LD-Proofs use JSON-LD schemas, so credentials that use them can have a rich, hierarchical set of attributes. Instead of the heavy-handed mechanism for the encoding and canonicalization of attributes values that we’d imagined for Rich Schemas, they use RDF canonicalization and a hash function. Rather than expanding the credential definition, they discarded it, taking advantage of some properties of BBS+ keys which allow for deterministic expansion.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Blum Blum Shub (BBS) is used as a pseudo-random number generator (it is pseudo as it is not a truly random number, and where its randomisation depends on a random seed). It was created by Lenore Blum, Manuel Blum and Michael Shub in 1968. Blum Blum Shub uses the form of xn+1=x2n(modM), and where x0 is a random seed. The value of M is equal to pq, and where p and q are prime numbers. These values of p and q are both congruent to 3 mod 4 (p=q=3(mod4)). The security of the method involves the difficulty in factorizing M. It is slow, but is the strongest proven random number generator. For each step, we extract some of the information from xn+1, and which is typically the least significant bit. It would not be used within a cipher application, but could be used in key generation.</p>

      <p>What do we want from a pseudo-random sequence generator? Ideally, we would like a pseudo-random sequence generator to quickly produce, from short seeds, long sequences (of bits) that appear in every way to be generated by successive flips of a fair coin.</p>

      <p>Certainly, the idea of a (fast) deterministic mechanism producing such non-deterministic behavior seems contradictory: by observing its outcome over time, we could in principle eventually detect the determinism and simulate such a generator.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Digital signature schemes are a fundamental cryptographic primitive, of use both in its own right, and as a building block in cryptographic protocol design. In this paper, we propose a practical and provably secure signature scheme and show protocols (1) for issuing a signature on a committed value (so the signer has no information about the signed value), and (2) for proving knowledge of a signature on a committed value. This signature scheme and corresponding protocols are a building block for the design of anonymity-enhancing cryptographic systems, such as electronic cash, group signatures, and anonymous credential systems. The security of our signature scheme and protocols relies on the Strong RSA assumption. These results are a generalization of the anonymous credential system of Camenisch and Lysyanskaya</p>

<p>If you follow our blog, you might have seen our definition of digital resilience floating around. To sum all this up: <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/what-do-we-think-about-when-we-think-about-digital-resilience/" title="">we see digital resilience</a> as a set of practices that support the ability of an organisation to:</p>



 
 protect itself from, and respond to, digital security threats,&nbsp; 



 adopt infrastructures that respond to the ever-changing needs and contexts of the organisation and its members,&nbsp; 



 ensure their wellbeing. 
 



<p>Back in July we hosted an “Ask Me Anything” session about <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/ask-us-anything-digital-resilience-for-social-justice-organisations/" title="">digital resilience in social justice organisations</a> and one of the questions we received got us thinking more about point 2 in the list above:</p>



<p>Once an organisation has decided to shift to tech that is more aligned with their values, what are some good practices for creating easy to read/accessible documentation that helps the process of introducing free/safer/privacy respecting tools to their team, especially for people who might not have a tech background and aren’t familiar with these kinds of tools?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below we’re sharing some of the tips we shared during the AMA, along with some additional ideas for how you can approach the process of creating documentation that supports your team as you adopt tech tools.&nbsp;</p>



 Before rolling out a tool… 



<p>At The Engine Room, before rolling out a tool we try to have lots of conversations with the team and get on the same page in terms of why we’re adopting a new tool. If it’s a tool that we’re adopting as a more secure alternative to another popular tool (for example, adopting a self-hosted Big blue Button instance to use instead of Zoom),we discuss how these tools won’t necessarily make our lives easier, but they will make ourselves and our partners safer. We <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/" title="">test and pilot tools together</a>, weighing the pros and cons of our experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that process, there are a few things we try to hold on to:</p>



 
 Not using fear to pressure the use of a tool. Using fear to persuade is not ethical and only leads to stress and panic! We tend to raise awareness by fostering a sense of collective responsibility as opposed to individual fear. 



 Remembering that it is normal to feel a bit uncomfortable in a new environment, encouraging the team to take it easy and making sure everyone has access to tech support when needed.&nbsp; 



 Remembering that tech tools that are not self-explanatory: some may come with a learning curve, and might require training and support. 



 One tool won’t always fit all our needs and desires, so being flexible and balancing out our “must haves” vs “nice to haves” is super important. 
 



<p>On a more practical level, before rolling out a tool, we host introductory or welcome sessions to get everyone familiar with the new environment. In the first few weeks or months of piloting a new tool, we also encourage our team to exercise <a href="https://alixtrot.medium.com/technical-intuition-instincts-in-a-digital-world-a6bfda669a91" title="">tech intuition</a>, letting people explore the tool by themselves and making sure our Tech Team is around to offer support if needed.</p>



 Be clear on the “why” behind a new tool&nbsp; 



<p>One practice that has helped our team in adopting new tools is making sure our tech documentation includes a brief, direct overview of why we have chosen the tool. Our internal “guides” for the various tools we use include a short review of the context of adoption, including why and when the tool was adopted, what we use it for and how we use it. We find that this can be a simple, but effective way of reminding ourselves of our values and how they’re tied to our tech choices.&nbsp;</p>



 Create documentation specifically for you and your team! 



<p>We all know that useful documentation should cover the basics instructions of how to use tools and its main features. But we also find that, most importantly, your documentation should respond to specific use-cases you find in your workflow. For example, we use Big Blue Button and Jitsi for video conferencing. There are several public resources available about these tools (like <a href="https://gitlab.com/MaadiX/bbb-tuning/-/wikis/Manual-de-uso-2.3" title="">this one on BBB</a> or <a href="https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/user-guide/user-guide-start" title="">Jitsi’s official FAQ</a>), so our internal guide to the tools are short and straight to the point, covering the main questions our team members have had about them. We always make sure to link to external resources to have as references – because we don’t want to duplicate resources and we also want to avoid having to constantly update our internal documentation every time the external documentation is updated.&nbsp;</p>



 Keep it concise and use visual resources 



<p>General things we try to keep in mind when creating technical documentation:</p>



 
 Prioritise visual resources, (like screenshots, drawings and diagrams!) to help make things clearer. There are a few resources online that exemplify how this can be done: the <a href="https://totem-project.org/" title="">Totem project</a>, for instance, has online courses that include diagrams and images (we like this one on <a href="https://learn.totem-project.org/courses/course-v1:Totem+TP_IP_001+2018/about" title="">How the Internet works</a>!).&nbsp; 



 Avoid long paragraphs of text. When possible, we avoid overly narrating every single detail about the tool. Instead of “move the cursor to the right of your screen to open the menu…”, we try to go for “click on the menu on the right”. If someone needs a more detailed explanation, we make sure they have space to ask, and we offer to host an introductory session.&nbsp; 



 Synthesise as much as possible. Usually when we’re reading this kind of document, we’re not looking for long form text. We want direct, quick answers about something we haven’t been able to figure out by themselves.&nbsp; 



 Remember that people don’t “read” technical documentation, they skim it. We always try to keep in mind that people usually “scan” technical documents looking for specific answers. Formatting (when used intentionally) can help this process: using bold, italics, colours, creating “warning boxes” can help us highlight what is most important and make “scanning” easier for the reader.&nbsp; 
 



 Dealing with technical terms 



<p>Sometimes it’s hard to avoid using technical terms that some people might not be familiar with. If it is necessary to include technical words, we try to explain them briefly in context. We find that, depending on the tool, creating a glossary can also be a good idea (see <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/glossary/" title="">this example from Surveillance Self-Defense</a>!)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Tools change and evolve – your documentation should too! 



<p>We try to keep our tech documentation “alive”: team members can ask questions, make comments and suggest edits on the documentation itself (gitbook, which we use, allows this! Other tools do too!). Internally, our team leaves questions on our shared documents about things that aren’t clear and then the Tech Team updates the documentation as needed. This process is important because tools get updated from time to time, which often raises new questions and because the way we use tools may also evolve over time, it’s important that the documentation evolves too.&nbsp;</p>



 Make the documentation more engaging&nbsp; 



<p>As an attempt to make tech tool documentation a little less boring, we’ve experimented with:</p>



 
 Adding some encouraging commentary and encouraging tolerance to the frustration of not understanding everything (not understanding everything immediately is an expected part of adopting new technology!). And sometimes, even the support people themselves don’t know everything! &nbsp; 



 Using “Question and Answer” formats, to expand on the most common questions that come into technical support. 



 Including memes or GIFs (and even making jokes about the retro charm of the interfaces of some FOSS tools!). 
 



 Keep it human&nbsp; 



<p>Being a remote team that is committed to using <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/technology-in-the-service-of-justice/" title="">justice-based tech tools</a> as much as we can, having documentation about the tech we use is super important to our workflows. But written documentation isn’t everything. We find that having people on the team who we can actually talk to about these tools is super helpful. Other things to try are having “peer-to-peer sessions” to support each other as we learn to navigate new tools, and having live Q&amp;A sessions to address the problems or doubts that emerge when we’re working with something new.</p>

<p>Elastos emerges as a beacon of hope in the <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/the-evolution-of-the-internet-from-web1-to-web3-with-elastos-at-the-forefront/">Web3</a> world where online privacy and data ownership have become increasingly important. This platform offers individuals complete control over their digital assets. <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/unleashing-the-potential-of-decentralized-apps-with-carrier/">Active Proxy service</a>, the revolutionary feature on <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/carrier-2-0-initial-release/">Elastos Carrier</a>, allows users to host their own <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/web3-the-era-for-personalized-websites-powered-by-elastos/">personal website</a> from their local device, and ensures the website is accessible to the entire internet while users retain absolute ownership and control of their data.</p>
<p>Setting up a personal website via the Active Proxy service not only grants you full data control but also ensures privacy and reliability. It allows for secure global access, reduced latency, and tamper-proof content thanks to the blockchain technology. Moreover, Elastos provides streamlined tasks through the <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/sidechains/esc/">Elastos Smart Contract (ESC) sidechain</a>, simplified digital asset management via the <a href="https://elastos.info/essentials-the-super-wallet/">Essentials wallet</a>, trust establishment with <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/dids/intro/">Elastos DIDs</a>, decentralized domain names, and <a href="http://v">Digital Rights Management (DRM)</a> technology for enhanced control and content security, ultimately boosting monetization possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how to set up a personal website via the Active Proxy service.</p>
 Prerequisites 
 
 A Debian-based Linux distribution. 
 A domain name registered on pc2.net. 
 Basic command-line knowledge. 
 
 Step 1: Update Your System 
<p>$ sudo apt-get update</p>
 Step 2: Install Required Packages 
<p>Install the necessary packages and dependencies:</p>
<p>$ sudo apt-get install -y build-essential autoconf automake autopoint libtool cmake libncurses-dev git</p>
 Step 3: Clone Carrier Repository 
<p>Navigate to your home folder and clone the Carrier repository:</p>
<p>$ cd ~</p>
<p>$ git clone <a href="https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.Carrier.Native">https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.Carrier.Native</a></p>
 Step 4: Create a Build Directory 
<p>Change to the build directory inside the Carrier repository and create and name a directory:</p>
<p>$ cd Elastos.Carrier.Native/build</p>
<p>$ mkdir linux &amp;&amp; cd linux</p>
 Step 5: Generate Makefiles and Compile 
<p>Generate the Makefile files with this prompt:</p>
<p>$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=dist -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..</p>
<p>Then compile the Carrier with all options included using this command:</p>
<p>$ make &amp;&amp; make install</p>
<p></p>
 Step 6: Move Configuration File 
<p>Move the configuration file to the appropriate directory and rename it as “default.conf”:</p>
<p>$ mv ~/Elastos.Carrier.Native/apps/launcher/sample.conf ~/Elastos.Carrier.Native/build/linux/apps/launcher/default.conf</p>
 Step 7: Update Configuration File 
<p>Edit the configuration file using your favorite text editor, e.g., nano:</p>
<p>$ nano ~/Elastos.Carrier.Native/build/linux/apps/launcher/default.conf</p>
<p>Update the following lines in the config file under the “addons” section:</p>
 
 peerPrivateKey: Replace with your own peer private key. (Generate the private key as specified in step 13) 
 “domainName”: Replace with your registered domain name from pc2.net. 
 “upstreamHost”: Set to your local device’s IP address. 
 “upstreamPort”: Set to 8989 or the port you plan to use for your website. 
 
<p></p>
 Step 8: Launch Carrier 
<p>Run the following command to launch the Carrier service:</p>
<p>$ ./carrier-launcher -c default.conf</p>
<p>If you need to restart the launcher, use the following commands:</p>
<p>$ ps -e | grep carrier</p>
<p>$ kill -9 “IDprocess”</p>
<p>Run the command with the suffix “&amp;” to indicate that this command will run in the background.</p>
<p>Once the launcher is running, check the nodeId by using the command:</p>
<p>$ cat ~/Elastos.Carrier.Native/build/linux/apps/launcher/data/id &amp;&amp; echo</p>
<p>Use this base58 Node ID string when you register or update your pc2 domain name.</p>
 Step 9: Register a DDNS Domain 
<p>Go to pc2.net, need to use Essentials to get signed in with your DID, choose “REGISTER DDNS NAME,” enter your domain name and Node ID, and then click on “REGISTER.”</p>
<p></p>
 Step 10: Install Caddy Server 
<p>Download the Caddy server binary and move it to the /usr/local/bin/ directory, and make sure this /usr/local/bin is in the $PATH environment :</p>
<p>wget -O caddy&nbsp; https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/releases/download/v2.7.4/caddy_2.7.4_linux_amd64.tar.gz</p>
<p>tar -xzvf&nbsp; caddy</p>
<p>sudo mv caddy /usr/local/bin/</p>
<p>sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/caddy</p>
<p>Here we use Caddy service as an example of a personal web service. Users can replace their own dedicated personal service by deploying on LAN home, while being able to share it outside for the public.</p>
<p></p>
 Step 11: Create an example of Web content to set up your website 
<p>Create a directory for your website content and download your website files (e.g., AdminLTE) into it. Unzip the files if necessary:</p>
<p>$ mkdir ~/web</p>
<p>$ wget https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE/archive/refs/tags/v3.2.0.tar.gz</p>
<p>$ mv v3.2.0.tar.gz ~/web</p>
<p>$ tar -xzvf ~/web/v3.2.0.tar.gz -C ~/web</p>
 Step 12: Run Caddy Server 
<p>Start the Caddy server with the following command:</p>
<p>$ caddy file-server –listen 0.0.0.0:8989&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you can check it on your local environment by inputting an url like: <a href="http://your-local-ip-of-the-device">http://YOUR-LOCAL-IP-OF-THE-DEVICE:</a>8989</p>
<p>If another web service is already using the default port 80 on the device, you can use a different port for your web service.</p>
<p>Here the port needs to match the value of item “upstreamPort” in “default.conf”</p>
 Step 13: Generate Your Node Private Key 
<p>On the Carrier Network, every service is considered an equal peer. Services can be publicly announced within the network, and interested parties can retrieve information about a specific service by using its unique peer ID, which follows the same format as a Node ID. To maintain ownership of a service, the user responsible for it must generate and associate a peer ID, and each service peer must secure its operation by binding it to a private key.</p>
<p>To generate your private key node, follow these steps:</p>
 
 Clone the Elastos.Carrier.Java repository: 
 
<p>$ git clone https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.Carrier.Java.git</p>
 
 Compile the Java code: 
 
<p>$ cd Elastos.Carrier.Java</p>
<p>$ ./mvnw</p>
 
 Enter the shell directory and run the carrier-shell command: 
 
<p>$ cd shell/target/bin/</p>
<p>$ ./carrier-shell</p>
 
 In the carrier-shell, run the keygen sub command to generate a private key: 
 
<p>Carrier $ keygen</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the set of private and public keys are generated, then add “Private Key of Signature to the “default.conf” file for authentication.</p>
<p>After all steps are finished, you can then restart the carrier-launcher so the function works properly.</p>

<p>This blog was updated on September 28, 2023 to include an updated link that includes the session recordings.</p>
<p>OECD hosted a launch event on September 26, 2023 on the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/digital/digital-government/oecd-recommendation-on-the-governance-of-digital-identity.htm">Recommendation on the Governance of Digital Identity</a>, (note the session recordings at the bottom of the page) as adopted by the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/about/">OECD Council</a> in June 2023. The Recommendations guide its Adherents to develop and govern digital identity systems as digital public infrastructure. The launch event drew upon government officials in Japan, Brazil, Canada, India, and Italy, as well as experts from the OECD, UNDP, the EU Digital Identity Wallet Consortium (EWC) and the OpenID Foundation (OIDF) to comment on the Recommendations and the path ahead.</p>
<p>In OIDF Chairman Nat Sakimura’s comments, he applauded the comprehensive approach of the OECD Recommendations and the compass the Recommendations offer to digital identity standards bodies.&nbsp; Nat also announced the “<a href="https://openid.net/human-centric-digital-identity-whitepaper/">Human-Centric Digital Identity: for Government Officials</a>” whitepaper (cobranded by twelve non-profits) as a paper grounded in the OECD Recommendations and human rights that:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Explains the current global landscape and the values underpinning emerging models&nbsp; 
 Provides insights on how to enable inclusion, equity, privacy and security&nbsp; 
 Encourages a shift in the focus of design from organisations to humans&nbsp; 
 Offers a starting point on how the OECD recommendations may be delivered technically and operationally, while respecting domestic sovereignty&nbsp; 
 
<p>Furthermore, Nat called upon the OECD to be transparent in the scope of its role, and he called upon the global community to collaborate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We call upon the global community to participate collectively in a global dialogue to deliver on the OECD Digital Identity Recommendations, and close policy and standards gaps through coordinated plans and shared goals. Together we hope to see Digital Identity reach its full potential to be of service to 8 billion people, and not the privileged few.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The OECD provided a link to the whitepaper for reference. Nat Sakimura’s interventions from the panel discussion can be found in full below.</p>
<p>As context, the OECD Recommendation supports its Adherents’ efforts to ensure reliable and trusted access to digital identity for natural and legal persons that is portable across locations, technologies and sectors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Being able to prove who you are underpins access to a variety of essential services across the public and private sectors. As these services move online, digital channels have emerged to handle identity verification processes, proofs, and authentication of verified identity claims. As people increasingly access essential services online and even across borders, improving the governance and implementation of digital identity systems in line with user needs becomes ever more important.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Recommendations also advise officials to future-proof policies, promote cross-sector coordination, pursue international collaboration, and facilitate a healthy market for identity solutions among these key pillars</p>
 
 Develop user-centered and inclusive digital identity systems
 
 Design and implement digital identity systems that respond to the needs of users and service providers 
 Prioritise inclusion and minimise barriers to access to and the use of digital identity 
 
 
 Strengthen the governance of digital identity

<p>OpenID Foundation Chairman Nat Sakimura’s Intervention During OECD Panel</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>Thank you, chair. Let me first congratulate OECD for the launch of this excellent recommendation and praise the secretariat for putting much effort into it. I am Nat Sakimura, the chairman of the OpenID Foundation.</p>
<p>OpenID Foundation is a standardisation organisation in the field of digital identity. We are not a consumer brand, so you may not be aware of it, but the likelihood is that you are using standards we have developed without knowing. Industry giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Google use them in consumer and enterprise identification, enabling billions of people to assert their identity and gain access to services online. Similarly, many governments offer identity and open data systems using our protocols. In fact, the FAPI family of security profiles are the most commonly selected by governments and private sector leaders of Open Banking and Open Data.</p>
<p>Our members are spread across the world and build standards by consensus. They are open standards that you can access freely and use without any licensing fee. We strive to make them globally relevant and interoperable. They may be selected and deployed for a single implementation, a national ecosystem, or enable national systems to interoperate globally.</p>
<p>Currently, we are developing a new generation of identity protocols for wallet-mediated identity transactions, among other things. This OpenID for Verifiable Credentials family of specifications have been adopted as the remote presentation method of verifiable credentials in the EU Digital Identity Architecture Reference Framework, TrustedWeb demonstration experiments that the Japanese government is backing, and the NIST NCCoE project on Accelerate Adoption of Digital Identities on Mobile Devices Project. That said, the OpenID foundation recognises that no one standards body, country, company or non-profit will be able to lead the world to a globally interoperable digital identity on their own. We recognise it is vital to bring the public and private sectors closer together with a shared vision and approach.</p>
<p>To that end, the OpenID foundation has developed a series of whitepapers, many of which are co-branded and developed with partner organisations. Today I am proud to announce the “Human-Centric Digital Identity: for Government Officials” published in partnership by 12 non-profit partners. The paper takes the OECD Digital Identity Recommendation and expands it by</p>
 
 explaining the current global landscape and the values underpinning emerging models 
 insights on how to enable inclusion, equity, privacy and security 
 encouraging a shift in the focus of design from organisations to humans 
 offering a starting point on how the OECD recommendations may be delivered technically and operationally while respecting domestic sovereignty 
 
<p>We hope this paper will serve as a key input to the Digital Identity Interoperability Summit November 28th amongst non-profit and government thought leaders. The whitepaper is available now at OpenID.net.</p>
<p>We are fully aligned with the OECD Digital Identity Recommendations and it’s vision. We call upon the global community to participate collectively in a global dialogue to deliver on the OECD Digital Identity Recommendations, and close policy and standards gaps through coordinated plans and share goals. Together we hope to see Digital Identity reach its full potential to be of service to 8 billion people, and not the privileged few.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nat shares his views on how the OECD Recommendation can help bridge issues with interoperability across borders:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will start at a 10K meter altitude view, then come to more specifics.</p>
<p>When creating a globally interoperable standard, the first hurdle is to come to a consensus on the comprehensive requirements. What I like about the OECD Recommendation is that it is really comprehensive and it achieved consensus among OECD members. Appendix B of the Human-centric Digital Identity whitepaper maps recommendations from several digital identity reports and highlights how the OECD Recommendations contain all the current global best practices.&nbsp; Such a comprehensive framework achieving consensus among OECD nations will be our guiding light when creating standards for cross-border identity transactions.</p>
<p>Specifics:</p>
 
 Every subclause of clauses VI, VII, VIII is spot on, but I would like to first Highlight subclause VI-2 to demonstrate how it helps. 
 
<p>VI.RECOMMENDS that Adherents align their legal and regulatory frameworks and provide resources to enable interoperability. <br>2. Ensure that digital identity solutions are technology and vendor neutral as long as they comply with all relevant security requirements, and promote the use of internationally recognised technical standards and certification;</p>
 
 To achieve this goal, it is vital for public and private entities to adopt robust, global standards that have been formally and mathematically analysed to be secure and that offer test suites and certification.
 
 Our experience tells us that formal analysis finds holes in protocols. So, it is better to do it proactively identify and fix security gaps before standards move to final, and the installed base is too entrenched to migrate to more secure protocols. The importance of security analysis led the Australian government to co-fund some of our FAPI security profiles to support their Consumer Data Rights objectives. 
 Furthermore, test suites and certification are essential. Implementors often claim that they are compliant with standards when they are not. A test suite can demonstrate conformance to standards very quickly, and self-certification can do so at a low cost. Without a test suite and certification scheme, it is extremely difficult to achieve interoperability at scale, and our shared goal of globally interoperable digital identity. 
 To push member countries towards these directions, the recommendation helps a lot. 
 
 
 There is a related subclause II-1. It says: Take into account the domestic context, including digital maturity and existing digital identity developments when considering the design, implementation or iteration of a digital identity system;
 
 It is important to note that all jurisdictions will not choose the same standards and architectures and will continue to do so. However, like a passport, people will expect their digital identity credentials to work when they cross borders in person or conduct online transactions. This means there will probably be a need for the global community to come together to do a few concrete things
 
 Agree on global, shared goals in the model of an OECD Recommendation and a shared target in the model of a UN Sustainable Development goal 
 Consider the minimum viable requirements to enable global interoperability and governance across diverse domestic implementations. 
 Consider how to enable capacity building and close geographic gaps to ensure no country is left behind. 
 
 
 The rest of clause II guides us in this respect. 
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nat’s responses to the questions, “What do you consider being the biggest challenges and opportunities ahead for realising the full potential of digital identity worldwide? What is the role of the OECD?”: </p>
<p>Opportunities: In the Human-centric digital identity whitepaper, we have categorised the opportunities and benefits into three buckets.</p>
 
 Access to economic opportunities: McKinsey estimates that 3 to 13% of GDP can be unlocked by it, removing friction from everyday lives and allowing those on the fringes of society to participate in the formal economy more easily. 
 Access to government resources: for those who were challenged to access government resources physically, digital identity can facilitate equity and inclusion. 
 National security: The EU Cybersecurity Act and US National Cybersecurity Strategy cite DI as a key enabler, and more recently at FedID, US Treasury/ FinCEN attributed $212B in 2021 financial crime to flaws in identity infrastructure. 
 
<p>Challenges:</p>
 
 Coming to an agreement at the policy level
 
 Technology is the easy part. Ensuring that, as appropriate, domestic policies, laws, rules and guidelines for the digital identity system cover issues such as governance, liability, privacy, resilience, inclusion and security, to encourage and facilitate interoperability and portability in terms of location, is hard. 
 
 
 Tweaking of standards seems to be very attractive.
 
 I have seen many jurisdictions trying to do so. Even though the tweak seems small, at the technical level, it breaks the interoperability. If you want to tweak, then do not do it on your own, but come to the standardisation organisations and find the common solution. 
 
 
 
<p>Role of OECD</p>
 
 Foster multi-stakeholder dialogue
 
 As the OECD Recommendation testifies, OECD is very good at creating consensus. Building further consensus as divergent details emerge is expected. 
 
 
 Monitor the progress.
 
 A framework is only as good as it is implemented. 
 
 
 Develop the processes, guidance and tools to support the implementation of this Recommendation
 
 It may be unrealistic for OECD to do everything. In this case, I am pretty sure that many entities are there to help. So, to be transparent and pragmatic on what the OECD can take a leadership role on and what it will not in the next 3-5 years and sharing the work with other organisations may be a good idea. This will help inform and align OECD’s work with those of the UN, regions, and emerging public/ private coalitions as well.

<p>[Updated 28.09.2023]</p>
<p>The following<a href="https://www.einpresswire.com/article/657877295/harnessing-technology-un-side-event-to-explore-strategies-for-eradicating-human-trafficking-in-sports"> press release</a> was submitted on September 26, 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NEW YORK, USA, September 27, 2023/&nbsp;—&nbsp;<a href="https://mission89.org/">Mission89</a>, in collaboration with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.generationamazing.qa/">Generation Amazing Foundation</a>&nbsp;and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), will host a transformational side event during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA78) on tackling the critical issue of human trafficking in sports through innovative technological solutions and inspire the next generation to combat modern slavery and exploitation.</p>
<p>With the theme “Leveraging Technology to Combat Exploitation and Human Trafficking in Sport,” the event is scheduled for September 25, 2023, at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, between 1400 – 1600 EST. It will bring together various stakeholders dedicated to eradicating human trafficking and promoting youth involvement in sports, including youth advocates, academics, football executives, and the UN’s permanent representatives from Qatar, Monaco and Gabon.</p>
<p>“Sport, a global language that transcends borders, has always been a source of joy and inspiration for countless young individuals worldwide,” emphasized Lerina Bright, founder and executive director of Mission89. “Unfortunately, it also serves as a troubling arena for human trafficking, particularly targeting young, aspiring athletes, with approximately 15,000 children falling victim to trafficking from West Africa to Europe each year. This issue is deeply disturbing and necessitates the utmost attention and concerted efforts from all stakeholders.”</p>
<p>The first session will shed light on sports trafficking and its implications for social inclusion in sports, the evolving landscape of women’s football, and the specific vulnerabilities female athletes face. The second session will explore how technology can be harnessed to combat this issue effectively. The third panel session will engage youth perspectives on these issues, drawing lessons from their experiences and knowledge.</p>
<p>“Through collaborative efforts, the Generation Amazing Foundation remains resolute in its commitment to harness the transformative potential of sports alongside esteemed partners like Mission 89,” stated Nasser Al-Khori, Executive Director of the Generation Amazing Foundation. “Together, we aim to drive lasting positive change and reach our shared objectives of addressing global youth-centric social issues.”</p>
<p>Jonathan Hargreaves, Global Head of Business Development at&nbsp;<a href="https://elastos.info/digital-destiny/">Elastos</a>&nbsp;added, “In a decade of working with data and technology to combat trafficking, we see time and again that compromised identity is the vulnerability that traffickers use to build deception and focus their business models around. By using technology to prevent falsified identity, create transparency in the decision process and verification of authority figures these criminal enterprises are fundamentally undermined. The Elastos’ evolving Web3 systems allow players and families to secure their data, verify the provenance of agents and learn about the opportunities in a inspiration yet safe manner. In this way, blockchain is the key to prevention of trafficking at a systemic level.”</p>
<p>Keynote speakers at the event include Samuel Eto’o Fils, President of the Federation Of Cameroon Football Football (FECAFOOT), and H.E. Mrs Melrose Karminty, Minister of Social Welfare, Republic of Sierra Leone. Other distinguished speakers include Dr Roberto Branco Martins, Director General of the European Football Agents Association (EFAA); Lerina Bright, Founder &amp; Executive Director of Mission89; Ambassador Michel Xavier Biang, Permanent Representative of Gabon to the United Nations; Alya bint Ahmed Al Thani, UN’s Permanent Representative of Qatar; and Ambassador Isabelle F. Picco, Permanent Representative of Monaco to the United Nations.</p>
<p>This forum aims to spotlight the issue of human trafficking in sports and empower young individuals to become advocates and change agents by leveraging technology. By providing a platform for youth engagement and participation, they can voice their concerns, share innovative tech-driven ideas, and contribute to developing effective strategies to combat this urgent issue.</p>
<p>The event’s alignment with the United Nations’ commitment to combat human trafficking and promote youth engagement underscores its significance. It harnesses the UN’s extensive experience in addressing human rights issues and complements ongoing efforts to raise awareness about the grave issue of human trafficking.</p>
<p>———-</p>

<p>In this era of generative AI, how do we determine whether an image is human-created or machine-made?&nbsp;For the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Professor Hany Farid shares the techniques used for identifying real and synthetic images — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, environmental lighting, and GAN-generated faces. A world-renowned expert in the field of misinformation, disinformation, and digital forensics as well as an advisor to the CAI, Professor Farid explores the limits of these techniques and their part in a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the final article in a six-part series.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>Part 1: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">From the darkroom to generative AI</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">How realistic are AI-generated faces?</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-for-ai-generated-faces">Photo forensics for AI-generated faces</a></p><p>Part 4: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-from-lighting-environments">Photo forensics from lighting environments</a></p><p>Part 5: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-from-lighting-shadows-and-reflections">Photo forensics from lighting shadows and reflections</a></p>




 


  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>In the past few posts, I have described representative examples of passive forensic techniques. This category of tools for distinguishing the real from the fake assumes no explicit knowledge of the content source or specialized recording equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>The benefit of these techniques is that they are applicable to a broad category of content. The drawback, however, is they sometimes require manual intervention. The shadow and reflection analysis, for example, requires identifying corresponding points on an object and shadow or reflection. While this is a relatively simple step for a human analyst, it is still out of reach of automation. As a result, these techniques cannot be applied to the torrent of daily online uploads.</p><p>Active forensic techniques, on the other hand, operate at the source of creation, embedding into or extracting from an identifying digital watermark or signature. There is a long history of marking content to prove authenticity, indicate ownership, and protect against counterfeiting. For example, Getty Images, a massive image archive, adds a visible watermark to all digital images in their catalog. This allows customers to freely browse images while protecting Getty’s assets.&nbsp;</p><p>An “invisible” or steganographic watermark can be added to a digital image by, for example, tweaking every 10th image pixel so that its color (typically a number in the range of 0 to 255) is even-valued. Because this adjustment is so minor, the watermark is imperceptible. And, because this periodic pattern is unlikely to occur naturally, it can be used to verify an image’s provenance.</p><p>The ideal watermark is one that is imperceptible and also resilient to basic manipulations like cropping or resizing. Although the above pixel manipulation is not resilient to, for example, image resizing, many robust watermarking strategies have been proposed that are resilient — though not impervious — to attempts to remove them.</p><p>The benefit of watermarks is that identifying information is directly associated with a piece of content before it is released into the world, making identification fast and easy. The drawback to this approach is that watermarks are vulnerable to attack, where an adversary can digitally remove the watermark while leaving the underlying content largely intact.</p><p>Therefore, in addition to embedding watermarks, a creator can extract an identifying fingerprint from the content and store it in a secure centralized ledger. (This fingerprint is sometimes called a perceptual hash —&nbsp;see article 2 in Further Reading below.) The provenance of a piece of content can then be determined by comparing the fingerprint of an image or video that is out in the world to the fingerprint stored in the ledger. Both watermarks and fingerprints can be made cryptographically secure, making it very difficult to forge.</p><p>This type of watermarking and fingerprinting is equally effective for actively tracking AI-generated and human-recorded content. The benefit of this approach is that it can efficiently scan the billions of online daily uploads. The drawback is that it requires specialized hardware or software to be used at the point of creation and recording. It also requires downstream platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok to respect the watermarks, and it requires browsers to display the accompanying content labels. Although not perfect, these combined technologies make it significantly harder to create a compelling fake and significantly easier to verify the integrity of real content.</p><p>Importantly, this active approach is agnostic as to the truthfulness or value of content. The goal of this approach is simply, but critically, to distinguish between human-recorded and AI-generated content.</p>

  <p><a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">I started this series</a> by talking about my initial journey some 25 years ago into the world of media authentication and forensics, and so I'll end with some thoughts of what may lie ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>A combination of many factors has contributed to a complex and at times chaotic online information ecosystem. With democratized access to powerful editing and creation software, the widespread deployment of generative AI is poised to significantly complicate this environment. Harms ranging from the creation of non-consensual sexual imagery to small- and large-scale fraud and disinformation have already emerged even in these early days of this AI revolution.&nbsp;</p><p>Legitimate concerns have also been raised regarding creators' rights and their very livelihoods. Here we can draw on some historical analogs. The introduction of photography did not — as some 19th-century artists feared — destroy art or artists. It disrupted some aspects like portrait paintings, but it also liberated artists from realism, eventually giving rise to Impressionism and the Modern Art movements.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, the digitization of music did not kill music or musicians, but it did fundamentally change the way we produce and listen to music, and it spawned new genres of music. This history suggests that generative AI does not necessarily have to lead to the demise of creators, but that it can, with proper care and thought, be a new enabling medium.&nbsp;</p><p>There is much to be excited about during these early days of the AI revolution. At the same time, there are legitimate and real concerns as to how these new technologies are being weaponized against individuals, societies, and democracies, and how they might disrupt large sections of the workforce. Advances in AI do not need to lead us into an unrecognizable dystopian future. But, technologists, corporate leaders, and regulators need to carefully consider how they develop and deploy technologies, and build in proper safeguards from the point of conception through rollout.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>[1] H.

<p>The Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) and Ceramic are excited to share an integration that allows developers to easily store EAS attestations on Ceramic. We’ve seen a marked increase in awareness and interest in using attestations to express flexibly-defined, verifiable data about online activity. Attestations are a building block for creating and working with this data.</p><p>EAS is an open-source, permissionless, and token-free public good for making on-chain or off-chain attestations. It runs on two elegantly simple smart contracts, one for registering schemas and one for making attestations on those schemas. Developers can use EAS to create, issue, and manage attestations with options to store on-chain, off-chain, and now, on Ceramic.</p><p>Ceramic is a decentralized data network for managing data at scale and with trust, making it easy for developers to build applications that rely on verifiable data. It can be used to store a wide variety of data types, including profiles, badges, credentials, attestations, and stamps.</p> EAS + Ceramic: How to Use and Store Composable Attestations <p>Attestations play a crucial role in building trust and ensuring data accuracy in various decentralized applications and platforms. EAS offers a straightforward standard that simply works, agnostic of the nature of the attestations themselves or where they are stored. As such, it’s important for communities that rely on attestations to consider the benefits and trade-offs relevant to the attestation frameworks they use, which technical standards those frameworks rely on, and how to safely and efficiently store them for later use.</p><p>This blog post will explore the advantages of storing attestations on Ceramic and includes references to a <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">new tutorial for storing off-chain attestations using EAS</a>.</p> Understanding Attestations <p>Before diving into Ceramic and EAS, let's briefly recap what attestations are and the key differences between on-chain and off-chain attestations.</p><p>Attestations are like digital seals of approval, signed by one entity (the attester) about another entity or a piece of data. The attester cryptographically signs the attestation to ensure its authenticity and immutability. Attestations are basically reputation primitives and therefore only matter based on the context it’s being represented in and the reputation of the attester. For example, a credit score attestation from a credit bureau is more credible than a credit score attestation from a friend. But it’s only relevant if you need to provide a sense of your financial stability. Our friends at EAS go into greater detail on attestation examples <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/core--concepts/onchain-vs-offchain?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p><p>Attestations enable the verification and validation of information. When viewed in aggregate, attestations provide an integral building block to the broader manifestation of identity and contextual reputation.</p><p>On-chain attestations are stored directly on the Ethereum blockchain, which makes them secure, decentralized and immutable. They are ideal for scenarios where attestations need to be read by smart contracts or when guaranteed availability is essential. On the other hand, if privacy, high-volume throughput, or cost efficiency are important to your need for attestations, then purely on-chain attestations might not be the best option for your use case.</p><p>Off-chain attestations are stored off the Ethereum blockchain, often in decentralized storage solutions like IPFS or even in ephemeral cold storage. They are linked to the blockchain through cryptographic signatures but do not reside on it. This makes them great for maintaining attestations privately and sharing them when necessary.</p><p>However, some use cases may require the scalability and efficiencies related to off-chain attestations together with the myriad of qualities corresponding to on-chain guarantees. To help meet these needs, there are solutions that don’t fall cleanly into the on vs. off-chain binary, but instead share qualities of both—granting benefits like better scalability with on-chain assurances.</p><p>Ceramic, with its unique approach to storing data, serves as an attractive third option for projects seeking a combination of both on-chain and off-chain characteristics.</p> Ceramic Acts as a Data Ledger <p>Ceramic can be understood as a middle ground between on-chain and off-chain attestations. It offers a decentralized data network that combines the security and transparency of on-chain transactions with the scalability and cost efficiency typically associated with off-chain solutions.</p><p>Ceramic’s underlying protocol is built on decentralized event streams. Users can benefit from a variety of verifiable DID methods (including using their existing digital wallet to incur a did:pkh instance with no additional configuration) to cryptographically sign data events and submit them to the network. Ceramic stores these events in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), using the IPLD protocol to organize them into readable streams. This flexibility allows developers the ability to store any data types one could expect to find in a traditional SQL/NoSQL database (along with several additional scalars to support decentralized identifiers and account types) needed to create rich user experiences—including attestations, which can be used to reflect users’ experience and reputation on Ceramic.</p><p>Ceramic, together with the tools built on the network, provides data-streaming and querying capabilities familiar to developers experienced with tools like Kafka, GraphQL, and relational databases. However, it is built on a fully decentralized and open-source protocol, using the IPLD content addressing protocol within IPFS, which is periodically anchored to the Ethereum blockchain in the form of a Merkle tree. This architecture preserves global consensus, immutability, and transparency while delivering faster performance, lower costs, and straightforward traversal capabilities, making it an attractive option for projects dealing with high volumes of attestations.</p><p>Developers can also take advantage of ComposeDB, a graph database built on Ceramic. ComposeDB enhances composability and ease of querying, offering native support for GraphQL and optimizing read/write load distribution for improved performance. This allows developers to define their own data models using GraphQL or leverage existing community-defined models.</p> Create Your Attestations <p><a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Follow along in this tutorial</a> to learn how to generate simple off-chain attestations representing a “met in real life” claim. This guide uses a preexisting attestation schema already deployed on the EAS schema registry and therefore is designed to focus on the core processes and attributes available to developers using the EAS SDK.</p><p>You will learn how to generate off-chain “met in real life” attestations, allow users to generate referenced attestations confirming the original attestation, and verify attestations instances—all within the context of using ComposeDB to store and query attestations.</p>

Today the FIDO Alliance announced the launch of its FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) Certification Program, enabling edge node and IoT device vendors to prove that their solutions adhere to the security and interoperability requirements of the FDO specifications. Achieving certification allows vendors to demonstrate their products are high quality and at low risk of cyberthreats, while deploying companies can ensure devices will interoperate more seamlessly and securely within IoT and distributed computing infrastructures.</p>



<p>Leading vendors around the world, including Dell Technologies, IBM, Intel, Red Hat and VinCSS&nbsp; have already begun to include the FDO specification in products and services, which are being utilized by customers in a variety of settings and applications. [Media note: see quotes from FDO vendors at end of press release].</p>



<p>According to Markets and Markets in their June 2023 report, the “Edge Computing Market size is expected to grow from $53.6 billion in 2023 to $111.3 billion by 2028.”(1) They go on to say that “despite the benefits, the edge computing architecture is susceptible to cyberattacks with the addition of vulnerable edge nodes and IoT devices.” The FIDO Alliance’s FDO technology has been specifically defined by leaders including Infineon, Intel, Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm and ARM to address these concerns so that users in areas such as enterprise and industrial can fully take advantage of edge computing opportunities.</p>



<p>The FDO protocol is a freely available standard that champions a ‘zero trust’ approach to remove these barriers, enabling devices to quickly and securely onboard to cloud and edge management platforms. As a Dell Technologies <a href="https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/p/dell-nativeedge-speeds-edge-deployments-with-fido-device-onboard-fdo/">white paper</a> explained, “The installation of these systems must prioritize simplicity and must be zero-touch once plugged in and powered on. Secure operations require the ability to bring edge devices into your environment with zero touch in mind.”(2)</p>



<p>FDO Certification, testing for which will take place in early October provides conformance and interop testing, a security risk analysis, and assurance that a company’s device meets FDO Specification and Security and Privacy Requirements. Certification testing builds trust among device owners, as devices are validated as meeting a high level of security by a third-party. Companies interested in taking part in the FDO Certification interop test can register for free and get more information <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fdo-functional-certification/">here</a>.</p>



<p>“Edge nodes and IoT devices are bringing transformative benefits to a whole range of industries but overcoming the security risks that exist today is critical to enable more organizations to take the leap,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “The appetite we’ve seen for the FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) standard since we launched last year is a testament to how urgent the business need is to secure the edge in a way that’s quick and cost-effective. Launching the certification program marks another step towards fostering trust in the edge and IoT space and taking mass deployments to the next level.”</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance brings together 250+ of the most influential and innovative companies and government agencies from across the globe to deliver unrivaled security specifications that offer strong security, are free to use and easy to deploy. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/internet-of-things/">FDO Specification</a> is an important pillar in the expansion of the Alliance’s core vision: to boost global cyber security levels, help eliminate data breaches and enable secure online experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The business benefits of the FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) standard include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Simplicity&nbsp;– Businesses no longer have to pay more for the installation and onboarding process than they do for the actual hardware devices themselves. The highly automated FDO process effectively brings ‘plug and play’ to the world of onboarding edge nodes and IoT devices. 



 Flexibility&nbsp;– Businesses can choose which cloud or edge platforms they want to onboard devices to at the point of installation (as opposed to when devices are manufactured). A single device SKU can be onboarded to any platform (edge or cloud), thereby greatly simplifying the device supply chain.&nbsp; 



 Security&nbsp;– FDO leverages an “zero trust” approach, which means the installer no longer needs – nor has access to – any sensitive infrastructure/access control information.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Developers can view and download the FDO Specification <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/download-iot-specifications/">here</a>. Higher levels of security certification are planned for the program in future, and interested parties are encouraged to join the FIDO Alliance and contribute to the evolution of the FDO standard.

<p>26 September 2023</p>



<p>The not-for-profit, Digital Identity NZ, is calling for any future Government to ensure they focus on supporting the uptake of digital identity for the benefit of all New Zealanders.</p>



<p>In their recently released manifesto, the New Zealand digital identity ecosystem seeks to remind Government of the importance of digital identity as a way to revolutionise the lives of all New Zealanders by enabling them to fully participate in the digital economy safely and confidently.</p>



<p>“If people don’t have trust in the safe and secure use of their identity in a digital world, they will not participate, and will miss many opportunities,” says Colin Wallis, executive director of Digital Identity NZ.</p>



<p>“We believe the Government must focus on building a resilient digital identity ecosystem in order to address digital inclusion, and establish trust and security across New Zealand’s economy and society.”</p>



<p>“Our Manifesto outlines four key areas to enable such an environment – how to establish trust and security, empowering digital inclusion, enabling user-centric design and promoting interoperability and standards.”</p>



<p>“The expertise needed to get the right outcomes from Digital Identity for New Zealanders is found less in government and more in industry. As a nation we need to face this reality and change the way we set policy and regulation for technically complex domains, for example biometrics,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2023/09/22/why-its-too-early-for-biometrics-regulation-in-aotearoa/">which I opinioned recently</a>,” says Wallis.</p>



<p>The manifesto calls for increased focus on bridging the digital divide to ensure equitable access to digital identity solutions for all New Zealanders – people and organisations – taking into account Māori tikanga and Māori data sovereignty, and social inclusion for the disadvantaged in our society.</p>



<p>Digital Identity NZ is the voice of digital identity in Aotearoa, a not-for-profit formed to help New Zealand’s transformation as a digital nation, where everyone should have the right and ability to prove who they are in a secure and trusted way. Digital Identity NZ is a part NZTech, the umbrella tech association for New Zealand.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to announce that the <a href="https://openid.net/Human-Centric-Digital-Identity-Final">“Human-Centric Digital Identity: for Government Officials”</a> whitepaper is now available, with this final version co-branded by twelve non-profit organisations.</p>
<p>This paper offers a broad view of the global digital identity landscape, key considerations for government officials, and the path ahead to global interoperability. Importantly, the paper is grounded in the role of digital identity in the wider international human rights agenda and the recent OECD Digital Identity Recommendations.</p>
<p>The paper started with many months of due diligence including public listening sessions at FIDO’s Authenticate in 2022, OIDF’s workshop in 2022, and two Internet Identity Workshops (IIWXXXV-XXXVI) as well as interviews with subject matter experts. The draft paper was subject to public review this summer with numerous contributions from individuals and non-profits. Contributors over time included technologists working on digital identity standards, government officials, policymakers, legal scholars, human rights advocates, and civil society thought leaders. The twelve organizations that support and co-branded the whitepaper are:</p>
 
 Decentralized Identity Foundation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Identity Defined Security Alliance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 IDPro&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 ID4Africa 
 Kantara Initiative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 MyData&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 OpenID Foundation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Open Identity Exchange 
 Secure Identity Alliance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Trust Over IP Foundation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 UN Refugee Agency&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Women in Identity 
 
<p>Part 1 of the paper explores the opportunities and risks inherent in Digital Identity technologies, with motivations that can vary considerably by country from economic drivers, to enabling access to social services, to national security. The paper then moves into Part 2, which analyzes Digital Identity paradigms across markets, and identifies common trade-off decisions. &nbsp;For example, the paper references a sister whitepaper, “<a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/05/Government-issued-Digital-Credentials-and-the-Privacy-Landscape-final.pdf">Government-issued Digital Credentials and the Privacy Landscape</a>” (Flanagan, 2023), which delves deeply&nbsp; into challenges of creating a globally viable privacy-preserving Digital Identity landscape. Part 3 builds upon existing principles-based literature, especially the recently published OECD Recommendations on the governance of Digital Identity, to help government officials navigate through these decisions.</p>
<p>The paper recognizes that no one size fits all nations, that no technology or architecture will be the default model for all countries. Multiple systems will co-exist, and in some cases, there may be multiple systems in a single jurisdiction. However, the paper argues that there are design practices and strategic approaches that will guide government officials and their stakeholders towards Digital Identity Systems that sustain and promote human rights. The paper also highlights the potential for global digital identity infrastructure to empower the ability of all people to assert their identity in person and remotely cross borders, while respecting domestic sovereignty.</p>
<p>Although this is the final version of the paper, we are still at the start of critical domestic conversations on digital identity, and a global conversation on how to enable global interoperability across these domestic systems.&nbsp; The editors would like to thank all the individuals who took part in listening sessions, interviews, and provided written feedback, as well as the co-branding partner organizations. The editors would also like to give a special thanks to the contributors who challenged the paper to give voice to the challenges of vulnerable populations, including stateless people, and migrant families.</p><p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/human-centric-digital-identity-whitepaper/">Announcing the “Human-Centric Digital Identity: for Government Officials” Final Whitepaper</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID Foundation</a>.</p>

  <p>ABSTRACT: The principles of least privilege and least authority are core computer security principles that can minimize attacks. Not only can they be extended to the realm of digital data with a new principle of least access, but they can also be flipped on their heads, to address what privilege and authority (and access) are required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the roots of computer security can be traced back to the military and intelligence communities, where the focus was on protecting information and assets from enemies and adversaries, I prioritize the protection of individuals, who are uniquely due respect and dignity, and who are likely to be more vulnerable and less resilient than groups such as tribes, corporations and goverments.</p>

<p>I’ve already written about design patterns such as <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">Data Minimization and Selective Disclosure</a> that protect those individuals, but I want to share some thoughts on related design patterns that talk not about what data to release, but instead what permissions to grant. And moreso, I want to talk about how those design patterns can provide even more insight into protecting the data of indvidiuals when we turn them inside out.</p>

<p>So let me introduce the least design patterns followed by their reverse, the necessary design patterns.</p>

 The Principle of Least Privilege 

<p>The concept of “least privilege” has been around in computer security for several decades. Though its origins are not entirely clear, the design pattern was popularized in the mid-1970s by Jerry Saltzer and Michael Schroeder in their influential paper, <a href="https://bitstreamllc.com/assets/documents/the-protection-of-information-in-computer-systems-saltzer-schroeder.pdf">“The Protection of Information in Computer Systems”</a>. Since then, the “Principle of Least Privilege” has become a cornerstone of modern computer security design.</p>

<p>At its core, the principle of least privilege is all about limiting the damage that can be caused by a security breach. This principle stipulates that each user, program, or system component should have only the minimum set of permissions required to perform their respective functions. In other words, if a user does not need access to a particular file, system resource, or network device to perform their job, then they should not have access to it. By limiting the access of each user or component to only what is necessary, the system as a whole becomes more resilient to attack.</p>

<p>“It also reduces the number of potential interactions among privileged programs to the minimum for correct operation, so
that unintentional, unwanted, or improper uses of privilege are less likely to occur. Thus, if a question arises related
to misuse of a privilege, the number of programs that must be audited is minimized.”<br><a href="https://bitstreamllc.com/assets/documents/the-protection-of-information-in-computer-systems-saltzer-schroeder.pdf">—Jerry Saltzer &amp; Michael Schroeder, “The Protection of Information in Computer Systems”</a></p>

<p>The principle of least privilege can be applied to a wide range of security domains, including access control, network security, and application security. In access control, for example, least privilege means that each user should be granted only the permissions necessary to perform their job functions, and no more. In network security, least privilege means that each network device should be configured to only allow the traffic that is necessary for its specific function, and no more. In application security, least privilege means that each application should be designed to only access the resources and data that are necessary to perform its intended function, and no more.</p>

 Principle of Least Authority 

<p>The principle of least privilege has evolved and grown over the decades. In particular, it has been refined as the principle of least authority, which expands on how a user (or device) might gain access to a resource. It is perhaps best described in Chapter 8 of Mark S. Miller’s dissertation, <a href="http://www.erights.org/talks/thesis/markm-thesis.pdf">“Robust Composition: Towards a Unified Approach to Access Control and Concurrency Control”</a>. Whereas least privilege focuses on individual permissions granted to a user, least authority instead recognizes that a user and a resource are part of a larger ecosystem that can include transitive authority: even if a user doesn’t have the privilege to access a resource, he might have the privilege to access a program (or some other object) that itself has the privilege to access the resource. It’s a recognition that privileges are part of a larger web, which when seen together becomes authority.</p>

<p>“It is unclear whether Saltzer and Schroeder’s Principle of Least Privilege [SS75] is best interpreted as ‘least permission’ or ‘least authority.’ As we will see, there is an enormous difference between the two.”<br><a href="http://www.erights.org/talks/thesis/markm-thesis.pdf">—Mark S. Miller, “Robust Composition:
Towards a Unified Approach to Access Control and Concurrency Control”</a></p>

<p>The concept of least authority has become a standard principle in many modern security designs. In a least privilege system, a user might have been granted privileges to access a file or to utilize a database program; but a least authority system is more likely to additionally consider the access to files that the user might receive through access to the database.</p>

<p>Many modern discussions of least privilege conflate it entirely with least authority, but that should only be done if least privilege has been expanded to incorporate the larger ecosystem of interwoven privileges recognized in Miller’s paper.</p>

 A New Principle of Least Access 

<p>The least privilege and least access design patterns focus on the permission to do things, which is the standard for security on computing systems. However within the world of self-sovereign identity (SSI) and verifiable credentials, we instead need to focus on data access.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">“data minimization” and “selective disclosure”</a> design patterns already outline methods for reducing access to data. Combining that with “least privilege” and “least authority” reveals a larger, related design pattern that we can apply more specifically to digital data:&nbsp;”least access”.</p>

  <p>“Data Minimization is the practice of limiting the amount of shared data to the minimum necessary: just enough for parties to successfully transact, accomplish a task, or otherwise meet a goal with each other, while minimizing risks to all parties by omitting unnecessary content.”<br><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">—Christopher Allen, “Musings of a Trust Architect: Data Minimization &amp; Selective Disclosure”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Data minimization mitigates the following threats: surveillance, stored data compromise, correlation, identification, secondary use, and disclosure.”<br><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6973/">—IETF RFC 6973</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than just minimizing data, least access minimizes data access. We can state the principle as follows: In order to protect privacy, respect individual entitlements, and maintain human dignity, only the minimum amount of data access necessary to achieve a specific goal should be granted.</p>

<p>In practical terms, this new “least access” principle can be applied in a variety of contexts. For example, in the case of online transactions, this principle would go beyond the idea of data minimization, which says that only the minimum identifying data necessary to complete the transaction should be collected, and no more, to say that a merchant should not have any ability to access data he shouldn’t have — and perhaps even that a datastore shouldn’t be able to reveal data that the merchant shouldn’t have access to. Consider a more coerceive situation where an LEO might demand personal data from a citizen: if the citizen’s datastore refuses to grant the LEO access to information that they shouldn’t have, then the threat of coercion is negated.</p>

<p>To further enhance privacy and security, a “least access” principle should be extended to minimize opportunities for correlation. This refers to the process of linking different pieces of data together to identify an individual, even if that data was collected separately. Limiting access to data through the Principle of Least Access (and especially through the Principle of Least Authority that it’s built upon) should help to minimize data more than just selective disclosure alone, because it looks at the whole data ecosystem. This in turn can help protect individuals’ privacy and prevent the misuse of their personal data.</p>

 Turning Design Patterns Inside Out 

<p>Once I discover a useful design pattern, I often find utility in turning it inside out. This results in a different mindset that can provide new insights into security design.</p>

<p>For instance, selective disclosure is a part of my architectural tool box, and also a goal and byproduct of least access. Turning it inside out creates the idea of “selective correlation” instead: you think about what to purposefully disclose to enable correlation, rather than what to minimize to avoid correlation. It’s built on the idea that correlation is not always a bad thing, and that in some cases it is necessary to achieve specific security goals.</p>

<p>Thus, with the inside-out design pattern of selective correlation, you: identify the specific pieces of data that need to be correlated in order to achieve a particular security objective; and then design systems and applications that allow for this correlation to occur while minimizing the risk of privacy violations.</p>

<p>A similar methodology can be applied to the “Least” design patterns.</p>

 Necessary Privilege, Authority, and Access 

<p>To turn the design patterns of “least privilege”, “least authority”, and “least access” inside out, we focus on the positive aspects of granting access to resources and data in a way that enables effective and efficient operation, rather than simply limiting access. We could call this “necessary privilege”. The idea actually goes back to Saltzer’s original design for least privilege in <a href="https://bitstreamllc.com/assets/documents/protection-control-info-sharing-multics-saltzer.pdf">“Protection and Control of Information Sharing in Multics”</a> when he said: “Protection mechanisms should be based on permission rather than exclusion.”</p>

<p>Fundamentally, necessary privilege and necessary authority systems should focus from the start on what will be necessary for a user to do their job, rather than just how to limit them. This allows for the boundaries of design for a project to be reset. Rather than trying to tamp down all possible abuses, which is potentially an endless task, it instead concentrates a designer’s attention on the positive. Once a designer fully understands the boundaries for what are necessary, their design task becomes easier and their work more proficient.</p>

<p>If this job is done well, then designers can create systems and applications that scale and that are more flexible and adaptable to changing user needs, because everything is proactively flagged for usage, rather than being negatively limited, with access then added after the fact. This approach may also help to minimize the burden on system administrators by reducing the need for constant permission updates and access control changes. And it’s all done while still maintaining a high level of security.</p>

<p>Besides improving administrator workload, the system can also create better user experiences: if a user prooactively has access to everything that they need, they’ll never bump up against barriers in a system. This can help to reduce the risk of human error and increase user satisfaction by empowering users with the authority they need to perform their tasks effectively. It creates a more “humane” and thus more resilient system.</p>

<p>A necessary access system can extend these necessary privilege and necessary authority advantages to digital data. It does so by defining what data each system needs to operate rather than what data each individual is willing to release. Now perhaps a user won’t be willing to release the data in question, but this creates the foundation needed for a negotiation, where a user can decide whether he wants to use a system or not. It also ensures that the user knows what data he’s releasing, thanks to the improved user experience of the positvely oriented system. Since this sort of negotiation is crucial for credential systems, necessary access offers the potential of improving the whole space.</p>

 A Summary in Brief 

<p>The differences between these six design patterns can be subtle. Here’s how each one offers a slightly different way to consider computer security:</p>

 
   Least Privilege. Minimize permissions to what’s necessary for a task. 
   Least Authority. Minimize permissions, but consider transitive authority. 
   Least Access. Minimize data access to what’s necessary for a task, considering transitive authority. 
   Necessary Privilege. Provide permissions necessary for a task. 
   Necessary Authority. Provide permissions and consider transitive authority. 
   Necessary Access. Provide data access necessary for a task, considering transitive authority. 
 

 One Last Flip-Flop 

<p>Turning design patterns inside out forces us to think differently and creates new insights into how to solve security problems.</p>

<p>Turning the “least” design patterns inside-out involves a shift in focus from limiting access and authority to enabling access and authority in a controlled and strategic way. It allows us to identify the specific needs of users and applications and to grant access and authority accordingly, creating security designs that are more effective, efficient, and user-friendly.</p>

<p>In case you think that radio is still one of the few media where you’re safe from surveillance, here is what <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/author/6389/ray-schultz/">Ray Schultz</a> says in <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/388956/can-radio-time-be-bought-with-real-time-bidding-i.html">Can Radio Time Be Bought With Real-Time Bidding? iHeartMedia is Working On It</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>HeartMedia hopes to offer real-time bidding for its 860+ radio stations in 160 markets, enabling media buyers to buy audio ads the way they now buy digital.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have the capabilities to do real-time bidding and programmatic on the broadcast side,” said Rich Bressler, president and COO of iHeart Media, during the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, according to Radio Insider.</p>
<p>Bressler did not offer specifics or a timeline. He added: “If you look at broadcasters in general, whether they’re video or audio, I don’t think anyone else is going to have those capabilities out there.”</p>
<p>“The ability, whenever it comes, would include data-infused buying, programmatic trading and attribution,” the report adds.</p>
<p>The Trade Desk lists iHeart Media as one of its programmatic audio partners.</p>
<p>Audio advertising allows users to integrate their brands into their audiences’ “everyday routines in a distraction-free environment, creating a uniquely personalized ad experience around their interests,” the Trade Desk says.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trade_Desk">The Trade Desk</a> “specializes in real-time programmatic marketing automation technologies, products, and services, designed to personalize digital content delivery to users.” Translation: surveillance-based and privacy-hostile ad targeting, which we’ve been hating in the online world <a href="https://doc.searls.com/the-adblock-war/">at least since 2008</a>.</p>
<p>But radio, one might think, is basically an offline medium. Most radio listening is to radios, not to computers or phones. Sure, some listening is online; but relatively speaking, not much. For example, here is the bottom of the <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb009">current radio ratings for the San Francisco market</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb009"></a></p>
<p>Those numbers are fractions of one percent of total listening in the market. And the Bay Area is a very streaming-oriented market.</p>
<p>So how are iHeart and The Trade Desk going to personalize radio ads?&nbsp; Well, here is a meaningful excerpt from<a href="https://www.insideradio.com/free/iheart-to-offer-real-time-bidding-for-its-broadcast-ad-inventory/article_95861ff4-4e19-11ee-b044-b346721c7d1f.html">&nbsp;iHeart To Offer Real-Time Bidding For Its Broadcast Ad Inventory</a>, which ran earlier this month at&nbsp;Inside Radio:</p>
<blockquote><p>The biggest challenge at iHeartMedia isn’t attracting new listeners, it’s doing a better job monetizing the sprawling audience it already has. As part of ongoing efforts to sell advertising the way marketers want to transact, it now plans to bring real-time bidding to its 850 broadcast radio stations, top company management said Thursday.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have the capabilities to do real-time bidding and programmatic on the broadcast side,” President and COO Rich Bressler said during an appearance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference. “If you look at broadcasters in general, whether they’re video or audio, I don’t think anyone else is going to have those capabilities out there.”</p>
<p>Real-time bidding is a subcategory of programmatic media buying in which ads are bought and sold in real time on a per-impression basis in an instant auction. Pittman and Bressler didn’t offer specifics on how this would be accomplished other than to say the company is currently building out the technology as part of a multi-year effort to allow advertisers to buy iHeart inventory the way they buy digital media advertising. That involves data-infused buying and programmatic trading, along with ad targeting and campaign attribution.</p>
<p>Radio’s largest group has also moved away from selling based on rating points to transacting on audience impressions, and migrated from traditional demographics to audiences or cohorts. It now offers advertisers 800 different prepopulated audience segments, ranging from auto intenders to moms that had a baby in the last six months…</p>
<p>Advertisers buy iHeart’s ad inventory “in pieces,” Pittman explained, leaving “holes in between” that go unsold. “Digital-like buying for broadcast radio is the key to filling in those holes,” he added…</p>
<p>…there has been no degradation in the reach of broadcast radio. The degradation has been in a lot of other media, but not radio. And the reason is because what we do is fundamentally more important than it’s ever been: we keep people company.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Most AM-FM radios in homes are not connected to the Internet, so they don’t work for tracking individual listeners. Cars, however, are another story. In <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/">Privacy Nightmare on Wheels’: Every Car Brand Reviewed By Mozilla — Including Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota — Flunks Privacy Test</a>, Mozilla pulls together a mountain of findings about just how much modern cars spy on their drivers and passengers, and then pass personal information on to many other parties. Here is one relevant screen grab:</p>
<p><a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/what-data-does-my-car-collect-about-me-and-where-does-it-go/"></a></p>
<p>As for consent? When you’re on a browser or an app, you’re on the global Internet, where the GDPR and to a lesser degree the CCPA and other privacy laws apply, meaning that websites and apps have to make a show of requiring consent to what you don’t want. But cars have no UI for that. All their computing is behind the dashboard where you can’t see it and can hardly control it. So the car makers can go nuts gathering fuck-all, while you’re almost completely in the dark about it.</p>
<p>Here is how Mozilla describes the situation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many car brands engage in “privacy washing.” Privacy washing is the act of pretending to protect consumers’ privacy while not actually doing so — and many brands are guilty of this. For example, several have signed on to the automotive <a href="https://www.autosinnovate.org/innovation/Automotive%20Privacy/Consumer_Privacy_Principlesfor_VehicleTechnologies_Services-03-21-19.pdf">Consumer Privacy Protection Principles</a>. But these principles are nonbinding and created by the automakers themselves. Further, signatories don’t even follow their own principles, like Data Minimization (i.e. collecting only the data that is needed).</p>
<p>Meaningful consent is nonexistent. Often, “consent” to collect personal data is presumed by simply being a passenger in the car. For example, Subaru states that by being a passenger, you are considered a user — and by being a user, you have consented to their privacy policy. Several car brands also note that it is a driver’s responsibility to tell passengers about the vehicle’s privacy policies.</p>
<p>Autos’ privacy policies and processes are especially bad. Legible privacy policies are uncommon, but they’re exceptionally rare in the automotive industry. Brands like Audi and Tesla feature policies that are confusing, lengthy, and vague. Some brands have more than five different privacy policy documents, an unreasonable number for consumers to engage with; Toyota has 12. Meanwhile, it’s difficult to find a contact with whom to discuss privacy concerns. Indeed, 12 companies representing 20 car brands didn’t even respond to emails from Mozilla researchers.</p></blockquote>
<p>And, “Nineteen (76%) of the car companies we looked at say they can sell your personal data.”</p>
<p>To iHeart? Why not? They’re in the market.</p>
<p>And, of course, you are not.</p>
<p>Hell, you have access to almost none of that data. There’s what the dashboard tells you, and that’s it.</p>
<p>As for advice? For now, all I have is this: buy an old car or keep the one you’ve got.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Exploring badge endorsements in cooperative communities  Background and&nbsp;context <p>In 2017, We Are Open Co-op (WAO) <a href="https://goo.gl/XzLWso">presented</a> groundbreaking ideas on building and credentialing ‘cooperative character’ at the Cooperative Education and Research Conference. Fast forward to today, and we find ourselves revisiting this concept, driven by three key developments that we’ll delve into in this post. We’ll also outline the exciting directions we’re considering for future&nbsp;work.</p> 🎨 1. Interdisciplinary Focus <p>As highlighted in our previous post, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/finding-the-others-1f43b48ceff1">Finding the Others</a>, we’re keen on awarding badges to individuals and organisations that intersect with WAO’s five core priority&nbsp;areas:</p> 🌱 2. New Partnerships <p>Our recent collaboration with <a href="https://workers.coop">workers.coop</a>, a new federation of worker cooperatives, has rekindled our interest in badging for cooperative character. Together, we aim to foster collective economic, social, and cultural progress, guided by the <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity/">seven foundational cooperative principles</a>:</p>  Voluntary and Open Membership  Democratic Member&nbsp;Control  Member Economic Participation  Autonomy and Independence  Education, Training, and Information  Cooperation among Cooperatives  Concern for Community   💡 3. Technological Advances <p>The <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2023/03/16/verifiable-credentials-and-open-badges-3-0-whats-changed/">latest version</a> of the Open Badges standard has matured, offering a <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2023/09/08/the-role-of-endorsement-in-open-badges-and-open-recognition/">transformative approach to endorsements</a>. Specifically, badges can now be endorsed retrospectively, adding a new layer of credibility and flexibility to the ecosystem.</p> Rethinking trust networks through badge endorsements <p>If you’re familiar with LinkedIn, you’ll know that the platform allows you to ‘recommend’ colleagues by writing brief testimonials about their performance or approach to work. Similarly, you can ‘endorse’ them for specific&nbsp;skills.</p><p><a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a> take this concept a step further by making learning and skills visible. As we highlighted in a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/endorsement-practices-using-open-badges-and-community-recognition-d0bfd96a4799">previous post</a>, the evolving Open Badges standard now enables retrospective endorsements, adding an extra layer of credibility to the skills, knowledge, or behaviours your organisation values and wishes to&nbsp;promote.</p><p>Our approach to badge endorsements is straightforward. We aim create categories based on universally accepted rules within a given group or professional body. For federations of co-operatives, these categories are naturally aligned with the well-established co-operative principles we’ve discussed earlier.</p><p>The above image comes from our <a href="https://goo.gl/XzLWso">presentation</a> to the Cooperative Education and Research Conference In 2017. Reflecting on that work, especially in light of recent advancements in the Open Badges ecosystem, opens up exciting avenues for future exploration.</p> Exploring Badge Endorsement scenarios <p>Guiding principles in professional networks serve to encourage specific behaviours. In the context of co-operatives, the aim is to cultivate global cooperation. To better understand deeper into how badges can facilitate this, we introduce a 2x2 grid that categorises badge endorsements from simple to complex, capturing the essence of co-operative behaviour.</p><p>Within this framework, national or international co-operative organisations like <a href="https://www.uk.coop/">Co-ops UK</a>, <a href="https://workers.coop">workers.coop</a>, or the <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en">International Cooperative Alliance</a> (ICA) have the capacity to issue badges to individual co-operatives. These badges can subsequently be endorsed by any people or organisations that engage with the&nbsp;co-op.</p><p>Our goal extends beyond merely recognising ‘membership.’ Such a narrow focus doesn’t adequately reflect a co-op’s alignment with co-operative principles. Instead, our grid aims to offer a more nuanced view, encouraging visibility, collaboration, and proactive engagement.</p><p>Starting at the bottom-left quadrant of the grid, we have the ‘enduring membership’ model. Here, a single badge is issued once to each federation member. The ideal evolution is towards the top-right quadrant, labelled ‘time-limited principles.’ In this advanced model, co-operatives receive annual badges endorsed by their collaborators, demonstrating ongoing commitment to co-operative principles.</p><p>Let’s break down each quadrant for a more detailed understanding.</p> 1. Enduring membership badges <p>A federation such as workers.coop issues a single ‘membership’ badge to its member organisations when they become a member. This badge can be endorsed by other individuals and organisations in the federation with which they collaborate.</p><p>✅ Pros: Simple to implement and offers a snapshot of network membership.</p><p>❌ Cons: Lacks focus on actions or behaviours, offering no incentive for members to actively embody federation values.</p> 2. Time-limited membership badges <p>A federation such as workers.coop issues a single ‘membership’ badge to its member organisations for each year they’re a member of the federation. This badge can be endorsed by other individuals and organisations in the federation with which they collaborate.</p><p>✅ Pros: Provides an annual overview of active participation, without revoking badges from departed&nbsp;members.</p><p>❌ Cons: Increased administrative burden due to yearly badge&nbsp;issuing.</p> 3. Enduring principles-based badges <p>A federation such as workers.coop issues seven different badges to its member organisations when they become a member. Each badge represents one of the seven cooperative principles. This badge can be endorsed by individuals and organisations with which they collaborate, either inside or outside the federation.</p><p>✅ Pros: Encourages a focus on specific co-operative principles, enhancing network alignment..</p><p>❌ Cons: Potential for confusion with multiple badges; risk of neglecting some principles.</p> 4. Time-limited principles-based badges <p>A federation such as workers.coop issues seven different badges to its member organisations for each year they’re a member of the federation. This badge can be endorsed by individuals and organisations with which they collaborate, either inside or outside the federation.</p><p>✅ Pros: Offers an annual update on active principle adherence, aiding in the search for like-minded collaborators.</p><p>❌ Cons: High administrative effort for yearly updates and potential for ‘badge fatigue.’</p> Conclusion <p>In summary, our 2x2 grid provides a sophisticated framework for badge endorsements in professional and cooperative networks. Transitioning from a singular ‘membership’ badge to annually updated, principles-based badges enables a more dynamic and transparent ecosystem. This not only identifies network participants but also gauges their active contribution to shared values. The result is enhanced transparency, accountability, and alignment with cooperative principles, contributing to a stronger, more engaged community.</p><p>We see this as a significant stride towards fostering trust and cooperation on a larger scale. Our team is full of strategic ideas on badge endorsements, from <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/badges-for-digital-transformation-7e9e1a17e714">trojan mice, to cow paths, and constellation creation</a>.

<p>Condatis delivers bespoke Identity and Access Management solutions designed to simplify onboarding, enhance security, and boost overall business efficiency for clients globally.<br></p><p>The company is a leading systems integrator for Microsoft Azure in the UK, and is one of the partners involved in delivering the National Health Service (NHS) Digital Staff Passport for the past three years. <br></p><p>We caught up with founder and CTO, Chris Eckl, to hear about how the service began life in the midst of the pandemic, and how it is evolving to support broader NHS objectives and use cases. &nbsp; <br></p><p>The NHS Digital Staff Passport has an interesting history. How did the project come about? <br></p><p>Staff onboarding can take a long time in the NHS. There are hundreds of Trusts (local healthcare organizations) and senior staff have many credentials. Doctors were turning up with briefcases full of paper every time they needed to move to a new location. <br></p><p>We were planning some hackathons in December 2019 together with our sister company Sitekit and Interopen (a group aiming to accelerate interoperability in the UK healthcare sector) to explore how decentralized identity could help address this. </p><p>Then the pandemic hit. <br></p><p>Suddenly, the NHS was facing hotspots of high demand around the country. They needed to move staff around a lot quicker, and to have them working in the new organization from Day One. <br></p><p>We saw that a decentralized approach was the right direction. Give the doctor or nurse their own data and they can share it directly with the new employer, without the need for Human Resources (HR) to manage everything.<br></p><p>What solution did you implement initially and how has it evolved?<br></p><p>Because of our long experience building Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, we suggested we could stand something up quickly. First, we went through this legal exploration of how to do the staff onboarding in a new way. The base system was built in six weeks and the COVID-19 Digital Staff Passport went live in summer 2020. <br></p><p>Every NHS Trust that opted in got their own instance. At first the aim was to ensure COVID hotspots had enough staff. The ‘sending’ Trust’s HR team put the staff member’s credentials into a Verifiable Credential (VC), then physically visited the ‘receiving’ Trust to authorize the secondment.<br></p><p>Later in the project, it became more about ensuring all immunization facilities are staffed. We also moved from face-to-face governance meetings to Skype, and connected to the Electronic Staff Record (ESR), a common HR system. &nbsp;</p><p>We’ve built in a lot more automation since the early days. <br></p><p>Please can you describe the key technology pieces that sit behind the NHS Digital Staff Passport, and Condatis’ role in delivering these &nbsp;<br></p><p>Microsoft Entra is now being used to issue and verify credentials, but the NHS wants to ensure staff are not forced to use any particular wallet. Condatis developed an OpenID Connect (OIDC) bridge we call the Credentials Gateway, that can communicate with many wallet providers and allows the NHS to work with a single integrator partner, as well as enabling users to choose their wallet. <br></p><p>A key piece is the trust layer that underpins communication between wallet and verifier. The issuers’ Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) were initially anchored on the Sovrin network. This is now moving to did:web, as credential holders don’t need their own identifiers (Editor’s note: this method works by hosting an issuer’s DID document on a company website domain, proving the DID’s owner controls the domain and is affiliated with the company). &nbsp; <br></p><p>There’s also a need for a trust register and a revocation register, so verifiers know they can trust the issuer of a credential, and that it is still valid. Condatis is working on both of those pieces. <br></p><p>What is the current status of the project, and what’s the future direction? <br></p><p>We have a successful system in place that’s been used since summer 2020, and was really helpful in enabling the COVID-19 immunization program to be delivered. <br></p><p>The NHS has used this experience to create a framework for a long-term Digital Staff Passport.<br></p><p>The program is moving into a public Beta phase over the autumn (Editor’s note: a full roll-out is expected by August 2025*). The current system will be decommissioned and replaced with a new solution encompassing the full identity lifecycle of a healthcare professional, from when they graduate and do placements, to getting registered with their professional body, right-to-work checks and continuing professional development, all using Verifiable Credentials. It’s also moving into access credentials for digital services used by NHS staff. <br></p><p>The ecosystem is expanding (for example, enabling more wallet providers to participate) and Condatis and Sitekit have been retained as partners. <br></p><p>What lessons have been learned during this journey? <br></p><p>The current program has provided a lot of insight about how to do things better. For example, we ended up with a lot of data fields in the credentials. Now we’re looking to use more specific credentials and combine them in compound proofs. We’ve also done important work with Microsoft, Evernym (now part of Gen Digital) and Yoti on how different wallets can interoperate. <br></p><p>Another learning has been around the governance process for staff secondments. There are many legal and HR challenges, such as who needs to agree to what in a secondment. &nbsp;<br></p><p>There’s also the question of how to establish trust between issuers and verifiers. Each identity platform only goes so far. We’re aiming to codify the trust framework in the Credentials Gateway and to make it more modular, so it’s replicated on all partner nodes.<br></p><p>How has DIF membership helped? <br></p><p>We’ve been a DIF member for a long time. The work on Presentation Exchange (PE) in particular is important to us, and has helped us address some of the interoperability challenges around exchanging credentials. </p><p></p><p>*Source: NHS Long Term Workforce Plan <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nhs-long-term-workforce-plan-v1.2.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nhs-long-term-workforce-plan-v1.2.pdf</a><br><br><br><br><br></p>

<p>We’ve been in an uphill fight to empower people—customers—in online markets where the prevailing belief is that captive customers are more valuable than free ones. (The value of free customers is well-understood, though not always respected, in offline markets.) And we’ve been in this fight for more than seventeen years.</p>
<p>But now AI is&nbsp;<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=AI&amp;hl=en">all the craze</a>.</p>
<p>Question: Can AI help VRM? And vice versa?</p>
<p>Think about&nbsp;what would happen if people had their own AI systems, working for them and not for companies whose business is selling you something (e.g. Amazon), pushing advertising at you (e.g. Google), or trapping you in their walled garden (e.g. Apple)? Why not have our own AI, to help us make better sense of our contacts, our calendars, our health, financial, property, travel, and other kinds of data? And then, when the need arises, have our personal AI help us make well-informed decisions about what to buy, how, and where, without being biased by marketers and their bots on the other side?</p>
<p>Those are just a few questions we’ll be visiting two Mondays from now, October 9, at VRM Day in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. The time frame will be 9am to 4pm. There is also plenty of parking (the Museum is otherwise closed on Mondays).</p>
<p>We’ll visit other questions that come up, of course. And participants with something to show off are free to do that as well. And some will, especially with <a href="http://iiworkshop.org/">IIW</a>&nbsp;happening the following three days, also at the Computer History Museum.</p>

<p>The world moves. Technology advances. We find ourselves standing at crossroads, staring at paths paved by Big Gov and Big Tech. Both promise the same thing: a digital ID for the new age. But the truth? It’s found somewhere else – in Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Here’s why.</p>



<p>Big Gov has strength. It has power. But with that power comes weight. The heavy bureaucracy makes change slow, like an old bull trying to keep pace with sprightly calves. Big Gov means centralized control. It means data housed in a single barn, a target for those with ill intentions. It’s a single point of failure in a vast digital landscape. Too risky.</p>



<p>Then there’s Big Tech. Sleek. Modern. But with its shine comes opacity. Behind the gleaming surface, data gets traded, often without consent. With Big Tech, control is elsewhere, not with the individual. The profits, the power, they flow upward, leaving the user, the real owner of the data, out in the cold.</p>



<p>SSI? It’s different. It’s like the open plains. Vast. Decentralized. SSI gives control back to the individual. It’s your identity, your data. You decide who sees it, who doesn’t. It’s not stored in one barn or controlled by one entity. It’s spread out, secure, like stars scattered across the night sky.</p>



<p>With SSI, trust is inherent. Transactions are transparent. You know where your data goes, and who’s knocking at your digital door. There’s no middleman. No ulterior motives. It’s just you and your identity, standing strong.</p>



<p>The world is complex. Digital identity shouldn’t add to that complexity. It should be straightforward, transparent, and secure. It should be in the hands of the one it belongs to. That’s the simple truth.</p>



<p>In the end, it’s a matter of trust. Do you trust a heavy system, slow to change, susceptible to breaches? Do you trust shiny corporations, with their hidden motives and centralized power?</p>



<p>Or do you trust yourself?</p>



<p>The answer seems clear. The world moves. And as it does, may it move towards the simplicity and truth of Self-Sovereign Identity.</p>

<p></p>      DENSO, Honda, and Nissan to Co-Chair New MOBI Working Group           <p>Circular Economy and the Global Battery Passport Working Group unites efforts to drive solutions for comprehensive circularity in global supply chains.</p>
          <p>MOBI is proud to introduce the co-chairs of our highly anticipated Circular Economy and the Global Battery Passport (CE-GBP) Working Group (WG). The WG aims to set interoperability standards and build the foundational infrastructure for comprehensive circularity in global supply chains, with an initial focus on building a decentralized Global Battery Passport System (GBPS).</p>
<p>As organizations worldwide strive to meet global sustainability goals, enhance energy efficiency, and pave the way for long-term supply chain resilience, it is critical to drive the adoption of circular business practices from product sourcing to manufacturing, use, end-of-life, and beyond. This transformative shift towards end-to-end circularity represents a pivotal moment in our collective efforts to address urgent environmental and economic challenges.</p>
<p>Circularity in the battery industry remains a pressing concern for supply chain stakeholders as battery usage proliferates in various industries — including EV production and renewable energy storage. Emerging regulations worldwide emphasize battery traceability and highlight the need for a standardized approach to promote circularity, safety, and quality assurance throughout the battery supply chain.</p>
<p>Global policies regarding batteries, like the US Treasury’s Section 30D Guidance on EV Tax Credits and the EU Battery Regulation, mandate digital recordkeeping to track battery life cycles, underscoring the need for a global battery passport — a digital credential containing key information about the battery’s composition, state of health, history, and more.</p>
<p>Ensuring battery supply chain circularity requires a new system built on global interoperability standards — one that enables verifiable, end-to-end information traceability throughout a battery’s lifecycle and permits privacy-preserving coordination between supply chain stakeholders (public and private). MOBI and its members are developing a decentralized GBPS to facilitate seamless communication in production management, maintenance, safety, second and third-life uses, and recycling while meeting consumer demands and ensuring regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>Released in June 2023, MOBI’s Guideline for Implementation of a Decentralized Global Battery Passport System marked a critical milestone towards this goal. The CE-GBP Working Group is set to build on this foundation through the creation of new standards and the development of GBPS infrastructure. Members of the WG will also focus on implementation of the GBPS and defining the next steps for interoperability and industry adoption.</p>
<p>The CE-GBP Working Group is supported by our dedicated working group members: Anritsu, ASJade Tech, Aucnet, AWS, BMW, CEVT, Dana, DENSO, Ford, Hitachi America Ltd, Honda, HIOKI, ITOCHU, Mazda, Nissan, Orico, Politecnico di Torino, ParkyMyFleet, Quantstamp, Reply, Stellantis, SyncFab, State Farm, Toyota Industries Corporation (TICO), Tradelog, Vitesco, and Vinturas.</p>
           Meet the CE-GBP Co-Chairs   <p>Roger Berg — Vice President, DENSO North America R&amp;D: “I embrace the prospect of collaborating once more with industry experts in crafting a universally adaptable sustainability battery passport solution for the evolving electric vehicle (EV) landscape. MOBI stands with its members at a pivotal juncture, and all of us are acutely aware of the profound significance of this work for the broader industry.”</p>
<p>Christian Köbel — Sr. Project Engineer, Honda R&amp;D Europe: “Web3 principles and blockchain hold the potential to facilitate the implementation of upcoming battery regulations, such as reporting CO2 emissions embedded in a battery, or providing a battery product passport with verifiable stakeholders and data. The time is now right to evaluate this potential and exploit it further, towards future interoperable ecosystems for battery passports and data sharing.”</p>
<p>Yoshinori Suzue — Sr. Manager, Nissan North America Inc.: “I am honored to serve as a CE-GBP Working Group Co-chair with MOBI, which is helping to drive mobility innovation toward Circular Economy and create an automotive industry ecosystem that is more sustainable for all.”</p>
<p>About MOBI</p>
<p>MOBI is a global nonprofit smart mobility consortium. We are creating standards for trusted decentralized identities (e.g. vehicles, people, businesses), data interoperability, business automation, and MOBI Trusted Trip. MOBI and members are building the Web3 digital infrastructure for connected ecosystems and IoT commerce. Our goal is to make transportation more efficient, equitable, decentralized, and sustainable while preserving data privacy for users and providers alike.</p>

<p>First public review - ends October 21st</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Lexicographic Infrastructure Data Model and API (LEXIDMA) TC are pleased to announce that Data Model for Lexicography Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment. This 30-day review is the first public review for this specification.</p>



<p>About the specification draft</p>



<p>The LEXIDMA TC’s high level purpose is to create an open standards based framework for internationally interoperable lexicographic work. Data Model for Lexicography v1.0 describes and defines standard serialization independent interchange objects based predominantly on state of the art in the lexicographic industry. The TC aims to develop the lexicographic infrastructure as part of a broader ecosystem of standards employed in Natural Language Processing (NLP), language services, and Semantic Web.</p>



<p>This document defines the first version of a data model in support of these technical goals, including:<br>– A serialization-independent Data Model for Lexicography (DMLex)<br>– An XML serialization of DMLex<br>– A JSON serialization of DMLex<br>– A relational database serialization of DMLex<br>– An RDF serialization of DMLex<br>– An informative NVH serialization of DMLex</p>



<p>The documents and related files are available here:</p>

<p>Updated documents now available</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the approval and publication of new Approved Errata by the members of the OASIS Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF) TC.</p>



<p>Overview:</p>



<p>Software developers use a variety of tools to assess the quality of their programs. These tools can report results on qualities such as validity, security, performance, compliance with legal requirements, etc. To form an overall picture of program quality, developers often need to aggregate the results produced by all of these tools, a task made difficult when each tool produces output in a different format.</p>



<p>SARIF defines a standard format for the output of static analysis tools in order to:<br>– Comprehensively capture the range of data produced by commonly used static analysis tools.<br>– Reduce the cost and complexity of aggregating the results of various analysis tools into common workflows.<br>– Represent analysis results for all kinds of programming artifacts, including source code and object code.</p>



<p>This publication includes:<br>– The errata, in the form of a list of changes. (sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os)<br>– The OASIS Standard with the errata changes applied and highlighted. (sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os-redlined)<br>– The OASIS Standard with the errata changes applied, and not redlined. (sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os-complete)<br>– The SARIF v2.1.0 JSON schemas.</p>

<p>In the latest Elastos Bi-Weekly Update, significant progress has been made in various areas. On the <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/mainchain/intro/">Elastos main chain</a>, the core team is working on a feature that allows stakers to redelegate their voting between nodes, which adds flexibility for the stakers. Additionally, they have conducted tests for using multisig wallets for CR Proposal submissions and have resolved issues causing instability in the main chain ELA node.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/sidechains/intro/">Elastos side chain</a> has seen important developments, with the finalization of the upcoming developer incentive plan. The team is also investigating some new protocols that can potentially improve the performance on side chains. They’ve also addressed issues on testnet related to the transfer of BNFTs between the side chain and the main chain.</p>
<p>In the realm of the <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/dids/intro/">DID (Decentralized Identifier)</a> Web Service, user experience improvements have been a priority. This includes refining the authentication process, enhancing the user interface for identity-related pages, and adding features such as the Contact Us page. They’ve also focused on security, introducing a Sensitive attribute for certain data types to improve the authentication mechanisms.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://kyc-me.io/">KYC-me</a> has introduced a new feature enabling the capture of passport and ID card photos, facilitating integration with potential KYC providers, while also incorporating liveness detection and OCR capabilities.</p>
<p>The DID SDK has undergone refinements, particularly in enhancing the security of identity data storage, and V2.3.1 has been released to improve functionality and reliability.</p>
<p>Lastly for the <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/hive/intro/">Hive</a> SDK, the team resolved some issues that arose during integration with the DID Web Service. These updates collectively reflect Elastos’ commitment to advancing decentralized identity solutions and blockchain technology.</p>
 Elastos Main Chain 
 
 Initiated the development of the BPoS votes redelegation feature, which allows for the transfer of the staked votes from one node to others. 
 Tested the upcoming feature allowing the multisig wallet to be used for the CR Proposals. The test scripts are complete, and specific CR Proposal-related transactions have been tested. 
 Updated the integration documentation for some exchanges and shared it with the exchanges. 
 Began deploying the BPoS stake rewards dashboard for the main chain browser. 
 Addressed the issues causing abnormal quits in the main chain ELA node. These fixes will be included in the next release of the ELA node. 
 
 Elastos Side Chain 
 
 Developed a decentralized strategy for the upcoming developer incentive mechanism. The whitelist has been finalized, allowing for queries to retrieve incentive receiving addresses and their corresponding distribution ratios based on contract addresses. 
 Completed testing for the RGB protocol and the deployment of the Lightning Network client on a private network. 
 The ESC node on the testnet received an upgrade, addressing an issue that prevented BNFTs from being transferred between the side chain and main chain. 
 Investigated the cause of unstable block production on the ESC side chain and devised a plan to fix this issue. 
 
 DID Web Service 
 
 Enhanced the OAuth authentication process in the DID Web Service, focusing specifically on the frontend callback URL. 
 Refined the Identity page on the DID Web Service, improving the UI/UX for both the DID creation and deletion, as well as the DID list. 
 Enhanced the My Profile page by optimizing the layout of related attributes, refining the Search box functionality, and addressing some known bugs. 
 Continue to implement more UI Widgets on the Web Service dashboard. 
 Introduced the Sensitive attribute to Verified Credentials (VCs) on the Web Service page and added markers for sensitive VCs in the display list. 
 Implemented the connectivity SDK for integration with third-party platforms. This SDK leverages AppDID to request DID Web Service authorization and displays relevant DID information within the request. 
 Created a page for issuing VCs upon request, which also displays detailed request information. 
 Enabled the Web Service to update or retrieve DID avatars from the Hive Vault while facilitating avatar data caching in browsers. 
 Developed theContact Us page for the DID Web Service to provide support for users. 
 Streamlined the UI/UX flow on the Web Service to direct users to the onboarding page after passkey binding. 
 Integrated an enhanced PassKey authentication mechanism into the Web Service, ensuring that some extreme situations are addressed. 
 Resolved compatibility issues to ensure the PassKey functions properly on Chrome. 
 Deployed the DID Web Service frontend (didweb.trinity-tech.io) and backend service (didweb-service.trinity-tech.io), and set the test environment for future iterative developments – didweb-testapp.trinity-tech.io to show the interactivity with DID web service. 
 Initiated the design process for the DID Web Service pages. 
 
 KYC-me 
 
 Finalized the feature that allows the platform to capture photos of passports and ID cards for integrating potential KYC providers. 
 Integrated liveness detection and OCR capabilities. 
 
 DID SDK 
 
 Refined the DID JavaScript SDK by introducing a robust DID storage interface and incorporating asynchronous capabilities. 
 Developed an encryption mechanism for VCs to enhance storage security. 
 Conducted comprehensive testing and released DID JS SDK V2.3.1. 
 
 Hive SDK 
 
 Addressed some issues that were found when integrating the DID Web Service with the Hive SDK.

<p>‘<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DINZ-Response_-Biometrics-discussion-document-2023.pdf">Digital Identity NZ’s submission</a>&nbsp;to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/publications/guidance-resources/biometrics-and-privacy/">potential code of practice for Biometrics</a>&nbsp;is possibly the most comprehensive response to a submission on Biometrics ever done in Aotearoa in recent times’. In my message to DINZ’s Executive Council to confirm the submission, that was my assessment of the depth and quality of the mahi produced by DINZ’s Biometrics Special Interest Group (SIG) and two further experts – one an indigenous rights advocate working with Māori data experts in this space, the other with deep knowledge and insights into Māori tikanga and Māori Data Sovereignty – both of whom hugely informed this submission. Our subsequent&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2023/09/11/digital-identity-new-zealand-dinz-advocates-for-a-thoughtful-approach-to-potential-biometric-regulation-in-new-zealand/">press release</a>&nbsp;was picked up by RNZ’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/businessnews/audio/2018906570/midday-business-news-for-12-september-2023">Midday Business News</a>&nbsp;at 1’56” and a further post on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/497828/biometric-industry-warns-that-regulation-may-bring-unintended-consequences?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=0eab72ff5e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-0eab72ff5e-">website</a>.</p>



<p>Our submission maintained that the Privacy Act 2020 remains the most appropriate regulatory instrument for all personal information, provided Privacy Impact Assessments are made mandatory and that definitions are clear. Standards based clear guidance co-created with industry would both improve education, provide confidence for industry, and maintain convenience and benefits for people while avoiding unintended consequences for them such as increased friction in their online experience and hampering technological improvement for industry. It’s far better to regulate the rare exceptional use cases than regulate the whole domain and have a plethora of exceptions. To follow up our submission, one DINZ member has a blog/podcast in the works on how Privacy Enhancing Technologies can retain the benefits of biometrics while protecting people from potential harm. Look out for it in the coming months.</p>



<p>All of our submissions, reports and other mahi are published&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/submissions/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=0eab72ff5e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-0eab72ff5e-">on our website under Our Work</a>&nbsp;including yesterday’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DINZ-Submission-Targeted-Engagement-DISTF-Regulations.pdf">submission</a>&nbsp;to the Department of Internal Affairs’&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DISTF-Regulations-Discussion-Paper.pdf">Discussion Paper on the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Regulations</a>.</p>



<p>While the topic above is a case in point, it’s clear that in recent years there’s been a downward trend across public sector agencies in retaining deep technical expertise and operational experience in their respective knowledge domains they are responsible for. It’s understandable given the pressure to reduce public spending. Even workarounds to bring in experts on short-term contracts are caught up in spending cuts. Election rhetoric around public sector cuts oversimplifies the expertise vs budget challenge that agencies face. As a consequence we see high level material developed in-house by agencies put out for public consultation with the ensuing submission-consultation-submission back and forth. It’s not a great way to develop anything because it wastes all parties’ precious time and effort typically ending in suboptimal outcomes and unintended consequences. But it’s the symptom of a deeper cause rooted in how we have traditionally developed and implemented policy in Aotearoa. Simply put, we have to start ‘right-sizing’ for the reality of our public expenditure budget. The public sector co-creating with industry (just as more effort has been made in recent years to co-create with Māori) would motivate people and organisations to step up and deliver better outcomes for all. Of course this challenges long standing public sector policies to avoid conflicts of interest and bias that have led to the current approach but we simply have to think in more modern terms about how we deliver really good outcomes in technically complex domains with minimal budgets. It’s not just an issue and opportunity for digital identity and its related technical domains such as Biometrics. It’s a macro-economic issue though most easily observed in digital contexts. The NZTech Alliance, of which DINZ is a part, continues to press for change. Please support us to drive a co-creation agenda for better outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This post was initially prepared by Becky Kazansky, who led the digital rights and climate justice research while at The Engine Room, earlier this year. It was edited and updated by Laura Guzmán and Helen Kilbey for publication.</p>



<p>Last year, The Engine Room <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-report-at-the-confluence-of-digital-rights-climate-justice/" title="">conducted research exploring the intersections of digital rights and climate justice</a>, identifying a number of opportunities and pathways for alignment between movements focused on digital rights or climate justice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We found that there’s a huge appetite in the digital rights and tech sector for more work on these intersections, but, conversely, that it can be difficult for groups to find the resources to explore new issues, as they are often juggling multiple priorities within their existing remit of work. It can feel daunting or irresponsible to jump into work on a whole new set of issues, especially as it relates to crises as large and complex as contemporary climate and environmental ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We found that it’s possible to take an approach to climate and environmental issues that builds on what an organisation is already doing – in other words, organisations working on digital rights and technology can think about what it would mean to apply a climate lens to existing areas of work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This ‘layering’ approach takes inspiration from TER’s research –&nbsp; which identified a number of existing intersections between digital rights, climate and environmental justice&nbsp; –&nbsp; as well as the collective discussions that took place within the larger research consortium, which included fellow organisations such as the <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/project/technology-environmental-justice-and-sustainability" title="">Association of Progressive Communications (APC)</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thinking about climate and environmental issues in this way can help an organisation articulate the most meaningful connections between their existing mission and climate/environmental issues, while opening paths to working in solidarity with movements long working to foster change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 From climate concerns to climate justice 



<p>As an organisation moves from exploring how their existing work relates to these issues to articulating desired areas of work for the future, there’s a step that is important to take, which is to ask: how can the work an organisation decides to do on climate, environmental and sustainability issues be explicitly supportive of climate justice?&nbsp;</p>



<p>As The Engine Room’s research showed, there are many different approaches to climate, environment, and relatedly, sustainability. Some, unfortunately, can perpetuate harm, distract from the most important issues, or place unnecessary/unjust burdens on under-resourced groups and impacted populations. Some conceptions of sustainability, for example, are challenged by the global climate justice movement, whose proponents look critically at sustainability claims by corporations (including big tech companies), and push back against frames that individualise the climate problem (i.e. personal carbon footprint), pushing instead for acknowledgement of the historical processes that have resulted in the present crisis (including colonialism, extractivism, and social inequality, among others), and accountability by powerful institutions..&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the climate justice movement’s commitments to be a guiding star to tech and digital rights organisations interested in these issues, it’s important to consider what these concerns and commitments mean in the context of tech and the communities they engage with.&nbsp;</p>



 Diving into already intersecting priorities 



<p>Through a series of internal conversations held earlier this year, a few areas that surfaced for The Engine Room include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Appropriate tech and low-tech ‘solutions’: TER’s focus on appropriate technologies means that when engaging with and supporting organisations through our hands-on <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/work/" title="">Matchbox and LiTS work</a>, it’s crucial to consider how technologies meet needs particular to social, political, and environmental contexts. This means thinking about criteria such as energy intensiveness, accessibility, and access. As a result, TER often discusses so-called <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/innovation-is-not-for-free/" title="">‘low-tech’ solutions</a>, examples of which include data storage platforms that function without internet connectivity, community radio, the use of solar power, and other technologies that function in low-bandwidth and low-electricity environments. These kinds of solutions can support climate-justice-oriented commitments to community self-determination and to sufficiency-oriented and circular economic models. An example that emerged from our environmental justice research is around local environmental data collection efforts, which currently tend to rely on large commercial platforms for data, and where finding more secure, low-bandwidth options is a priority.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Responsible data approaches/data minimisation: a running thread throughout TER’s responsible data work is the importance of data minimisation. Collecting less data minimises the risks of data compromises and leaks, and having less data means less to ‘exploit’ for surveillance, advertisement and marketing. Data minimisation also <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/blog/2021/08/how-data-minimization-data-quality-and-storage-limitation-can-help-fight-against" title="">maps directly</a> to issues around the energy-intensiveness of web platforms and data centres, currently one of the largest concerns when it comes to technology’s impact on the environment. As digital rights advocates often point out, at the moment it costs more to delete data than to keep it, incentivising perpetual storage and greater environmental costs. In one of TER’s climate discussions, a team member suggested that <a href="https://www.digitalcleanupday.org/home/materials/" title="">energy intensiveness</a> considerations fit naturally within TER’s existing push for data minimisation.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Digital Resilience: The Engine Room has been articulating an area of work that fits under our umbrella of digital resilience, which brings together safety, security, and sustainability (e.g. financial, wellbeing, environmental) concerns around technology. Within the framework of a research and capacity building project currently underway, the digital resilience team has been exploring the considerations that go into the implementation of solar panels, and aims to evaluate the sustainability of electronics (noting, however,&nbsp; that it can be difficult to find good information on this — a challenge that we also encountered in our digital rights/climate justice research; you can find some discussion in that report around the difficulties of parsing what ‘green’ and ‘sustainable’ means in the context of tech).&nbsp; 
 



<p>As The Engine Room continues to explore these intersections, we expect more considerations and approaches to surface. Keep an <a href="http://theengineroom.org/blog/" title="">eye on our blog for updates</a>, or get in touch at <a href="mailto:hello@theengineroom.org" title="">hello@theengineroom.org</a> to swap ideas.</p>

<p>Web1, the “Institutional Web,” was the early internet, featuring static web pages and one-way information flow from institutions to users. Web2, the “Oligarchic Web,” introduced user-generated content, interactivity, and social networking through platforms like Facebook and YouTube. Web3, known as the “Semantic Web” or “Personal Web,” envisions a future where machines understand and interconnect information, enabling highly personalized and intelligent services via technologies such as AI and IoT. As Elastos Founder Rong Chen <a href="https://twitter.com/chen2rong2/status/1702099671122845744">tweeted</a>,&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>#Web1 nodes are typically operated by institutions.</p>
<p>#Web2 nodes are often controlled by oligarchs.</p>
<p>#Web3 nodes are PCs left on 24/7 at home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This succinctly captures how internet infrastructure has shifted along with changing power dynamics. Elastos is at the forefront of the internet’s transformation from Web1 to Web3, representing the evolution of the internet’s infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elastos empowers users with self-sovereign identity, decentralized storage, encrypted messaging, and scalability. This infrastructure enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and aligns with the user-centric vision of Web3. Beyond its core components, Elastos envisions a future where users can establish micro websites and cyber storefronts, epitomizing the Web3 ideal where individuals and businesses have greater control over their online presence and <a href="https://elastos.info/digital-destiny/">digital destiny</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 Web1: The Institutional Internet 
<p>The early internet of the 1990s took shape across government agencies, research institutions, and large corporations. Websites were largely static brochures, generated by institutions for one-way informational distribution. Individual users had little influence over content or infrastructure.</p>
<p>Government bodies like the U.S. military were primary developers of early networking technologies like <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ARPANET">ARPANET</a>. Academics spearheaded sites for knowledge sharing among researchers. Large media outlets launched websites as extensions of their centralized information distribution.</p>
<p>This institutional Web1 gave elite organizations outsized control over online interactions. They operated massive centralized server farms while individuals accessed the web primarily through institutional terminals like libraries or campus computer labs. Policies and cultural norms heavily restricted individual content creation.</p>
 Web2: The Oligarchic Internet 
<p>Web2 emerged with a promise to distribute power by putting publishing and communication tools into every user’s hands. Platforms flourished with individual participation, creativity, and connection. However, as the tech industry grew, early online pioneers gave way to increasingly centralized oligarchic tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Rather than dispersing influence, platforms like Facebook and Twitter became massive walled gardens where user-created value was extracted for corporate gain. The boundaries between media outlets and tech companies blurred into new consolidated information regimes.</p>
<p>The paradox of Web2 was its transformation: from a tool promising empowerment to a system commodifying user engagement for the benefit of a few digital oligarchs. Even innovations like smartphones, intended to further decentralize access, inadvertently amplified the reach of these tech giants. Despite its groundbreaking advancements, Web2 inadvertently birthed a new era of digital monopolies.</p>
 Web3: The Personal Internet 
<p>Web3 stands on the brink of a technological revolution, poised to decentralize the online power dynamics that have historically favored institutions and tech oligarchies. Central to this shift are innovations like blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and tokenization that promise to redefine online ownership and control.</p>
<p>Where Web1 and Web2 largely relied on centralized nodes driven by corporate entities, Web3 is built around nodes hosted on millions of personal devices in homes across the world. Instead of passively participating in platforms like Facebook, users are the true architect of their own digital spaces. Ownership and control of digital assets are managed via the decentralized technologies rather than centralized servers.</p>
<p>Web3 represents a profoundly personal internet where users command their own online experiences. Rather than residing in oligarchic walled gardens, power and agency are pushed back to the edges among ordinary users.</p>
<p>Of course, realizing this vision requires overcoming complex barriers around scalability, security, regulation, and more. Many past decentralization efforts failed to account for the tendency to reconsolidate power. However, Web3 offers hope of recapturing the original internet spirit: distributing influence among common users.</p>
 Elastos: The User-Controlled Internet 
<p>Elastos empowers users to monetize their data and digital assets, emphasizing the shift from passive ownership to active profit generation. This key aspect aligns with the broader Web3 goal of granting users agency and control over their online activities.</p>
 Self-sovereign Identity 
<p>Elastos’ core philosophy revolves around decentralization and digital sovereignty, and its adoption of <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/dids/intro/">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> technology is central to achieving this vision. DID technology fundamentally reshapes the way Know Your Customer (KYC) processes are conducted, creating a user-centric and privacy-focused approach. With Elastos DID, individuals have full ownership and control of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can selectively share only the necessary attributes for verification, minimizing the exposure of sensitive personal data. This not only enhances privacy but also reduces the risk of identity theft and misuse. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#what-is-a-verifiable-credential">Verifiable Credentials</a>, a key service of DID, allow users to securely store digital proofs of their attributes and qualifications, which can be issued by trusted entities. This further streamlines KYC, making it a more efficient and secure process.</p>
<p>Moreover, Elastos DID effectively bridges the gap between the physical and digital realms. Users can link their digital identities to real-world credentials like driver’s licenses or diplomas, providing a robust connection between their online and offline personas. When they need to prove their identity, these Verifiable Credentials can be presented, ensuring that the digital identity remains rooted in real-world authenticity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In essence, Elastos DID marries the real world and the digital space, fostering trust and security in online interactions while preserving individual control over personal information.</p>
 Decentralized Storage Solution 
<p><a href="https://elastos.info/blog/breaking-down-hive-elastos-all-in-one-decentralized-storage-solution/">Hive</a>, as a decentralized storage technology, addresses a pivotal challenge in today’s internet landscape by fundamentally changing how data is stored and accessed. With Hive, users have the autonomy to select and deploy their preferred Hive nodes for secure data storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://elastos.info/blog/hivehub-evolving-decentralized-storage-in-the-elastos-ecosystem/">HiveHub</a> exemplifies this decentralized storage revolution within the Elastos ecosystem. It offers users a comprehensive solution, allowing them to create Vaults on their chosen Hive nodes, register these nodes as NFTs, and back up or migrate their data. This approach embodies true data sovereignty for users and it fosters a community-driven economy, enabling users to profit by sharing their storage resources.</p>
<p>As Hive and platforms like HiveHub continue to evolve, they demonstrate the potential of decentralized storage to liberate data from centralized control, enhance security, and empower users to shape the future of the internet. This shift towards user-centric storage solutions marks a significant step towards a more resilient and equitable digital landscape.&nbsp;</p>
 Peer-to-peer Network 
<p>Elastos enhances user privacy and control through encrypted peer-to-peer messaging with <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/carrier-2-0-an-evolution-in-connectivity/">Elastos Carrier</a>. This feature not only enhances privacy but also empowers secure communication, giving users more control over their online interactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acting as the linchpin in Carrier’s decentralized infrastructure, the <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/unleashing-the-potential-of-decentralized-apps-with-carrier/">Active Proxy service</a> enables users to host personal websites, apps, and services on their home WiFi networks while maintaining privacy and control. It leverages Carrier Super Nodes for reliability and trust, allowing individuals to announce their services globally and achieve true data ownership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Active Proxy combines the convenience of mainstream hosting with the benefits of privacy and decentralization, ensuring data remains private on users’ hardware while accessible from anywhere.</p>
 Mainchain-sidechain Structure With Scalability 
<p>Elastos employs a mainchain-sidechain structure, with the added security benefit of being protected by the Bitcoin blockchain through <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastos-merged-mining-explained-harnessing-bitcoins-strength-for-security/">merged mining</a>. This unique approach combines scalability and security efficiently. Scalability is achieved by enabling parallel processing on independent sidechains, allowing for high transaction throughput and customization for specific use cases, all while minimizing the risk of network congestion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the security of Elastos is enhanced by the isolation of sidechains from the mainchain, ensuring that any security breaches on a sidechain do not compromise the entire network. The reduced attack surface, support for various consensus mechanisms, and the ability to implement data privacy features further bolster security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the added protection of Bitcoin’s mining power, Elastos’ mainchain-sidechain architecture strikes a robust balance between scalability and security, making it a trusted platform for dApps.</p>
<p>DRM to Monetize Your Data</p>
<p><a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elacity-and-the-journey-blending-drm-and-nfts/">Digital Rights Management (DRM)</a> is a critical technology for protecting intellectual property in the digital age. It plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the rights of content creators by controlling access to and usage of their digital assets. However, DRM has often been criticized for potentially limiting consumer rights and stifling innovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://ela.city/">Elacity</a>, through its innovative approach, is addressing these concerns and working towards a balanced solution. By combining DRM with Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Elacity aims to provide content creators with comprehensive tools to protect and monetize their digital assets effectively. This integration enables creators to maintain ownership rights while ensuring that their content is used and distributed in a controlled and authorized manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elacity’s open-sourced approach and commitment to DRM technology will significantly empower artists, musicians, and other content creators in the digital landscape, ultimately leading to greater creative freedom and financial independence.

<p>The Open Wallet Foundation has accepted a proposal by Findynet and TNO to take ownership and control of the open-source digital wallet and agent comparison matrix and establish a new special interest group to maintain it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The digital wallet and agent overview is a framework that enables the comparison of digital wallets based on their characteristics, such as the technical capabilities they support. Digital wallets enable the holder to store credentials and to make presentations to verifiers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tno-ssi-lab.github.io/wallet-overview/">SSI wallet overview</a> of the comparison framework, hosted in TNO’s Github repository, is focused on cloud and mobile applications for holders that can be used to store, manage, and present verifiable credentials. The <a href="https://findyfi.github.io/wallet-overview/">SSI agent overview</a>, forked into Findynet’s Github repository, extends the scope to include agents that can issue and verify&nbsp;verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>The overview was born when the Dutch research organization for applied science (TNO) began evaluating various digital wallets. One driver was to prioritize the development of connectors in the <a href="https://eassi.ssi-lab.nl/">TNO EASSI gateway</a>, but also to provide an independent and transparent overview. TNO invited SSI wallet vendors to fill in the data for the overview in order to keep the data as correct and up-to-date as possible.</p>
<p>The second version was developed when Findynet needed to evaluate SSI solutions for enterprise use. Findynet added more characteristics and functionality to the framework. Some of the Findynet additions are also merged into TNO’s version.</p>
<p>Together, TNO and Findynet <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/tac/issues/56">proposed</a> that the OpenWallet Foundation (OWF) adopt the repository. We also proposed a new Special Interest Group (SIG) to be formed to further develop and maintain the digital wallet and agent overviews. The proposals were <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18fnNIsJSsyLVghINBK4iTqFP6UYacCJjP7jnDjxZcGw/edit#slide=id.g27a1c9067e9_0_0">accepted</a> on September 20th, 2023 in the OWF Technical Advisory Council meeting.</p>
<p>The new group should discuss the terminology and the scoping of the overview – whether the holder wallets and the issuer and verifier agents should be contained in one overview, or be split up into two.</p>
<p>TNO is an independent research organization making knowledge serve the common good.</p>
<p>Findynet Cooperative is building infrastructure for trusted communications and self-sovereign identity in Finland.</p>
<p>The OpenWallet Foundation is a consortium of companies and non-profit organization collaborating to drive global adoption of open, secure, and interoperable digital wallet solutions as well as providing access to expertise and advice.</p>

<p>By Francis Beland, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>Misinformation and copyright attribution each present unique challenges in the digital age, but they also intersect and present several mutual grand challenges:</p>



<p>1. Detecting and Tracking Content: AI technologies like deep learning can be used both to create and detect deepfakes and other forms of synthetic media. At the same time, these technologies can also be used to identify copyrighted content and enforce rights.</p>



<p>2. Digital Attribution: For both misinformation and copyright, there’s a grand challenge of attributing digital content to its true source. This can involve technologies like digital watermarking, blockchain, and others.</p>



<p>3. Balancing Rights and Freedoms: In both areas, there’s a delicate balance to be struck between protecting rights (such as copyright or the right to truthful information) and preserving essential freedoms (like the freedom of speech or of the press).</p>



<p>4. Adapting to Rapid Technological Change: The rapid pace of technological change presents a mutual challenge in both fields. New technologies can enable new forms of misinformation or new ways to infringe on copyrights, and laws and regulations often struggle to keep up.</p>



<p>5. Education and Awareness: Finally, there’s a mutual challenge in educating the public about these issues. Many people lack a clear understanding of what copyright is and why it’s important, and similarly, many people struggle to identify and deal with misinformation.</p>



<p>These mutual challenges highlight the need for an interdisciplinary approach that brings together expertise from fields like AI, law, ethics, education, and communication, among others.</p>

		<p>Newark, NJ, August 28, 2023 – Edge, the region’s nonprofit research and education network (REN)&nbsp; and technology partner, is pleased to welcome Bucknell University as its first connected member in the state of Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Bucknell University, a private liberal arts college in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, discovered Edge while searching for a REN that could offer a converged solution encompassing internet services, Internet2 services, and AWS Direct Connect as well as a service provider with industry-leading service reliability and 24/7/365 customer support. Enter Edge, a REN able to provide access to all three of those solutions across one 100 gig circuit.</p>
<p>“The solution we constructed for Bucknell created an exciting challenge due to the level of complexity and distance from our network,” explained Bruce Tyrrell, Associate Vice President Programs &amp; Services, Edge. Continued Tyrrell, “With the connections now fully operational and functioning in accordance with Bucknell’s specification, the solution we constructed is the largest Layer 2 VLAN environment Edge has built for an institution to date–a true landmark achievement.”</p>

 Part 3: Greenpeace’s Critical Incident Network Advanced Comms&nbsp;Training <p>Designing educational programming requires zooming in and out of learner needs, organisational realities, and the impact you wish to have on the world. In this series, we’re writing about an educational project we’ve been working on with Greenpeace International for a number of years. If you haven’t read <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/navigating-greenpeaces-critical-incident-network-5d9fe79ea824">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/exploring-community-learning-pathways-88a9758928c2">Part 2</a> of this series, you might want to do that&nbsp;first!</p><p>In this post, we will talk about the structures and curriculum underlying the Critical Incident Network (CIN) Advanced Comms training.</p> Structuring Stress <p>Taking a formerly in-person training and making it digital isn’t just typing things up into the computer and calling it done. A digital training environment should mimic the vibe of an in-person training as much as possible. For critical incidents and crisis management, this means mimicking stressful situations.</p><p>Introducing stress elements is crucial for preparing individuals for real-world crisis scenarios. Stressors like time constraints and emotional pressure help to simulate the unpredictability and urgency often encountered in critical incidents. This enables learners to build resilience and adaptability, skills that can’t be developed in a purely theoretical environment.</p><p>Part of the stressors that we can place upon learners include placing demands upon time, emotional resilience, and communication strategies. Training, however, needs to be a safe space for learning. This means learners need scaffolding, structure and&nbsp;support.</p>Cc-by WAO and GPI, remix &amp; expansion of @jonanygaard’s highchart, based on Glasl’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Glasl's_model_of_conflict_escalation">Model of Conflict Escalation</a><p>The training programme is designed to escalate in intensity into a crescendo at the end of Week 3. In addition, each scenario involves escalations which each team involved in the training will have to choose how to&nbsp;manage.</p> Scaffolding <p>Learning design requires finding ways to structure time and information so that participants can focus on developing the skills and attitudes required. In professional development, there is the added complication that many people take training courses in addition to their regular jobs. Figuring out a cadence to a training is important, as is documenting that cadence. This helps learners know what to expect and what is expected of&nbsp;them.</p>How the course is structured, cc-by WAO and&nbsp;GPI<p>The CIN Advanced Comms training takes place over a period of four weeks and includes a range of approaches from self study, through to working in small teams, expert sessions and role play. We chose a blended learning, multi-modal structure to ensure that we could adequately address complex topics. A month gives us enough time to get through the curriculum, while being compact enough to keep engagement high.</p><p>Choosing appropriate digital tools and platforms enhance the learning experience, and this offers flexibility for learners to access materials and engage with the content at their own pace. Regular communication, both in-person and through digital channels, help provide support and foster a sense of community among learners. This blend of instructional methods and modalities not only enhances learner engagement but also equips learners with valuable digital and communicative skills.</p><p>Each week in the CIN Advanced Comms training, participants have one module of online learning to complete. This content introduces concepts, processes and best practices from within Greenpeace. It is self-paced, so the participant determines how much time they devote to this work. Synchronous sessions are then held at the same time each of three days during a&nbsp;week.</p><p>We continuously assess and adapt our curriculum, using feedback and data analytics to identify areas for improvement and tailor the learning experience to meet diverse&nbsp;needs.</p> Building Teams <p>Learning is an experience and we remember good experiences. In learning design, we strive to help learners create connections not only with the concepts or skills they’re there to learn, but also with each&nbsp;other.</p><p>The CIN Advanced Comms training is a collaborative experience. People learn to work together, collaborate in stressful situations, and to trust each other. The training forms 5–6 person teams with participants fulfilling various communications roles- such as Comms Lead, Digital Lead, Press Officer, Internal Comms, Editor or Media Producer. Other roles in the organisation (e.g. security personnel, HR managers, journalists, campaign directors, lawyers, etc) are enacted through a combination of asynchronous training materials, as well as the trainers and CIN community members.</p><p>Given the complexity of the training we’re designing, we work with a range of trainers with different backgrounds. Remember, we are building <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/exploring-community-learning-pathways-88a9758928c2">multiple pathways</a> deepening the community’s engagement in this work. We’ve developed a Train the Trainer (TtT) programme as well and aim to help people level up within the community. Stay tuned for a future post on the&nbsp;TtT.</p><p>Each team has several trainers to help guide them. We call the constellation of trainers for the CIN Advanced Comms training the Training Committee.</p><p>Roles on the Trainer Committee:</p>  Lead trainers run their team of trainers as well as the training sessions for their dedicated group of participants.  Co-Trainers are confident trainers that support their lead trainer in facilitating the scenario sessions.  Scenario Support are experienced in scenario based training and can advise other trainers on how to conduct scenario based training&nbsp;best.  Training Coordinators The coordinator(s) ensure that the training works across focus teams and inline with pace and content. They also keep a close loop to the lead trainers and provide support for the learning design and technical channels.  Shadow Trainers are people who want more experience as a trainer before potentially stepping up. Their main objective is to learn and to support their fellow trainers.   The Curriculum CIN Advanced Comms learning objectives<p>We talked about our five learning objectives in the last post, but as a reminder the Critical Incident Network Advanced Comms Training is focused&nbsp;on:</p>  Shared understanding — building a shared vocabulary and mental model for critical incidents so that people can apply the appropriate tactics and techniques for crisis communications  Decision-making — identifying relevant information, making a judgement, and choosing a path&nbsp;forward  Collaboration under pressure — supporting other individuals and the team to respond effectively in difficult and stressful situations  Stress resilience — developing self-awareness to understand capacity and desire for dealing with difficult and stressful situations  Conflict reframing — articulating risks to identify communication opportunities  <p>We focus each week on content that stretches between and around those five objectives.</p> Prep Week: Setting the&nbsp;Scene   Main objective: We begin with metacognition, or ‘thinking about thinking’. What’s the link between thinking and behaviour? What role does personality play in conflict? How can we develop a better mindset to deal with critical incidents?  Focus of the week: Preparing for the coming weeks, and doing some self-study.  What’s tricky: Finding and dedicating the time it takes to really commit to learning.   Week 1: Terms, Roles &amp;&nbsp;Tactics   Main objective: This week is about developing a shared understanding and sharpening decision making skills. What is the difference between a critical incident and a crisis? What is an issue? What does risk mean in our context? Who is responsible during a critical incident and what are best practices in communication in these situations?  Focus of the week: Coming together as a team working to respond to a communication crisis.  What’s tricky: People respond differently in crisis situations! How will personalities show up this&nbsp;week?   Week 2: Comms &amp; Collaboration in a&nbsp;Crisis   Main objective: We continue to develop decision making skills and shared understanding of crisis communication. In addition, we focus on dealing with the social, cultural and other dynamics of crisis incidents. How do we deal with internal and external communication? How do we collaborate in these&nbsp;times?  Focus of the week: Making good decisions in communication, both internal and external and being observant of people around&nbsp;you.  What’s tricky: Communication can be complex, with disinformation, trolls, negativity and political nonsense. Can you keep your cool and work collaboratively?  a marketing card the team put&nbsp;together Week 3: Reframing Conflict   Main objective: In week 3 the heat is turned way up, and participants use everything they’ve learned to respond to scenarios that will challenge them to think quickly, make sound decisions and take smart&nbsp;risks.  Focus of the week: Responding as quickly as possible to critical incidents, as well as seeing opportunities and being prepared before an issue becomes a critical incident.  What’s tricky: Thinking deeply about potential risks would be easy if we weren’t under time pressure or if we had a crystal ball. Can learners reframe situations, protect people involved and communicate well?   Week 4: Debrief &amp; Cool&nbsp;down   Main objective: The CIN Communication training is designed to stress people out a little bit. It deals with tough situations, so week 4 is all about debriefing and reflecting on the experience.  Focus of the week: Reflecting and identifying the primary stressors people experienced during scenarios. We explore experiences and come up with some proactive strategies together with learners.  What’s tricky: Developing self-awareness is a lifelong endeavour. To understand our own capacity and desire for dealing with difficult and stressful situations is part of what this training is all&nbsp;about!   There’s so much&nbsp;more <p>As we explained in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/navigating-greenpeaces-critical-incident-network-5d9fe79ea824">our first post</a> of this series, this programme is about building a community of practice. There’s a lot to that, and we’ve focused this series particularly on the learning elements of the Critical Incident Network programme.</p><p>As you’re designing learning experiences, pay attention to the scaffolding of information and learner engagement. You’ll want to build teams and relationships to strengthen peer to peer learning and reflection. You need to set learning objectives and be clear about how those objectives are achieved through the curriculum of the programme.</p><p>Which of the planning strategies and learning design advice from this series are you most excited&nbsp;about?</p><p>This body of work is built on the back of incredible contributions from a wide variety of people. In particular, we’d like to thank Greenpeace International’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-musar-godwin/">Elizabeth Godwin</a>, the Global Lead of Digital Learning, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patric-salize-87954520/">Patric Salize</a>, the Global Communication Hub Coordinator and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-townsley-625897b/">Mike Townsley</a>, the Communications Director for their collaboration and direction.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/discovering-a-multimodal-training-f289eeed7fde">Discovering a Multimodal Training</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Andrew Shikiar is quoted in the lead story of The Green Sheet: “Simply put, verification is the process of confirming someone’s identity. Authentication is the process of recognizing someone’s identity,” he said. “The easiest way to think about it is that you verify someone’s identity less often—usually at the point of account creation—to confirm they are who they say they are. You then authenticate them at subsequent sign-ins to confirm the person logging in is the person who created the account.”</p>

  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>Where there is light, there are shadows. The relationship between an object, its shadow, and the illuminating light source(s) is geometrically simple, and yet it’s deceptively difficult to get just right in a manipulated or synthesized image. In the image below, the bottle's cast shadow is clearly incongruous with the shape of the bottle. Such obvious errors in a shadow are easy to spot, but more subtle differences can be harder to detect.</p>

  <p>Below are two images in which the bottle and its cast shadow are slightly different. (The rest of the scene is identical). Can you tell which is consistent with the lighting in the rest of the scene?</p>














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>The geometry of cast shadows is dictated by the 3D shape and location of an object and the illuminating light(s). This relationship is wonderfully simple: A point on an object, its corresponding shadow, and the light source responsible for the shadow all lie on a single line.</p><p>Because (in the absence of lens distortion) straight lines in the 3D scene are imaged to straight lines in the 2D image, this basic constraint holds in the image. Locate any point on a shadow and its corresponding point on the object, and draw a line through them.

  <p>From shadows to reflections</p><p>As a student taking the subway to work each morning, I would stare out the window and watch the tunnel walls whiz by superimposed atop reflections of my fellow passengers. On occasion someone’s reflection would catch my eye, and I would look back into the subway car to get a better view. But I would invariably not see them where I thought they would be given the position of their reflection on the window. As a budding image and vision scientist this really bothered me — how could it be that it was so hard to reason about something so simple as a reflection in a window?</p><p>Below are two images of the same basic scene. The reflection of the table and garbage can are slightly different; everything else is the same. Can you tell which is correct? </p>














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>The geometry of reflections is fairly straightforward. Consider standing in front of a mirror and looking at your reflection. An imaginary straight line connects each point on your body with its reflection. These lines are perpendicular to the mirror’s surface and are parallel to one another. When photographed at an oblique angle, however, these imaginary lines will not remain parallel but will converge to a single point. This is the same reason why railroad tracks that are parallel in the world appear to converge in a photograph.</p><p>This geometry of reflections suggests a simple forensic technique for verifying the integrity of reflections. Locate any point on an object and its corresponding point on the reflection, and draw a line through them. Repeat for as many clearly defined object and reflection points as possible. As you do this, you will find that all the lines should intersect at one point.&nbsp;</p><p>Below are the results of this simple geometric analysis, which clearly reveals the second reflection to be the fake.</p>














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  



  



  <p>Notice that this geometric analysis is exactly the same as that used to analyze shadows. The reason is that in both cases we are exploiting basic principles of perspective projection that dictate the projection of straight lines.</p><p>In practice, there are some limitations to a manual application of this geometric analysis. We must take care to select appropriately matched points on the shadow/reflection and the object. We can best achieve this when the object has a distinct shape, like the corner of a cube or the tip of a cone. Depending on the scene geometry, the constraint lines may be nearly parallel, making the computation of their intersection vulnerable to slight error in selecting matched points. And, it may be necessary to remove any lens distortion in the image that causes straight lines to be imaged as curved lines that will then no longer intersect at a single point.</p><p>From Adobe Photoshop to generative AI</p><p>When we first developed these techniques, we were primarily concerned with images that were manipulated with Photoshopto, for example, digitally add a person or object and its shadow or reflection. Because our own visual system is not particularly sensitive to inconsistent shadows and reflections (see item 1 in the Further Reading section below) and because it is difficult to precisely match the 3D scene geometry within 2D photo editing software, this technique has proven quite effective at uncovering fakes.</p><p>Classic computer-generated imagery is produced by modeling 3D scene geometry, the surrounding illumination, and a virtual camera. As a result, rendered images accurately capture the geometry and physics of natural scenes, including shadows and reflections. In contrast, AI-generated imagery is produced by learning the statistical distribution of natural scenes from a large set of real images. Without an explicit 3D model of the world, it is natural to wonder how accurately synthesized content captures the geometry of shadows and reflections.&nbsp;</p><p>Although we are still early in the age of generative AI, today's AI-generated images seem to struggle to produce perspectively correct shadows and reflections. Below is a typical example, generated using OpenAI's DALL-E2, in which the shadows are inconsistent (yellow lines), the reflections are impossibly mismatched and missing, and the shadows in the reflection are oriented in exactly the wrong direction. (See item 2 in the Further Reading section below for a more detailed analysis.</p><p>Even in the absence of explicit 3D modeling of objects, surfaces, and lighting — as found in traditional CGI-rendering — AI-generated images exhibit many of the properties of natural scenes. At the same time, cast shadows and reflections in mirrored surfaces are not fully consistent with the expected perspective geometry of natural scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>The trend in generative AI has been that increasingly larger synthesis engines yield increasingly more realistic images. As such, it may just be a matter of time before generative AI will learn to create images with full-blown perspective consistency. Until that time, however, this geometric forensic analysis may prove useful.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>1. S.J. Nightingale, K.A. Wade, H. Farid, and D.G.

 A guide to current and future practices <p>In a recent blog post, we <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2023/09/08/the-role-of-endorsement-in-open-badges-and-open-recognition/">outlined the role of endorsement in Open Badges and Open Recognition</a>. This article aims to demonstrate how you can apply these concepts within your community, both now and in the&nbsp;future.</p> Background and&nbsp;context <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/issuing-open-badges/">Issuing Open Badges</a> by Visual Thinkery is licensed under&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a><p>One of the unique features of Open Badges is that anyone can issue a badge for anything. In our work with the <a href="https://badges.community">Open Recognition is for Everybody</a> (ORE) community, we’ve emphasised that self-issued badges are crucial for avoiding the replication of existing power hierarchies. We do not aim not to merely mimic traditional awarding&nbsp;bodies.</p><p>Endorsement serves as a retrospective way to lend credibility to self-asserted skills, knowledge, or positive behaviours. In other words, community members can validate your claims after you’ve made them. This not only shows what you know and can do, but demonstrates the relationship between you and&nbsp;others.</p><p>While endorsements have been a part of the Open Badges framework for some time, they currently need to be added when the badge is issued. This isn’t ideal for self-issued badges, as it somewhat undermines their purpose; the endorser could just as well be the&nbsp;issuer.</p> Community recognition <p>In established communities of practice, recognition often operates organically and informally. While long-standing members easily see these relationships, they may be less visible to newcomers or those outside the community.</p><p>One method to add this recognition to a badge is by building a mini-portfolio around it. For instance, the screenshot below illustrates how this could be implemented on the new Participate platform:</p>Mockup of how supporting evidence could potentially be added to a badge in the new Participate platform (note: this does not show existing functionality)<p>In this scenario, the self-issued badge gains credibility through additional recognition from community members. The individual can opt to share this enriched page instead of just the&nbsp;badge.</p><p>Workflow:</p>  Self-assert skills, knowledge, or behaviour.  Seek recognition from&nbsp;peers.  Peers add recommendations via comments on the badge&nbsp;page.  Badge earner can delete (but not edit) comments.  Share the page featuring the badge and recognition.  <p>The upside of this method is its flexibility in providing additional community recognition. However, the downside is that this is confined to a specific platform.</p> Community endorsement <p>As explained in the <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2023/09/08/the-role-of-endorsement-in-open-badges-and-open-recognition/">post mentioned earlier</a>, version 3 of the Open Badges standard is compatible with Verifiable Credentials. Using this approach, endorsements act as credentials themselves and link back to the original&nbsp;badge.</p><p>While an image is not required for either badges or endorsements in v3, we expect images to remain popular with the issuing of badges. For endorsements, however, we envisage people using mainly text&nbsp;fields.</p><p>Workflow:</p>  Self-assert skills, knowledge, or behaviour.  Request endorsements from&nbsp;peers.  Peers add endorsements to the&nbsp;badge.  Badge earner can choose to display or hide endorsements.  Share the badge, complete with endorsements.  <p>The upside of this approach is its platform-agnostic nature, allowing badges and endorsements to be displayed anywhere. The current downside is its current impracticality, as no badging system yet supports the new version 3 standard in this&nbsp;way.</p> Conclusion <p>The true potential of Open Badges is coming to fruition, offering communities innovative ways to issue and endorse credentials without perpetuating existing power dynamics.</p><p>WAO is eager to contribute to this promising future. <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">Get in touch</a> if you need assistance, whether it’s for adding supporting evidence to badges now or planning for community endorsements in the&nbsp;future!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/endorsement-practices-using-open-badges-and-community-recognition-d0bfd96a4799">Endorsement using Open Badges and Community Recognition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

     <a></a>         Overview of the Pilot and the Problem It Solves           <p>The eTitling/eRegistration Automation Pilot (“Pilot”) is spearheaded by MOBI’s <a href="https://dlt.mobi/mobi-working-groups/">Finance, Securitization, and Smart Contract (FSSC) Working Group (WG)</a> with contributions from Accenture, Altaventure, Amazon Web Services, BMW Bank, CEVT, Connections Insights, CO-OP Financial Services, ConsenSys, D.E. Consulting, DENSO, DMI, Ford Credit, Global Debt Registry, GM Financial, Honda, IOTA, Itochu, National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), Nissan Motor Acceptance Company, On the Road Lending, Orrick, Quant Network, Quantstamp, Reply, RouteOne, Southeast Toyota Finance, Spring Free EV, Stellantis Financial Services, Tezos Foundation, Toyota Industries Corporation, Trade Log, and USAA.</p>
<p>Across the U.S., there are hundreds or even thousands of jurisdictions with unique databases and processes for handling registration and titling. While organizations in some of these jurisdictions have begun digitizing certain processes, it is difficult to automate eTitling/eRegistration across state lines with existing centralized platforms and databases. The sheer amount of stakeholders involved means that the frictional cost of trust is extremely high, and centralized solutions lack the interoperability and data security needed to address the challenges facing the ecosystem. Solving these pain points requires a secure solution that can be easily and cheaply adopted across all jurisdictions rather than one that functions at a state, county, or municipal jurisdiction level. </p>
<p>MOBI leverages standards-based <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twins™ (SSDTs)™</a> — decentralized universal translators — for ecosystem interoperability. SSDTs™ can be used by stakeholders within their existing applications to increase the efficiency of registration and titling for vehicles at the point of purchase or transfer. In Phase 1 of the Pilot, the FSSC WG will demonstrate privacy-preserving multiparty business automation for eTitling across jurisdictional and organizational lines. SSDTs™ will be used for communication interoperability without the need to build new infrastructure. The WG is currently drafting high-level requirements for the pilot. Phase 2 will include real-world implementation.</p>
                    Stakeholders:    Vehicle Manufacturers(OEMs); Financial Institutions (FIs) /Lenders &amp; Servicers; Dealerships; Motor Vehicle Authorities (MVAs) / Third party registration &amp; titling providers (RTPs); State Authorized Inspectors, Department of Justice National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (DoJ NMVTIS); Third Party Data Consolidators; Fleet Operators; and Consumers.                Our Innovative Solution        Self-Sovereign Digital Twins™: trusted decentralized identity for interoperability and business automation   <p>Currently, digital transactions rely on identities issued by centralized platforms to prove their credentials. However, in addition to being vulnerable to fraud, identity theft, and data leaks, centralized approaches to identity management fail to address the trust problems created by the rise of decentralized services, IOT, and Generative AI. As digitization advances, it will become increasingly challenging — and costly — to verify data authenticity, secure digital perimeters, and ensure cross-border regulation compliance. This is critical for state agencies like MVAs and regulated lenders, who are responsible for executing the bulk of the registration/titling process.</p>
<p>Overcoming these challenges calls for a new solution. The White House’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf">Federal Zero Trust Strategy</a> (2022) underscores this need by directing federal agencies to adopt a Zero Trust framework by the end of FY 2024. Zero Trust requires every entity to authenticate and validate every other entity for every single digital transaction at all times. Since this is not possible through Web2/centralized means, we must leverage Web3 technologies and principles to unlock privacy-preserving ecosystem interoperability using Citopia <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twins™ (SSDTs™)</a>.</p>
           What are SSDTs™?   <p>SSDTs™ are portable digital twins that can automatically authenticate identity and selectively disclose pertinent data for Web3 transactions at the edge. SSDTs™ combine standards from W3C, MOBI, IEEE, ISO, SAE, and others with Zero-Knowledge cryptography to offer the data privacy and autonomy needed to engage in secure, tamper-evident transactions across the connected ecosystem. SSDTs™ enable cross-industry interoperability and business automation through:</p>
        
<p>Enabling seamless verification and validation of identities and transactions</p>
    
<p>Empowering the creation of regulation-compliant data privacy solutions</p>
    
<p>Providing the ability to obtain and monetize data at the moment of transaction without the need to open up databases / store data</p>
    
<p>Serving as platform-agnostic, legacy system compatible “universal translators,” eliminating the need to build new infrastructure / APIs</p>

<p>By Omar Santos, Cisco Security Research and Operations; OASIS Board Member; OASIS CSAF TC Chair</p> 


<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity and supply chain security, it has become increasingly necessary to ensure the timely identification of End-of-Life (EOL) and End-of-Support (EOS) milestones for software or hardware. The current frameworks in place, including Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF), and Vulnerability Exchange (VEX), have been making strides in enhancing the transparency and efficiency of cybersecurity processes. Despite these advancements, there exists a significant gap in the industry: the lack of a standardized method to programmatically ascertain the EOL/EOS status (i.e., EoX) of products, a gap more noticeable with open-source software. It is in this context that we introduce <a href="https://openeox.org/">OpenEoX</a>.</p>



<p>OpenEoX seeks to address this problem by facilitating a programmatic approach to identifying the endpoint of a product’s lifecycle. When software or hardware reaches EoX milestones, security vulnerabilities and functional bugs are not addressed. This significantly increases the risk of any organization. OpenEoX aims to foster a more transparent, efficient, and unified method that includes vendors, open-source maintainers, and consumers of technology. Our objective is not to introduce another isolated specification but to develop a lightweight schema that can integrate seamlessly into existing solutions such as SBOMs, VEX, asset and vulnerability management systems, among others.</p>



<p>OASIS Open<a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/oasis-charter-discuss/202309/msg00000.html"> recently announced</a> the draft charter of the OpenEoX Technical Committee.</p>



<p>We are at a critical juncture where collaboration and collective effort are vital to shaping a standard that will serve the broader community. Many leading organizations including Microsoft, Cisco, Red Hat, Siemens, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security: BSI, and others are already engaged in this effort.</p>



<p>As we continue to make strides, we are extending an open invitation to those interested in joining this pioneering initiative. <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/join-a-tc/">Join now!</a> Your involvement will be instrumental in sculpting a new standard that promises to revolutionize the industry. We are eager to collaborate with industry experts around the world.</p>



<p>We encourage you to share this opportunity with other professionals and enthusiasts in the field. Your support in spreading the word will play a critical role in bringing together a community of like-minded individuals committed to fostering a safer and more secure digital environment. </p>



<p>We would like to invite you to our inaugural TC meeting on November 2nd. We strongly encourage you to become a member of the OpenEoX TC by October 26th, 2023, allowing you to contribute and participate in decision-making activities right from the beginning.

<p>The biometric industry is asking the privacy commissioner to develop a code of practice that will not impose regulations that stifle innovation.</p>



<p>Industry organisation Digital Identity (DINZ) was concerned regulation would introduce complexities and unintended consequences for the emerging technology.</p>



<p>DINZ executive director Colin Wallis said the industry was advocating for a code that offered strong guidance, while building awareness and education.</p>



<p>“No decision has been made yet, but our point to them was just be careful of the unintended consequences of coming in too quickly, with a lack of forethought about some of the unintended consequences,” he said.</p>



<p>“And our point was, start with beefing up guidance and support and knowledge and awareness, before beginning to try and regulate the space.”</p>



<p>Biometric information included physical and behavioural features such as faces, fingerprints, voices, and walking patterns, which could be used to verify identities online, border control, law enforcement, retail security, access control and attendance monitoring in workplaces and schools.</p>



<p>“Our response focuses on striking a balance between protecting individuals’ privacy and allowing responsible government and business use of biometric data,” Wallis said.</p>



<p>“We emphasise the importance of a thoughtful and well-informed approach to considering the potential for regulation of the use of biometrics, tailored to the unique challenges of this technology.”</p>

<p>We’re excited to share that we’re starting a new project aimed at contributing to a healthy and robust information ecosystem in Latin America and the Caribbean, supported by the Latin America Programme at Open Society Foundations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Healthy and robust information ecosystems are crucial: they are<a href="https://airtable.com/appnLJTCZnA6TP5Ho/shrUM9evKPo90DPUj/tbleFZPSMiFy9wKDM/viw4hkl0yu4pHAzem?blocks=hide" title=""> connected to</a> greater community cohesion, healthier civic spaces, higher voter turnout, increased trust in public institutions, and less polarised public dialogue. Being able to access, create, disseminate and share critical information about the world is foundational for individuals, organisations and communities to <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/innovation/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Internews_Mapping_Information_Ecosystems_2015.pdf" title="">survive, adapt and even transform</a> in the face of change, stress, shocks and disruption.</p>



<p>In Latin America and the Caribbean, we’ve witnessed concerning trends when it comes to the information ecosystem in recent years. Lack of or unequal access to information continues to be a key challenge throughout the region. Inequity in access to reliable internet and digital technologies has continued to affect many groups in various parts of the region, especially in rural areas and forest territories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, more and more state actors, corporate stakeholders and extremist groups in the region have been using the internet to undermine the work of activists dedicated to vital issues such as transparency and accountability, access to law or justice, land, water, women’s LGBTQI+ reproductive rights, and indigenous and racial justice. Disinformation and misinformation have <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2020/04/Fighting-misinformation-and-defending-free-expression-during-COVID-19-recommendations-for-states-1.pdf" title="">helped to foment hate speech against vulnerable groups</a>.</p>



<p>In our work supporting civil society organisations and activists with their tech and data, we see how attacks against activists and <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/press-under-attack-latin-america/" title="">journalists</a> are <a href="https://latamjournalismreview.org/articles/study-shows-83-percent-of-gender-editors-in-argentina-targeted-by-online-violence/" title="">frequent</a> and on the rise, with <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/for-rights-defenders-cyber-is-the-new-battleground/" title="">digital attacks</a> becoming more sophisticated and pervasive. Relatedly, many <a href="https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/surveillance-technology-is-on-the-rise-in-latin-america/" title="">governments in the region have been using surveillance technology</a>, which impacts <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/surveillance-tech-in-latin-america-made-abroad-deployed-at-home/" title="">civil society</a> and human rights defenders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At The Engine Room, we believe that we’re in a crucial moment to bring together organisers and activists who have diverse perspectives and expertises, and who are resilient and savvy to drive necessary change in relation to Latin America’s information ecosystems.</p>



 Our plans for this project&nbsp; 



<p>During the first phase of the project, we’ll be mapping the landscape of the Latin American information ecosystem, with a specific focus on trends and regional differences around dis- and misinformation, access to information, privacy and security, as well as freedom of expression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this research, we are looking to compile learnings from existing coalitions and advocacy efforts within civil society. We’ll conduct a series of interviews and host community calls with representatives from the region’s civil society groups, journalistic communities, technology and cybersecurity experts, and philanthropic institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the second phase, we will organise an in-person convening with activists and organisers, where we’ll co-create a shared, multilingual toolkit with recommendations and ideas for impactful advocacy efforts, campaigning and storytelling aimed at strengthening the region’s information ecosystem. During the event, we’ll collectively explore strategies for organisations to keep their operations protected, sustainable and resilient and dedicate space for field leaders to imagine and act towards a future where meaningful change is achieved. (We’ll share more about this convening over the next few months as the project unfolds!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout the whole duration of the project, and particularly after the toolkit is launched, we’re providing hands-on tech and data support to civil society organisations, activists and journalists (<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">sign up here!</a>). We hope to use findings from the research we conduct, as well as our previous experience supporting social justice organisations, to better support Latin American and Caribbean civil society organisations to proactively defend their operations from dis- and misinformation campaigns and <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/what-do-we-think-about-when-we-think-about-digital-resilience/" title="">increase their digital resilience</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Get involved&nbsp; 



<p>We’re far from being the only ones interested in strengthening the information ecosystem in the region – there has been so much fantastic work being done in Latin America and the Caribbean! We’d love to build on existing knowledge and connect with digital rights researchers, journalists and representatives of independent media, human rights defenders, philanthropic institutions, technologists, cybersecurity practitioners, and academics from the region who are interested in sharing their insights and ideas with us!&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to get in touch to learn more about the project and/or share insights from your work, feel free to reach out to <a href="mailto:barbara@theengineroom.org" title="">barbara@theengineroom.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re hosting a community call in a few weeks to talk about the challenges civil society is facing in the information ecosystem in the region. We’ll share more information about the event in our blog soon (and you can <a href="https://us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=1747fd8a7bf587bd4a215d984&amp;id=53139510a0&amp;e=8a7f1d5bf0" title="">sign up to our newsletter</a> to make sure you don’t miss it!).</p>



<p>We look forward to working with many of you on this project!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Estamos felizes&nbsp; de anunciar que começamos um novo projeto que visa contribuir para um ecossistema de informação mais saudável e robusto na América Latina e no Caribe, apoiado pelo Programa para a América Latina da Open Society Foundations.</p>



<p>Ecossistemas de informação saudáveis e robustos são cruciais: eles estão <a href="https://airtable.com/appnLJTCZnA6TP5Ho/shrUM9evKPo90DPUj/tbleFZPSMiFy9wKDM/viw4hkl0yu4pHAzem?blocks=hide" title="">ligados a uma maior coesão comunitária</a>, a espaços cívicos mais saudáveis, a uma maior participação eleitoral, a uma maior confiança nas instituições públicas e a um diálogo público menos polarizado. Ser capaz de acessar, criar, disseminar e compartilhar informações críticas sobre o mundo é fundamental para que indivíduos, organizações e comunidades <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/innovation/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Internews_Mapping_Information_Ecosystems_2015.pdf" title="">sobrevivam, se adaptem e até se transformem</a> face à mudança e à instabilidade.</p>



<p>Na América Latina e no Caribe, temos testemunhado tendências preocupantes no que diz respeito ao ecossistema da informação nos últimos anos. A falta ou a desigualdade de acesso à informação continua a ser um desafio fundamental em toda a região. A desigualdade no acesso à Internet estável e às tecnologias digitais continuou a afetar muitos grupos em várias partes da região, especialmente nas zonas rurais e nos territórios florestais.</p>



<p>Ao mesmo tempo, cada vez mais atores estatais, stakeholders corporativos e grupos extremistas na região têm utilizado a Internet para minar o trabalho de ativistas que se dedicam a questões vitais como a transparência e a responsabilização, o acesso à lei ou à justiça, à terra, à água, direitos reprodutivos LGBTQI+ das mulheres e justiça indígena e racial. A desinformação ajuda a <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2020/04/Fighting-misinformation-and-defending-free-expression-during-COVID-19-recommendations-for-states-1.pdf" title="">fomentar o discurso de ódio contra grupos vulneráveis</a>.</p>



<p>No nosso trabalho apoiando organizações da sociedade civil e ativistas com o seu uso de tecnologia e dados, vemos como os ataques contra ativistas e <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/press-under-attack-latin-america/" title="">jornalistas</a> são <a href="https://latamjournalismreview.org/articles/study-shows-83-percent-of-gender-editors-in-argentina-targeted-by-online-violence/" title="">frequentes</a> e crescentes, com <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/for-rights-defenders-cyber-is-the-new-battleground/" title="">ataques digitais</a> tornando-se mais sofisticados e difundidos. Ao mesmo tempo, <a href="https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/surveillance-technology-is-on-the-rise-in-latin-america/" title="">muitos governos da região</a> têm utilizado tecnologia de vigilância, o que tem <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/surveillance-tech-in-latin-america-made-abroad-deployed-at-home/" title="">impacto na sociedade civil</a> e nos defensores dos direitos humanos.</p>



<p>Na The Engine Room, acreditamos que estamos em um momento crucial para reunir organizações e ativistas que tenham diversas perspectivas e conhecimentos, e que são resilientes e experientes, para impulsionar as mudanças necessárias em relação aos ecossistemas de informação da América Latina.</p>



 Nossos planos para este projeto 



<p>Durante a primeira fase do projeto, mapearemos o panorama do ecossistema de informação latino-americano, com foco específico nas tendências e diferenças regionais em torno da desinformação e da desinformação, do acesso à informação, da privacidade e da segurança, bem como da liberdade de expressão.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Para esta pesquisa, pretendemos compilar os ensinamentos retirados das coligações existentes e dos esforços de advocacy no seio da sociedade civil. Conduziremos uma série de entrevistas e realizaremos chamadas&nbsp; comunitárias com representantes de grupos da sociedade civil da região, comunidades jornalísticas, especialistas em tecnologia e segurança cibernética e instituições filantrópicas.</p>



<p>Na segunda fase, organizaremos uma reunião presencial com ativistas e organizações, onde co-criaremos um kit de ferramentas compartilhado e multilingue com recomendações e ideias para esforços de advocacia, campanhas e narração de histórias impactantes destinados a fortalecer o ecossistema de informação da região. Durante o evento, exploraremos coletivamente estratégias para que as organizações mantenham as suas operações protegidas, sustentáveis e resilientes e dedicaremos espaço para os participantes imaginarem e agirem em direção a um futuro onde mudanças significativas sejam alcançadas. (Compartilharemos mais sobre este evento nos próximos meses, à medida que o projeto se desenrola!).</p>



<p>Durante toda a duração do projeto, e especialmente após o lançamento do kit de ferramentas, ofereceremos apoio prático de tecnologia e dados a organizações da sociedade civil, ativistas e jornalistas (<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">inscreva-se aqui</a>!). Esperamos utilizar os resultados da investigação que conduzimos, bem como a nossa experiência anterior no apoio a organizações de justiça social, para melhor apoiar as organizações da sociedade civil da América Latina e das Caraíbas a defenderem proativamente as suas operações contra campanhas de desinformação e a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/what-do-we-think-about-when-we-think-about-digital-resilience/" title="">aumentarem a sua resiliência digital</a>.</p>



 Participe&nbsp; 



<p>Estamos longe de ser os únicos interessados em fortalecer o ecossistema de informação na região – tem muito trabalho fantástico sendo feito na América Latina e no Caribe! Adoraríamos aproveitar o conhecimento existente e conectar-nos com investigadores de direitos digitais, jornalistas e representantes de meios de comunicação independentes, defensores dos direitos humanos, instituições filantrópicas, tecnólogos, profissionais de segurança cibernética e acadêmicos da região que estejam interessados em compartilhar os seus conhecimentos e ideias com nós!</p>



<p>Se você quiser entrar em contato para saber mais sobre o projeto e/ou compartilhar insights de seu trabalho, sinta-se à vontade para escrever para <a href="mailto:barbara@theengineroom.org">barbara@theengineroom.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dentro de algumas semanas realizaremos uma chamada comunitária para falar sobre os desafios que a sociedade civil enfrenta no ecossistema de informação da região. Em breve compartilharemos mais informações sobre o evento em nosso blog (e você pode <a href="https://us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=1747fd8a7bf587bd4a215d984&amp;id=53139510a0&amp;e=8a7f1d5bf0" title="">se inscrever em nossa newsletter</a> para não perder!).</p>



<p>Estamos ansiosas para trabalhar com muitos de vocês neste projeto!</p>

<p>Nos complace compartir que estamos iniciando un nuevo proyecto destinado a contribuir a un ecosistema informativo saludable y robusto en América Latina y el Caribe, respaldado por el Programa de América Latina en Open Society Foundations.</p>



<p>Los ecosistemas informativos saludables y robustos son importantes: están <a href="https://airtable.com/appnLJTCZnA6TP5Ho/shrUM9evKPo90DPUj/tbleFZPSMiFy9wKDM/viw4hkl0yu4pHAzem?blocks=hide" title="">conectados</a> a una mayor cohesión comunitaria, espacios cívicos más saludables, mayor participación de votantes, mayor confianza en las instituciones públicas y un diálogo público menos polarizado.&nbsp;Ser capaz de acceder, crear, difundir y compartir información crítica sobre el mundo es fundamental para que las personas, las organizaciones y las comunidades <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/innovation/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Internews_Mapping_Information_Ecosystems_2015.pdf" title="">sobrevivan, se adapten e incluso se transformen</a> frente al cambio, el estrés, las crisis y las disrupciones.</p>



<p>En América Latina y el Caribe, hemos presenciado tendencias preocupantes en lo que respecta al ecosistema informativo en años recientes. La falta o el acceso desigual a la información sigue siendo un desafío clave en toda la región. La inequidad en el acceso a internet confiable y a las tecnologías digitales continúa afectando a muchos grupos en varias partes de la región, especialmente en áreas rurales y territorios forestales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Al mismo tiempo, cada vez más actores estatales, corporaciones y grupos extremistas en la región han estado usando el internet para minar el trabajo de activistas dedicados a temas como la transparencia y la rendición de cuentas, el acceso a la ley o justicia, tierra, agua, derechos reproductivos de mujeres LGBTQI+, y justicia indigena y racial. La desinformación y la información errónea han <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2020/04/Fighting-misinformation-and-defending-free-expression-during-COVID-19-recommendations-for-states-1.pdf" title="">ayudado a fomentar discursos de odio contra grupos vulnerables</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>En nuestro trabajo apoyando a organizaciones de la sociedad civil y activistas con su tecnología y datos, vemos como los ataques contra activistas y <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/press-under-attack-latin-america/" title="">periodistas</a> son <a href="https://latamjournalismreview.org/articles/study-shows-83-percent-of-gender-editors-in-argentina-targeted-by-online-violence/" title="">frecuentes</a> y están en aumento, con <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/for-rights-defenders-cyber-is-the-new-battleground/" title="">ataques digitales</a> cada vez más sofisticados y generalizados. De manera relacionada, muchos <a href="https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/surveillance-technology-is-on-the-rise-in-latin-america/" title="">gobiernos en la región han estado usando tecnología de vigilancia</a>, lo que <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/surveillance-tech-in-latin-america-made-abroad-deployed-at-home/" title="">afecta a la sociedad civil</a> y a los defensores de los derechos humanos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Como miembros del equipo de The Engine Room, creemos que estamos en un momento crucial para reunir a organizaciones y activistas que tienen perspectivas y experiencias diversas, y que son resilientes y espabilados para impulsar el cambio necesario en relación con los ecosistemas informativos de América Latina.&nbsp;</p>



 Nuestros planes para este proyecto 



<p>Durante la primera fase del proyecto, estaremos mapeando el panorama del ecosistema informativo latinoamericano, con un enfoque específico en tendencias y diferencias regionales en desinformación y mala información, acceso a la información, privacidad y seguridad, así como libertad de expresión.&nbsp;</p>



<p>En esta investigación, buscamos recopilar aprendizajes de coaliciones y esfuerzos de defensa ya existentes dentro de la sociedad civil. Realizaremos una serie de entrevistas y llamadas comunitarias con representantes de los grupos de la sociedad civil de la región, comunidades periodísticas, expertos en tecnología y ciberseguridad, e instituciones filantrópicas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>En la segunda fase, organizaremos un encuentro presencial con activistas y organizadores, donde co-crearemos un kit de herramientas compartido y multilingüe con recomendaciones e ideas para esfuerzos de defensa impactantes, campañas y narración de historias dirigidos a fortalecer el ecosistema informativo de la región. Durante el evento, exploraremos colectivamente estrategias para que las organizaciones mantengan sus operaciones protegidas, sostenibles y resilientes y dedicaremos espacio para que los líderes del campo imaginen y actúen hacia un futuro donde se logre un cambio significativo. (¡Compartiremos más sobre este encuentro en los próximos meses a medida que se desarrolle el proyecto!).</p>



<p>Durante toda la duración del proyecto, y especialmente después del lanzamiento del kit de herramientas, estaremos ofreciendo apoyo técnico y de datos a organizaciones de la sociedad civil, activistas y periodistas (<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">¡inscríbete aquí!</a>). Esperamos usar los hallazgos de la investigación que realizamos, así como nuestra experiencia previa apoyando organizaciones de justicia social, para apoyar mejor a las organizaciones de la sociedad civil de América Latina y el Caribe para defender proactivamente sus operaciones de campañas de desinformación e <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/what-do-we-think-about-when-we-think-about-digital-resilience/" title="">incrementar su resiliencia digital</a>.</p>



 Participa 



<p>Estamos lejos de ser los únicos interesados en fortalecer el ecosistema informativo en la región: ¡se ha hecho tanto trabajo fantástico en América Latina y el Caribe! Nos encantaría aprovechar el conocimiento existente y conectar con investigadores de derechos digitales, periodistas y representantes de medios independientes, defensores de derechos humanos, instituciones filantrópicas, tecnólogos, profesionales de ciberseguridad y académicos de la región interesados en compartir sus perspectivas e ideas con nosotros.</p>



<p>Si deseas ponerte en contacto para obtener más información sobre el proyecto y/o compartir percepciones de tu trabajo, no dudes en escribir a <a href="mailto:barbara@theengineroom.org">barbara@theengineroom.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizaremos una llamada comunitaria en las próximas semanas para hablar sobre los desafíos que enfrenta la sociedad civil en el ecosistema informativo en la región. Compartiremos más información sobre el evento en nuestro blog pronto (¡y puedes inscribirte a <a href="https://us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=1747fd8a7bf587bd4a215d984&amp;id=53139510a0&amp;e=8a7f1d5bf0" title="">nuestro boletín</a> para asegurarte de no perdértelo!).</p>



<p>¡Esperamos trabajar con muchos de ustedes en este proyecto!</p>

<p>Talk with Vladimir Vujovic, Senior Digital Innovation Manager from SICPA about product definition and value proposition of Issuer/Holder/Verifier software of SSI tech providers. Why is it hard to convey the right message to the audience coming from outside of SSI domain. How different SSI tech providers define their offering and the language they use to convey the message. What is really the value proposition of SSI tech providers who are offering their Issuer/Verifier software to the market. How big regulation initiatives like the one in Europe for eIDAS v2 are driving the market and roadmaps for SSI tech providers and how will such initiative will have impact to the rest of the world in terms of regulation, but some of the underlying technical standards. What is the place of SSI platforms in the broader Identity landscape and when are we going to see more maturity from the market. </p>

<p>Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ), an organization making expert contributions to New Zealand’s digital transformation efforts, has underlined the need to prioritize an intense awareness and education program related to the intricacies of biometrics deployment in the country.</p>



<p>This call is contained in a&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DINZ-Response_-Biometrics-discussion-document-2023.pdf">submission</a>&nbsp;by the group and it comes as the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/new-zealand-privacy-commissioner-considers-biometric-regulation-code">is considering</a>&nbsp;a code of practice that will regulate the use of the technology that has become a common feature in the daily lives of New Zealanders, according to a DINZ news release.</p>



<p>From online ID verification to border control, to law enforcement, retail security, access control and attendance monitoring in offices and schools, the deployment of biometrics in growing by the day in New Zealand and users are also getting worried about the potential risks of the technology if it is deployed improperly.</p>



<p>“Our response focuses on striking a balance between protecting individuals’ privacy and allowing responsible government and business use of biometric data. We emphasize the importance of a thoughtful and well-informed approach to considering the potential for regulation of the use of biometrics, tailored to the unique challenges of this technology,” says Colin Wallis, DINZ executive director.</p>



<p>He adds that because biometrics are increasingly taking a preponderant place in the lives of citizens, the need for “demonstrable privacy and technical expertise, alongside practical experience combined with good design and implementation, are keys to great outcomes.”</p>



<p>In the submission, DINZ advises the OPC on five key things to consider as it figures out a biometrics code of practice.</p>



<p>On privacy protection, the organization believes that users can have assurance about adequate privacy protection if privacy impact assessment as sated in the Privacy Act 2020 is made mandatory. This, it says, will help “avoid unintended consequences, elevate industry standards and prevent subpar practices.”</p>



<p>Among other things, DINZ calls for clarification on which definition of biometrics should apply to New Zealand before a code of practice is considered, suggests that regulatory changes should primarily safeguard individuals’ privacy in identification and verification processes, advises OPC to exercise caution and avoid rushing into implementing a code of practice which could trigger a change towards “compliance behaviour” that will stifle innovation.</p>



<p>“The proposals for a code could suspend, reduce, or delay use of biometric information, to the detriment of information security and customer service,” DINZ writes in response to the OPC’s question about potential unintended consequences of its regulation. “The proposals could also stunt development and innovation that would in time improve the accuracy and acceptability of less well known/trusted use cases.”</p>



<p>A similar point about the risk of stifling biometrics innovation with overly restrictive regulation has also been made by, biometrics developers like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/201910/facefirst-helps-us-lawmakers-draft-facial-recognition-privacy-regulations">FaceFirst</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/eu-preparing-tough-measures-for-ai-while-uk-and-us-take-a-slow-approach">government officials</a>, and even the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202207/with-long-road-ahead-experts-suggest-eu-ai-act-could-stifle-or-enable-biometrics-adoption">International Association of Privacy Professionals</a>.</p>



<p>The group also recommends that OPC collaborate with industry experts to co-create guidance on biometric information’s use in identification and verification.</p>

Engaging GenZ with Voice and Choice to Promote Digital Literacy</p>
<p>“The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report lists Technology Use as one of their top 10 skills for 2025. Across industries, skills in visual design, digital storytelling, and video production are in high demand, as digital communication dominates the mainstream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To begin this session, we will introduce Generation Z and explain their needs and expectations for the classroom environment. Driven by sense of purpose, Gen Z students will connect with learning experiences that emphasize creativity, voice, equity, and utility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will present an assignment that engages students in course content while developing their digital literacy in preparation for the professional demands that lie ahead. While traditional essays and discussion forums can be perceived as irrelevant and impersonal, this authentic assignment capitalizes on students’ impetus to create something that has real-world meaning.</p>
<p>All participants will receive a prompt and rubric, which includes a list of potential, student-created digital artifacts and corresponding instructions. We’ll discuss considerations for implementation, including ways to customize the assignment to meet the needs of virtually all instructional modalities and course delivery formats. Instructors can also tailor the list of options to leverage available institutional technology and resources without bearing responsibility for learning, teaching, and supporting new software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the heart of this assignment, we’ll discuss how giving students “voice and choice” bolsters their resilience and empowers them to persevere through challenges. Research is conclusive that student investment and performance skyrocket when they are given agency in determining how to demonstrate proficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The session will conclude with a hands-on activity in which participants use the provided rubric to evaluate real student work samples. We will finish with a question-and-answer session and scannable QR code that leads to downloadable materials and a cited list of the research that informed this presentation.”</p>

HyFlex: Creating Opportunities for Success as a Community College</p>
<p>After the pandemic, Ocean County College was looking to create more flexibility for students in how they receive their education. In the summer of 2022, the college launched its first set of fully HyFlex courses allowing students to choose on any given day whether they came to class in person or logged in remotely to the live class session. Data was collected over the course of the 2022-2023 Academic year to see how students performed and to see if there were any advantages students perceived to using the modality. Many positive outcomes were discovered. This session will go over the results from the qualitative and quantitative data as well as walk participants through the process of implementing HyFlex classes in a community college setting.</p>

Crafting Campus Connections with Oral History and Adobe Premiere Rush</p>
<p>This presentation discusses how student-created videos using Adobe Premiere Rush contribute to campus connectivity—we will provide examples that demonstrate the community-building nature of the assignment in a post-pandemic era and conclude with a reflection on how the final project submissions (which were donated to the university’s archives) used a new technology to create inspiring content that benefitted not only students, but also members of the Seton Hall University community in the present moment and, as we will explain, future community members as well. In our ever-changing technological world, collaborative projects between college students, faculty, and staff must ensure individuals from different backgrounds can work together to benefit their university communities. The disconnects that exist between these groups, however, present challenges for determining what productive collaborations and connections might look like. An oral history assignment used at Seton Hall University in Spring 2023 reflects one such innovative approach. First we will discuss how oral history presents a unique and engaging way for students to learn about history from those who have lived it and then we outline the assignment itself. Finally the audience will see how the creation of an oral history using Adobe Premiere Rush was the ideal way for students to practice several skills including various research techniques (reading primary and secondary sources), interpersonal communication (interviewing), and video creation (Adobe Premiere Rush).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Using Bite-sized Videos to Layer Nurse Practitioner Content</p>
<p>Educators are constantly exploring innovative strategies to assist students in retaining salient course material. Educational research has established that students need to refocus in under a minute, their attentiveness diminishes throughout a class, and they focus more effectively when student-centered pedagogies are integrated (Blake, 2023). Specifically, Gen Z nursing graduate students have shorter attention spans and, as digital natives (Prensky, 2001), expect to learn through a variety of modalities (Chicca &amp; Shellenbarger, 2018; Singh &amp; Dangmei, 2016). Today’s nurse practitioner students are digitally grounded and often prefer information in bite-sized chunks. To address this need, the presenters created a series of health assessment bite-sized videos highlighting important lecture content to reinforce nurse practitioner student course content. The presenters found this tailored approach can effectively engage nurse practitioner students and leverage the most important content for retention beyond the didactic classroom. This presentation will emphasize the process used in developing and refining the videos with a look forward to adapting the format to other subject areas.</p>

Preparing to Teach Online: From Learner to Teacher 
<p>Learning and teaching in the online environment often look very different than in face-to-face classrooms. For novice instructors, understanding how students experience the online classroom can feel like a daunting task. Through the Online Teaching Certificate (OTC) Program offered by Rutgers Teaching and Learning with Technology, instructors take on the role of online students for themselves. As they learn about key principles of online pedagogy and instructional technology usage, they also build empathy for their students, reflecting on their own experiences, challenges, and discoveries as online learners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this workshop, we will provide an overview of the design of the OTC program, highlighting one course in detail. We will demonstrate how the structure and content of this course, Universal Design and Accessibility for Online Teaching, facilitates both skill-building and metacognitive reflection about participants’ experiences as online learners. Attendees will focus on key challenges related to online learning contexts as well as strategies supporting online student success.</p>

Making Art with Embedded Poetry from Human and ChatGPT Sources</p>
<p>I published a book in 2011 titled “3D Haiku and Tanka” in Apple Books which explored how writing poetry in 3D space was different from traditional ways of writing on flat 2D surfaces. When 3D printing strategies became available, now it was possible to make 3D real world models of assembled poetic lines which also contained audio buttons that could be pressed for a line of poetry to be read aloud. The appearance of laser cutters made possible the use of multicolored acrylic sheets cut into patterns such as squares, rectangles and pentagons and held together with wood veneer and nuts and bolts. The text of poems are laser cut into the acrylic sheets with QR codes placed nearby for reading by patrons who may be blind or visually impaired. The appearance of ChatGPT now permits the possibility of asking ChatGPT to write poetry in Haiku or Tanka format and include the selected poetry in the mixed media art piece. An example of a Tanka poem made from asking ChatGPT follows.</p>
<p>Silent algorithms,<br>
AI ponders the unknown,<br>
Unraveling truths,<br>
The quest for understanding,<br>
Guided by digital minds.</p>
<p>This raises questions about copyright as ChatGPT utilizes what is available in its captured database to write poetry so any art I make with ChatGPT-inspired poetry pays credit to ChatGPT when its generated poetry is used in an art piece and in that way can be viewed as a virtual collaborator and listed as so in the information describing the art piece.</p>

<p>Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ) has submitted a comprehensive response to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) on its consideration of a code of practice for biometrics.&nbsp;DINZ is Aotearoa’s only community dedicated to digital identity, delivering trustworthy and recognised thought leadership that influences digital identity decision-making for the common good.&nbsp;DINZ’s deep insight into the operating environment for biometrics highlights the complexities and potential unintended consequences of introducing regulation through a code rather than starting with strong guidance, awareness, and education in this field.</p>



<p>Biometric information encompasses physical and behavioural features such as faces, fingerprints, voices, and walking patterns.&nbsp;Some examples of its use include identity verification online, border control, law enforcement, retail security, access control, and attendance monitoring in workplaces and schools.</p>



<p>The increasing role of biometric technologies in the lives of New Zealanders has led to calls for greater regulation of biometrics. Other countries are also considering how best to minimise potential harm to people caused by improper use of these technologies and some have enacted specific regulatory frameworks for biometrics.&nbsp;A code (if taken forward) could change how the privacy principles in the Privacy Act apply when organisations use technology to analyse biometric information.</p>



<p>DINZ Executive Director Colin Wallis says, “Our response focuses on striking a balance between protecting individuals’ privacy and allowing responsible government and business use of biometric data. We emphasise the importance of a thoughtful and well-informed approach to considering the potential for regulation of the use of biometrics, tailored to the unique challenges of this technology.</p>



<p>“Biometrics improves the digital experiences of New Zealanders every day in both the public and private sectors. Demonstrable privacy and technical expertise, alongside practical experience combined with good design and implementation, are keys to great outcomes,” says Colin.</p>



<p>Key Points from DINZ’s Response:</p>



  Privacy Protection: DINZ believes that the Privacy Act 2020 can provide people with adequate privacy protections for biometrics if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/responsibilities/privacy-impact-assessments/">Privacy Impact Assessments&nbsp;</a>become mandatory and high-quality, clear industry co-created guidance is issued under the oversight of OPC. This approach aims to avoid unintended consequences, elevate industry standards and prevent subpar practices.  



  Clarity on Definitions: DINZ emphasises the need for consensus on which of the international definitions of biometrics will apply in New Zealand before considering a code of practice. Clear definitions across the entire domain are essential to prevent confusion and ensure alignment with global standards.  



  Focus on Identification, Verification and Classification: DINZ suggests that regulatory changes should primarily safeguard individuals’ privacy in identification and verification processes, avoiding overlap with other regulatory authorities or areas outside the Privacy Act’s jurisdiction.  



  Measured Approach: DINZ advises OPC to exercise caution and avoid rushing into implementing a code of practice. The roughly equal support for further guidance and a code indicates concerns that a rush to a code will result in a change towards ‘compliance behaviour’ that will stifle innovation, have unintended consequences, and negatively affect the positive outcomes sought by a code’s introduction.  



  Industry Expertise: DINZ recommends that OPC collaborates with industry experts to co-create guidance on biometric information’s use in identification and verification. Such collaboration ensures informed and practical guidance while enhancing OPC’s expertise in this complex field.

    <blockquote>
      <p>There is one “extra” field that JSON-LD requires/needs which is @context and if you didn’t want to use it and simply wanted to ignore it and just do JSON you could. The VC would be entirely compliant and thus both data expression formats could live in the same specification. JSON-LD credentials that did have an @context that were being read by tooling that just did JSON could still read the credentials – it did nothing to interfere. This seems like a pretty good “let’s figure out how to live with each other” solution.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This specification refers to cryptographic algorithm identifiers that fully specify the cryptographic operations to be performed, including any curve, key derivation function (KDF), hash functions, etc., as being “fully specified”. Whereas, it refers to cryptographic algorithm identifiers that require additional information beyond the algorithm identifier to determine the cryptographic operations to be performed as being “polymorphic”. This specification creates fully-specified algorithm identifiers for all registered JOSE and COSE polymorphic algorithm identifiers, enabling applications to use only fully-specified algorithm identifiers.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A JWT-VC has three parts, and the payload contains what I would call envelope information: the data needed to know who the credential is is bound to, who made the credential, when it was made and how it can be identified.  Additionally, there is a JSON object called “vc”. Claims information is embedded inside the vc object.  A JWT-VC uses an external proof, meaning in this case that signature data is not embedded inline with the credential, the signature is detached from the credential.

    <blockquote>
      <p>JWT takes a different approach to determining the meaning of claim terms in credentials. There is an <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml">IANA registry for JWT claims</a> as a first place to look for JWT claim definitions. If the claim name isn’t in the IANA register, then the claim can be given a “give it a public name (i.e., a URI), [or] a local name (i.e., any string)”. The meaning of the terms is decided between the issuers and verifiers.</p>

      <p>In the VC Implementation Guidelines, there is a long list of the different characterizations of methods: JSON with JWT’s support vs JSON-LD with LD Signatures, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-imp-guide/#benefits-of-jwts">Benefits of JWT</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-imp-guide/#benefits-of-json-ld-and-ld-proofs">Benefits of JSON-LD and LD-Proofs</a>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>JWTs have the benefit of already being widely used in today’s identity technologies, most notably in the framework used by OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. Because of this, there are a number of existing software libraries and tools that developers can use immediately to begin building out their implementations. In addition, due to the fact that JWT-based credentials rely on a shared assertion format with existing identity technologies, it may be an easier mental model for newcomers to adopt when starting to experiment with VCs.</p>

 VC-JWT Selective Disclosure 
 
   [Standards Track] <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">SD-JWT-based Verifiable Credentials (SD-JWT VC)</a> 2023-08-16 Oliver Terbu, Daniel Fett IETF
    <blockquote>
      <p>JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [RFC7519] can in principle be used to express Verifiable Credentials in a way that is easy to understand and process as it builds upon established web primitives.</p>

      <p>Selective Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT) [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] is a specification that introduces conventions to support selective disclosure for JWTs: For an SD-JWT document, a Holder can decide which claims to release (within bounds defined by the Issuer).</p>

      <p>SD-JWT is a superset of JWT as it can also be used when there are no selectively disclosable claims and also supports JWS JSON serialization, which is useful for long term archiving and multi signatures. However, SD-JWT itself does not define the claims that must be used within the payload or their semantics.</p>

      <p>This specification therefore uses SD-JWT and the well-established JWT content rules and extensibility model as basis for representing Verifiable Credentials with JSON payload. Those Verifiable Credentials are called SD-JWT VCs.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The JOSE RFCs and JWT, have been widely adopted for identity use cases, including for the widely-deployed OpenID Connect protocol and STIR. Concurrent to the growth of adoption of these standards has been an increasing societal focus on privacy. Common privacy themes in identity solutions that intersect with JWT are user consent and minimal disclosure.</p>

      <p>In recent years, newer solutions have been evolving such as Verifiable Credentials that formalize the entities of Issuer, Holder, and Verifier. A Verifiable Credential lifecycle has three accompanying phases: issuance, storage, and presentation. The JOSE and JWT standards have also been adopted by Verifiable Credentials (for the JWT-VC representation), but JWS and JWT have limitations that make privacy protection challenging.</p>

      <p>CBOR is a compact binary data serialization and messaging format. This specification defines CBOR-LD 1.0, a CBOR-based format to serialize Linked Data. The encoding is designed to leverage the existing JSON-LD ecosystem, which is deployed on hundreds of millions of systems today, to provide a compact serialization format for those seeking efficient encoding schemes for Linked Data. By utilizing semantic compression schemes, compression ratios in excess of 60% better than generalized compression schemes are possible. This format is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in storage and bandwidth constrained programming environments, to build interoperable semantic wire-level protocols, and to efficiently store Linked Data in CBOR-based storage engines.</p>

  In his latest piece, digital forensics expert and CAI advisor Hany Farid 
investigates how lighting environments can help distinguish real images 
from AI-generated ones. He dives into techniques used in computer-generated 
imagery (CGI) technology we've grown accustomed to through entertainment 
and gaming and today's AI systems producing photorealistic images.

<p>In this era of generative AI, how do we determine whether an image is human-created or machine-made?&nbsp;For the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Professor Hany Farid shares the techniques used for identifying real and synthetic images — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, environmental lighting, and GAN-generated faces. A world-renowned expert in the field of misinformation, disinformation, and digital forensics as well as an advisor to the CAI, Professor Farid explores the limits of these techniques and their part in a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the fourth article in a six-part series.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>Part 1: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">From the darkroom to generative AI</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">How realistic are AI-generated faces?</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-for-ai-generated-faces">Photo forensics for AI-generated faces</a></p>




 


  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>Classic computer-generated imagery (CGI) is produced by modeling 3D scene geometry, the surrounding illumination, and a virtual camera. As a result, rendered images accurately capture the geometry and physics of natural scenes. By contrast, AI-generated imagery is produced by learning the statistical distribution of natural scenes. Without an explicit 3D model of the world, we might expect that these images will not always accurately capture the 3D properties of natural scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>The lighting of a scene can be complex, because any number of lights can be placed in any number of positions, leading to different lighting environments. Under some fairly modest assumptions, however, it has been shown that a wide range of lighting can be modeled as a weighted sum of nine 3D lighting environments that each capture a variety of lighting patterns from different directions.</p><p>My team and I first wondered if lighting environments on AI-generated faces match those on photographic images. Next, we wondered if the lighting on multiple faces or objects in an image are the same, as would be expected in an authentic photo.</p><p>Analyzing lighting environments first requires fitting and aligning a 3D model to individual objects. Fortunately, for faces, fitting a 3D model to a single image is a problem that has largely been solved. (See article 1 in the Further Reading section.)&nbsp;</p><p>Below you’ll see a 3D model fitted to an AI-generated face. From this aligned 3D model, we can estimate the surrounding lighting environment, which reduces to nine numeric values corresponding to the weight on each of nine 3D lighting environments.</p>

  <p>As you can see in the plot on the left below, there are some significant deviations between the nine lighting values for real faces (horizontal axis) and diffusion-generated faces (vertical axis). Interestingly, as you can see in the plot on the right, the lighting on GAN-generated faces (see previous post) are nearly indistinguishable from the lighting on real faces.</p>

  <p>While a comparison of lighting environments may expose a diffusion-based face (or object), it appears that this approach will not provide much insight for GAN-based faces. This is the reverse of our <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-for-ai-generated-faces">previously described technique</a>, which was applicable to GAN-based faces but not diffusion-based faces, further highlighting the need for a wide variety of approaches.</p><p>The above analysis can be expanded to compare the lighting between two people or two objects situated side by side in an image where, in a naturally photographed scene, we expect the lighting to be the same. For this analysis, we find that diffusion-based faces and objects exhibit relatively large (but not always perceptually obvious) differences in lighting. (See article 3 in the “Further reading” section below for more details.)</p><p>The strength of this lighting analysis is that we have discovered a fairly fundamental limitation of today's AI-generated content: In the absence of explicit 3D models of the physical world, diffusion-based models struggle to create images that are internally (across multiple people/objects) and externally (as compared to photographic images) consistent. The weakness of this technique is that, unlike other approaches, it does not necessarily lend itself to a fully automatic and high-throughput analysis. The fitting of 3D models can be somewhat time intensive and require manual intervention.</p><p>Another strength of this technique is that even when made aware of the issue of lighting inconsistencies, it is not easy for an adversary to adjust the image. That is because the pattern of illumination is the result of an interaction of the 3D lighting and the 3D scene geometry, whereas most photo editing occurs in 2D. Also, as you will see in the next post, there are additional aspects to lighting that we can exploit to distinguish the real from the fake.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>[1] Y. Feng, H. Feng, M.J.

  <p>ABSTRACT: Self-Sovereign Computing is a transformative paradigm designed to empower individuals to take command of their digital journey and to uphold their dignity, human rights, and resilience online. It encourages proactive collaboration among individuals, collectives, and platforms to enhance digital autonomy and to mitigate vulnerabilities. Building on Christopher’s initial ideas of self-sovereign identity, self-sovereign computing introduces an allegory that revisits some foundational influences and recognizes self-sovereignty not just as a personal choice but as something that’s part of a larger ecosystem._</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2016, Christopher Allen authored <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">“The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>, where he introduced the concept of “Self-Sovereignty” to the world, with its ten principles. Five years later, he offered an <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/SSI-5-Years-On/">update</a> on its progress. Today, the self-sovereign community continues to evolve, with recent successes including <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/news/specifications/DIDs-Ratified/">the ratification of DIDs</a> and the passage of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">laws in Wyoming</a> that recognized self-sovereignty. Given the time that had passed, Christopher also wrote an article talking about <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.</p>

<p>Christopher’s newest look at self-sovereignty is an allegory that again revisits some of its foundational influences, recognizing self-sovereignty not just as a personal choice, but something that’s part of a larger ecosystem.</p>



 Your Digital Journey 

<p>Consider the times when you’ve felt lost in the vast and unpredictable digital sea. You’ve set out in a small ship, but your course is uncertain.</p>

<p>Despite being the rightful owner of that ship, you are a mere passenger. Your ports of call and your choice of companion vessels are not under your command but dictated by corporate behemoths that lurk beneath the waves. These unseen gatekeepers exact a continuous “toll” from you, not always in gold, but often in the currency of your personal data or by compelling you to relinquish your rights. Those behemoths control not just your data, but also your actual digital identity.</p>

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing is about finding a better way: about giving you control over your digital vessel.</p>

 Claiming Command — From Passenger to Captain 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing empowers you to claim command, to ascend from being a passenger to becoming the captain of your digital ship. This gives you the autonomy to plot your journey, to command your personal data, and to navigate digital exchanges without the burden of incessant tolls.</p>

<p>You become the rightful commander of your digital voyage and online experience.</p>

 Assembling Your Tools — Devices and Services 

<p>Your smartphone, your laptop, your smartwatch, and your digital wallet are the tools that you use to command your vessel, modern-day sextants and compasses. They help you to become a skilled navigator in the often treacherous marketplace of the digital ocean.</p>

<p>They are also powerful tools of communication that allow you to foster cooperation with other digital captains, opening up new possibilities when we self-sovereign sailors come together.</p>

<p>Tools that important must be reliable. Beyond that, they must meet our personal needs. This calls back to a time when ship makers would consult with captains about the individual needs of their vessels (just as we do in the modern day with <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salons</a>). This ensures that we can sail the digital seas safely and have control and trust in our tools.</p>

 Fostering Digital Cooperation — Unity on the High Seas 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing envisions a cooperative digital ecosystem where individuals, as digital captains, can unite. Each ship, regardless of its size, contributes to the strength of our self-sovereign fleet, enhancing autonomy and rights for every individual. They can come together against the considerable adversaries of the digital landscape.</p>

<p>There are also promises of mutual aid: Self-Sovereign Computing seeks to protect the vulnerable. If a ship is in distress, others are obligated to give it support, which might mean helping to route messages to evade censorship or just lending some bandwidth to get around a digital traffic jam.</p>

<p>In essence, Self-Sovereign Computing steers us towards a cooperative digital ecosystem, where every digital captain’s strength is amplified through unity. The result is a digital seascape where collective strength is harnessed and where collective bargaining power is pooled, to negotiate better terms, services, and experiences for all.</p>

 The Inspiration of Self-Sovereign Computing 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing stems from a blend of inspirations, some of which are shared with <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity</a>. Among the influences most important to understanding the idea of Self-Sovereign Computing are: the Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity, Living Systems Theory, Agency Law, and Maritime Law, each of which contributed to its foundational ethos.</p>

<p>The Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity play a crucial role in defining the paradigm of Self-Sovereign Computing. These principles emphasize user control and consent, the freedom of data interoperability, and the decentralization of identity authority, pushing the boundaries of individual digital autonomy.</p>

<p>Living Systems Theory speaks of inviduals having boundaries (“membranes”) that separate them from the rest of the world, but recognizes that communication occurs through that membrane. It was a foundational inspiration for Self-Sovereign Identity and is closely linked to the analogy of ships upon the sea.</p>

<p>Agency Law offers the concept of fiduciary duties that dictate a relationship of trust, responsibility, and user priority. Under this framework, digital tools and platforms are required to grant a duty of loyalty and care to their user: acting in their best interest, respecting privacy, protecting data, and ensuring users maintain control and authority over their digital identities and personal information.</p>

<p>Maritime Law contributes principles of mutual aid, freedom of navigation, and the doctrine of the high seas, reinforcing the importance of collective security, unrestricted access, and autonomy in the digital realm.</p>

<p>This blend of inspirations helps us envision a digital landscape that respects individual autonomy while also acknowledging our shared responsibility within the digital community. Collectively, these principles create the bedrock of Self-Sovereign Computing, guiding us towards a future where technology remembers its ultimate duty — to serve and protect the people.</p>

 The Self-Sovereign Computing Call to Action 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing is more than a concept. It’s a beacon on the digital seas. It’s a movement and a rallying cry for individuals including: professionals in decentralized identity; digital human rights advocates; lawyers; and technologists alike. It’s a call for us to advocate for privacy-preserving tools, to demand transparency from platforms, and to assert control over personal data. It’s about supporting initiatives and platforms that align with the principles of Self-Sovereign Computing, fostering a culture of digital self-sovereignty in our communities.</p>

<p>Working collectively, we can form a fleet, to command respect and instigate change in the digital seas. By engaging in discussions, raising awareness, and actively advocating for change, we can reshape the digital world to prioritize people over corporations.</p>

 The Journey Ahead 

<p>Are you ready to seize control and chart your own course on this digital ocean? The era of Self-Sovereign Computing is upon us. It’s time to take the helm for your digital journey, shaping your route based on your choices and needs, not those of distant corporations.</p>

<p>Together, we can navigate toward a future where technology serves us unconditionally, and our devices, our data, and our digital experiences truly belong to us.</p>

<p>The helm is in your hands. The journey towards self-sovereignty begins now. Will you join us?</p>

 Introduction <p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to make the most out of the query filtering and ordering capabilities in ComposeDB. By the end, you will know how to:</p>  Set up type validation directives and create indices for specific fields  Use value and logical conditions for querying  Sort the returned results by specific fields   Prerequisites   Basic understanding of GraphQL  An active ComposeDB environment (make sure to <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/set-up-your-environment?ref=blog.ceramic.network">install the latest versions of Ceramic CLI and ComposeDB CLI</a>)   The Model <p>Before we can start querying, we need to have data models defined in ComposeDB, along with some data to query, filter, and sort.</p><p>You can use a simple social app from the great <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/getting-started-with-composedb-on-ceramic-2/">Getting Started With ComposeDB on Ceramic</a> tutorial, create a model from scratch, or work on your existing data.</p><p>For simplicity, I’ll create a new model, adapt it to support filtering, add some data to it, and demonstrate all the filtering and sorting capabilities.</p> Defining a <code>Posts</code> model <p>A simple <code>Posts</code> model from the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/getting-started-with-composedb-on-ceramic-2/">“Getting Started” guide</a> looks like this:</p> <code>type Posts @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple Post") {
  body: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
  edited: DateTime
  created: DateTime!
  profileId: StreamID! @documentReference(model:"BasicProfile")
  profile: BasicProfile! @relationDocument(property: "profileId")
}
</code> <p>It’s good enough to capture and store data, but let’s make it more robust, add a few fields and get it ready for filtering and sorting.</p> Create indices and add fields <p>Query filtering in ComposeDB allows you to create queries that return a subset of data that matches specified criteria. This functionality helps you narrow down the search by specifying the search parameter.</p><p>To filter queries, you will need to create an index for the corresponding field. An index is a data structure that allows the database to find documents matching the filter criteria more quickly.</p><p>In our <code>Posts</code> type, for example, we have created indexes for <code>status</code>, <code>tag</code>, <code>created</code>, <code>rating</code>, and <code>edited</code> fields using the <code>@createIndex</code> directive as shown below:</p> <code>@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "status" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "tag" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "created" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "rating" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "edited" }])
</code> <p>Our model now looks like this:</p> <code>enum PublicationStatus {
    DRAFT
    PUBLISHED
    ARCHIVED
}
type Posts
    @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple Post")
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "status" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "tag" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "created" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "rating" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "edited" }]) {
    body: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    tag: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    rating: Float @float(min: 0, max: 10)
    status: PublicationStatus!
    edited: DateTime
    created: DateTime!
}
</code> <p>You’ll notice a few additions here:</p>  A new <code>enum</code> type: <code>PublicationStatus</code>. We know that the publication status can have only a few possible options. We’re enumerating them all here and then we’ll use that as a type that we can apply to variables. We’ll use it for the new <code>status</code> value, and we’ll make the <code>status</code> mandatory by adding an exclamation point to the type  New fields: <code>tag</code>, <code>rating</code>, <code>status</code>, <code>edited</code>. A good social app should have more than just short entries. With these fields, we’re adding an option to tag and rate posts, have different publication statuses, and an option to see which entries were edited and when.  <code>@createIndex</code> directive on five fields: <code>status</code>, <code>tag</code>, <code>created</code>, <code>rating</code>, <code>edited</code>. These add all the necessary indices. We can now filter and sort on all of these.   Add data <p>We have a model now but we don’t have any data yet. We can’t do much filtering if we don’t have anything to filter. Let’s add some posts.</p> <code>mutation CreatePosts{
  createPosts(input: {
    content: {
      body: "ComposeDB Launch",
      tag: "announcement",
      rating: 9.9,
      status: PUBLISHED,
      created: "2023-02-28T12:00:00Z"
      edited: "2023-03-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  }){
    document{
      body
      tag
      rating
      status
      created
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>This mutation adds our first post, a ComposeDB launch post, with an <code>announcement</code> tag, a <code>9.9</code> rating and a non-zero <code>edited</code> field.</p><p>Let’s add 20 more posts so that we have enough to play with. You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/velvet-shark/ff6e840e939ba80dc5a11ad3338db5f9?ref=blog.ceramic.network">copy them from this gist</a> and use GraphiQL to add them to your Ceramic node.</p> Query Filtering <p>Now that we have a way to filter and have the data to filter on, let’s do some filtering.</p><p>You can filter by value or with logical conditions.</p><p>Filtering by value is based on a single field value and we can do a lot with it:</p>  check if it’s null - <code>isNull:</code> Boolean  check if it’s equal or not equal to a value - <code>equalTo:</code> (value), <code>notEqualTo:</code> (value)  check if it is or isn’t in a list of values: <code>in:</code> […values], <code>notIn:</code> […values]  check if it’s greater or smaller than a certain value: <code>lessThan:</code> (value), <code>lessThanOrEqualTo:</code> (value), <code>greaterThan:</code> (value), <code>greaterThanOrEqualTo:</code> (value)  <p>Logical conditions combine multiple conditions using <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, or <code>not</code>.</p> Filtering Examples: Filtering by Value <p>Let’s see all the ways we can filter our posts.</p><p>Filter by publication status</p><p>A query:</p> <code>query FilterByStatus($input: PostsFiltersInput!) {
  postsIndex(filters: $input, first: 50) {
    edges {
      node {
        body
        created
        rating
        tag
        status
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>With the input to show only posts with <code>DRAFT</code> status:</p> <code>{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "status": {
        "equalTo": "DRAFT"
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>If you’re <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/interact-with-data?ref=blog.ceramic.network#graphql-server">using GraphiQL</a> to run your queries, you need to write the query in the query section <code>(1)</code> and the input data in the variables section below <code>(2)</code>.</p><p>You can then run the query with the filter by pressing a play button and you get the results on the right <code>(3)</code>.</p><p>As you can see, only the posts with <code>DRAFT</code> status are showing up. The filter works!</p><p>Let’s do more filtering.</p><p>Filter by rating</p><p>Show poorly-rated posts, with rating less than 7.5</p> <code>{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "rating": {
        "lessThan": 7.5
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>Filter by date</p><p>Posts from earlier than Jan 10, 2023.</p> <code>{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "created": {
        "lessThan": "2023-01-10"
      }
    }

      ]

         }
      ]
   }
}
</code> <p>An alternative way of filtering by range</p><p>The previous two examples of filtering by range used an explicit <code>and</code>: you started with <code>and</code> at the top and supplied two <code>where</code> queries.</p><p>This can also be achieved with an implicit <code>and</code>, where you supply two conditions and the <code>and</code> is implied.</p><p>The two examples above can be rewritten like this:</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "where":{
         "rating":{
            "greaterThanOrEqualTo":2.2,
            "lessThan": 8.8

      }
   }

            "lessThan":"2023-12-31"
        }
      }
   }
}</code> <p>In both cases, the results are the same with both an implicit and an explicit <code>and</code>.</p><p>Filter by multiple fields</p><p>I want to clean up some posts. Show me the posts with <code>DRAFT</code> or <code>ARCHIVED</code> status, created before March 1, 2023.</p> <code>{

               }
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
</code>  Query Ordering <p>Now that we have focused on the posts we wanted, it would be nice to be able to sort the results, too.</p><p>For that, we need to define an additional variable: <code>$sortinginput</code>, include it in the query, and then add it next to the <code>$input</code> variable.</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "and":[
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"greaterThanOrEqualTo":"2023-01-01"
               }
            }
         },
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{

            }
         }
      ]
  },
  "sortinput":{
      "created":"DESC"

<p>In January 2023, the ToIP Foundation announced the formation of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force">Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force</a> (TSPTF) within our <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group">Technology Stack Working Group</a> (TSWG). <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">See the introductory blog post</a> for an overview of this task force. In short, the goal is to maximize interoperability of decentralized digital trust infrastructure by defining the core protocol at the center of the ToIP <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">hourglass model</a>. This protocol needs to meet all the Layer 2 requirements defined in the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification</a>.</p>



<p>To do this, the TSPTF spent three months to go through the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27724781">proposal stage</a>, entertaining four overall design proposals from <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/17">Sam Smith</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/19">Daniel Hardman</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/25">Wenjing Chu</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/27">Michael Herman</a>. Then the task force entered the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27724781">consolidation stage</a>: the hard work of finding enough common ground among these proposals to reach a rough consensus about the overall framework of the design so it can prepare the first Working Draft of the specification.</p>



<p>The good news is that we believe we have achieved that goal. Through a series of in-depth virtual workshops, additional proposals, and small group <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions">discussions</a>, we have arrived at seven “pillars” of the design. These seven pillars apply not just to the trust spanning protocol, but to a core family of protocols that together form the foundation for all the trust task protocols at Layer 3 of the ToIP technology stack.</p>



<p>In this blog post we will summarize these seven pillars:</p>



 
 <a>Verifiable Identifiers</a> 



 <a>End-to-End Authenticity and Confidentiality</a> 



 <a>Direct Connections (Inner and Outer Channels)</a> 



 <a>Routing Via Intermediaries (Routing Channels)</a> 



 <a>Relationship Context Channels</a> 



 <a>Text and Binary Encoding</a> 



 <a>Trust Task Protocol Framework</a> 
 



<p>This blog post does not attempt to provide the full technical details about each of these topics, rather it will attempt to summarize them using language accessible to anyone interested in decentralized digital trust infrastructure.</p>



 #1: Verifiable Identifiers 



<p>The ToIP Foundation as a whole—and the TSWG in particular—have long compared the ToIP stack to the Internet’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP stack</a> (see <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">our introductory white paper</a> for a full explanation). In particular, we have pointed to how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">Internet Protocol</a> (IP) illustrates the critical role of a spanning protocol in a protocol stack (for details, see Principle #3, The Hourglass Model, in <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack</a>).</p>



<p>The heart of the Internet Protocol defined a new type of address—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP address</a>—that enabled communications between existing networks that otherwise had no automated way to pass data between them. This new addressing layer enabled the Internet Protocol to “span” existing local area networks and create the ubiquitous global Internet we enjoy today.</p>



<p>Since the goal of the ToIP stack is to enable trust to span existing trust domains, the ToIP trust spanning protocol needs the same solution: a new type of address—one designed explicitly to enable cryptographically verifiable communications. In section 6.4 of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Technical-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-PR1-2022-11-14.pdf">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification</a> (TAS), we call this new type of address a verifiable identifier (VID). The three essential characteristics of a VID are:</p>



 
 It can be resolved securely to obtain the current public key(s) needed to verify that the VID owner controls the VID. 



 It can be resolved securely to obtain the current network endpoint(s) for establishing a ToIP connection with the entity identified by the VID. 



 It does not need to change when the controller’s key(s) are rotated or network endpoint(s) are updated. 
 



<p>Section 6.4 of the TAS explains that there are multiple types of VIDs, including many different types of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs—standardized by the W3C), and several types of Autonomous Identifiers (AIDs), such as those being standardized in the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-did-keri">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a> specifications from the ToIP <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force">Authentic Chained Data Container</a> (ACDC) Task Force. Since a verifier’s trust in a VID may depend on both the type of VID and the characteristics of its supporting infrastructure (e.g., cryptographic algorithms, storage, key management, resolution, etc.), the trust spanning protocol specification must also include an appraisability framework: a standard way for a ToIP endpoint to describe the type and properties of its particular VID.</p>



<p>In addition, VIDs share the same challenge as any other new type of identifier: how do parties discover and share the VIDs they want to use for each other? How do they bootstrap setting up their first ToIP communications channel? How can they do this safely while avoiding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle</a> (MITM) attacks?&nbsp;</p>



<p>All VID-based protocols, including <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/">DIDComm</a>, <a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/">Decentralized Web Nodes</a>, rely on some form of out–of-band introduction (OOBI), such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR code</a>, to accomplish this critical first step. Regardless of the specific OOBI used, the ultimate result is that all parties now have the VIDs needed to begin using the ToIP trust spanning protocol to connect and interact.</p>



 #2: End-to-End Authenticity &amp; Confidentiality 



<p>Almost all modern security protocols based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public/private key cryptography</a> use some combination of message signing (for authenticity) and message encryption (for confidentiality). A longstanding question has been: precisely what combination of these two properties produces the strongest security?</p>



<p>Our second pillar is a firm answer to that question: the signing and encryption pattern that provides the strongest protection against both key compromise impersonation (KCI) and sender impersonation of the ciphertext is called ESSR (for Encrypt Sender’s key then Sign Receiver’s key). ESSR was first defined <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2001/079">in a 2001 paper</a> by Jee Hea An and is well explained in these three Neil Madden blog posts about public key authenticated encryption: <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/11/14/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-i/">PKAE1</a>, <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/11/26/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-ii/">PKAE2</a>, <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/12/14/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-iii/">PKAE3</a>.</p>



<p>The bottom line: by binding the sender’s public key inside the encrypted ciphertext and binding the receiver’s public key in the enclosing signed plain text, an adversary is prevented from forging messages that compromise either authenticity or confidentiality. So the trust spanning protocol can achieve both strong authenticity and strong confidentiality by applying ESSR to all messages that require both properties.</p>



 #3: Direct Connections (Inner and Outer Channels) 



<p>With VIDs supplying verifiable public key(s) and network endpoint(s), and ESSR supplying the message signing and encryption pattern, all the essential ingredients for two ToIP endpoints are in place to establish a connection in order to communicate securely and confidentially. The only ToIP Layer 2 requirement that we have not addressed is correlation privacy: preventing public observation/correlation of the VIDs that parties are using to communicate.</p>



<p>Although the trust spanning protocol is designed to be transport-independent and could be used with any transport protocol for which a binding is defined (e.g., Bluetooth, AMQP, MQTT), if ToIP endpoints A and B have a direct connection with each other over a public TCP/IP network like the Internet, then full correlation privacy is impossible: anyone who can see the Internet traffic can track the flow of encrypted messages between A’s VID and B’s VID. Thus the only way A and B can achieve full correlation privacy is by employing intermediaries (see Pillar <a>#4</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>However A and B can still achieve partial correlation privacy over a direct connection by tunneling one ESSR protocol inside another. This is shown in Figure 1 below.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Figure 1: A direct connection showing one ToIP channel tunneled inside another for partial correlation privacy.</p>



<p>In Figure 1, the VIDs A0 and B0 are publicly-observable VIDs used to form the outer channel (shown in red). They are outside the two endpoint boxes because they are publicly observable on the Internet. The VIDs A1 and B1 are private interaction VIDs that form the inner channel (shown in orange).&nbsp; They are inside the two endpoint boxes because they are completely private to A and B. Each ToIP message between A1 and B1 is carried in the encrypted payload of ToIP messages between A0 and B0, so A1 and B1 are never exposed publicly on the Internet.</p>



<p>This two-layer, two-channel model enables A and B to communicate privately between A1 and B1 over the inner channel. As explained in Pillar <a>#5</a>, one potential use of this private channel is for A and B to negotiate replacing their current publicly-observable VIDs A0 and B0 with new publicly-observable VIDs An and Bn if/when needed. They can do this while still keeping A1 and B1 hidden. This enables some degree of correlation privacy even without the use of intermediaries.</p>



 #4: Routing Via Intermediaries (Routing Channels) 



<p>To provide stronger correlation privacy—i.e., to prevent public observation that A and B are communicating at all—it is necessary to tunnel one layer deeper using intermediaries. This triple layering is shown in Figure 2.</p>







<p>Figure 2: Adding a routing layer tunneled via intermediaries for stronger correlation privacy</p>



<p>In this configuration, both A and B first establish outer channels over direct connections with their respective intermediaries α and β (shown in red between VIDs A0 and α0 and B0 and β0 respectively). Then A and B tunnel another ESSR protocol (shown in blue) inside the outer channel to send ToIP routing messages. This routing channel gives the intermediaries α and β just enough information to pass the messages to the next hop on the path. The full path is never revealed to any single intermediary; all α and β know is the next destination.</p>



<p>The inner channel (orange) is layered within the routing channel (blue). As with direct connections, this is the fully private interaction channel between A1 and B1. Neither α or β know about A1 and B1 and cannot see any of the communications on this inner channel. To use a physics analogy, this inner channel has two layers of “insulation” that prevent the heat (private information) from leaking out into the environment (third parties observing the outer channel).</p>



<p>This routing architecture is not limited to two intermediaries; it can scale to more as needed. However adding more intermediaries is not required to enable better correlation privacy; it simply increases the number of intermediaries that would need to be compromised to learn the full path.</p>



 #5: Relationship Context Channels 



<p>The double or triple layering of ToIP channels described in Pillars <a>#3</a> and <a>#4</a> satisfies the ToIP architecture requirements for authenticity, confidentiality, and ​​correlation privacy. Whether it operates over a direct connection or via intermediaries, the inner channel instantiates a relationship root context connecting the two endpoints.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, what if two endpoints A and B need to communicate over other inner channels representing different relationship contexts? For example, what if they need to:</p>



 
 Move to a higher level of identity assurance, e.g., for high-value transactions instead of low-value transactions? 



 Step up to perfect forward secrecy or some other cryptographic algorithm? 



 Stream data instead of sending individual messages? 



 Instantiate a multi-party channel incorporating other parties (such as using the IETF <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_Layer_Security">Message Layer Security</a> protocol)? 



 Instantiate new publicly-observable VIDs to increase correlation privacy? 



 Instantiate new private interaction VIDs to prevent privacy leakage over time? 



 Invoke specific higher-level (ToIP Layer 3) trust task protocols (see Pillar <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CULKg76dSLnO5EX3YM5kG6Ya8PWDwmPSZAbGKKqdoTU/edit#heading=h.ekx5229cmb3v">#7</a>)? 
 



<p>In these cases, A and B need to be able to use the default inner channel as a “control channel” to establish other inner channels. Each new inner channel needs: a) a new pair of VIDs to establish a new relationship context, and b) a new set of parameters specific to that relationship context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This can be accomplished using a simple control channel protocol that enables A and B to establish and manage as many relationship context channels as they need over the lifetime of their relationship. This is illustrated in Figure 3 (shown over a direct connection for simplicity). The control channel is shown in orange and each new relationship context channel is shown in black.</p>







<p>Figure 3: Using the default inner channel as a control channel to establish new independent relationship context channels between A and B</p>



<p>Note that these new inner channels can emulate the same features as the concept of sessions used in other protocols. However, by using VIDs, they have the following advantages:</p>



 
 They can operate independently from any session management defined by underlying transport protocols. 



 They can persist as long as both parties need them (not just during one communications session). 



 They can establish fully “cryptographic sessions” that include all the security and privacy protections of the ToIP trust spanning layer. 
 



 #6: Text and Binary Encoding 



<p>Every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_protocol">wire protocol</a> that moves data from one endpoint to another must define its encoding(s). Encoding choices are even more critical (and often contentious) with security protocols because: a) they are replete with heavyweight cryptographic data structures, and b) they impose very strict rules governing message signing, encryption, decryption, and signature verification.</p>



<p>To avoid as much contention as possible, we propose to use Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) as the encoding format for all ToIP messages. The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ssmith-cesr/">CESR specification</a> is one of the deliverables of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force">ToIP ACDC Task Force</a>. To quote from the introduction:</p>



<p>The Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) is a dual text-binary encoding format that has the unique property of text-binary concatenation composability.&nbsp; This composability property enables the round trip conversion en-masse of concatenated primitives between the text domain and binary domain while maintaining the separability of individual primitives.&nbsp; This enables convenient usability in the text domain and compact transmission in the binary domain.</p>



<p>Other key benefits of CESR include:</p>



 
 Format-agnostic. CESR streams support interleaved JSON, CBOR, and MGPK serializations. 



 Optimized for cryptography. Popular cryptographic material suites have compact encodings for efficiency while less compact encodings provide sufficient extensibility to support all foreseeable types. 



 Self-framing. CESR supports self-framing group codes that enable stream processing and pipelining in both the text and binary domains. 
 



<p>For a complete overview of the benefits of CESR, see the IIW presentation <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12nX_IIPp5xw8qAxhZy-ae2aWYytYQmFBbB9K3PcVhqQ/edit?usp=sharing">CESR for First Year Wizards</a>.</p>



<p>Note: CESR V1.1 will include a few minor pipelining improvements based on production experience with CESR V1.0.</p>



 #7: Trust Task Protocol Framework 



<p>The final pillar is the capability for architects and developers to design, define, and build higher-level ToIP Layer 3 trust task protocols that operate over the Layer 2 relationship context channels described in Pillar <a>#5</a>. This trust task protocol framework should be modeled using the same protocol definition patterns established by other VID-based protocols such as <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/">DIDComm</a>, <a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/">Decentralized Web Nodes</a>. These definitions typically follow a two level model:</p>



 
 Protocol definitions specify the protocol ID (or VID), human-readable name, version, and other identifying metadata for the protocol. They also define its overall relationship context channel parameters and a catalog of its specified packets/messages. 



 Packet/message definitions specify the required and optional contents of each packet or message defined in the protocol. 
 



<p>A complete trust task protocol specification based on this framework will also include roles, states, request/response business logic, co-protocols, error messages, etc.. See <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/#protocols">section 9 of the DIDComm V2 specification</a> for a detailed example.</p>



<p>The ToIP trust task protocol framework should also define a small set of standard utility trust tasks such as:</p>



 
 Discovery. Rather than broadly defining how two parties try to discover each other’s VIDs, this trust task will narrowly define how two ToIP endpoints that have established a connection can discover what trust tasks each other is capable of supporting (see examples below). 



 Error handling. The rich extensibility of trust tasks—and the fact they may be combined into complex workflows—make it very useful to have a well-known trust task for handling error messages. 



 Trust ping. This simple, universal trust task for testing a ToIP connection is the ToIP equivalent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)">ping network utility</a> for testing an IP connection. 



 Logging/auditing. This is a standard trust task for logging ToIP interactions for debugging or auditing purposes. 
 



<p>The whole reason for the hourglass design of the ToIP technology stack is for the Layer 2 trust spanning protocol to support any number of trust task protocols at Layer 3. With authenticity, confidentiality, and correlation privacy all handled by the trust spanning layer, it becomes far easier for infrastructure architects and developers to design reusable trust tasks. This is turn makes it much easier for application designers and developers to build trusted applications by calling a series of trust tasks to accomplish their workflows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current market emphasis on digital identity wallets (such as the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">EU eIDAS 2.0 initiative</a>) can give the impression that the only important trust tasks are the issuance, presentation, and revocation of verifiable digital credentials. These are in fact only a small subset of the universe of trust tasks that can be enabled by the ToIP stack. Some other common examples discussed by the TSPTF include:</p>



 
 Stepping up authentication by using a ToIP connection to request local biometric authentication and/or liveness detection of a user. 



 Signing digital documents with strong, permanently verifiable digital signatures that do not require centralized service providers (a required feature of eIDAS 2.0). 



 Querying a trust registry to determine the authorized participants in a digital trust ecosystem (a trust task protocol under development by the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">ToIP Trust Registry Task Force</a>). 



 Exchanging electronic business cards for peer-to-peer communications and relationship management. 



 Secure messaging using synchronous chat or asynchronous mail. 



 Transmitting digital payments via any mutually-agreed means: credit card, debit card, direct-to-bank, fiat currency, cryptocurrency, loyalty points, etc. 



 Issuing e-receipts for any type of digital payment or value exchange. 



 Buying a digital ticket for an event and presenting it for admission. 



 Bidding in a digital auction, including reconciling and settlement of a winning bid. 



 Issuing a digital purchase order, sending an invoice, and remitting payment. 



 Orchestrating data supply chains using “product passports” that can be the digital twin of physical or digital products. 
 



 Next Steps 



<p>The TSPTF is now moving into the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27724781">Working Drafts stage</a>. After a break during the month of August, we are beginning two weekly meetings again every Wednesday (8AM PT for NA/EU time zones and 6PM PT for APAC time zones) starting on&nbsp;06 September&nbsp;(the full schedule of all ToIP meetings is published on the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Calendar+of+ToIP+Meetings">ToIP Calendar</a>).&nbsp;Our goal will be to work through enough open issues to be ready to present a complete “IIW Preview Draft”&nbsp;at the next Internet Identity Workshop, 10-12 October in Mountain View, California.

 OT-RFC-18 — Growing the Trusted Knowledge Foundation: TRAC delegation &amp; OTP incentives <p>“Q. How do you propose to do&nbsp;this?</p><p>A. By saving the knowledge of the race. The sum of human knowing is beyond any one man; any thousand men. With the destruction of our social fabric, science will be broken into a million pieces. Individuals will know much of the exceedingly tiny facets of which there is to know. They will be helpless and useless by themselves. The bits of lore, meaningless, will not be passed on. They will be lost through the generations. But, if we now prepare a giant summary of all knowledge, it will never be lost. Coming generations will build on it, and will not have to rediscover it for themselves. One millennium will do the work of thirty thousand.”</p><p>Hari Seldon</p><p>Foundation series by Isaac Asimov&nbsp;(1951)</p> Introduction <p>OriginTrail ecosystem’s vision is to build a trusted knowledge foundation that greatly improves the way humanity’s knowledge is produced, maintained and shared in a trusted and inclusive manner. The purpose of the OriginTrail Parachain is to provide a tailored blockchain for Trusted Artificial Intelligence that extends the capabilities of the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) with growth incentives for <a href="https://origintrail.io">real-world adoption</a>.</p><p>The requirements have already been met for the OriginTrail Parachain utility token (OTP) to be transferable via both centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEXs and DEXs) by having the decentralized governance in place. Now this DKG-focused L1 blockchain supporting real-world adoption, is set to drive growth of both valuable Knowledge Asset assemblies and DKG multichain infrastructure — crucial components of the Trusted Knowledge Foundation. It achieves that by incentivizing Knowledge generation and trusted knowledge infrastructure operation with OTP tokens, in unison with the multichain DKG adoption (detailed in OT-RFC-17).</p><p>The OT-RFC-18 proposes the first batch of incentivization features, which also leverage already implemented OriginTrail Parachain community voting.</p> OTP incentives for Trusted Knowledge Foundation Growth <p>Using OTP to create incentives for Trusted Knowledge Foundation Growth is one of its core utilities. The pool of OTP designated for that was 14% (or 70 million OTP) of the Genesis supply and also receives 30% of the annual inflation (you can learn more about the tokenomics and exact numbers&nbsp;<a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/OriginTrail_Ecosystem_White_Paper_2.0.pdf">here</a>).</p><p>When considering the best first activities to be included for the OTP incentives, the key requirements include the relevance of the activity, measurable nature of the activity and inclusiveness for all OriginTrail participants. All OTP incentives should also take full advantage of OriginTrail Parachain Governance — from proposal stage for an activity, to ongoing decisions on the scope of incentivisation support or even proposals to discontinue/substitute the incentives with more appropriate ones.</p><p>The OT-RFC-18 takes the above guidelines in action to propose 2 categories of activities as candidates for incentivization — (1) Incentivizing trusted knowledge creation and (2) Incentivizing trusted infrastructure.</p> Incentivizing trusted knowledge creation <p>Incentivizing the creation of trusted knowledge is central to the growth of the OriginTrail Trusted Knowledge Foundation. By offering OTP incentives for Knowledge Asset creation the “north star” growth activity is supported. The intention of incentives is also to serve as a curation mechanism for guiding publishing of high quality knowledge on the DKG. Curation is to be implemented through community-wide decisions using OriginTrail Parachain Governance. These activities will provide a significant boost towards creating truthful, structured, and AI-ready Knowledge Assets — ultimately leading to the creation of the largest trusted knowledge foundation in the world. The specific incentive mechanisms to achieve this will be continuously improved through OriginTrail Parachain Governance proposals.</p> Incentivizing trusted infrastructure: TRAC delegation &amp; Multichain adoption <p>The OriginTrail trusted infrastructure is a two layer system with two&nbsp;tokens:</p>  the DKG layer hosted on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN) fueled by the TRAC utility&nbsp;token,  and multi-chain consensus layer, with respective native blockchain tokens in use (which includes the OriginTrail Parachain and OTP&nbsp;token).  <p>Each of the layers performs a distinct function, yet are necessary building blocks for the implementation of the DKG (more info available in the OriginTrail whitepaper 2.0).</p><p>An increasingly important element of the trusted knowledge infrastructure is the TRAC stake for DKG nodes. The stake presents a collateral TRAC amount that is locked-up as a signal for the security and quality of node operations. The amount of TRAC stake also significantly contributes to the share of the network rewards (paid as network fees by Knowledge Asset publishers) that a DKG node can&nbsp;receive.</p><p>With the OT-RFC-18, the TRAC delegation feature is introduced, and DKG node operators will now be able to open their node stake for other TRAC holders to participate. With a higher amount of TRAC as their stake, nodes are eligible for more network rewards which are then shared with those that delegated their TRAC (implementation details below). This instrument will lead to more TRAC being used for its utility, larger TRAC holder community engagement, more robust and secure trusted knowledge infrastructure and a vibrant “marketplace” of DKG nodes and TRAC delegators.</p><p>To incentivize all of the above-mentioned positive effects of TRAC delegations, the OT-RFC-18 proposes this feature to be eligible for OTP incentives as well. The core premise of the OTP incentives would be to allow any TRAC delegator on blockchains where DKG V6 is implemented to be eligible for OTP rewards according to the size of their delegated stake.</p><p>Moreover, as more blockchain ecosystems <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-17-origintrail-integration-with-evm-compatible-blockchains-e635dc8afb86">express interest</a> to integrate with the DKG (following<a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/tree/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-17-OriginTrail-integration-with-EVM-compatible-blockchains"> the procedure and criteria detailed in the OT-RFC-17</a>), one time incentives in OTP are proposed, to both reward TRAC token holders who support integrations by contributing to the minimum required threshold. More details on this to be discussed in a separate proposal on incentivising MultiChain DKG adoption before voting on it via OriginTrial Parachain governance mechanism.</p> TRAC delegation mechanics <p>The implementation of the TRAC token delegation mechanism is loosely based on DeFi projects such as Uniswap, with the core component representing Node share tokens, (similar to Uniswap LP tokens). Each node deployed on ODN has a respective, node-specific, mintable and burnable 18 decimal ERC20 token created for it on the desired blockchain during node deployment, with the token symbol and name set by the node operator, as can be seen in the figure&nbsp;below.</p>Figure 1: Node share tokens on OriginTrail Parachain, visible through Subscan block&nbsp;explorer<p>The “share tokens” represent essentially a share of the total amount of TRAC stake that has been deployed on a specific node. The TRAC delegation feature, when fully activated, will enable node operators to “open up” their node to receiving more TRAC stake through delegation by TRAC token holders. The delegation mechanism is explained in the following figures:</p><p>Formula for share tokens&nbsp;minting:</p><p>Where tracAmount is the amount of TRAC delegated to the&nbsp;node.</p><p>Formula for share tokens&nbsp;burning:</p><p>Where tracAmount is the amount of TRAC withdrawn from the node&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Nodes with larger amounts of TRAC staked have effectively stronger economic security signals (see <a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/OriginTrail_Ecosystem_White_Paper_2.0.pdf">the whitepaper</a>), and therefore an advantage in receiving Knowledge Asset publishing fees from Knowledge Publishers (also in TRAC). Therefore, node operators have an interest in attracting a large amount of TRAC stake to establish a better position in the DKG service&nbsp;market.</p><p>TRAC token holders’ interest is in putting their TRAC tokens to work, which is achieved by node operators effectively sharing a portion of the TRAC fees received through Knowledge Asset publishing with the delegators.</p><p>Effectively, node runners are delegators to their own nodes at the moment of writing this RFC (currently only node admin keys can delegate, until the fully fledged system is implemented), and get 100% of the TRAC rewards from publishings their nodes&nbsp;receive.</p><p>When the delegation feature goes live, each node operator will be free to set their node settings, which are the following:</p>  operator_fee: percentage of the TRAC fee, which is deducted from each knowledge asset publishing fee, and is directed to the node operator prior to sharing with other delegators. The remaining TRAC fee is then split in proportion to the amount of share tokens among all delegators,  maximum_delegated_trac: the maximum amount of stake a node operator allows to be present on their&nbsp;node.  <p>It is important to note that the system is non-custodial, meaning that all delegated TRAC is locked in DKG core contracts, and can only be “withdrawn” from the system by burning share tokens by the delegators, which can only be performed by the <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/dkg-evm-module/blob/main/contracts/Staking.sol">DKG Staking contract</a>.</p><p>With such a system in effect, TRAC token holders can safely delegate their tokens to node runners. Having Node Share tokens be ERC20 tokens, they can also be easily transferred between wallets (e.g. a delegator can change wallets for OpSec purposes by transferring share tokens to a different address) and utilized with any ERC20 supporting tool.</p><p>Finally, the proposal indicates delegating TRAC in two&nbsp;ways:</p>  “Delegate” function: by using this function, share tokens are available to the delegator, enabling withdrawing TRAC at all times. This function should not involveOTP incentives,  “Delegate &amp; Lock” function: share tokens are locked in DKG contracts for a period of time, which qualifies the delegator for OTP Incentives, as they promote long-term security in the&nbsp;network.   TRAC Delegation: Implementation action&nbsp;points <p>After the RFC process and open discussion on TRAC delegation feature is completed, the core development team will proceed with detailed specification and updates on the implementation. Community proposals through comments on this RFC are very&nbsp;welcome.</p><p>The relevant updates are expected to include an updated version of smart contracts, with the aim to encapsulate other optimizations to the system (system formulas, neighborhood distance function updates, etc). All information will be available in the relevant Github repositories.</p> Conclusion <p><a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-18-Growing-the-Trusted-Knowledge-Foundation/README.md">This RFC</a> introduces the implementation direction for OTP incentives and initial high-impact activities for the growth of the Trusted Knowledge Foundation.

<p>In this era of generative AI, how do we determine whether an image is human-created or machine-made?&nbsp;For the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Professor Hany Farid shares the techniques used for identifying real and synthetic images — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, environmental lighting, and GAN-generated faces. A world-renowned expert in the field of misinformation, disinformation, and digital forensics as well as an advisor to the CAI, Professor Farid explores the limits of these techniques and their part in a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the third article in a six-part series.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>Part 1: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">From the darkroom to generative AI</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">How realistic are AI-generated faces?</a></p>




 


  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>As I discussed in <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">my previous post</a>, generative adversarial networks (GANs) can produce remarkably realistic images of people that are nearly indistinguishable from images of real people. Here I will describe a technique for detecting GAN-generated faces, such as those typically found in online profiles</p><p>Below you will see the average of 400 StyleGAN2 faces (left) and 400 real profile photos from people with whom I am connected on LinkedIn (right).&nbsp;</p><p>Because the real photos are so varied, the average profile photo is fairly nondescript. By contrast, the average GAN face is highly distinct with almost perfectly focused eyes. This is because the real faces used by the GAN discriminator are all aligned in the same way, resulting in all the AI-generated faces having the same alignment. It seems that this alignment was intentional as a way to improve generation of more consistently realistic faces.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to having the same facial alignment, the StyleGAN faces also appear from the neck up. By contrast, real profile photos tend to show more of the upper body and shoulders. It is these within-class similarities and across-class differences that we seek to exploit in our technique for detecting GAN-generated faces.</p>

  <p>Starting with 10,000 faces generated by each of the three versions of StyleGAN (1, 2, 3), we learn a low-dimensional representation of GAN-generated faces. This learning takes two forms: the classic, linear, principal components analysis (PCA) and a more modern auto-encoder.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of the underlying computational technique, this approach learns a constructive model that captures the particular properties of StyleGAN-generated faces. In the case of PCA, this model is a simple weighted sum of a small number of images learned from the training images.</p><p>Once the model is constructed, we can ask if any image can be accurately reconstructed with this model. The intuition here is that if the model captures properties that are specific to GAN faces, then GAN faces will be accurately reconstructed with the model but real photos (that do not share these properties) will not.</p><p>Below you will see the average reconstruction error for 400 GAN faces (left) and 400 real faces (right). They are displayed on the same intensity scale where, the brighter the pixel value, the larger the reconstruction error. Here you will see that the real faces have significantly higher reconstruction errors throughout, particularly around the eyes.<br></p>

  <p>By simply computing this reconstruction error, we can build a fairly reliable classifier to determine whether a face was likely to have been generated by StyleGAN. We can make this classifier even more reliable by analyzing the eiGAN-face model weights needed for the full reconstruction.&nbsp;</p><p>Using this approach, we can detect more than 99% of GAN-generated faces, while only misclassifying 1% of photographic faces — those that happen to match the position and alignment of GAN faces.</p><p>Any forensic technique is, of course, vulnerable to attack. In this case, an adversary could crop, translate, and/or rotate a GAN-generated face in an attempt to circumvent our detection. We can, however, build this attack into our training by constructing our model not just on GAN faces, but also on GAN faces that have been subjected to random manipulations. (See the article in the Further Reading section below for more details on this attack and defense.)</p><p>No defense will ever be perfect, so the forensic identification cannot rely on just one technique. It must instead rely on a suite of techniques that examine different aspects of an image. Even if an adversary does not find a way to circumvent this particular detection, newer diffusion-based, text-to-image synthesis techniques (e.g., Dall-E, Midjourney, and Adobe Firefly) do not exhibit the same facial alignment as GAN-generated faces. As a result, they will fail to be detected by this specific technique. In my next post, I will describe a complementary forensic analysis that is more effective at detecting faces generated using diffusion-based techniques.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>[1] S.

             <p>Every day, thousands of items leave bol.com's warehouses. In the coming months, the number of items could even escalate to one million per day. The importance of correct GTIN numbers [Global Trade Item Numbers] and reliable data cannot be overstated. Without them, the largest webshop in the Benelux would fail to fulfil its delivery promises. According to Vincent Weijers, Chief Operations Officer: “Selling partners who provide accurate codes and data are rewarded with increased transactions and satisfied customers”.</p>
 
     

     
   

         
                                                                                                                                                                                              
   

    
   
    
                         
           
  
    
       
      
 
             <p>During the year of the coronavirus, bol.com experienced an impressive 54 percent growth in revenue. Even now, as the virus appears to be under control, bol.com continues to grow. "The coronavirus has certainly accelerated our growth. And we continue to make plans for further expansion. Why? Because we see that our proposition aligns very well with the needs of consumers," says Vincent Weijers.</p>
 
     

     
   

         
                                                                                                                                                                                              
   

    
   
    
                         
            
                   
            
 
              
  
  
 
                
     

 
 
     

           
           
            
 
              
  
  
 
                
     

 
 
     

           
                     
    
                                                                                                                                                                                              
   

    
   
    
                         
           
  
    
       
      
 
              How did you manage to cope with a sudden growth? 

<p>We quickly ensured additional capacity by redesigning existing warehouses and leasing new ones. I am proud of my team who achieved this. Our top priority is always to be one hundred percent reliable. If necessary, we adjust the delivery promise to a later time. We prefer to do this rather than taking all orders we can and struggle with fulfilling them later. This approach allows us to keep control over our supply chain. Our customers appreciate this, as they keep coming back to us. They know that their package will arrive at the promised time.</p>

              How important is data in the process? 

<p>Extremely important because transparency is necessary for manageability, and data is essential for transparency. We need to know what product items we are dealing with. What are the requirements that these product items must meet? What kind of treatment do they need? It all begins with a correct barcode: the EAN code, which is officially known as the GS1 GTIN, the Global Trade Item Number. I've been involved with GS1 Netherlands, which was then called EAN Netherlands, since 1993. As an information analyst, I had the opportunity to contribute to the rules for the use of EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). I was immensely proud. From 2012 to 2015, I served on the board of GS1 Netherlands, and I was even chairman for a while. Currently, I am a member of the Global GS1 Management Board. So, from a young age, I have understood the importance of data and standards. Take GS1's slogan, for instance: 'The global language of business.' That is true. Standardisation enables easier communication with many more people. This is also crucial for bol.com. We sell 35 million items across diverse product categories through our platform, and unfortunately, we see that standardisation has not been equally implemented in every product category.</p>

 Is there a task for GS1 in this regard? 

<p>Certainly, I advocate for more standardisation and more information. In the food sector, GS1 has already launched a data pool to share product data across the supply chain, and we have linked it to a data quality programme. I would like to see similar initiatives in more sectors. With standardised data readily available, we can place more trust in the quality of that data. Currently, this is not always the case. Data quality is particularly crucial in the online realm. The only interaction an online consumer has with a product is based on the information available online. Their purchasing decisions depend on this information being accurate. If the information is incorrect, the product may be returned. In such cases, the customer is dissatisfied, we are dissatisfied, and it has negative implications for the environment.</p>

              As many as 52,000 entrepreneurs sell their products through bol.com's platform. Why is it so important for these products to have an identification number? 

<p>Having an identification number, a GTIN, for each product allows us to uniquely identify the product throughout the entire supply chain. With the GTIN, we no longer rely on vague product descriptions and can be certain that we are all referring to the same product. During my early days at Unilever, we would receive faxes from customers requesting twelve units of Dove. However, we couldn't determine if they meant twelve bottles, one box of twelve bottles, or twelve boxes, or or two shrink wraps each containing six bottles. No matter how well we describe the products, the GTIN ensures absolute clarity.</p>

 What are the consequences if selling partners do not use the GS1 GTIN? 

<p>A lot can go wrong. If partners reuse the GTIN from other products, we cannot identify the product correctly, leading to potential mix-ups and confusion. Of course, the risks vary depending on the nature of the products. For instance, if food products are mixed up, it could even result in harm to consumers' health. Therefore, it is also in the best interest of our customers that every partner ensures their products are properly identified. That doesn't seem unreasonable, does it?</p>

 Among the selling partner, there are both large companies and small ones, and they all need guidance. 

<p>That's exactly what we are striving to achieve. When sellers deal with existing products, they usually don't need to purchase the GTIN from GS1, but we do expect them to use the existing GTIN numbers assigned by manufacturers. However, when sellers sell their own unique products, we encourage them to obtain their GTIN from GS1. We are working to make it easier for smaller sellers by offering smaller subscription plans and code bundles, reducing the barriers to compliance. For instance, does a small family-owned business have to pay for a corporate membership? Why can't that business just purchase a single code?</p>
 
     

     
   

         
                                                                                                                                                                                              
   

    
   
    
                         
            
         
           
         
          
 
             <p>Selling partners who correctly identify their products with the GTIN get rewarded. They receive better reviews, make more sales, and have fewer returns.</p>

              We hear that selling partners who don’t have correct GTIN may be removed from the platform. Does that happen frequently? 

<p>Fortunately, not. The majority of sellers do things properly and they are rewarded. They receive better reviews, sell more, and have fewer returns. In certain categories like food, we are extremely strict due to health risks. Thankfully, most of them are aware of this. And we always initiate a conversation first. Actual removals are rare.</p>

 Do partners with lower data quality actually perform worse? 

<p>We have an algorithm that ranks customers based on attractiveness. Several factors come into play, such as the price and quality of the products, but also the number of issues. If a seller generates more returns than other sellers with the same product, that raises concerns. However, I'd rather look at it the other way around. If you do things right, you are rewarded with more transactions and more satisfied customers.</p>

              In media, we hear a lot of stories about returns being discarded. 

<p>That is not the case with us. We only discard items that cannot be repaired. We don't mind investing considerable effort in handling returns. It's partly an economic consideration: the amount of labour should be justified by the value added to the product. In the past, we had to open each box to see what was inside. Improved coding and identification of returns now enable us to send them directly to the right specialists without opening them, allowing us more time to enhance the products. This demonstrates that a strong foundation of codes and data drives innovation. When you are confident that your foundation is solid and your data is reliable, you can develop logic to streamline your processes. This logic also helps us provide better recommendations to our customers.</p>

 Bol.com aims to enable CO2-neutral shopping. How do you plan to achieve this? 

<p>We have reduced carbon emission per package by 34% since 2018 and have recently become a certified B-corp. We aim to achieve carbon-neutral shopping at bol.com and we're working on several fronts to make that a reality. It involves our energy supply, packaging, delivery, and an improved return process to minimise waste. At all our facilities in the Netherlands and Belgium, we use 100% wind and solar energy, partly generated on- or near site. To reduce packaging waste, we have fifteen advanced packing machines and a manual packing system that allows us to customise packaging, minimising the use of excess materials.<br>
In collaboration with carriers like PostNL, we are focused on making our delivery process more sustainable. Already 24% of our "last mile" deliveries are done by bike or on foot. We are working towards achieving zero grams of CO2 emissions per package through further measures such as using smaller, reusable, and biodegradable packages and more efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles.<br>
Furthermore, we are actively pursuing the sustainability of our product assortment. Currently, we offer a sustainable alternative in half of all product categories, and our goal is to expand this to cover all product categories by the following year. We have already removed products like single-use plastics from our assortment. Again, having accurate and comprehensive product data is crucial in this effort. We continue to encourage GS1 to centralise more neutral product data across a wider range of product categories, including sustainability certifications.</p>

              The peak season is just around the corner. How did you prepare for it? 

<p>The preparation actually started right after the previous peak. It begins with expanding our capacity. To be able to sell a lot in November and December, we started acquiring inventory in September and October. Especially during these months, it's crucial that we can rely on correct identification of products with the GTIN. Otherwise, our operation would fall apart. After all, we're dealing with large quantities, possibly over a million items on certain days. And particularly in December, nothing is more frustrating than a package arriving late.</p>

<p>KaratDAO is a decentralized growth network that connects Web2 to Web3, giving users full control over their personal data. This means that users can choose who they share their data with and how it’s used.</p><p>KaratDAO was founded in early 2022 by high school friends and college roommates who all went on to work in Web3. They identified user data as the most important object in Web2 and sought a way to use on-chain data to make it easier for projects to acquire and leverage this data in a user-centric way in Web3.</p><p>The team says it has a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities of data privacy and ownership in Web3. The first few dApps were built to allow teams to find their audience via community building and a recommendation system to identify holders of similar tokens and look-alike projects.</p><p>290,000 <a href="https://karatdao.com/network/claimer?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Karat network boarding passes</a> have been minted on zkSync by users verifying their Web2 accounts, enabling eligibility for KAT claiming. Recent token listings on <a href="http://gate.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Gate.io</a>, Bitget, BitMart, and MEXC &nbsp;offer access to liquidity KAT and aim to help drive increased utility for the network.</p> How KaratDAO Works <p>KaratDAO is <a href="https://docs.karatdao.com/why-karat-network?ref=blog.ceramic.network">built on Ceramic</a>, providing a secure way to store and share data. The team uses Lit for encrypting and accessing data on Ceramic. Karat Smart Contract is a smart contract that manages the ownership and access control of data on Ceramic. This combination of technologies gives users full ownership of their credentials on-chain.</p><p>KaratDAO chose to build on Ceramic after looking at other options because it was the most developer-friendly tech for DIDs, offering the most extensions and toolkits for developers. It also made IPFS usable and had a strong community of other projects in its ecosystem.</p> Why KaratDAO Chose Ceramic   Ceramic is the most friendly platform for DID projects. DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) are a new way of identifying people and things on the internet. Ceramic is the most mature platform for storing and managing DIDs.  Ceramic has the most extensions and toolkits for DIDs. Ceramic has a wide range of extensions and toolkits that make it easy to integrate with other projects.  Ceramic makes IPFS more usable. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a decentralized file storage system. Ceramic makes it easier to use IPFS by providing a layer of abstraction on top of it.  Ceramic has a strong community of other projects. This means that there is a lot of support and development available for Ceramic.  Ceramic is a long-term project with positive momentum and staying power. Ceramic has been around for several years and has a track record of positive development. This gives the KaratDAO team confidence that Ceramic will be around for the long term.   How KaratDAO Uses Ceramic <p>KaratDAO uses Ceramic to store three types of data:</p>  VCs: VCs are a way of storing verified credentials, such as a person's name, email address, or phone number. KaratDAO uses VCs to store user information in a secure and private way.  Schemas: Schemas define the structure of VCs. KaratDAO uses schemas to ensure that VCs are consistent and easy to use.  Lit protocol conditions: Lit protocol conditions are a way of defining rules for how VCs can be used. KaratDAO uses Lit protocol conditions to ensure that VCs are only used in a way that is consistent with their privacy policy.  <p>Each piece of user data is stored as a separate stream in Ceramic. For example, a user's Twitter handle would be <a href="https://cerscan.com/mainnet/profile/did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1eEad001168B559b7a76875e7D7C2d5EaC6d854a?ref=blog.ceramic.network">stored in a separate stream</a>, and their Discord handle would be stored in a separate stream. This makes it easy to manage and access user data.</p><p>They use the Karat contract to write a <a href="https://www.okx.com/web3/marketplace/nft/collection/zksync-era/karat-vc-registry-a0d713?ref=blog.ceramic.network">pointer to the user data on-chain</a>. This allows KaratDAO to verify the authenticity of the user data and to make it more accessible to other applications.</p><p>In the future, KaratDAO plans to use a smart contract wallet to improve the user experience of storing data on Ceramic. This will allow users to store their data on Ceramic without having to sign a contract.</p><p>KaratDAO offers a number of features and benefits that make it a powerful tool for data privacy and ownership. These features include:</p>  Decentralized control: KaratDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which means that it is owned and controlled by its users.  Rewards for data sharing: KaratDAO rewards users for sharing their data with projects. This helps to incentivize users to share their data responsibly and benefits the projects that can access the consumer data. There are roughly 100 projects using Karat dApps for their own websites, allowing them to host campaigns when users sign up that they can record on their data dashboards for airdrops and other giveaways.  <p>The team is also working on a number of new features and integrations, including:</p>  A marketing platform that will help projects to better understand and engage with their users.  A governance system that will give users control over the future of KaratDAO.  Integrating account abstraction (EIP4337) into Karat Network, enhancing user experience.  The incorporation of zero-knowledge (ZK) technology to further protect user’s privacy and bolster data ownership.   The Future of KaratDAO <p>KaratDAO is still under development, but the team plans to continue to grow the KaratDAO user base and become the leading data privacy and ownership platform in Web3. The team also plans to decentralize KaratDAO further, and to give users more control over the platform.</p><p>To learn more please visit the <a href="https://karatdao.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">KaratDAO website</a> or join the KaratDAO community on Discord.</p>

<p>Reviews of four updated Electronic Court Filing draft specifications ends Sept. 9th</p> 


<p>We are pleased to announce that Electronic Court Filing Version 4.1 &amp; Version 5.01 and Electronic Court Filing Web Services Service Interaction Profile Version 4.1 &amp; Version 5.01 from the LegalXML Electronic Court Filing TC [1] are now available for public review and comment. This is the second public review for Version 4.1 and the third public review for Version 5.01 of these specifications.</p>



<p>ECF defines a technical architecture and a set of components, operations and message structures for an electronic court filing system, and sets forth rules governing its implementation.</p>



<p>Version 4.1:<br>LegalXML Electronic Court Filing Version 4.1 (ECF v4.1) consists of a set of non-proprietary XML and Web Services specifications, along with clarifying explanations and amendments to those specifications, that have been added for the purpose of promoting interoperability among electronic court filing vendors and systems. ECF Version 4.1 is a maintenance release to address several minor schema and definition issues identified by implementers of the ECF 4.0 and 4.01 specifications.</p>



<p>Electronic Court Filing Web Services Service Interaction Profile defines a Service Interaction Profile, as defined in section 5 of the ECF v4.1 specification. The Web Services Service Interaction Profile may be used to transmit ECF 4.1 messages between Internet-connected systems.</p>



<p>Version 5.01:<br>Electronic Court Filing Version 5.01 (ECF v5.01) consists of a set of non-proprietary XML and Web Services specifications developed to promote interoperability among electronic court filing vendors and systems. ECF v5.01 is a minor release that adds new functionality and capabilities beyond the scope of the ECF 5,0, 4.0 and 4.01 specifications that it supersedes.</p>



<p>Electronic Court Filing Web Services Service Interaction Profile defines a Service Interaction Profile (SIP), as defined in section 7 of the ECF v5.01 specification. The Web Services SIP may be used to transmit ECF 5.01 messages between Internet-connected systems.</p>

<p>OSLC Open Project has now completed eight OASIS Standards</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the publication of its two newest OASIS Standards, approved by the members on 23 July 2023:</p>



<p>OSLC Configuration Management Version 1.0<br>OASIS Standard<br>23 July 2023</p>



<p>OSLC Configuration Management defines an RDF vocabulary and a set of REST APIs for managing versions and configurations of linked data resources from multiple domains.</p>



<p>OSLC Tracked Resource Set Version 3.0<br>OASIS Standard<br>23 July 2023</p>



<p>The Tracked Resource Set protocol allows a server to expose a set of resources in a way that allows clients to discover that set of resources, to track additions to and removals from the set, and to track state changes to the resources in the set. The protocol does not assume that clients will dereference the resources, but they could do so. The protocol is suitable for dealing with sets containing a large number of resources, as well as highly active resource sets that undergo continual change. The protocol is HTTP-based and follows RESTful principles.</p>



<p>These two specifications are part of a broader set of OSLC specifications that are part of the OSLC-OP project. In particular, OSLC-Core (<a href="https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/core/v3.0/oslc-core.html">https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/core/v3.0/oslc-core.html</a>) provides the core services upon which the Configuration Management and Tracked Resource Set specifications are built.</p>



<p>About the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration Open Project:<br>Managing change and configuration in a complex systems development lifecycle is very difficult, especially in heterogeneous environments that include homegrown tools, open source projects, and commercial tools from different vendors. The OSLC initiative applies World Wide Web and Linked Data principles to enable interoperation of change, configuration, and asset management processes across a product’s entire application and product lifecycle.</p>



<p>Configuration Management received three Statements of Use – from MID, SodiusWillert, and IBM.<br>Tracked Resource Set received three Statements of Use – from IBM, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and SodiusWillert.</p>

 Join Energy Web in Shaping the Energy Future via Upcoming Polkadot Crowdloan, Launching September 5th <p>Zug, Switzerland, August 24, 2023 — Energy Web, a non-profit organization developing digital solutions to accelerate the energy transition, is pleased to announce the <a href="http://crowdloan.energywebx.com">Energy Web X crowdloan</a>. The objective of the crowdloan initiative is to secure a parachain slot for Energy Web X on the Polkadot Relay Chain, thereby empowering it to leverage the security and scalability inherent in Polkadot’s infrastructure. Contributing to the crowdloan represents a unique opportunity for the Polkadot and Energy Web communities to help expand the Energy Web ecosystem to the Polkadot network and support Energy Web’s mission to accelerate the energy transition.</p> Crowdloan and Polkadot Parachains: Powering Energy Web X with&nbsp;Polkadot <p>Connecting to the Polkadot Relay Chain offers a <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/EWX-Lightpaper.pdf">multitude of scaling and security benefits </a>for the Energy Web ecosystem. Energy Web X aims to harness these advantages through a parachain connection. However, due to the limited availability of parachain slots on Polkadot, a competitive process is in place to allocate&nbsp;them.</p><p>To determine which projects get to connect their parachains to the Polkadot Relay Chain, lease periods (referred to as ‘ ‘time slots’ ‘) are auctioned off. Each lease period lasts for 12 weeks. Projects can bid for up to 8 slots at once in a crowdloan, for a total of 96 weeks of lease time. Winning an auction secures the project a parachain slot, granting it access to the security and resources of the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>The Energy Web and Polkadot communities can support Energy Web X’s bid for a parachain slot through a crowdloan mechanism.</p> How the EWX Crowdloan Works <p>Contributors lend their DOT tokens for the Energy Web X launch via the Polkadot crowdloan mechanism. Similar to the parachain auctions themselves, crowdloans occur directly on the Polkadot Relay Chain. Contributors will use DOT tokens to participate, requiring a Polkadot wallet. Contributed DOT tokens are temporarily locked on behalf of the project. No tokens are spent (except for a small transaction fee). In the event that Energy Web X does not win an auction, contributed DOT tokens are immediately and automatically returned.</p><p>In the event that Energy Web X wins an auction and secures a parachain slot, DOT tokens will be returned to all contributors once the parachain lease ends (96 weeks after it begins). If Energy Web X is awarded a parachain slot in the forthcoming auction, launch will be targeted for October 23, 2023 (coinciding with Polkadot lease period&nbsp;14).</p> Rewards for EWX Crowdloan Contributors <p>To incentivize community participation, a rewards program is in place. For every 1 $DOT contributed to the Energy Web X crowdloan, 1 $EWT (Energy Web Token) on Energy Web X is offered as a reward. The distribution of $EWT rewards is expected to commence in Q1 2024, with the rewards vested and distributed in consistent amounts in regular intervals over the remaining lease time of Energy Web X until Aug 25,&nbsp;2025.</p><p>The EWX parachain address is automatically calculated based on the Polkadot account that was used for the Crowdloan participation. Therefore it’s not possible to receive the crowdloan rewards to another&nbsp;address.</p> Participation Guidelines <p><a href="http://crowdloan.energywebx.com">To participate in the EWX Crowdloan</a>, contributors must send their $DOT tokens directly to the EWX Crowdloan on Polkadot, as described below. Funds raised via the crowdloan will be used in auctions beginning on September 5, 2023 and concluding between September 19 and September 24, 2023. Due to the candle auction mechanism that defines the auction end time at random, contributions made before September 7 have the most impact on EWX’s chances of winning the auction and your chances to win a reward. Please note that Ledger wallets will not initially support EWX. Contributors using Ledger wallets for the EWX Crowdloan may need to follow additional steps to access their $EWT rewards after the public&nbsp;launch.</p><p>About Energy Web <br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>In this era of generative AI, how do we determine whether an image is human-created or machine-made?&nbsp;For the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Professor Hany Farid shares the techniques used for identifying real and synthetic images — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, environmental lighting, and GAN-generated faces. A world-renowned expert in the field of misinformation, disinformation, and digital forensics as well as an advisor to the CAI, Professor Farid explores the limits of these techniques and their part in a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the second article in a six-part series.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>Read part 1: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">From the darkroom to generative AI</a></p>




 


  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>Before we dive into talking about specific analyses that can help distinguish the real from the fake, it is worthwhile to first ask: Just how photorealistic are AI-generated images? That is, upon only a visual inspection, can the average person tell the difference between a real image and an AI-generated image? Because the human brain is so finely sensitive to images of people and faces, we will focus on the photorealism of faces, arguably the most challenging task for AI-generation.</p><p>Before diffusion-based, text-to-image synthesis techniques like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Adobe Firefly splashed onto the screen, generative adversarial networks (GANs) were the most common computational technique for synthesizing images. These systems are generative, because they are tasked with generating an image; adversarial, because they pit two separate components (the generator and the discriminator) against each other; and networks, because the computational machinery underlying the generator and discriminator are neural networks.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Although there are many complex and intricate details in these systems, StyleGAN (and GANs in general) follow a fairly straightforward structure. When tasked with creating a synthesized face, the generator starts by splatting down a random array of pixels, and then it feeds this first guess to the discriminator. If the discriminator, equipped with a large database of real faces, can distinguish the generated image from the real faces, the discriminator provides this feedback to the generator. The generator then updates its initial guess and feeds this update to the discriminator in a second round. This process continues with the generator and discriminator competing in an adversarial game until an equilibrium is reached when the generator produces an image that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real faces. Above you can see a representative set of eight GAN-generated faces.</p><p>In a series of recent perceptual studies, we examined the ability of trained and untrained observers to distinguish between real and synthesized faces. The synthetic faces were generated using StyleGAN2, ensuring diversity across gender, race, and apparent age. For each synthesized face, a corresponding real face was matched in terms of gender, age, race, and overall appearance.</p><p>In the first study, 315 paid online participants were shown — one at a time — 128 faces, half of which were real. The participants were asked to classify each as either real or synthetic. The average accuracy on this task was 48.2%, close to chance performance of 50%, with participants equally as likely to say that a real face was synthetic as vice versa.</p><p>In a second study, 219 new participants were initially provided with a brief training on examples of specific rendering artifacts that can be used to identify synthetic faces. Throughout the experiment, participants were also provided with trial-by-trial feedback informing them whether their response was correct. This training and feedback led to a slight improvement in average accuracy, from 48.2% to 59.0%.&nbsp;</p><p>While synthesized faces are highly realistic, there are some clues that can help distinguish them from real faces:&nbsp;</p>  <p>StyleGAN-synthesized faces have a common structure consisting of a mostly front-facing person from the neck up and with a mostly uniform or nondescript background.</p>  <p>Facial asymmetries are telltale signs of synthetic faces. They are often seen in mismatched earrings or glasses frames. (See the top-left image in the figure below.)</p>  <p>When viewing a face, we tend to focus most of our attention in a "Y" pattern, shifting our gaze between the eyes and mouth and often missing some glaring artifacts in the background that may contain physically implausible structures. (See the top-right image in the figure below.)</p>  <p>StyleGAN-synthesized faces enforce a facial alignment in the training and synthesis steps that results in the spacing between the eyes being the same and the eyes being horizontally aligned in the image. (See the bottom image in the figure below.)</p>

  <p>Having largely passed through the uncanny valley, GAN-generated faces are nearly indistinguishable from real faces. Although we have not carried out formal studies, my intuition is that the more recent diffusion-based, text-to-image generation yields faces that are slightly less photorealistic. As this technology improves, however, it will surely lead to images that also pass through the uncanny valley.</p><p>Having seen that the visual system may not always be reliable in distinguishing the real from the fake, in my next post I will describe our first technique that exploits the facial alignment of GAN-generated faces to distinguish them from real faces.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>[1] S.J.

 Accelerating Innovators through Energy Web Validator Community Fund&nbsp;Grants <p>Zug, 20 July 2023 — Energy Web Chain Validators recently approved a newly designed <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/communitygrantprogram/">Community Fund Grant Program</a>. The program’s objective is to support innovative projects aligned with Energy Web’s mission by awarding them with grants to turn innovative ideas into&nbsp;reality.</p><p>The program will be governed by a comprehensive set of rules approved by the validator community and managed by the Community Fund Committee. The rules and processes were inspired by the experience of several validators, who have participated in several grant programs in other Web 3 communities.</p><p>Although the Community Fund has been used for initiatives such as the Bug Bounty Program or the Validator Accounting Tool, its potential can be maximised by opening it to the wider public and supporting innovative projects that contribute to Energy Web’s mission. And with <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-and-polkadot-link-up-to-build-pioneering-renewable-energy-solutions-aca7e95e61c">Energy Web entering the Polkadot environment </a>and developing its next-generation blockchain <a href="http://www.energyweb.org/EWXLightpaperV1">Energy Web X</a>, the opportunities for innovation are even&nbsp;greater.</p><p>The rules behind the program set a general framework comprised of specific requirements applicants must meet and also specify application processes. It features a tiered grant system intended to support different types of projects, from small-scale ideas such as building simple components to improve Energy Web’s tech stack to larger ones like building entirely new solutions or conducting pilots involving energy&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Impact-driven innovation and open-source technologies are deeply rooted in Energy Web’s mission and values. Applicants will be required to tackle tangible challenges and must be willing to share project results in a transparent way.</p><p>The first iteration of the program is officially accepting grants. Participants will be required to to submit an application via a simple online form made available on this <a href="http://energyweb.org/communitygrantprogram">website</a>. And, though it has only just kicked off, future iterations are being planned by having a GitHub based application process (similar to <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program#1-application">W3F’s process</a>) catering to developers and increasing transparency.</p><p>Energy Web Chain Validators look forward to receiving your applications. Stay tuned to upcoming announcements and do not hesitate in reaching out if you have any questions.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>To celebrate #HyperledgerWomen and their contributions to our community, we are asking a cross section of the many women leaders in our community to share stories about their careers, what brought them to the blockchain space, what projects they’re excited about and advice they’ve received or have to share. In this series, we will share stories from a diverse group of #HyperledgerWomen who are driving progress in our community, and in the industry at large.</p>

<p>It took a while, but our website is now on its own. Big thanks go to the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu">Berkman Klein Center</a> for hosting us on its blog server since 2006. Also for continuing to host our <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/lists/info/projectvrm">mailing list</a> and our <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page">wiki</a>. And to all the friends who helped, including those at <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> and <a href="https://pressable.com">Pressable</a>, who made the transition smooth and complete. Links to every post and page we’ve published at blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/ (our old location) now travel down the same directory paths at projectvrm.org/. There will be no 404s. This is a rare thing for any site that moves from one host to another.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is not the one-year project we imagined in the first place. It may not be a one-generation project. But we will get from the state on the left above to the one on the right. And thanks to <a href="https://www.gapingvoid.com/">Gapingvoid</a>‘s Hugh MacLeod for drawing that illustration in the first place, way back in 2005.</p>

<p>Committee Note discusses approaches to alerts in specific geographic areas</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce publication of “Mobile Alerting Practices Version 1.0,” a Committee Note from the members of the OASIS Emergency Management TC [1].</p>



<p>One method of reaching people with emergency alert messages is via their personal mobile devices, such as mobile phones and tablets. Access to these devices is via the Mobile Network to which they are currently attached. However, the need to make a large-scale distribution in a specific geographic area without crashing the control channel, and the need to reach roamers, whose devices may retain their default behavior from their home network, needs consideration by those mobile networks. This document discusses how practitioners have considered this matter.</p>



<p>The Committee Note is available here:</p>

<p>Second public review of this draft specification - ends September 15th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Universal Business Language TC are pleased to announce that Universal Business Language Version 2.4 is now available for public review and comment. This is the second public review for Universal Business Language Version 2.4.</p>



<p>About the specification draft:</p>



<p>UBL is the leading interchange format for business documents. It is designed to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes. The European Commission has declared UBL officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations, and in 2015 UBL was approved as ISO/IEC 19845:2015.</p>



<p>Specifically, UBL provides:<br>– A suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business documents.<br>– A library of schemas for reusable data components such as Address, Item, and Payment, the common data elements of everyday business documents.<br>– A set of schemas for common business documents such as Order, Despatch Advice, and Invoice that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation contexts.</p>



<p>UBL v2.4 is a minor revision to v2.3 that preserves backwards compatibility with previous v2.# versions. It adds new document types, bringing the total number of UBL business documents to 93. As with previous UBL releases, the UBL 2.4 library is designed to support the construction of a wide variety of document types beyond those provided in the 2.4 package.</p>

  DID methods are the magic ingredient that gives DIDs their flexibility. Before creating any specific DID, you first choose a DID method, which determines how you perform the create, read, update, and deactivate operations on a DID of that method. Once created, each DID includes the name of its method in the identifier itself, so that when you use the DID, others know how to retrieve the associated

 What Happened <p>On Tuesday, August 15, 2023 around 2pm EST, hackers believed to be from the Pink Drainer hacker group breached Ceramic’s Discord server. This resulted in a series of fake airdrop announcements with malicious links that looked like they came from a core team member.</p><p>After the hackers infiltrated the server, they immediately removed all core team members and other prominent community members, which effectively disabled us from taking action to stop the attack. Once the core team realized they lost access to Discord, around 2pm EST, they immediately contacted the support team at Discord and posted on Twitter to warn the community. By 6pm the core team regained control of Discord, banned the hackers, and eliminated the threats including malicious links and posts.</p><p>In total, the hackers siphoned around $1,710 (0.93476 ETH) from community members who clicked the malicious link in the announcement channel. If you were affected by this phishing attempt please email us at <a href="mailto:team@3box.io">team@3box.io</a>.</p><p>Huge thanks to the Metamask, Discord, LearnWeb3, and ENS teams and the multitude of community members who responded so quickly and effectively to help us contain the damage.</p> How it Happened <p>Hackers reached out to a core Ceramic team member on Telegram impersonating a prominent mainstream media journalist and requested an interview for a feature. Prior to speaking, they requested the completion of prerequisite consent forms that required the team member to drag and drop a button into their bookmarks and sign into Discord in order to verify their account identity.</p><p>After dragging the bookmark into <a href="http://discord.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Discord.com</a> through their web browser, the hacker was able to steal the JWT Auth Token of this user’s account from the browser's local storage—bypassing username, password and 2FA. This attack is known as a bookmarklet, you can read more about it <a href="https://breakdev.org/hacked-discord-bookmarklet-attacks/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>. The hackers only gained access to Discord and no other information was lost or compromised.</p><p>This highly-coordinated attack appears to be the work of Pink Drainer, a hacker group that has executed this type of bookmarklet attack on a number of other leading Web3 projects. You can read more about other similar hacks performed by this group <a href="https://drops.scamsniffer.io/post/pink-drainer-steals-3m-from-multiple-hack-events-including-openai-cto-orbiter-finance/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p> Incident &amp; Response Timeline <p>11:20am EST - Consent forms completed, hack begins</p><p>1:50pm EST - Core team members lose access to Ceramic Discord</p><p>1:55pm EST - Hackers impersonate Ceramic’s community manager and post fake Ceramic token airdrop announcements</p><p>2pm to 6pm EST - Core team engages Discord, MetaMask, Seal 911 team, WalletConnect, LearnWeb3, and ENS for support</p><p>6pm EST - Core team regains access to and control of Ceramic Discord</p> Next Steps <p>The Ceramic core team will be doubling-down on security while restoring previous roles and settings in Discord. Please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:team@3box.io">team@3box.io</a> if you’ve been affected by the attack.</p><p>We take our role of protecting the best interests of our community very seriously and this was certainly not our finest afternoon; however, these types of events are an unfortunate reality of operating in Web3. </p><p>We will learn from this misstep, improve, and make sure we continue to serve and protect our community of Web3 builders.

<p>Findynet received 10 responses to the SSI RFI and continues to evaluate available SSI solutions by arranging a series of demo sessions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Findynet <a href="https://findy.fi/en/ssi-rfi-2023/">requested information about Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) solutions</a> in the summer. We are very pleased with the quality of the 10 responses and thank all respondents for their participation. We feel that we have a good baseline to start evaluating which solutions would best fit the various ecosystems and use cases Findynet is planning to support.</p>
<p>If you are a potential participant in a Findy pilot or a Finnish SSI ecosystem member looking for an SSI solution, please reach out to <a href="mailto:samuel.rinnetmaki@findy.fi?subject=SSI+RFI+results">Samuel Rinnetmäki</a> so we can share the overview of the RFI results with you.</p>
<p>We have also arranged a series of demonstrations where SSI solution providers showcase their capabilities.&nbsp;In these 1-hour online events, invited SSI solution providers demonstrate their capabilities to support use case examples defined by Findynet.</p>
 Invitation to live demos 
 The demo sessions are open to all Findynet’s members and customers – both current and potential ones. If you’re interested to see how Self-sovereign identity works in practice and how SSI solutions can reduce friction and improve privacy, please join the Teams online sessions using the links below.

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>With this year’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata&nbsp;</a>earlier in the month now behind us but still very much in the sector’s mind, it has to be the most appropriate topic to lead this month’s newsletter.</p>



<p>Some of you reading this were there in the room to experience it and as I wrote to you last week,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/speakers-2023/">s</a><a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/speakers-2023/">peakers</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/sponsors/">sponsors</a>&nbsp;and delegates alike all played their part to make this event a great success, ‘the best yet’. Attendee survey results certainly support this assertion.</p>



<p>There were jaw-dropping statistics thanks to the Department of Internal Affairs and&nbsp;<a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/paulwarrentape">Paul Warren-Tape from Diamond Sponsor IDVerse</a>. The cost of identity crime in NZ is +$200M annually, and the cost of identity theft globally in 2021 was $52bn. By comparison, the estimated cost to eradicate world hunger for a year is $45bn. No math needed – the human cost of identity crime is huge and Aotearoa simply has to do better, faster, if we are to get ahead of this.</p>



<p>We enjoyed&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/programme-2023/">presentations, panel and roundtable discussions</a>&nbsp;ruminating on new tech in biometrics, in AI and Cloud, on talent and trust, identity and security. We heard experiences from the banking, health and retail sectors in operationalising digital trust. And we were able to get some useful insights and updates from the Department of Internal Affairs’ Digital Public Service branch and the RealMe team, even though Ministers and senior government officials were unable to attend due to the election being so close. Fortunately for attendees, they can re-run the event on the Backstage app, to keep those poignant moments top of mind. Get a head start on next year’s Summit:&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/subscribe-for-updates/">Subscribe for updates – Digital Trust Summit</a>.</p>



<p>Our decision to bring&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victordominello/">Victor Dominello&nbsp;</a>over from New South Wales to deliver the international keynote paid off handsomely – Victor also giving up his time so generously to meet with the Minister, the opposition, the Digital Executive Board comprising senior public service officials, the Te Whatu Ora and&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">Digital Identity NZ’s</a>&nbsp;own&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it was in my car on the Sunday night two days before the Hui Taumata, touring Victor around the Wellington CBD showing the locations for his upcoming meetings when he asked, “What happened? In my early days in the New South Wales Government as Minister for Digital we envied just how far ahead New Zealand was in terms of digital compared to us. And now you have me over here to share our story. What happened?”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a fair point. There were several policy changes around seven or eight years ago which impacted New Zealand’s leadership position. But on the other hand, that’s when discussions about regulating the New Zealand digital identity market first surfaced (with the passing of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2023/0013/latest/LMS459583.html">DISTF regulation</a>&nbsp;we are up towards the front again in that aspect) and with the establishment and success of New Zealand digital identity companies coming a little later, some of which have gone global (MATTR recently winning a contract from the NSW Government no less) it’s clear that we’ve moved forward. If you’re interested,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final-1.pdf">pages 14 -15 and 32-34 of our Report on Digital Identity in Aotearoa</a>&nbsp;help with further context around the market dynamics. Nonetheless, it’s sobering to be reminded how offshore perceives us – how our comprehensive leadership in this space less than 10 years ago has narrowed and in some cases been overtaken. Just like the All Blacks or the Silver Ferns (if we thought of Aotearoa’s digital identity ecosystem as a national team) there should be no complacency regarding our relative position in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So it was great to feel the ‘buzz’ of a sense of urgency in conversations at the Hui Taumata this year. And it has motivated<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">&nbsp;Digital Identity NZ</a>&nbsp;to think strategically on how to deliver its value proposition and increase its relevance more directly into the NZ digital identity ecosystem while supporting its members. In the coming months expect to see some timely and strategic changes to our positioning, posture, website and events content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>My opening and closing remarks encouraged attendees to actively participate and help frame the underpinning ecology and ecosystem that’s needed to support our shared goal. That could be through advocacy, research and development or education and awareness raising throughout your organisation, whānau, iwi and hapu of the critical and foundational role digital identity plays in achieving safe, secure and privacy-centric digital transactions.</p>



<p>To that end&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">Digital Identity NZ</a>&nbsp;has some great resources to draw on for help, including&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/submissions/">articles, research, reports and our submissions</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/webinars/">webinars</a>&nbsp;and similar postings from its&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/knowledge-hub/">Knowledge Hub</a>.&nbsp;They are there for you – private, public and&nbsp;non profit sectors – the mahi sponsored by socially responsible organisations working alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-members/">members</a>&nbsp;volunteering their time.&nbsp;The time for action is now.</p>

 Introduction — bringing any message across blockchains <p>The OriginTrail technical architecture consists of 3 layers — the consensus layer, the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) layer and the application layer. Since the OriginTrail ecosystem inception and the first whitepaper, the consensus layer was intended to include multiple blockchains in order to ensure neutrality, robustness and inclusiveness.</p><p>We have seen the first implementation of the multi-chain approach in the V5 of the DKG which ended up being integrated with Ethereum, Gnosis and Polygon. The currently newest V6, initially deployed on the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot, has yet to become a multichain network and drive trusted knowledge infrastructure across blockchains. This document serves as an outline of the path towards reaching&nbsp;that.</p><p>Web3 is currently lacking an interoperable layer for maintaining a trusted knowledge base across a growing number of blockchain ecosystems which is limiting the possibility to create cross-blockchain applications or expand user experience and user base across multiple blockchain ecosystems.</p><p>In addition to limiting the value that can be created for Web3 users, it also significantly discourages Web2 users from onboarding to Web3. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/10/majority-of-americans-arent-confident-in-the-safety-and-reliability-of-cryptocurrency/">According to research, </a>75% of Americans who have heard of cryptocurrencies are not confident in their safety and reliability. While reasons for this are multifaceted, it is clear, the growth of this sector is impeded by misinformation, poorly structured and siloed&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Web3 requires a semantic layer to bring any message across blockchains in a verifiable manner. Having discussed integrations with several leading EVM compatible blockchain ecosystem champions, the right time to enable such integrations is&nbsp;now.</p> OriginTrail integration with EVM — compatible blockchains <p>The ambition of the multichain OriginTrail project is to drive trusted knowledge exchange across Web3 communities by equipping builders from various ecosystems with tools and guidance to integrate DKG with their EVM-compatible chain.</p><p>The impact of OriginTrail integration with a blockchain ecosystem:</p>  Bringing Decentralized Knowledge Graph technology to any blockchain ecosystem enabling trusted AI applications, such as AI-powered trusted semantic search (<a href="https://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG</a> initiative)  Enabling enterprise solutions leveraging DKG and AI technology on your chain (enterprises using OriginTrail <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/overview">here</a>)  Cross-chain knowledge portability (e.g. bridging knowledge for multichain Dapps)  Semantic data oracle functionality for smart contracts on your blockchain (e.g. RWA applications)  Integrations with applications and protocols within your blockchain ecosystem, leveraging the interoperable design of Knowledge Assets (e.g. NFT marketplaces for trading Knowledge assets)  Shared user experience between metaverses leveraging trusted Knowledge Assets across blockchains (e.g. <a href="https://www.tracverse.com/">Tracverse</a>)  <p>Enablement of EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystems drives further exposure and awareness about OriginTrail DKG, resulting in synergies between crypto communities and ultimately the establishment of the Multichain Trusted Knowledge Foundation.</p> EVM blockchains DKG integration steps <p>The process kick-starting the integration of Decentralized Knowledge Graph on an EVM compatible blockchains is straightforward. The first step is to create a pull request in the <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/">OT-RFC-repository</a> using the template pull request with the following name: RFC-17-CHAIN_NAME_integration. In the PR you should create a JSON file with key details about the blockchain network (name, network ID, block explorer, website) and addresses of the smart contracts for TRAC bridge (both on Ethereum and destination chain). An example of the file is available <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-17-OriginTrail-integration-with-EVM-compatible-blockchains/chains/integration-requests/example.json">here</a>.</p><p>Once the pull request is submitted, the core development team will validate the submission to ensure that no inputs are missing and that all requirements are fully met (see below). Depending on the findings, the integration might be approved for the next stage or a request for more information will be&nbsp;given.</p><p>Once approved, a dedicated channel on <a href="https://discord.gg/cCRPzzmnNT">OriginTrail Discord</a> will be created for the blockchain network and integration will be scheduled for implementation (the exact date will be communicated in Discord).</p> EVM blockchain requirements for DKG integration <p>There are a few key criteria that need to be met in order for integration to&nbsp;proceed:</p>  The blockchain network needs to be EVM-compatible.  The blockchain network needs a functioning, preferably decentralized, bridge for the TRAC&nbsp;token.  Engagement within the OriginTrail community — there should be a positive presence of the particular blockchain community present in the OriginTrail community and/or vice-versa. The signaling of desired DKG utility on a particular blockchain ensures that the deployed network will see reasonable activity.  5MM+ TRAC bridged to the blockchain network showing support to initiate network infrastructure and initial DKG network activity.   Conclusion <p>This RFC has presented the approach to integrating OriginTrail DKG with EVM-compatible blockchains, the value propositions and indicated requirements for such integrations. We invite the wider Web3 community to participate in the RFC process, provide their feedback and initiate integrations.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-17-origintrail-integration-with-evm-compatible-blockchains-e635dc8afb86">OT-RFC-17 OriginTrail integration with EVM-compatible blockchains</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>In the past, altering the historical record required cumbersome and time-consuming darkroom techniques. Starting in the early 2000s, powerful and low-cost digital technology began to make it easier to record and alter digital images. And today, sophisticated generative-AI software has fully democratized the ability to create compelling digital fakes.</p><p>Twenty-five years ago, I was waiting in line at the library when I noticed an enormous book in the return cart called The Federal Rules of Evidence. I thumbed through the book and came across Rule 1001 of Article X, which outlined the rules under which photographic evidence can be introduced in a court of law. The rules seemed straightforward until I read the definition of original:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>An “original” of a writing or recording means the writing or recording itself or any counterpart intended to have the same effect by the person who executed or issued it. For electronically stored information, “original” means any printout — or other output readable by sight — if it accurately reflects the information.</p></blockquote><p>I was struck that the definition of original included this vague statement: “... or other output readable by sight.”&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, digital cameras and digital editing software were still primitive by today’s standards, and generative AI was unimaginable. The trajectory of technology, however, was fairly clear, and it seemed to me that advances in the power and ubiquity of digital technology would eventually lead to complex issues around how we can trust digital media. As we enter the new age of generative AI, these issues have only become more salient.</p><p>Although it varies in form and creation, generative AI content (a.k.a. deepfakes) refers to images, audio, or video that has been automatically synthesized by an AI-based system. Deepfakes are the latest in a long line of techniques used to manipulate reality — from Stalin's darkroom to Photoshop to classic computer-generated renderings. However, their introduction poses new opportunities and risks now that everyone has access to what was historically the purview of a small number of sophisticated organizations.</p><p>Even in these early days of the AI revolution, we are seeing stunning advances in generative AI. The technology can create a realistic photo from a simple text prompt, clone a person's voice from a few minutes of an audio recording, and insert a person into a video to make them appear to be doing whatever the creator desires. We are also seeing real harms from this content in the form of non-consensual sexual imagery, small- to large-scale fraud, and disinformation campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Building on our earlier research in digital media forensics techniques, over the past few years my research group and I have turned our attention to this new breed of digital fakery. All our authentication techniques work in the absence of digital watermarks or signatures. Instead, they model the path of light through the entire image-creation process and quantify physical, geometric, and statistical regularities in images that are disrupted by the creation of a fake.</p><p>In this series of posts, I will describe a collection of different techniques that we use to determine whether an image is real or fake. I will explain the underlying analyses — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, specular reflections in the eye, and AI-generated faces — and the conditions under which the analyses are suitable.</p><p>While these and related techniques can be powerful, I need to emphasize their limitations.&nbsp;</p><p>First, it is important to understand that while the presence of evidence of manipulation can tell us something, the absence of traces of manipulation do not prove that an image is real. We cannot differentiate between a flawless fake and the real thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, nearly all forensic techniques have a limited shelf life because techniques to manipulate content are continually improving. So while these techniques are applicable today, we have to continually be aware of how generative AI is evolving.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, these forensic techniques are only one part of a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record. This includes efforts like the Content Authenticity Initiative (to which I contribute), some regulatory pressures, education, and the responsible deployment of AI technologies.</p><p>Further reading:<br>[1] H.

Image by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freepik.com">Freepik</a> Introduction: <blockquote>In the realm of decentralized identity and access management (DIAM), analytics and insights play a pivotal role in enhancing user experiences, improving processes, and driving informed decisions. This article delves into the significance of analytics and insights within our DIAM framework and how they empower businesses and individuals.</blockquote> Comprehensive Data Collection <p>Our DIAM’s analytics and insights module collects a wide range of data related to identity usage, interactions, and engagement. This data forms the basis for generating valuable insights that drive improvements in various aspects of identity management.</p> Data Visualization and Reporting <p>The analytics and insights module presents data in visually engaging formats, making it easier for stakeholders to grasp complex patterns and trends. Customized reports provide a snapshot of identity-related metrics, facilitating data-driven decision-making.</p> Identity Usage&nbsp;Patterns <p>By analyzing identity usage patterns, businesses can uncover valuable insights into user behavior, preferences, and engagement. This information can drive personalized user experiences, tailored marketing strategies, and refined identity management processes.</p> Improving User Experiences <p>Analytics and insights shed light on pain points in the user journey. By identifying areas where users face difficulties or experience friction, businesses can streamline processes, enhance user experiences, and increase user satisfaction.</p> Enhancing Security and Fraud Detection <p>Data-driven insights can expose suspicious activities or anomalies, enabling businesses to promptly detect and mitigate potential security breaches or fraudulent transactions. Proactive measures based on data insights bolster overall security.</p> Tailored Marketing and Engagement Strategies <p>By analyzing user demographics and preferences, businesses can create targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with their audience. Insights into user engagement patterns allow for strategic content delivery and engagement optimization.</p> Performance Metrics for Identity Management <p>Analytics and insights provide quantifiable metrics related to identity management performance. Businesses can track metrics like onboarding success rates, authentication times, and transaction volumes to identify areas for improvement.</p> Continuous Improvement Strategies <p>The data-driven insights generated by the DIAM analytics module guide businesses in adopting continuous improvement strategies. Feedback loops based on data insights ensure that identity management processes evolve with changing user&nbsp;needs.</p> Regulatory Compliance and&nbsp;Audits <p>Analytics and insights aid businesses in maintaining regulatory compliance by tracking data access, sharing, and usage. Audit trails based on data insights provide a transparent record of identity-related transactions.</p> Business Growth and Innovation <p>As businesses harness the power of analytics and insights, they position themselves for growth and innovation. Informed decisions based on data insights empower businesses to innovate their identity offerings and stay ahead of market&nbsp;trends.</p> Conclusion: <blockquote>The DIAM analytics and insights module brings data to the forefront of identity management. By harnessing the power of comprehensive data collection, visualization, and analysis, businesses and individuals can uncover valuable insights that drive user-centric improvements, enhance security, and facilitate data-driven decision-making. As analytics become an integral part of DIAM, the potential for growth, innovation, and seamless user experiences in the identity management landscape becomes limitless.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.know.cards/">Know</a> more about&nbsp;us!</blockquote>

      <p>Stealth badges at scale require an automated system that issues badges depending on particular criteria. This is why they are very common in games-based environments. For example, I unlock some most weeks playing new and existing games on my PlayStation and Google Stadia.</p>

There’s an outstanding question, for us, around how this community explores and thinks about the theoretical underpinnings of a Community of Practice (CoP), but one thing is for sure, Keep Badges Weird is a CoP.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Among the many challenges in our global healthcare delivery landscape, digital health plays an increasingly important role on almost a daily basis, from personal medical devices, to wearables, to new clinical technology and data exchanges. Beyond direct patient care, digital health also applies to diagnostics, drug effectiveness, and treatment delivery. These use cases are being driven by rapid growth in data modeling, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML), and data visualization. Given the rapid digitalization of healthcare delivery, emerging digital twin technology is considered the next system that will advance further efforts in medical discoveries and improve clinical and public health outcomes.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Many different occupations, along with colleges and universities, have health certification requirements, such as proof of immunization and TB tests. Cardea provides an easy way to render these proofs as privacy-preserving and tamper-proof digital credentials that allow for consent-based sharing of specific data and for that data to expire (which is necessary where annual testing is required).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In proving that tamper-proof health data could be issued to travelers by their health providers and be verified by airlines and other countries without having to check back in with the health provider, Cardea has laid the foundation for something much bigger than Covid testing. Verifiable credential technology provides a way for all kinds of health data to be shared in a privacy-preserving and security-enhanced way.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The Cardea project at LFPH is a complete open-source reference implementation for sharing verifiable digital health credentials, with a focus on COVID testing. Built by Indicio for SITA, the world’s largest technology provider to the air transport sector, and successfully trialed in Aruba, Cardea has developed into an open-source community of companies collaborating to extend the codebase features and applications. Central to these goals is interoperability.</p>

      <p>Cardea is a complete ecosystem for the exchange of privacy-preserving digital credentials, open sourced as a project in Linux Foundation Public Health. Launched by Indicio.Tech, Cardea provides an easily verifiable, trustworthy, unalterable proof of health tests or vaccination that can be shared in a privacy-preserving way. Cardea easily integrates with existing health systems to ensure trusted data sources for credentials and uses decentralized identity technology to enable better control of data for individuals. Cardea recently announced its first reference implementation in partnership with SITA for the island of Aruba.</p>

      <p>Indicio’s Cardea ecosystem easily integrates with existing applications, allowing people, businesses, healthcare systems, and governments to work together to safely reopen physical locations such as offices, restaurants, venues, schools, and travel, while complying with global health and data privacy laws. The ecosystem frees businesses, organizations, and governments from having to store and manage people’s private medical information. Instead, decentralized identity enables the individual to independently acquire and control their data and securely share or selectively disclose it at their discretion with full consent.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>More than 50 open data, digital identity and API security technologists globally contributed to this whitepaper to answer the following questions:</p>
       
         What are the differences and similarities between different open data ecosystems? 
         Is global interoperability between different ecosystems possible? 
         Who will be driving this movement and what are the use cases motivating them? How will users benefit? 
         How could cross-border use cases work and what “good might look like”? What are the architecture and governance requirements? 
         What can you do if you believe this is the right direction for Open Banking and Open Data?

    <blockquote>
       
         A identity standard’s adoption is driven by its value of the reliability, repeatability and security of its implementations. 
         A standard’s value can be measured by the number of instances of certified technical conformance extant in the market. 
         Certified technical conformance is necessary but insufficient for global adoption. 
         Adoption at scale requires widespread awareness, ongoing technical improvement and a open and authoritative reference source. 
         When Libraries/Directories/ Registries act as authoritative sources they amplify awareness, extend adoption and promote certification. 
         Certified technical conformance importantly complements legal compliance and together optimize interoperability. 
         Interoperability enhances security, contains costs and drives profitability.

The OpenID Foundation formed the “<a href="https://openid.net/wg/sse/">Shared Signals and Events</a>” (SSE) Working Group as a combination of the previous OpenID RISC working group and an informal industry group that was focused on standardizing&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/re-thinking-federated-identity-with-the-continuous-access-evaluation-protocol">Google’s CAEP proposal</a>. These represented two distinct applications of the same underlying mechanism of managing asynchronous streams of events. Therefore the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0-01.html">SSE Framework</a>&nbsp;is now proposed to be a standard for managing such streams of events for any application, not just CAEP and RISC.

One key benefit of the approach proposed in the white paper is that the standards required to enable this network already exist: OpenID Connect and eKYC/IDA.</p>

      <p>The White Paper was a “no logo, pro bono, open source” collaboration of over 150 co-authors including many members of the OpenID Foundation.

<p>Version 3.1 specifications now available</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the publication of two PKCS #11 specifications as OASIS Standards, approved by the members on July 23, 2023.</p>



<p>The OASIS Standards announced today are:<br>– PKCS #11 Specification Version 3.1<br>– PKCS #11 Profiles Version 3.1</p>



<p>These PKCS #11 specifications define a platform-independent API to cryptographic tokens, such as hardware security modules and smart cards. The API itself is named “Cryptoki” (from “cryptographic token interface” and pronounced as “crypto-key”).<br>– PKCS #11 Specification defines data types, functions and other basic components of the PKCS #11 Cryptoki interface.<br>– PKCS #11 Profiles is intended for developers and architects who wish to design systems and applications that conform to the PKCS #11 Cryptoki standard.</p>

<p>In our time of climate emergency and growing efforts to erode democratic relationships and information ecosystems, perspectives around equity, enjoyment and care help us reimagine futures that nurture and regenerate relationships and natural ecosystems. Below I explore these ideas, proposing some critical positions for looking at technologies (many of which we are cultivating in The Engine Room), which I hope will inspire others and grow like wild herbs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I draw inspiration from feminists from different intersectionalities – indigenous leaders, cyberfeminists, seed keepers, popular educators, linguists and poets – to encapsulate seeds of thought that articulate the direction of efforts in promoting technology decisions and technology systems focused on justice.</p>



<p>Some iridescent sources of inspiration are <a href="https://feministinternet.org/en/principle/environment" title="">the efforts of APC</a>, <a href="https://fondoaccionurgente.org.co/site/assets/files/1433/care_at_the_center_web.pdf" title="">care-centred conversations</a> with colleagues from the Latin American Urgent Action Fund and the Numun Fund, reflections on critical points with Sursiendo and its “<a href="https://archive.org/details/Technoaffections" title="">Technoaffections</a>” initiative, long conversations with friends like <a href="https://pazpena.com/" title="">Paz Peña</a>, and many other sources, like <a href="https://web.facebook.com/coordinadorafeminista8M/videos/cierre-3er-encuentro-plurinacional-de-las-y-les-que-luchan/134664785171969/?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr" title="">local gatherings</a> where I have facilitated conversations focused on feminist technologies and <a href="https://www.ariadne-network.eu/green-screen-coalition-awards/" title="">Green Screen Coalition</a>-facilitated conversations on building sustainable and equitable views of internet infrastructure.</p>



 Grounded in the territory 



<p>An understanding of technologies from a feminist perspective takes as its starting point that technology cannot be separated from the territory it exists on. We must consider the materiality of the devices and the internet’s infrastructure. Both of these rely on an extractivist model that is <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Info-Sheet-1_-Intersection-1-_.pdf" title="">thirsty for data</a> and <a href="https://territorios.fondoaccionurgente.org.co/en/" title="">feeds itself with more extractivism</a>. This system has an impact on health (of humans and other living-beings), erodes the land and <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Info-Sheet-5_-Intersection-5-_.pdf" title="">creates displacement of peoples</a>.</p>



<p>At The Engine Room, we have <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-report-at-the-confluence-of-digital-rights-climate-justice/" title="">documented</a> some of the impacts of big-tech infrastructure and how this impacts communities in <a href="https://www.harvarddesignmagazine.org/articles/shahidul-alam-on-the-majority-world/" title="">the Majority World</a>. In the basin of the area of Chile where I live, for example, the expansion of Google’s and Microsoft’s data centres has diverted scarce local water sources and contaminated local water systems.</p>



<p>In our support to local movements and ecosystems for social justice, we also consider it essential to start from territory and context, and we ask ourselves how the definitions of “local” and “territory” vary between communities, understanding that territory in many cases does not map on to political borders, but to land, natural (for example, the Andean-Amazonian zone), ancestral or cultural environments. This territory can also be the internet.</p>



 Equity as a catalyst 



<p>Along the same lines, the possibility of inhabiting the Internet with enjoyment is facilitated or restricted depending on where you connect from. We have observed – from the experiences and concerns of the communities we support, as well as those of our team members – internet shutdowns and interruptions (whether government-ordered or due to power/network instability) obstructing work, collective organising, advocacy and enjoyment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this, we propose technological and information management alternatives that respond to the territory and identities of those who make up the collective; that offer an enjoyable human connection, reduce harm, focus on digital care, and provide tools to increase digital resilience against emergencies, which also reduces stress and strengthens well-being. For example, we have provided our team members with solar panels and chargers and portable power stations where needed in order to facilitate their remote participation, and have organised community calls to share strategies in times of disruption.</p>



 Preserving memory and the seeds of knowledge 



<p>During the pandemic, I attended several sessions organised by the <a href="https://redsemillas.org/" title="">Red de Guardianes de Semillas </a>(Seed Guardians Network), which connects families that protect agrobiodiversity and promote regenerative life systems in Ecuador, within the context of advancing agroindustrial monoculture farming. Guardian initiatives and seed guardians are widespread throughout the lands of America, generally representing ancient roles that were born with agriculture <a href="https://www.estudiospnud.cl/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/undp_cl_medioambiente_Guardianas-de-semillas.pdf" title="">twelve thousand years ago</a>. Seeds are protected and inherited, together with the knowledge of how to keep them alive, with the aim of “sowing teachings in the community”.</p>



<p>Following this ancestral model, communities should have the option to choose what knowledge they seek to preserve and communicate among themselves, and through which channels they want to do it. Thus, we highlight and promote initiatives that make it possible to make knowledge and communications fly across borders privately (such as <a href="https://signal.org/" title="">Signal Messenger</a>), and local information management initiatives like Rede Mocambos, a solidarity movement that brings together quilombola communities, indigenous people, artisans and artists to organise <a href="https://baobaxia.mocambos.net/#mocambos/rede/bbx/search/datacenter" title="">community data centres</a>.</p>



<p>We also have promoted and investigated <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/findings-tool-dev/" title="">development of technology projects</a> to preserve collective memory, including through the documentation of human rights violations and the creation of <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/" title="">workflows and open source tools</a> for journalists and human rights defenders to archive valuable digital information.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://uwazi.io/" title="">Uwazi</a>, created and maintained by Huridocs, is one example of these tools. We have worked with a number of organisations to create (and sometimes publish) databases on Uwazi, including <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/dont-reinvent-the-wheel-refine-it/" title="">Japiqay</a>, one of our 2018 intensive-support “Matchbox” partners who used it to create and systematise an extensive database of corruption cases from the last 30 years in Peru.</p>



 Sustaining infrastructures of care 



<p>Maintaining adaptable digital infrastructures is key to the sustainability of movements. Adaptable&nbsp; infrastructures are not only made up of technology and digital information, but also require knowledge management practices, an organisational culture centring learning and adaptability, and a commitment to care and joy in development and maintenance processes.</p>



<p>We know that it is not an easy task to design and re-design a collective, fluid and resilient infrastructure with the multiple bodies, cultures and territories of those who make up a collective. In the ever-relevant path towards creating and sustaining a culture of care, some of the questions we ask ourselves to get closer to sustaining infrastructures are:</p>



 
 How do we learn from our past experiences with technology, and apply the learnings to future decisions? 



 What forms of infrastructure must we adopt so that everyone, with their differences, can fully participate, with special attention to times of power and connectivity interruptions? 



 What systems should be established or strengthened to allow rest, disconnection and well-being? How do you apply a holistic approach to digital security and care? 



 How do we take care of the organisation’s data and the data of the people with whom we work? How can we adopt a care policy that focuses on the collective and not on individualised practices? 



 What are the support networks that we must nurture to express solidarity and mutual support, or seek support when we need it? 



 How do we build adaptability in such a way that infrastructures can flow, and respond to the complexity of our identities and their changes? How do you create an infrastructure that promotes enjoyment for all? 
 



 Maintaining the flame of imagination 



<p>I have always admired the ability of feminisms that maintain the <a href="https://ia601805.us.archive.org/32/items/nos-permitimos-imaginar-web/NosPermitimosImaginar.pdf" title="">ability to dream</a> – despite the passing years, democratic and <a href="https://www.awid.org/resources/impact-fundamentalisms-and-extremisms-cultural-rights-interview-un-special-rapporteur" title="">human rights setbacks</a>, denialism and misinformation resulting in <a href="https://www.icfj.org/news/how-disinformation-fuels-online-violence-storms-targeting-women-journalists" title="">violence</a>. To <a href="https://www.awid.org/2021-festival-in-review" title="">create, resist and transform</a> is sustained as a political act.</p>



<p>Last year, we collected some of the dreams that The Engine Room team members have around what a world with justice-focused technology and data systems could look like. Here we offer a composite of those dreams:&nbsp;</p>



<p>We imagine an internet that builds on interconnection and joint responsibility, instead of individualism and capitalism. That is organised through consent, collaboration and privacy. Where digital platforms and networks primarily work towards community engagement – as and how communities define them. A world where we have time and space to collectively understand that technologies go beyond digital ones, and that these build from the knowledge and strategies that pass from generation to generation. Where we are able to turn off digital systems, and live a full life even if we opt out. A world that is a big playground of possibilities.</p>

<p>By Francis Beland, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>Open standards can play a significant role in ocean protection. They can facilitate collaboration, interoperability, and transparency among stakeholders and organizations working towards a common goal. In the context of ocean protection, open standards can provide a framework for the development and implementation of sustainable practices and technologies that can help reduce the negative impact of human activities on the marine environment.</p>



<p>Open standards can also facilitate the sharing of data and information related to ocean health, such as water quality, temperature, and biodiversity. Furthermore, open standards can help ensure that ocean protection efforts are inclusive and equitable by allowing for the participation and input of diverse stakeholders, including local communities, indigenous peoples, and small-scale fishers.</p>



<p>Today, they are particularly useful in the field of oceanic sciences, where data interoperability and sharing are critical for advancing scientific research and understanding of the ocean:</p>



 
 NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a set of open standards for storing and sharing scientific data in a platform-independent manner. 
 



 
 The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) develops and maintains a set of open standards for geospatial data and services. 
 



 
 The Climate and Forecast (CF) conventions provide a set of guidelines for the creation and sharing of climate and forecast data.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Ocean Data View (ODV) is an open-source software tool that provides a platform for visualizing and analyzing oceanographic data. 
 



<p>Scientists may share and combine data more easily utilizing open standards like these, enabling more effective research and understanding of the ocean. A wider number of stakeholders, such as policymakers, the general public, and other researchers, can benefit from access to and transparency of ocean data and research thanks to open standards.</p>

  <p>ABSTRACT: The idea of Self-Sovereign Identity emerged in 2016, but it has inspirations dating back centuries. This article explores the historic evolution of sovereignty and demonstrates how it can be modeled using approaches from other disciplines, including Living Systems Theory and Ostrom’s Principles. It then dovetails that with the topic of human rights to demonstrate many of the goals of the original advocacy for Self-Sovereign Identity. These are goals that we must reconsider today, to shape a digital future rooted in individual autonomy and human rights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christopher Allen is a futurist whose work on the internet highlighting personal agency and privacy dates back to his co-authorship of the TLS spec. He popularized the the term “self-sovereign identity” through his publication of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/04/27/the-path-to-self-sovereign-identity/">“The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a> and has continued to support it through the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops</a> and articles such as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/26/self-sovereign-identity-5-years-on/">“Self-Sovereign Identity, Five Years On”</a>. It’s now seven years on: here’s the latest.</p>

 The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity 

<p>Throughout my professional career, themes of collaboration and trust have remained constant pillars that inform my ventures in the digital world. As a technologist, I have been involved with the development of collaboration and security tools since the inception of the internet and became deeply invested in how these digital spaces can both bolster and challenge traditional systems. My fascination as a software architect with trust has guided me toward understanding the ways in which some concepts of sovereignty, particularly self-sovereignty, unfold within both our physical and digital identities. The convergence of collaboration, trust, and self-sovereignty led to my formulation of <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">10 Principles of Self-sovereign Identity</a> in 2016.</p>

<p>However, I feel that over time some of my original intents for self-sovereign identity have been lost. Though I meant for it to be something that would protect the individual, self-sovereignty doesn’t mean that you are in complete control. It simply defines the borders within which you can make decisions and outside of which you negotiate with others as peers, not as a petitioner.</p>

<p>To help to clarify some of the original goals of self-sovereign identity, I thought that it would be helpful to delve into the origins of those principles and to examine the array of influences that shaped them.</p>

<p>This includes five major areas:</p>

 
   History, which reveals how the idea of sovereignty has evolved. 
   Living Systems Theory, which describes how membranes allow different systems to interact. 
   Ostrom’s Principles, which further define the boundaries of common resources. 
   Feminist Perspectives, which redefine sovereignty as agency, not control. 
   Human Rights &amp; The Governance of the Commons, which detail the intersection between self-sovereign systems and the UN Declaration of Human Rights. 
 

<p>Through this exploration, I aim to describe some of the original goals underlying the self-sovereign principles and to illuminate the importance of self-sovereign identity in our interconnected, digital world.</p>

 A History of Sovereignty 

<p>Any look at the recent concept of self-sovereignty must begin with a look at historic sovereignty, dating back to even before the state-centric model we are familiar with today. It has changed and evolved over time.</p>

<p>During the early Middle Ages, the concept of sovereignty was embodied by lords, who wielded power to give them control over their domains. However, these lords did not exist in isolation; they were part of a complex network of feudal relationships, where power and authority were often negotiated rather than absolute. Vassals pledged fealty to their lords, yet even these bonds were based on mutual obligations. The lord promised protection, and in return, the vassal provided military service and counsel. It was a symbiotic relationship.</p>

<p>As societies underwent transformation, so too did the concept of sovereignty. The rise of cities during the late Middle Ages challenged the power dynamics that had previously been centered around lords and their domains. Independent cities, often organized as city-states, started to emerge as powerful entities. Their sovereignty was asserted not through isolated power but through commerce, diplomacy, and alliances with other cities. Networks of cities created dynamic trade relationships, with goods and information flowing between these different powers.</p>

<p>Jean Bodin wrote about sovereignty in 1576. He saw it as “absolute” and “indivisible”, but nonetheless recognized that it could be passed from one person to another for a limited time. This concept was the foundation of the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years’ War in 1648.</p>

<p>The treaty was a major shift in sovereignty from cities to nations that established the modern concepts of the nation-state and state sovereignty. It marked this significant transition by formalizing the idea of territoriality and non-interference, establishing that each nation was sovereign within its borders. Yet, even then, nations needed to negotiate with each other, reflecting the historical roots of sovereignty in reciprocity and interconnectedness: sovereignty was fluid, rooted in the balance of power between peers with power. It was less about rigid boundaries and more about negotiations and relationships.</p>

<p>This evolution of sovereignty — from lords to cities to nations — offers a historical lens through which we can better understand the principles of self-sovereign identity and its own interconnected world view.</p>

 Living Systems Theory 

<p>The evolution of my ideas for self-sovereign identity goes beyond the traditional context. That began with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_systems">Living Systems Theory (1978)</a>, which struck a deep chord with me from the moment I was first introduced to it, in the mid-80s. It provides a great model for extracting some of the design patterns seen in historic sovereignty.</p>

<p>Living systems theory is a framework that sees the world as an interconnected network of systems. Each living system (such as a single cell, an organism, a social organization, or an ecosystem) is part of a larger system (its environment), and, in turn, is composed of smaller systems (its subsystems). The beauty of this theory lies in its capacity to draw parallels between different levels of organization, making it applicable across a diverse range of fields.</p>

<p>One of the key principles of living systems theory is the concept of the membrane. This is not just a physical barrier but a selective boundary that controls the exchange of energy, matter, and information between the system and its environment. The membrane allows certain things to pass through while restricting others, thereby maintaining the system’s integrity and autonomy. It’s a delicate balancing act: the system must allow enough interaction with the environment to sustain itself while ensuring that it isn’t overwhelmed by external forces.</p>

<p>The concept of the selective membrane is not static; rather, it’s a dynamic entity, constantly adapting and responding to the system’s internal and external changes. This theory is particularly resonant in today’s world, which is characterized by interconnectedness and the continuous negotiation and redefining of boundaries.</p>

<p>It also has obvious parallels to the historic evolution of sovereignty. The symbiotic relationships of peers, cities, or nations all reflect the interdependent relationships in a living system, while the flow of goods that evolved out of the mercantile city-state period demonstrates the movement of objects out of and through the membranes of these independent entities.</p>

<p>More importantly, living systems theory reveals the conception of a sovereign self: a sovereign entity (whether an individual or collective) that like a living systems navigates the balance between maintaining its autonomy and engaging with its environment, including its peers. This is the central foundation of self-sovereign identity.</p>

 Ostrom’s Principles &amp; Living Systems 

<p>Elinor Ostrom’s groundbreaking work on managing common-pool resources was another non-traditional look at sovereignty that offered additional valuable insights to shape my emerging understanding of self-sovereign identity. As the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, in 2009, Ostrom challenged conventional wisdom by showing how local property can be successfully managed by local communities.</p>

<p>Ostrom’s <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/11/a-revised-ostroms-design-principles-for-collective-governance-of-the-commons-.html">eight principles</a> for managing a commons provide a blueprint for effective, sustainable communal resource management. They demonstrate that with the right systems in place, communities can manage shared resources equitably and sustainably, without the need for centralized control or privatization.</p>

<p>Her first principle was particularly notable for my self-sovereign work. I paraphrase it as:</p>

 
   Authorized Use. The community of those who have the right to use the common resource is clearly defined. 
   Commons Boundaries. The boundaries of the commons are clearly defined so as to separate the usage rules from the larger environment. 
 

<p>Much like the selective membrane in living systems theory, Ostrom’s principles delineate the boundaries of a common resource, establishing clear rules on who can use the resource and how much they can use. They also call for collective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process, responding dynamically to their environment through the membrane of their living system.</p>

<p>Further, Ostrom’s principles recognize the need for effective monitoring, conflict resolution mechanisms, and graduated sanctions for rule violators. These elements can be seen as analogous to the regulatory mechanisms within a living system, ensuring its continued functionality and survival.</p>

<p>Finally, Ostrom’s principles suggest that resource governance activities are organized in multiple layers of nested enterprises. This reflects the hierarchical organization seen in living systems, where smaller systems exist within larger ones, and each layer is interconnected and interdependent.</p>

<p>In this light, Ostrom’s principles and the living systems theory converge towards a shared understanding: that complex systems, whether they be biological, social, or digital, can effectively self-regulate and sustain themselves when guided by fundamentals that respect their autonomy, uphold their integrity, and recognize their interconnectivity.</p>

 Sovereignty from a Feminist Lens 

<p>One of the important elements of Ostrom’s principles is that they approached sovereignty from a different, more cooperative viewpoint. Ostrom wasn’t alone in that conception. The idea was in the zeitgeist when I was teaching at Bainbridge Graduate Institute in the early ’10s, just before I began writing about self-sovereign identity. More recently, it’s been articulated in a few published articles.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.gendersecurityproject.com/post/exploring-sovereignty-through-a-feminist-lens">“Exploring Sovereignty through a Feminist Lens”</a>, Vaishnavi Pallapothu advocates for more inclusive understandings of sovereignty and for a transition from rigid hierarchical systems to more interconnected and equitable structures — ones that cleave closer to the ideals of a sovereign self.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sovereignty would move beyond the implication of sovereignty as domination, towards sovereignty as the right to individual agency and prosperity.” – <a href="https://www.gendersecurityproject.com/post/exploring-sovereignty-through-a-feminist-lens">Vaishnavi Pallapothu</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This feminist interpretation of sovereignty fundamentally disrupts the power dynamics traditionally associated with sovereignty. Instead of seeing sovereignty as a tool of domination and control, Pallapothu reframes sovereignty as a means of affirming individual agency and prosperity. Moreover, Pallapothu introduces a sense of fluidity and inclusivity to sovereignty, emphasizing the necessity for cooperation and mutual respect between entities, whether they be individuals, communities, or nations.</p>

<p>This focus on the significance of individual agency within a larger system resonates deeply with the principles of self-sovereign identity and also aligns with the dynamics of living systems and with Ostrom’s principles, which stress interdependence and balance rather than domination.</p>

<p>Pallapothu isn’t the only one to offer a more diverse look at sovereignty. Bethany Webster does so too in <a href="https://www.bethanywebster.com/blog/what-is-sovereignty-13-elements/">“The 13 Elements of Sovereignty”</a>, which talks about women’s sovereignty rather than digital sovereignty, but nonetheless is another great additional to the discussion.</p>

<p>These radical departures from traditional writings on sovereignty, by Pallapothu, Ostrom, Webster, and others demonstrate the importance of including women and marginalized groups (and their too-often overlooked contributions) in the discourse around sovereignty.</p>

<p>Building upon all of these insights, my journey into self-sovereign identity began to take shape, giving rise to principles that mirrored this understanding but were adapted to the unique challenges of the digital age.</p>

 The Sovereignty of Self and Human Rights 

<p>The concept of the sovereign self, championed by the feminist viewpoint, intrinsic to living systems theory, and revealed by Ostrom’s principles, connects to a fundamental pillar of human rights. The <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, underlines the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of all individuals. This aligns with the concept of self-sovereignty, underscoring the individual’s inherent right to autonomy and self-determination.</p>

<p>However, the concept of self-sovereignty is not merely about autonomy; per the Declaration’s promise of “dignity”, self-sovereign identity is also about the recognition of each individual’s unique identity and experiences. It empowers individuals to freely express themselves, to make choices without coercion, and to be treated with respect. Such principles echo the most basic tenets of human rights, promoting equality, freedom, and justice.</p>

<p>These ideals of autonomy, self-determination, dignity, and respect do not exist in isolation. As we’ve seen in living systems theory, every entity is part of a broader network of relationships and exchanges. Likewise, self-sovereignty operates within a societal context, requiring an environment that respects individual agency and fosters mutual respect among all individuals.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Human rights are not only violated by terrorism, repression or assassination, but also by unfair economic structures that create huge inequalities.” - Pope Francis (from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/13/jorge-mario-bergoglio-pope-poverty">2013</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, self-sovereignty is closely linked to the broader quest for social justice and equality. It calls for the transformation of societal structures that perpetuate inequality and injustice, highlighting the imperative to ensure that every individual can exercise their right to self-sovereignty.</p>

<p>It is in this societal and human rights context that the importance of self-sovereign identity becomes even more salient. That’s because self-sovereign identity offers a critical framework for asserting individual autonomy and dignity in an increasingly digital world.</p>

<p>It was also within this context that the idea of self-sovereign identity evolved. “The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity” was written just in advance of <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/events/#rwot-2-id2020-2016">RWOT2</a>, which was held in coordination with the <a href="https://id2020.org/">ID2020 Summit</a> at the United Nations. Many of the concepts of self-sovereign identity and many of the original discussions focused on ID2020’s requirement that everyone in the world have the ability to prove their identity. This human-rights approach thus remains a vital component of self-sovereign identity.</p>

 Sovereignty in the Digital Era 

<p>Together, all of these philosophies, histories, and other ideas offered a strong foundation for the ideas of self-sovereign identity, but there was also a precipitating event: a change in the internet.</p>

<p>In the early internet era, personal sovereignty was a growing power, supported by developments such as self-hosted UUCP emails, personal domains, and individual blogs. These innovations demonstrated interconnectivity, with information being exchanged across personally controlled digital borders. It challenged the notion of absolute state sovereignty.</p>

<p>But by the start of the ’10s, globalization was rising, and digital services and platforms were being consolidated. The nature of digital sovereignty began to shift: not only did states with “sovereign power” take increased control of the digital world, but so did corporate giants and global digital platforms, which are sometimes called <a href="https://lawexplores.com/sovereignty-or-post-sovereignty-a-social-systems-theoretical-perspective/">post-sovereignty</a></p>

<p>When the once-impermeable membranes of state sovereignty added new non-state parties to their ecosystems, individuals did not have a voice in this renegotiation of terms. Instead, the new parties only negotiated with the older state sovereigns. This resulted in insufficient mutual obligations being offered to individuals — or only obligations under property law. We once again become “serfs”.</p>

<p>People had already been attacking this problem for a while. I participated in the collaborative event that led to the <a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1068/988">ASN white paper</a> and that in turn led to the user-centric models that I wrote about in <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">“The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>, but as I was poking my head back into the identity field starting at IIW 2014, I felt that these approaches had failed because they’d been co-opted by those with centralized power. We needed better answers.</p>

<p>Consequently, I identified a need for sovereignty to manifest at the individual level not only in the real world, but also online. Digital rights needed a model where individuals, much like living systems, had personal boundaries serving as membranes. Individuals needed to become sovereigns too, so that they could negotiate as peers. Human beings needed identity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As digital systems create representations of us, a free society demands that we be given a voice in deciding how those representations are created and used. Not because we own that data, but because individual human beings are the ONLY valid source for that moral authority. Human dignity demands that individuals be treated with respect no matter which system they interact with, face-to-face or online. Without that, we become nothing but data in the machine — entries in a ledger to be managed, problems to be solved, digital serfs. We are not.” – Christopher Allen (2020)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where my knowledge of all those scattered philosophies and ideas began to merge into my early thoughts on self-sovereign identity: individuals are seen as living systems, intertwined with each other and with other layers of systems, each with permeable boundaries serving as their membranes. As in living systems theory, my principles needed to highlight the need for a balance between maintaining individual autonomy and engaging in an interconnected digital world; as in Ostrom’s principles, that balance would be based on strong boundaries and clear rules; and as in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, those rules needed to protect agency and human dignity.</p>

<p>Together all of these ideas shaped my perspective, deeply informed my original ten principles, and influenced my choice to use the term “self-sovereign identity” as a name for them in 2016. But, some of these origins and influences have been lost, and if there is a desire to return to the original intent behind the self-sovereign principles, we must return to these influences as well.</p>

 Join Me in the Conversation 

<p>As we look forward, it’s clear that we must strive for balance: maintaining personal and collective autonomy while also encouraging connection in an increasingly interconnected world. By upholding the principles of self-sovereign identity, and their original intents and influences, I believe we can shape a future that respects and values every individual’s rights and dignity.</p>

<p>In the seven years since their inception, the original ten principles of self-sovereign identity have been widely accepted. However, these principles were never meant to be an endpoint. Rather, they were written as a starting point for a larger discussion on the essence of self-sovereignty and human rights in the digital world. Back in 2016, I wrote that I saw these principles as a “departure point to provoke a discussion about what’s truly important.” Furthermore, I sought assistance in evolving these principles to the next level.</p>

<p>Today, it is apparent that as self-sovereign systems are being deployed in the EU and elsewhere, there’s an urgent need to delve deeper into these principles, to correct misunderstandings and acknowledge legitimate criticisms. This is not about regressing to past ideas but about reconnecting with the foundational spirit that informed them in the first place. It is crucial to learn from both the triumphs and the setbacks of the early adopters of these principles to guide the development of the next generation of self-sovereign identity technologies. The problem is large: we thus need people from a large number of disciplines to ensure that we do self-sovereign technology right and with the humility required for such a massive and important undertaking.</p>

<p>The upcoming Rebooting Web of Trust conference in <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/events/rwot12/">Cologne, Germany</a>, starting September 18th, presents an excellent platform for this undertaking. I urge you to <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot12-cologne/blob/main/advance-readings/advance-reading-primer.md">contribute advance readings</a> with your own perspectives on self-sovereign idenity or your own constructive questions. These will allow you to participate in the discussions during an event where we can refine and expand the self-sovereign identity principles.</p>

<p>This is my call to action: let’s collaborate together to ensure that the digital future we’re building is rooted in respecting individual sovereignty and the fundamental human rights of all individuals.</p>

Lissi’s Journey in the Metaverse<p>Welcome to Lissi’s Journey in the metaverse! Today, we are investigating the essential role of trust infrastructure in the metaverse. Identity is the very foundation of every social interaction, regardless of where it happens. While the real world gives us humans countless glues to verify the authenticity of people or organisations we interact with, virtual worlds can be constructed, modified and faked with the press of a button. Hence, the ability to verify the authenticity of people, organisations and content is paramount to the success of the metaverse.</p><p>Over the past four years we collaborated with governments, universities and private organisations alike within <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a> to build a common trust infrastructure, which we now want to leverage to create trust in the metaverse. Our primary focus is the integration of user-friendly applications of ID-Wallets and verifiable credentials. The Neosfer Lounge in Decentraland features a dedicated use case track for Lissi, serving as a showcase to underline the practicality and effectiveness of these tools. Finally, we will wrap-up with reflections on the expedition and look into the future steps towards their widespread adoption.</p> ID-Wallet use cases in the Lissi Lounge — by&nbsp;Neosfer <p>The Neosfer Lounge was published at the beginning of 2023 with the objective to showcase relevant projects and investments of the company as well as host the live streaming of the expert talk Between the Towers. You can find the lounge <a href="https://play.decentraland.org/?NETWORK=mainnet&amp;position=-122,26">here</a>. We now expanded the lounge to include a dedicated track for identity use cases. Join Lissi as our protagonist, demonstrating the practical usage of ID-Wallets with the following use&nbsp;cases.</p>You can speak to our project lead Helge in the Lissi&nbsp;Lounge<p>End-user use cases: ID-Wallets are one of the key tools to build trust in the metaverse. These wallets store digital identity credentials of users, such as customer and membership cards or tickets. They can also be used to identify the real world identity of citizens to comply with know your customer (KYC) requirements, given this is required by law e.g. for opening a bank account or receiving consulting services. But the use cases are not limited to end-users.</p><p>Demonstration Case Customer Cards: A seamless onboarding process enables the user to swiftly sign up and begin exploring the Lissi Lounge — by Neosfer using an ID-Wallet app. The simple, secure onboarding process saves time and ensures one can easily authenticate the next time interacting with the&nbsp;company.</p>Easily get your demo customer card by scanning the&nbsp;QR-code<p>Organisational Use cases: How can you ensure a virtual building you enter is actually representing your favourite retailer brand? How can the company ensure that only their own employees can declare themself as company representatives to prevent fraud and phishing? The answer lies in identities for organisations “ORG-IDs” and digital employee passes. We work together with commercial registers and eIDAS qualified trust service providers to issue organisational identities as verifiable credentials to companies.</p>Proof your customer status to our customer service personell<p>The institutional trust we bring to the metaverse serves as corner-stone to enable business driven use cases and trusted interactions. By facilitating reliable identity verification, we move a crucial step towards a trusted and secure metaverse. Using ID-Wallets in the metaverse gives users the required confidence to explore, interact, and transact in the virtual world. The wallets can also help users maintain control over their relationships as well as transparency of their interaction history.</p>Christian from the Neosfer Team as verified Employee behind the bank&nbsp;counter<p>Demonstration Case Employee Pass: Within the Lissi Lounge you might be lucky and encounter a real person behind the service desk.

Hence, the next steps for us is to integrate the credential workflow with real data for the customer cards and build a holistic story for the customer service representatives together with interested partners. While we focused on the technical integration, we now have to pay attention on use case benefits and UX in the second step. This will also include the task to beautify our lounge&nbsp;;)</p>

<p>As technology advances at a rapid pace, proponents of microchip implants for digital identification herald them as the ultimate solution for convenience and security. However, the implementation of microchip implants as a digital ID system raises significant concerns about privacy, autonomy, and potential abuse. This article explores the dangers associated with microchip implants and argues that they are a bad idea for society.</p>



 
 Invasion of Privacy 
 



<p>Microchip implants, when used for digital ID, essentially turn individuals into walking databases. These chips store personal information, including biometric data and other sensitive details. By integrating such extensive information into a tiny implant, individuals risk becoming vulnerable to privacy breaches and hacking attempts.</p>



<p>Hackers and malicious actors could exploit these microchips to gain unauthorized access to personal information, financial data, and even the ability to track individuals’ movements. As we have witnessed in the past, no system is entirely hack-proof, and the introduction of microchips into our bodies only exacerbates these concerns.</p>



 
 Loss of Autonomy 
 



<p>Adopting microchip implants for digital ID could lead to a loss of personal autonomy. The moment we accept a chip inside our bodies, we hand over control to a system or authority. Such dependence can become precarious, allowing external entities to manipulate our lives, access our data, and possibly even dictate our actions.</p>



<p>In cases where the digital ID is mandated by governments or corporations, refusal to accept the implant might lead to discrimination, exclusion, or limited access to basic services. This coercion to conform infringes upon personal rights and freedom of choice, effectively transforming citizens into passive subjects of surveillance and control.</p>



 
 Ethical and Social Concerns 
 



<p>Microchip implants for digital ID raise significant ethical questions. The prospect of embedding technology inside our bodies blurs the line between humans and machines, potentially reducing individuals to mere data points. This human-machine integration poses a fundamental challenge to our understanding of what it means to be human and how we relate to technology.</p>



<p>Moreover, the adoption of microchip implants may exacerbate existing societal inequalities. Low-income individuals might face barriers to access or be disproportionately affected by a system that favors those who can afford the technology. This could deepen the digital divide, further marginalizing the most vulnerable members of society.</p>



 
 Security Risks and Control 
 



<p>Relying solely on microchip implants for digital ID concentrates power and control in the hands of a select few. Governments or corporations could exploit this control to manipulate public opinion, restrict movement, or even implement social engineering techniques. The potential for mass surveillance raises grave concerns about the erosion of civil liberties and individual rights.</p>



<p>Furthermore, this centralized approach to identity verification presents a single point of failure. If the system experiences a massive breach or a malfunction, it could cause widespread chaos and disruption. Relying on such a fragile system for something as crucial as personal identity is an unnecessary risk that our society should not be willing to take.</p>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>While the concept of microchip implants for digital ID may seem innovative and convenient at first glance, the associated risks far outweigh any potential benefits. The invasion of privacy, loss of autonomy, ethical concerns, and security risks make microchip implants a bad idea for society as a whole. Instead, we should focus on developing alternative solutions that protect privacy, uphold individual autonomy, and bridge the digital divide without compromising our core values and freedoms.</p>

<p>As part of our efforts around <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/mapping-digital-resilience-challenges-in-social-justice-organisations-learnings-from-our-partners/" title="">mapping digital resilience trends, challenges and opportunities</a>, we’ve seen the impact that digital rights threats can have on civil society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, internet shutdowns have become a pertinent issue, particularly during elections. In 2022, the #KeepItOn coalition tracked <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/campaign/keepiton/" title="">187 internet shutdowns in 35 countries</a>. Populations that have recently been on the receiving end of a shutdown during an election include those of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-internet-rights-trfn/100-hours-in-the-dark-how-an-election-internet-blackout-hit-poor-ugandans-idUSKBN29P1V8" title="">Uganda and</a> <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/belarusian-election-tainted-by-internet-shutdown-and-state-sponsored-violence/" title="">Belarus</a>.</p>



<p>An internet shutdown is the <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/internet-shutdowns-and-elections-handbook/" title="">intentional disruption of internet or electronic communications, rendering them inaccessible or effectively unusable, for a specific population or within a location, often to exert control over the flow of information</a>. Shutdowns can last for hours, days, or even weeks, and they often occur during politically sensitive periods, such as elections.&nbsp;The purpose of these shutdowns is often to control the narrative and limit public dissent. Sometimes they’re also used with the purported goal of preventing the spread of false information; however, it’s important to keep in mind who has the power to determine what information is ‘false’.</p>



<p>During a shutdown, citizens are unable to communicate with each other, access critical information (which negatively impacts their ability to make informed decisions), or hold their government to account. This leads to a significant decline in transparency, accountability, and ultimately the democratic process.</p>



<p>Internet shutdowns are a critical threat to internet freedom. International human rights law recognises the right to access information and freedom of expression as a fundamental human right, and <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/stories/2022/08/activists-internet-shutdowns-violate-human-rights" title="">governments that impose internet shutdowns during elections violate these rights.</a> However, some governments are permitted by national laws and regulations to impose internet shutdowns during elections, citing public safety and security concerns.</p>



 Resources for staying online during internet shutdowns&nbsp; 



<p>By promoting digital capacity and encouraging the use of alternative and secure communication channels, we can strengthen digital resilience and minimise the impact of internet shutdowns on democratic processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below are some resources and inspiration of work being done in these areas – with a reminder that developing strategies to respond to internet freedom threats should always be politically, socially and technically contextualised, timely, and, if possible, consulted through a local expert.</p>



 
 <a href="https://devex.shorthandstories.com/how-3-african-activists-are-combating-internet-shutdowns/index.html" title="">Activists in Ethiopia, Sudan and Nigeria are standing up against internet shutdowns</a> in their countries.&nbsp;
 
 In Ethiopia, the <a href="https://www.cardeth.org/" title="">Center for Advancement of Rights and Democracy</a> are attempting to insert digital literacy programs into the existing education curriculum.&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://www.beamreports.com/" title="">Beam Reports</a> in Sudan are doing so by organising workshops and advocacy campaigns.&nbsp; 



 At <a href="https://www.connecthubng.org/" title="">Connect Hub NG</a> in Nigeria, the team is similarly trying to combat shutdowns by building awareness around human rights, democracy, and freedom of expression.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 



 
 For guidance on digital tools, see this list of <a href="https://restofworld.org/2022/blackouts-five-ways-to-stay-online/" title="">five ways to stay online during government shutdowns</a> published by restofworld.org. The list recommends, among other things (keeping in mind that some of these tools are illegal in some countries, so make sure to check their legal status in your context beforehand):
 
 Using a&nbsp;trusted VPN provider to allow access to sites and platforms that may be blocked in your country (this should be set up in advance!).&nbsp; 



 A TOR Browser to protect your privacy.&nbsp; 



 Platforms that function via a local mesh network that allow users to send encrypted messages to people nearby via Bluetooth.&nbsp; 
 
 
 



 
 AccessNow has also shared recommendations around <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/ways-circumvent-internet-shutdown-democratic-republic-congo/" title="">browsing securely and using circumvention tools</a>. Extensions such as <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere" title="">HTTPS Everywhere</a> ensures that you access websites only via encrypted connections (if the website offers this – most reputable news sites should) and proxy tools such as Lantern, which reroute your requests through other computers, may help you browse more securely and privately.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Further key resources to learn more about internet shutdowns include:&nbsp;</p>

 AccessNow’s <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/2023-elections-and-internet-shutdowns-watch/" title="">Election Watch 2023</a>, which provides information on elections at risk of internet shutdowns in 2023.

 This year one of our main strategic pillars is to bundle our open-source technology stack into commercial products that are simple to adopt, easy to use, and create material business value for the companies in our ecosystem (and the energy transition at&nbsp;large).  GP4BTC Certification Platform   Green Proofs for Bitcoin is a first-of-its-kind leadership initiative to promote transparency and decarbonization in the bitcoin mining industry. In May we released the <a href="https://gp4btc.org/">GP4BTC registry and platform</a>, which is the first production offering built with the recently released <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions-green-proofs/">EW Green Proofs</a> solution.  <p>New features&nbsp;include:</p>  Bitcoin miners can now <a href="https://miner.gp4btc.org/login">apply for certification</a>,(read more about how the registry works&nbsp;here).  Institutions interested in working with sustainable bitcoin miners can now <a href="https://explorer.gp4btc.org/explorer">explore the certification data here</a> or learn more about potential use cases&nbsp;<a href="https://gp4btc.org/for-institutions/">here</a>.   Digital Spine Public&nbsp;Release   In July we released the <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/energywebdevhubgmbh1670375546257.ewf-data-exchange-client-gateway">Digital Spine Integration Client on Azure Marketplace</a>, in tandem with a public message broker. The Digital Spine is a reference implementation of our Data Exchange solution that helps electricity market participants communicate information about distributed energy resources at scale. Originally developed in support of <a href="https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/initiatives/der/2023/project-edge-der-data-hub-lessons-learnt-final-june-2023.pdf?la=en">Project EDGE</a>, the Digital Spine was previously made available as an <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-releases-digital-spine-toolkit-to-the-public-e65847d468dd">open-source toolkit</a> which required participating organizations to manually configure and deploy multiple components. The Digital Spine is primarily intended to streamline coordination among grid operators and electricity market participants, but any company working with DER or EV can potentially get value from the Digital Spine solution.  <p>A number of new features are now available:</p>  With this release, we are now offering a Digital Spine under a software-as-a-service model featuring a public message broker that companies can integrate with by installing a Client Gateway through an Azure subscription. Once integrated, companies can leverage three preconfigured data exchange applications or customize their own applications tailored to specific business needs.

<blockquote>
<p>DIF recently sat down with Pakorn Leesakul, the CEO and Founder of Finema, and his innovation Manager Nuttawut Kongsuwan, to learn more about their decentralized identity platform and how they have been impacting the Southeast Asia region. Finema has been driving adoption within Thai government agencies and through the development of a decentralized identity ecosystem including the Thailand Blockchain Services Infrastructure inspired by the EBSI, (European Blockchain Services Infrastructure) and the development of a standard for digital wallets in Thailand, based on the European digital wallet. Watch the entire interview at <a href="https://youtu.be/FJbl8_LSsGk?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://youtu.be/FJbl8_LSsGk</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>LIMARI: I'm also curious to hear more about your user adoption journey. What were some of the challenges that you confronted when you were getting your platform adopted by the government? Were there challenges with interoperability that you confronted, that you overcame? I would be interested to hear more about that.</p>
<p>PAKORN: I can share about some of our customers like the Electronic Transactions Development Agency (ETDA) under the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society of Thailand.  That’s a big pilot project called the ETDA SSI Project. We helped them build their whole infrastructure of SSI.  We came up with a use case for them on medical and educational certificates. We also worked with the Ministry of Commerce to help them issue their digital certificate attestation.</p>
<p>Another one is from (NBTC) National Broadcasting and Telecommunication Commission. That’s another client that we helped to create a platform to register and issue digital certificates for licensing.</p>
<p>LIMARI: How have you been able to integrate what you're doing with decentralized identity with the existing technology at the government agencies you’re working with?</p>
<p>PAKORN: It’s all about the discussion of verifiable credentials.  Educate them, that if you have any document on your system, if you're issuing it in the form of verifiable credentials you can be interoperable with other government departments. It’s not a PDF, it's a new generation of a file that you can interop with and you can verify between one another.</p>
<p>We focused on that when we approached the government agencies. I think we talked about verifiable credentials for almost six years, since we set up this company. We helped the Ministry of Digital economy to introduce the verifiable credential open standard in the Thai language. How to use this kind of standard, what is the use case, where it's beneficial, and then, a lot of people became excited about it and tried to implement verifiable credentials here in Thailand.</p>
<p>LIMARI: One thing I'm very curious about is also the discussion of decentralized identifiers, because I know this is a concept that can be a little bit more challenging for people to grasp who are not familiar with decentralized identity. Is that a discussion that you've also broached with people in the government layers about being able to get into maybe the details of decentralized identifiers?</p>
<p>NUTTAWUT: I think that's one of the reasons why we work closely with the main regulator in Thailand to issue standards. Once we had national standards, then it has created awareness in the public about the technology.</p>
<p>We also try to drive the ecosystem in Thailand. In the recent year we have seen a lot of interest of other organizations as compared to years ago. Six years ago we were pretty much the only organization in Thailand talking about this space. In the past one or two years we have seen multiple companies popping up and using similar technology.</p>
<p>LIMARI: Wow, that's amazing. So it sounds like it's really taking off.</p>
<p>PAKORN: We are very happy to see other people figure out the things that we share and then everyone tries to come up with an open standard. That’s what we’re really happy about.</p>
<p>LIMARI: That brings me to my final question, which is, what is the vision for Finema? Where do you see things going? How do you see Finema changing the way we're going to do things in the future?</p>
<p>PAKORN: I think here in the Southeast Asia region, it's not easy to sell a product about decentralized identity. They have to come up with the whole solution. You have to take care of the existing system they have, meaning you build a custom system for them, and then deliver your product inside of this. You can do that, or you can influence them to do something like that. After you have many departments use your product, we can influence them to make something interoperable between each other department. That's the strategy for the government in Thailand.</p>
<p>For me, my mission is not only for Thailand. We focus on the Southeast Asia region like Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, to copy some use cases that we implemented, and had success with in Thailand to approach local partners in these countries and let them bring this to their government departments. That’s the mission. Let’s think about if we can take something like the consular department here in Thailand and consular department in Singapore and we create a bilateral policy of using digital passports on a mobile phone instead of a physical passport. Then a Singaporean and Thai can fly over with their mobile phone.</p>
<p>That’s the vision of our company. We want to help government to transform any citizen service. It’s all about citizen service, because we have the strength in digital identity, how to onboard users, how to maintain the private key verification and authentication. In all the projects we involve ourselves in, it's all about citizen service.</p>
<p>NUTTAWUT: I’d like to add on that as well, so what Leesakul just mentioned is the company vision. I can add, the innovation team’s vision at Finema as well. So currently we’re working on a decentralized organization identity. We are developing a prototype for issuing.<br>
legal entity identity as a verifiable credentials, so that legal representatives of organizations can typically prove that they really represent the organization and get the authority from the person who, legally by that jurisdiction to give the power or the authority to the representative to represent that organization.</p>
<p>LIMARI: Thank you both of you for joining me today for this member spotlight. it's been really eye opening to learn more about Finema and I hope to intersect both of you again soon.</p>

<p>About the FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

<p>Steering Committee Elections - call for nominations<br>
The annual election of DIF Steering Committee members is approaching, with the deadline for nominations September 4.</p>
<p>The Steering Committee is an elected group of member representatives who lead DIF, set strategy, assure the quality of ratified work items and respond to the community’s needs. Elections occur each year to ensure a democratic process to lead and administer DIF, and to continually provide a diverse and inclusive mix of commitee members.</p>
<p>If you know someone who would be a good candidate, please submit their name to <a href="mailto:nominations@identity.foundation">nominations@identity.foundation</a> by Sept 4. Self-nominations are also fine!</p>
<p>The full election timetable is available on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/election2023/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF website </a>.</p>
<p>Korea SIG<br>
The Korea SIG met for the first time on 19th July in the city of Busan, designated a Blockchain Special Zone by the Korean Government.</p>
<p>The Kickoff event was held in conjunction with the Self-Sovereign Identity Technology Project, initiated in the first half of 2023 by the Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Technology (ICT).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Standardization committee members, professors, and industry officials gathered at the event. DIF was introduced, together with the specifications-compliant stacks being discussed at DIF, and the wider ecosystem DIF operates within.</p>
<p>The topic of a Legal Identity Issuance and Verification Framework for Decentralized Identifiers was introduced in preparation for further discussions at upcoming meetings, with a presentation on the topic from Professor Kim Hyun-il of Kongju University, generating considerable interest and questions.</p>
<p>In Korea, Decentralized Identity demonstration projects are ongoing every year, creating various application cases, but it is true that progress on technology standardization has been slow. Accordingly, DIF Korea SIG agreed to explore and further understand DIF's technology specifications and stacks through periodic meetings, contribute to the standardization of Decentralized Identity technology, and discover exemplary application cases to which DIF specifications will be applied already this year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The next meeting of the Korea SIG will take place on 14 September at Yongsan Army Hall, hosted by the Korea Institute of Information Security &amp; Cryptology, when DIF will be introduced at the Next Generation Authentication Research Group Workshop 2023</p>
<p>New DIF developer advocates<br>
DIF welcomes Mostafa Nagy and Pratap Mridha as Volunteer Developer Advocates. Mostafa helped to recruit a number of participants for the recent successful did:hack event and both advocates will help recruit participants for a series of upcoming hackathons.</p>

 <a href="https://identity.foundation/Hospitality-and-Travel-SIG/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Hospitality and Travel SIG</a> 
<p>The Hospitality &amp; Travel SIG is hard at work on a decentralized traveller profile and schema which we hope will attract broad interest and participation from the Hospitality &amp; Travel community.</p>
<p>Traveller information is today locked into narrow silos controlled by competing interests all of whom claim to own the customer. No effective data sharing arrangements exist between those parties, preventing traveller information from flowing with the traveller in transit.</p>
<p>While much of the interaction between travel and identity communities has to date been denominated by discussions around border crossing, credentials and trust, SSI offers equal opportunity for traveller experience improvement within the airport and downstream into transport, accommodation, and tourism. Collectively, we describe the targeted outcome as a seamless traveller journey.</p>
<p>Central to unlocking this opportunity is adoption of a common traveller profile and preferences.</p>
<p>The H&amp;T SIG is hoping to use the DIF collaborative process to allow the widest participation in the schema definition and creation.</p>
<p>*The Hospitality &amp; Travel SIG meets each Thursday 10 AM Eastern time for 1 hour</p>
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/SIG-IoT/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">📻 IoT SIG</a>

<p>Digital Identity unConference (DICE) Europe 2023</p>
<p>DIF members participated in three days of inspiration, collaboration and connection in Zurich last month as the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) format came to Europe for the first time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The event brought together innovative startups, large companies, and governments, who are building products and developing services using emerging digital identity technologies.</p>
<p>The pre-unConference day on 7th June featured presentations on both foundational and advanced Decentralized Identity topics. One of the highlights was a panel discussion in which government representatives from the UK, Finland, Bhutan, the USA, Austria and Switzerland compared notes on how each country is approaching the introduction of digital identity services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the next two days of the unConference attendees proposed, discussed and co-created valuable output on a wide range of topics including DNS and Decentralized Systems, Mapping non-technical problems, How to evaluate tech stacks for future ecosystems, Digital Ethics, Interop Profiles and Experiences for OIDC4VC, Verifiable Credentials for Education, Wallet Security, Trust Registries, Connecting SSI with the Supply Chain, Requirements for Organisational Wallets, Revocation Methods and the EIDAS 2.0 EU Digital Identity Wallet Architecture Reference Framework (ARF).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kaliya Young and Heidi Nobantu Saul, the two facilitators of IIW, collaborated with a local partner, Trust Square, and the Swiss Digital Identity and Data Sovereignty Association (DIDAS) to produce and host the event.</p>

<p>Identity Week Europe 2023</p>
<p></p>
<p>Several DIF members also participated in Identity Week Europe in Amsterdam last month.</p>
<p>The event was attended by many vendors and customers in fields such as biometrics and travel, counter document fraud, Know Your Customer (KYC) and border management.</p>
<p>DIF's senior director of communications, Damian Glover, participated in a panel discussion on Decentralized Identity with Marnix van den Bent from Rabobank, Raffael Knecht (Swisscom), Pedro Torres (Youverse) and Robert Garskamp (Id Next).</p>
<p>The session was well attended, signalling growing interest in Decentralized Identity within well-established identity-centric industries. The audience posed some interesting and challenging questions at the end of the panel discussion and it was great to engage with the wider identity and business community.</p>
<p>Guest blog</p>
<p>DIF has featured interviews and guest blogs from a range of members and community participants on our website in recent weeks.</p>

 14. DIAM Fort Knox: Safeguarding Your Digital Frontier — Unveiling the Impenetrable Security and Privacy&nbsp;Armor! Image by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freepik.com">Freepik</a> Introduction: <blockquote>In an era defined by digital interconnectedness, safeguarding security and privacy has become paramount. As we navigate the virtual landscapes of our lives, Decentralized Identity and Access Management (DIAM) emerges as a guiding light, transforming how we interact with our digital personas while elevating security and privacy to unprecedented heights.</blockquote><p>This comprehensive article will help us deep dive into DIAM’s multifaceted security and privacy features delves into the bedrock upon which the architecture is built, unraveling the intricate layers that redefine our digital experiences.</p> The Pillars of Security: Encryption and Decentralization <p>At the heart of DIAM’s fortress lie two foundational pillars: encryption and decentralization.</p> Encryption: Shielding the Citadel of Identity&nbsp;Data <p>Central to DIAM’s security architecture is the impregnable shield of encryption. By converting sensitive identity data into an indecipherable code, encryption stands guard, ensuring that confidential information remains veiled from prying eyes, whether in transit or at&nbsp;rest.</p><p>In the digital realm, data is a prized possession, and encryption emerges as the guardian that ensures its sanctity. The process of encryption involves converting plain text into a cipher text using complex algorithms. This encrypted data is nearly impossible to decipher without the corresponding decryption key. As a result, even if unauthorized entities gain access to the encrypted data, they cannot make sense of it without the necessary decryption mechanism.</p><p>For DIAM, encryption goes beyond a mere safeguard. It’s a fundamental philosophy that upholds the sanctity of individual identity attributes. Whether it’s your biometric data, personal identifiers, or financial credentials, encryption ensures that your information remains private and inaccessible to anyone without authorized access.</p> Decentralization: Shattering the Chains of Vulnerability <p>Traditional centralized systems house a single point of failure, rendering them vulnerable to breaches. DIAM’s revolutionary architecture shatters this vulnerability by decentralizing identity management across a network of nodes, significantly diminishing the potential impact of a security&nbsp;breach.</p><p>In centralized systems, all identity data is stored within a central repository. This centralized storage, while convenient, poses a significant risk. If a hacker gains access to this central repository, they can potentially compromise the entire system and access a vast amount of sensitive information. The decentralized approach embraced by DIAM disperses this data across multiple nodes, making it virtually impossible for any single point of entry to grant unauthorized access to the entirety of a user’s identity information.</p><p>Imagine a world where each node acts as a guardian of a fragment of your identity. No single node possesses a comprehensive picture of who you are; rather, they collectively safeguard the pieces of your identity puzzle. Even if one node is compromised, the intruder gains access to only a fraction of your identity, limiting the potential damage and minimizing the risk of a catastrophic breach.</p> Empowering Individuals through Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp;(SSI) <p>Empowerment takes center stage within DIAM’s design, epitomized by the concept of self-sovereign identity&nbsp;(SSI).</p> Selective Sharing: Orchestrating the Symphony of&nbsp;Privacy <p>In the realm of DIAM, users wield the baton of selective sharing, conducting a symphony of privacy. Through SSI, individuals can selectively disclose relevant identity attributes, cementing their control over the information they share and amplifying their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The traditional model of identity sharing follows a binary approach: you either share all or nothing. For instance, when you provide your identification to a service, you expose all your identity attributes, even if the service only requires a subset of them. This overexposure creates a privacy gap, leaving users vulnerable to unnecessary data collection and&nbsp;misuse.</p><p>SSI sweeps away this antiquated model, offering a new paradigm where users retain the sovereignty to reveal only what’s essential. Picture a scenario where you’re interacting with a service that requires your age verification. Instead of revealing your full birthdate, SSI empowers you to share only the fact that you’re above a certain age, without exposing the exact date. This level of selective sharing ensures that service providers receive the necessary information for their functions without accessing more than they&nbsp;need.</p> Elevating Trust through Zero-Knowledge Proofs&nbsp;(ZKPs) <p>DIAM’s arsenal is fortified by zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), a cryptographic masterpiece that authenticates identity attributes without compromising data privacy. This innovative approach ensures that trust and authentication can coexist without infringing on individual privacy.</p><p>Imagine a scenario where you need to prove your identity to access a service, but you’re hesitant to reveal all the details. Enter ZKPs, a cryptographic marvel that enables you to prove a statement’s validity without revealing the actual data behind it. This process operates like a magic trick, where you prove you possess specific information without actually divulging that information.</p><p>For instance, consider a situation where you want to prove you’re over 18 years old without disclosing your birthdate. ZKPs allow you to share a “proof” that verifies your age without revealing the specific birthdate. The verifier receives confirmation that your age meets the requirement without gaining access to unnecessary information.</p> Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Anchors of Digital&nbsp;Trust <p>Enter Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), cryptographic keys that serve as the anchors of trust within the DIAM framework. Immutable and verifiable, DIDs instill confidence in the digital realm, laying the groundwork for secure interactions.</p><p>In the digital landscape, trust is often hard to come by. The internet is replete with instances of identity theft, data breaches, and fraudulent activities. Establishing trust within this environment requires a revolutionary approach — one that transcends traditional methods.</p><p>DIDs emerge as the answer to this predicament. Think of them as the digital counterparts of a physical identification document. However, unlike physical documents that can be forged or duplicated, DIDs are unique, cryptographic representations that are nearly impossible to replicate.</p><p>Every individual, business, or entity in the DIAM ecosystem possesses a DID — a virtual passport, if you will. When someone presents a DID, it’s akin to presenting an unforgeable badge of authenticity. DIDs are linked to public keys, allowing anyone to verify their validity. This cryptographic link ensures that the presented DID corresponds to a legitimate entity, eliminating the possibility of identity&nbsp;fraud.</p> Fortifying the Gates with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) <p>In the age of DIAM, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) stands as a formidable guardian, fortifying access to the digital domain. By demanding multiple forms of verification, MFA creates an impervious shield against unauthorized entry.</p><p>We live in an era where the password’s effectiveness has waned. The sheer number of passwords we juggle across various platforms makes it challenging to maintain strong, unique passwords for each account. Hackers exploit this vulnerability, leveraging techniques like brute force attacks and phishing to breach accounts.</p><p>MFA revolutionizes this scenario by introducing an additional layer of defense. Instead of relying solely on passwords, MFA requires users to provide multiple proofs of identity. This could include something you know (like a password), something you have (like a smartphone or security token), and something you are (like biometric data).</p><p>Imagine you’re logging into an online portal. With MFA enabled, the system not only requires your password but also sends a verification code to your smartphone. Only after you enter the correct code can you access your account. Even if someone manages to obtain your password, they would still need your smartphone or security token to breach the&nbsp;account.</p> Blockchain: The Immutable Keystone of Data Integrity <p>DIAM’s architecture is bolstered by the unyielding foundation of blockchain technology. This immutable ledger guarantees data integrity, fortifying the veracity of identity information and transactions.</p><p>In a world plagued by data manipulation and falsification, blockchain emerges as the incorruptible sentinel. Unlike traditional databases susceptible to unauthorized alterations, blockchain records information in a series of interconnected blocks. Once information is recorded within a block, it’s virtually impossible to alter or erase. This immutability safeguards the authenticity of data, ensuring that identity attributes and transactions remain tamper-proof.</p><p>Imagine you’re interacting with a financial institution. Traditional systems require you to trust the institution’s database, which can be manipulated by those with access. With blockchain, your interactions are recorded in a transparent and unalterable ledger. This means that no party can alter the records, and all transactions are traceable and verifiable.</p> Access Control and Consent Mechanisms: Crafting a Symphony of&nbsp;Privacy <p>DIAM’s innovative canvas extends to access control and consent mechanisms, allowing individuals to orchestrate who can access their identity attributes and under what circumstances. This symphony of privacy enhances personal data ownership and&nbsp;control.</p><p>In the digital age, granting access to personal data is akin to providing the key to your digital kingdom. Unauthorized access can lead to identity theft, data breaches, and a host of privacy violations. Access control emerges as the sentinel at this gateway, dictating who can cross the threshold and under what conditions.</p><p>Imagine you’re sharing your identity information with a service provider. Access control mechanisms empower you to set specific rules for this interaction. You can dictate which attributes the service can access, the duration of access, and the purpose for which the data is being used. If the service provider breaches these rules, access is denied or revoked, safeguarding your privacy and maintaining control over your&nbsp;data.</p> Transparency through Auditable Transaction History <p>Every interaction within the DIAM ecosystem is etched into an auditable transaction history, fostering accountability and bolstering the reliability of the digital identity landscape.</p><p>In an age where accountability is a cornerstone of trust, the concept of an auditable transaction history emerges as a vital tenet. Every action taken within the DIAM framework is recorded in a transparent and tamper-proof ledger. Whether it’s the issuance of verifiable credentials, the sharing of identity attributes, or the verification of claims, each interaction is logged in this immutable record.</p><p>Imagine a scenario where you’re applying for a job and need to verify your professional qualifications. Within the DIAM framework, the verification process leaves an indelible trace. This trace can be audited by relevant parties, ensuring that the verification was conducted ethically and accurately. This transparency builds a foundation of trust and accountability, enhancing the integrity of the entire ecosystem.</p> Compliance: Navigating the Regulatory Currents <p>In an era marked by regulatory currents, DIAM emerges as a guiding beacon. Committed to upholding regulations like GDPR, DIAM ensures that identity data is handled ethically and responsibly, further nurturing the bedrock of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>The digital landscape is governed by a patchwork of regulations designed to protect individual privacy and data security. These regulations reflect society’s collective consciousness, emphasizing the need to uphold ethical standards even within the virtual&nbsp;realm.</p><p>For DIAM, compliance is not a mere obligation — it’s an affirmation of its commitment to user-centricity. Take the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as an example. This European regulation outlines strict rules for the collection, processing, and storage of personal data. DIAM’s architecture aligns seamlessly with GDPR principles, ensuring that user data is handled transparently, ethically, and in accordance with regulatory standards.</p> A Guardian’s Vigilance: Regular Audits and&nbsp;Updates <p>DIAM’s commitment to security is unwavering, evidenced by its regimen of regular security audits and updates. This proactive approach ensures that the fortress remains impregnable, ready to repel emerging&nbsp;threats.</p><p>In the realm of cybersecurity, vigilance is paramount. Threat landscapes evolve, vulnerabilities emerge, and new attack vectors surface. To maintain the highest level of security, DIAM adopts a proactive stance. Regular security audits are conducted, scrutinizing every facet of the framework for vulnerabilities.</p><p>Imagine DIAM as a digital guardian constantly patrolling the boundaries of its fortress. Security experts systematically examine the system’s architecture, codebase, and protocols, seeking any chink in the armor. If vulnerabilities are detected, immediate action is taken to rectify them, often in the form of security updates or&nbsp;patches.</p> Conclusion: <blockquote>As we traverse the intricate pathways of the digital realm, the torchbearers of security and privacy illuminate our way. Within this landscape, DIAM stands as a beacon, guiding us toward a future where security is paramount and privacy is sacrosanct. Through encryption, decentralization, SSI, ZKPs, DIDs, MFA, blockchain, access control, audit trails, compliance, and unwavering vigilance, DIAM crafts a legacy of fortified digital identities and a sanctuary of&nbsp;privacy.</blockquote><blockquote>In this journey, let us stride forth with confidence, for within the realm of DIAM, we find not just a bastion of security, but an embodiment of our unwavering commitment to a digital world where security and privacy reign&nbsp;supreme.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.know.cards/">Know</a> more about&nbsp;us!</blockquote>

 13. Your Digital Trust Vault — Unraveling the Wonders of Verifiable Credentials for a Trustworthy Future! Image by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freepik.com">Freepik</a> Introduction: <blockquote>In a world defined by digital interactions, trust serves as the cornerstone of relationships, both personal and professional. However, establishing trust in the digital realm has been an ongoing challenge, given the prevalence of data breaches and identity theft. Enter the concept of verifiable credentials, a technological breakthrough facilitated by Decentralized Identity and Access Management (DIAM).</blockquote><p>In this comprehensive guide, we delve into the very essence of verifiable credentials and explore how they are harnessed within the DIAM framework to revolutionize trust-building.</p> Verifiable Credentials Unveiled: A New Dawn of&nbsp;Trust <p>At its core, a verifiable credential represents a digital claim that an entity possesses certain attributes, qualifications, or certifications. Think of it as a digital equivalent of a driver’s license or a university degree. However, what sets verifiable credentials apart is their ability to be cryptographically secured, tamper-proof, and shareable in a selective manner. These credentials empower individuals to present trusted information without revealing unnecessary details.</p> DIAM’s Role: Fortifying Verifiable Credentials <p>Within the realm of DIAM, verifiable credentials become more than just digital representations; they evolve into trust anchors that shape the way individuals interact, verify, and share information.</p> The Power of Verifiable Credentials within&nbsp;DIAM <p>1. Immutable Integrity: Safeguarding Trust:<br>Verifiable credentials rely on cryptographic techniques to maintain their integrity. Each credential is cryptographically signed by the issuer, ensuring that any attempt to tamper with the information is detected. This tamper-proof nature establishes a new level of trust in the digital&nbsp;realm.</p><p>2. Selective Disclosure: Privacy Meets Transparency:<br>In a world grappling with data privacy concerns, DIAM-powered verifiable credentials offer a solution. Individuals can choose what attributes to share, allowing them to present only the necessary information for a specific context. This selective disclosure strikes a balance between transparency and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>3. Efficient Verification: Streamlining Trust Validation:<br>Verifiable credentials streamline the verification process. Verifiers, the parties seeking to validate the claims, can quickly and securely verify the authenticity of a credential without the need for intermediaries. This not only expedites transactions but also reduces reliance on centralized identity providers.</p> Navigating Verifiable Credentials within the DIAM Ecosystem <p>1. Issuance of Verifiable Credentials: Building Trust Anchors:<br>The journey of a verifiable credential begins with its issuance. Trusted entities, known as issuers, create these credentials and anchor trust in their cryptographic signatures. Whether it’s a university validating a diploma or a healthcare provider confirming vaccination, the issuer’s mark ensures authenticity.</p><p>2. Storage in the Digital Wallet: Your Identity Fortress:<br>Once issued, verifiable credentials find their home within the DIAM identity wallet. This wallet, securely stored on the user’s device, acts as a vault where credentials are under the user’s control. It grants individuals the power to manage and selectively share their verifiable credentials.</p><p>3. Presentation and Verification: Building Bridges of Trust:<br>When a claim needs verification, the user can present the corresponding verifiable credential. Verifiers can then use cryptographic proofs to validate the authenticity of the claim. This process ensures that only legitimate claims are accepted, enhancing the overall trust in digital interactions.</p> Verifiable Credentials in Action: Realizing a Trusted&nbsp;Future <p>1. Professional Identity: Elevating Credentials:<br>Verifiable credentials redefine professional identity. Imagine presenting a tamper-proof credential that showcases your qualifications, licenses, and memberships. These credentials empower professionals to engage confidently in various contexts, from job applications to cross-border work opportunities.</p><p>2. Seamless Access to Services: Redefining Convenience:<br>DIAM-enabled verifiable credentials simplify access to services. Whether it’s boarding a plane, checking into a hotel, or accessing a secure facility, these credentials streamline processes while ensuring data security and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>3. Government Services: Transforming Citizen Engagement:<br>Governments can harness verifiable credentials to modernize citizen services. From digital IDs that eliminate the need for physical cards to verified vaccination records for seamless travel, citizens experience efficient, secure, and privacy-respecting interactions.</p> Conclusion: <blockquote>Verifiable credentials, bolstered by our DIAM framework, have emerged as a beacon of trust in the digital landscape. Through cryptographic signatures, selective disclosure, and secure validation, these credentials redefine how trust is established and maintained. As verifiable credentials take center stage, a new era of secure, efficient, and privacy-respecting interactions dawns — one where trust is no longer a challenge but a fundamental element of the digital tapestry.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.know.cards/">Know</a> more about&nbsp;us!</blockquote>

<p>Phishing and other attacks usually have one goal: passwords. So the world could be a better place without passwords. There have already been several attempts to bury the passwords. All have failed – due to the complexity, the costs for hardware keys, for example, or the inconvenient use. The new approach with FIDO2 and Passkeys sounds more promising. By the way, FIDO stands for Fast Identity Online.</p>

<p>Spherity builds Decentralized Identity management solutions designed to power the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The company participates in standards-setting processes and interacts with developer, industry, and research communities to enable compliance and interoperability in increasingly complex technological and regulatory landscapes. Spherity is active in various industry segments, but currently has a focus on the pharma industry and works on circular economy topics.<br></p><p>We caught up with Dr Susanne Guth-Orlowski, Chief Innovation &amp; Solution Officer, Christiane Wirrig, Product Manager CARO, and Ricky Thiermann, Product Owner Digital Product Passports to learn about their work on Digital Product Passports in the EU, and promoting compliance with new pharmaceutical industry regulations in the US.<br></p><p>Why did you adopt a decentralized approach to implementing the EU Digital Product Passport, Susanne Guth-Orlowski? <br></p><p>The decision was taken by the European Commission (EC), not us. Currently manufacturers have to provide data such as product certifications for chemicals and automotive parts and energy labeling data for electronic products to central systems in order to comply with EU regulations (such as <a href="https://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/registered-substances?ref=blog.identity.foundation">REACH </a>and <a href="https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">EPREL</a>). <br></p><p>The EC knows how hard it is to set up and maintain these central systems and keep everybody happy. Supply chain actors in particular do not want to upload their data to centralized systems as they fear sharing business secrets and they have no control over their data, once it is uploaded.<br></p><p>The EC saw that a use case as big as Digital Product Passports across multiple product segments, with supply chain actors scattered around the world, is very complex. It is difficult to set up a single platform to manage it and to satisfy the needs of all supply chain actors concerning business confidentiality.<br></p><p>How is Decentralized Identity being integrated alongside existing systems and standards? <br></p><p>This is an area where we’re working directly with the EC’s policy officers, participating in standardization groups at Stand.ICT and CEN/CENELEC, as well as contributing to research projects such as <a href="https://thebatterypass.eu/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Battery Pass</a>, <a href="https://cirpassproject.eu/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">CIRPASS </a>and others. We’re bringing in decentralized concepts that enable the requirements to be met, incorporating W3C standards into the <a href="https://psqr.eu/publications-resources/all-about-dpp/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">EU Digital Product Passport</a> (DPP) specifications and designing and implementing Proof of Concepts (PoCs), such as our latest <a href="https://medium.com/@susi.guth/resolving-digital-product-passports-f08ac8f11b5a?ref=blog.identity.foundation">T-Shirt use case</a>. Textiles are one of the first regulated product segments, and therefore we are using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as a product identifier and resolver technology to reach the Digital Product Passport, and verifiable credentials for the product information. <br></p><p>What Decentralized Identity capabilities are you leveraging? <br></p><p>Information discovery is highly relevant in the DPP use case, and is fully solved by Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). Being able to locate a product’s DID and obtain all kinds of information from the DID document or service endpoint(s) enables you to meet so many use cases, from compliance certificates to pointing end customers to the product website. There’s so much flexibility.</p><p>Verifiability is another major driver. If you’re using the DPP to query a product’s carbon footprint, you need to ensure you’re looking at verified data. Products with a large footprint will be taxed more, creating an incentive for fraud. We need to ensure we can validate the data is accurate. <br></p><p>Verifiability has several important ingredients. <br></p><p>The first is cryptographic standards and protocols including signature schemes. <br></p><p>Then there’s trust verification, which is the ability to trace documents and data back to the supply chain’s root of trust (such as the digital signature of a competent authority). <br></p><p>Finally, there are semantics and calculations. It is critical to have standardized definitions (such as <a href="https://www.carbontrust.com/our-work-and-impact/guides-reports-and-tools/briefing-what-are-scope-3-emissions?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Scope 3 emissions</a>) and methods for calculating these values. <br></p><p>How are you handling product identification and data exchange? <br></p><p>For some products such as batteries, it makes sense to use Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) from Day One. The end product’s digital passport will include the identifiers of all materials and components, which in turn will have their own passports. This makes it possible to validate the product’s carbon footprint by summing the footprints of the pre-products and checking that it tallies. <br></p><p>For other categories such as textiles, existing systems in retail are built around the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) and Global Location Number (GLN). For those systems it will take some time until they can handle Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as globally unique identifiers. &nbsp;<br></p><p>With regards to data exchange, we are looking at using different methods depending on the requirements. For example, a Verifiable Presentation request might be handled via OpenID Connect for Verifiable Presentations (OIDC4VP) for human identity use cases. On the other hand, we see the need for ongoing trusted connections between the supply chain actors associated with a finished product, so we are planning to use <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DID Communications (DIDComm)</a> for data exchange within the supply chain. <br></p><p>Turning to <a href="https://caro.vc/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">CARO</a>, Spherity’s credentialing service for &nbsp;US Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) compliance, what value does Decentralized Identity bring in this use case, Christiane Wirrig? <br></p><p>The way the pharma industry is set up in the US requires a decentralized approach. The FDA (US Food &amp; Drug Administration) doesn’t work like the EMA (European Medicines Agency). In the US, you have all these product repos sitting with the manufacturers themselves. Moreover, there’s no central register of participants in the supply chain.<br></p><p>From November 2023, supply chain actors, such as wholesalers and dispensers, will be required to verify the authenticity of the pharmaceutical product they are trading in a new way. Those opting for an automated solution can use a Verification Router Service (VRS) provider for the product verification. However there’s still an unanswered question, namely how do the pharma companies know who’s enquiring and responding?<br></p><p>This is where CARO comes in. The solution enables participants in the pharmaceutical supply chain to obtain a Verifiable Credential confirming their Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) status. In combination with VRS, this enables them to prove their legitimacy and complete an electronic product enquiry in real time.<br></p><p>The US pharmaceutical supply chain sounds quite fragmented. How is this being coordinated? <br></p><p>In a decentralized ecosystem, it’s essential to provide a safe environment for information exchange as well as shared standards as pointed out earlier by Susanne. We saw the need for a neutral body to play the role of ecosystem coordinator. That’s why we are one of the founding sponsors of the <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI)</a>. <br></p><p>The OCI is where the industry comes together to agree the format of the ATP credentials, who is authorized to issue, hold and verify these and other considerations such as how to handle credential revocation. <br></p><p>Creating OCI was a stroke of genius because it lowers the barriers to entry for everyone. Service providers understand the required benchmarks and service users can expect interoperability and a degree of consistency across providers.<br></p><p>What Decentralized Identity capabilities are you leveraging in the CARO solution, Ricky Thiermann? <br></p><p>OCI has standardized on W3C Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials. CARO allocates Ethereum-based did:ethr as unique identifiers to its users. <br></p><p>Veramo is one of the core libraries we use and to which we contribute. We also use DIF Credential Manifest, and some of the cryptographic signature pieces being standardized in DIF. <br></p><p>Hyperledger Aries RFCs and DIDComm are very important for CARO, and will be the standard for Presentation Issuance and Exchange between OCI-compliant wallet providers. Aside from the technical benefits, it’s also about ecosystem efficiency and lowering the market entry barriers. At the moment the service provider ecosystem is small and we still have the capacity for active collaboration to align on shared standards and processes to avoid homebrewed niche approaches. Imagine if even just a couple of issuers and a handful of wallets had to integrate with each other’s provider-specific hook-ups in every possible combination!<br></p><p>Using DIDComm, there’s no need for issuers and verifiers to integrate. Once you’ve put the work in upfront to comply with the specification, you’re interoperable by design. This allows for an open market to emerge, and will ultimately enable the solution to scale. <br></p><p>What value does DIF bring? <br></p><p>We need the standards to be out there and recognized in order to implement a solution around Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) successfully. For that, we need a home that further develops Decentralized Identity technologies and specifications in a highly professional way, and closes any gaps that emerge around industry needs. For us, that’s what DIF brings to the table. <br><br><br></p>

 12. DIAM: Unleash the Ultimate Secure Channel — Revolutionizing Peer-to-Peer Communication with Unbreakable Privacy! Image by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freepik.com">Freepik</a> Introduction: <blockquote>In an era marked by ubiquitous connectivity, the exchange of information transcends physical boundaries. Yet, this increased connectivity also gives rise to heightened concerns regarding privacy and security. Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, enabled by cutting-edge technologies such as Decentralized Identity and Access Management (DIAM), offers a transformative solution.</blockquote><p>This comprehensive guide delves deep into the intricacies of peer-to-peer communication and how DIAM serves as a formidable safeguard for secure, private, and authenticated interactions.</p> Understanding P2P Communication: A Paradigm&nbsp;Shift <p>Peer-to-peer communication marks a departure from the conventional client-server model, where interactions are routed through central intermediaries. In contrast, P2P communication enables direct, encrypted exchanges between parties, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This paradigm shift promises enhanced security, reduced vulnerability to cyber threats, and greater control over data&nbsp;sharing.</p> The DIAM Advantage: Elevating P2P Communication <p>Leveraging the power of DIAM, peer-to-peer communication undergoes a transformation, merging cryptographic security with user-centric principles. The DIAM framework reinforces P2P communication with layers of authentication, trust, and selective disclosure, establishing an ecosystem where individuals and entities can communicate with confidence.</p> Empowering Features of DIAM-Enabled P2P Communication <p>1. Encrypted Conversations: Fortifying Privacy:<br>DIAM employs advanced encryption techniques to shield conversations from prying eyes. Information exchanged between peers is encrypted end-to-end, rendering it inaccessible to unauthorized entities. This cryptographic shield ensures that only intended recipients have access to the shared&nbsp;content.</p><p>2. Identity Verification: Cementing Trust:<br>In a digital landscape where anonymity can breed mistrust, DIAM’s identity verification mechanisms redefine interactions. Peers can verify each other’s identities with cryptographic proofs, minimizing the risk of impersonation or fraudulent engagements.</p><p>3. Selective Disclosure: Sharing with Precision:<br>DIAM-enabled P2P communication empowers users with selective disclosure capabilities. Individuals can choose what information to share, tailoring their responses to the specific context. This not only safeguards sensitive data but also preserves a user’s control over their digital footprint.</p> Navigating Secure P2P Communication with&nbsp;DIAM <p>1. Initiating Conversations: Establishing Trust:<br>Engaging in a secure P2P conversation begins with identity verification. DIAM facilitates this by enabling peers to validate each other’s identities through cryptographic proofs. This step sets the foundation for a trustworthy exchange of information.</p><p>2. Encrypted Messaging: Shields Up, Privacy Intact:<br>Once identities are verified, DIAM ensures that messages are encrypted end-to-end. This cryptographic shield safeguards the content from unauthorized access, ensuring that only the intended recipients can decrypt and comprehend the exchanged information.</p><p>3. Multi-Factor Authentication: Strengthening Security:<br>To elevate security further, DIAM integrates multi-factor authentication (MFA). This additional layer of protection ensures that only authorized individuals with the necessary credentials can engage in P2P communication.</p> Real-World Applications of Secure P2P Communication <p>1. Business Collaborations: Trustworthy Transactions:<br>Enterprises can harness DIAM-enabled P2P communication to foster secure collaborations. Business negotiations, sensitive data sharing, and contractual discussions can occur without intermediaries, preserving confidentiality and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>2. Government-Citizen Interactions: Enhanced Engagement:<br>Governments can streamline citizen interactions with the heightened security of DIAM. From applying for licenses to accessing public services, citizens engage in secure and privacy-focused exchanges with government entities.</p><p>3. Personal Conversations: Elevating Privacy:<br>In an age where privacy is paramount, DIAM-powered P2P communication offers individuals the means to converse privately and securely. Personal exchanges, medical consultations, and confidential discussions remain shielded from unauthorized access.</p> Conclusion: <blockquote>As technology paves the way for an increasingly interconnected world, safeguarding the sanctity of communication becomes imperative. Peer-to-peer communication, enriched by the tenets of DIAM, transcends traditional barriers. With encrypted conversations, verified identities, and selective disclosure, individuals and entities alike can embrace a future where secure, private, and authenticated communication is the norm. As we navigate this digital age, DIAM-led P2P communication stands as a testament to the power of technology harnessed for the greater good, offering a secure haven where communication thrives in the embrace of privacy and&nbsp;trust.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.know.cards/">Know</a> more about&nbsp;us!</blockquote>

 Part 1: Digital Twins in a Surveillance Economy <p>This article is the first in a two-part series. It aims to clarify the benefits and limitations of digital twinning technologies and why recent developments in AI continue to raise global concern regarding the inevitable socio-ethical dangers of digital twinning conscious entities–––a virtual model of "digital self"–––and our quest to protect free will and human agency in the current surveillance economy, where humans hope to leverage insights from digital twins for material objects and processes rather than being beholden to a virtual representation of "self" in the digital space.</p><p>Waking up to an unwelcome reality: Before the Internet of Things (IoT) brought the term "wearables" into fashion, people have been extending our physical and cognitive abilities for generations through supportive inventions such as glasses, watches, walking sticks, hearing devices, and wheelchairs, or used mind-altering consumables to extend our natural capabilities beyond previously known limits to assist us in our daily routines and activities, influencing the imagination of "self" as we evolve as an intelligent species.</p><p>In light of recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), creating a virtual representation of ourselves for self-determined interactions in the digital world is a societal issue as much as a technological one, pointing directly to our species' sense of being. Therefore, delineating between "what is human" and "what is a machine" lies at the heart of technological innovation in determining how humans engage with digital systems, with "human consciousness" a dominant factor in that delineation.</p>







  






















  <blockquote>
    ““It is a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what they long for&nbsp;and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not fancy.””
  </blockquote>
  — — Thucydides (c.455-c.400 BC)




  <p>The philosophical concept of "Sovereign Reason" states that all humans possess the inherent right to have supreme or ultimate power of a self-determined cause, explanation, or justification for an action or event, acting as the sole instrument of "<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/free-will">free will</a>."</p><p>Analogous to marine life struggling to survive beyond aquatic ecosystems, engaging in a digital world remains overwhelming to humans. Our ability to adapt to and comprehend the ramifications of deploying next-generation technologies is still embryonic. At Human Colossus, implementing any disruptive technology without fully understanding its influence on societal well-being is unfathomable. When AI is intrusive enough to result in coining the term "Digital Twin," societal vigilance is necessary for any technology deployed under that banner. Humans are conscious entities, not material objects. Developing a digital twin of a conscious entity is dangerous. An accurate virtual representation of "self" must never be in the form of a digital twin.</p><p>Refactoring AI innovation could narrow the current analogue/digital divide, providing a more realistic digital representation of real-world interactions with other entities in a virtual environment.</p> Why the notion of a digital twin of a human being continues to raise global concern <p>A "digital twin" is a virtual model designed to accurately reflect a physical object or process. They are created by collecting enough data to model an object in the digital space with enough accuracy to serve a specific purpose.</p> The benefits of digital twinning material objects and processes <p>A simple example of a "digital twin" is a digital image captured by a digital camera viewed on the camera's image display. The captured image is the digital counterpart of a negative in a roll of film, a photographic image stored as a single frame captured by an analogue camera. By creating a digital representation of the analogue photo, the photographer can enhance the image through digital image processing, a set of underlying algorithms to process existing data about the digital photograph mathematically. The image processing algorithms may include low-level methods, noise removal, and colour enhancement. AI algorithms provide data actioning recipes to accurately process data packets to represent material objects and processes in the digital domain. You can experience the digital counterpart of a material object or process remotely.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most well-known companies using digital twins is Tesla, which creates digital simulations for every car it sells. Each vehicle has sensors and sends data to the cloud, and Tesla then uses AI to analyse their performance.</p>














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>Organisations use digital twins for compound use cases. By collecting enough data about a physical object or process, digital twinning enables their corresponding representation in a digital environment, where the supporting data is ingested into virtual simulations to observe performance, check for physical limitations (e.g., crash tests), stress test critical components, and verify behavioural response in varying conditions. These simulations significantly reduce operational costs. After all, how often can an aviation company such as The Boeing Company, for example, afford to crash its Boeing 737s to test their handling in harsh weather conditions. Mechanical engineers can repeatedly crash a plane in a simulation without significant financial burdens or consequences. So, digital twins are disruptive to product lifecycle management (PLM) processes in most industries; they enable product owners to access an enormous amount of real-time data collected using sensors to ingest factual information about a physical object (the "product") or behavioural information about how that object responds to changes in environmental circumstance through its digital counterpart in simulation.</p><p>Previous technological limitations confined product owners to only being able to test early-stage life cycles in a lab before releasing a product to market. However, due to the ever-decreasing costs of digital sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution has scaled digital twinning technologies, with digital twins now able to provide algorithmic reasoning for performance monitoring at every stage of a product life cycle, with data insights about consumer products accessible in real-time. Product owners can create digital twins for a product and create digital twins for an instance of a product. That level of granularity makes past impossibilities in trend analysis now possible, with product insights more accessible across the board.</p><p>So, how can we use digital twins? Well, digital twins can run practical simulations to study multiple real-time processes, such as predicting failure, improving response times, and informing customers about maintenance information to prolong a product's functioning life. With simple controlling mechanisms built into the devices, we can monitor responses, inform product customers, and remotely solve issues before they happen, enabling automated self-healing functionality. Digital twins can fully control a device without unnecessarily burdening the consumer, allowing a more seamless user experience.</p><p>Digital twins allow product owners to monitor granular processes across an entire product lifecycle, including at all stages of research and development (R&amp;D), design, manufacturing, service and maintenance, and daily operation.</p> The socio-ethical dangers of digital twinning conscious entities <p>For the most part, developing digital twins for material objects ("products") and processes can significantly benefit organisations wishing to streamline product development and optimise costs, and their customers, who benefit from greater product efficiency. However, if virtual representations of objects can profoundly benefit society, can we produce a digital twin for a conscious entity, such as an intelligent animal or human? A virtual model of "digital self."[1]</p><p>In truth, through corporate surveillance, many companies already have enough data about customer buying behaviour and other traceable patterns to develop virtual representations of consumers (without consent) to benefit the organisation in any digital environments they control, an unwelcome economic reality and, in light of digitally twinning civilians, a sobering thought.</p><p>For large swathes of the global population, humans are well connected as an ever-evolving species reliant on technology. However, through our various online interactions with service providers and product owners, organisations can leverage personal data gathered through their collection processes to benefit their companies. With the sheer amount of personal data collected, by integrating a small amount of consumer behavioural data, companies can run powerful algorithms to process sensitive information about us, directly profiling our deepest desires, no matter how private the information, including our watching, buying, and eating preferences, and this epidemic doesn't stop with probabilistic predictions, as simulated models can coercively tell us what to do without relying on the intricacies of human consciousness.</p><p>Digital twinning conscious entities would inevitably leave human reasoning to machines and the ultimate loss of our God-given right to "<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/free-will">free will</a>."</p><p>But Free Will will prevail.</p><p>Luckily, there is an inherent flaw in the logic of profiling using big data. Although relatively simple to explain, exposing this weakness brings awareness of the risks we face in the current digital economy and gives rise to an alternative solution to digitally twinning civilians.</p><p>Even with tech companies collecting an enormous amount of data about us, there remains an unquenchable thirst for them to collect more and more personal data to fuel their algorithms. This frenzy for data is easy to explain.</p><p>So, imagine a scenario where you purchase an appliance, for example. Shortly after buying the product, you'll often receive targeted ads from a different store for a similar product at a lower price. So why do digital companies rely on this type of ad campaign? Despite having access to massive data sets and analytical tooling to generate "digital twins," the business model is flawed. If common sense prevailed, declaring that you've already bought the desired appliance should deter any marketing algorithms from sending you targeted ads for similar products after the purchase event. So, why do companies engage in this type of business model? The simple answer is “cost."&nbsp;</p><p>Correctly identifying helpful information in a database to enable a simple decision process is a complex and largely unsolved problem. With more and more data required for companies to maintain a competitive edge, marketing analytics resort to brute-force correlations, pressing for a tsunami of data that fuels the digital economy, leading to the societal consequences we see today.</p><p>At Human Colossus, we think differently and advocate for a Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) where the integrity of data objects and processes and the authenticity of recorded events in associated key event logs provide the cryptographic assurance and data quality necessary for accurate analytics and improved business insights (see <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/accuratedata1">Blog post from November 2022</a>). A way of visualising this difference is via the Economics of Correlators.&nbsp;</p> The Economics of Correlators <p>In September 2021, the Human Colossus Foundation hosted a webinar titled "Core public utility technologies for a <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/invitation-core-public-utility-technologies-for-a-next-generation-internet">Next Generation Internet</a>." In the context of systems with weak privacy, Dr. Sam Smith presented the concept of the economics of correlators (see Vimeo <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/invitation-core-public-utility-technologies-for-a-next-generation-internet">recording @19m20sec</a>). The correlator is an entity that tries to gather data about you and correlate it with specific behaviour to create a prediction. This correlation is the basis of digital transformation in the advertising industry. In less than a generation, the sector's primary focus evolved from "know-your-customer" to "know-your-data-and-correlate," with collected consumer data enabling companies to propose their "best" offers and products to consumers based on company-controlled algorithms. Unfortunately, the previous example of the purchased appliance demonstrates that this only works as intended occasionally due to the limitations of simple economics where accurate correlation has a cost.</p><p>Gathering real-time data with proper context and accuracy is an ongoing data curation problem for humans today, with technological and economic barriers. This article will ignore governance barriers (e.g., privacy), focusing purely on technology and economics. Today's network architecture may allow sufficient data flow for simple IoT devices or physical objects by measuring a few standardised data points. However, it cannot cope with the nuanced complexity of interactions involving humans in an even more complex ecosystem. Monitoring all that at scale is a challenging technological task with a cost. Therefore the economic constraints of extracting real-time data outweigh the benefits payoff for those companies.</p><p>The economics of the correlators describes a relationship between correlation costs and value from which we can identify the domains in which there is an extractable value in correlation. As we can see in the diagram below, the correlation costs need to be lower than the correlation value, so extracting the value from the data would be profitable. By understanding the dynamics of these curves, one can control the economics around the data, influencing the behaviour of the data market.</p>

  <p>The example we provided above indicates that commercially, the most valuable pieces of information are near "Now." So the services can adapt to your current needs. But, of course, it only helps if you get a proposition of the product you have yet to buy. But as we can see on the diagram, the cost of extraction grows significantly as soon as it approaches "Now." It, therefore, reduces the domain of value extraction from correlated data. As a result, this correlation cost translates into a limit of accuracy for the algorithms attempting to predict individual behaviour.</p> The limits of correlation <p>This limit is good news when considered from a higher societal perspective. Collecting data in real-time is particularly challenging and, in many cases, leads to total surveillance of a person and their community. Whether we like it or not, information is generated by us directly or captured through our interactions on social platforms, online buying behaviour, and via our friends and family through shared personal photos on social media, a personal phone number shared through a specific instant messaging app, etc. Based on collected data, companies can make robust predictions, such as inferring a social profile of a not yet-born child based on the information their mother posts on a social platform, the country in which they are living, areas, parents' background, and more.</p><p>The success of the current digital economy is primarily due to the advertising model mentioned above, with systemic flaws for everyone to observe, where user-generated data aggregated by organisations fuel machine learning algorithms that model behavioural patterns to predict our desires and shape our opinions, enslaving consumers to corporate-driven incentives, a surveillance system.</p><p>In Shoshana Zuboffin's book "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism," the author describes "Capitalism" as "a profit-making incentive that arose as advertising companies, led by Google's AdWords, saw the possibilities of using personal data to target consumers more precisely.", an observation indicating that the current label "Digital Twins" is a misnomer. Perhaps "Digital Puppets" would be more appropriate! However, as digital twins are a reality, what can be done to reverse the trend of our current surveillance society? The wake-up call highlighted above shows that, although de facto, digitally twinning human beings is a bad idea due to known privacy risks.</p> Actualising digital twins in the natural world <p>So, the digital twinning of material objects and processes can provide enough data for humans to understand how to react to and control devices to operate in a particular manner. However, if we were to apply the same principle to living beings, we would have to digitalise the differentiating factors that separate humans from machines, the essential characteristics of living beings, namely, the concepts of "Free Will" and "Sovereign Reason" introduced at the beginning of this article. In addition, we can also highlight the economic dimension, where the human instinct for financial success is the modern equivalent of survival.</p><p>Like any software tool, digital twins can assist both good and bad practices. However, influenced and determined by the community, "Good" and "Bad" are contextual. The trickier question is how to ensure that developing the right digital twinning technology will maximise the "good" and minimise the "bad." In particular, can we provide access to real-time data that makes economic sense without losing control or compromising privacy?&nbsp;</p><p>And our answer is, "Yes, we can!" (and we are working on it.)</p> Step 1: Acting on the economy of correlators as the agent of change <p>As we learned in the "The Economics of Correlators" section, we can manipulate how data reaches the market, influencing the costs of the correlation or the correlation value so that value extraction can happen in desired conditions through de-correlation techniques developed for privacy preservation purposes, for example. The cost of value extraction for near real-time data correlation is high for market actors but quasi-nil for the data source. Therefore, we could change assumptions about who in that situation is a correlator and drive the correlation costs to the minimum for the system. If the user collects the data themselves, costs drop dramatically since they already have devices able to collect data in real-time, with the user deciding what data they generate, record, and share. We not only make it affordable because of the scale (i.e., just one individual instead of millions), but we also change the control over the data.</p><p>Sharing for an explicit purpose will provide a high incentive for adoption and consent.</p><p>This topic becomes critically important in healthcare, where patient data is of high value to many stakeholders. Suppose a patient or an organisation trusted by the patient has complete control of shared data for a specific purpose, not inadvertently used for something else. This scenario is a game changer, facilitating dramatically improved access to purposeful data.</p> Step 2: Restore Sovereignty <p>Individuals must operate the proper tools in a secure environment to transform the end user into the correlator. With this prerequisite, they will perform such activities without worrying about being surveilled or losing sensitive information. For this to happen, individuals must regain confidence in their digital interactions.</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation continues to shape the requirements of a SELF Actioning System (SAS), a core technological piece for human-centric digital engagement in a new Dynamic Data Economy (DDE), in HCF’s SELF Actioning System (SAS) Working Group.</p><p>That concludes Part 1 of this two-part series. Part 2 will describe how a SELF actioning system provides a superior solution for embodying "digital self" to facilitate human-led data actions in the digital realm, where sovereign reason and consciousness reside with the system's owner (a "human"), not with a virtual representation of that person (a "machine").</p><p>Stay tuned!</p>

 Trace Labs and BSI develop new solution for cross-border food transfers as UK adopts Electronic Trade Documents Bill <p>United Kingdom adopts the Electronic Trade Documents Bill as Trace Labs, core developers of OriginTrail open-source technology, and British Standards Institution (BSI), the business improvement and standards company established under Royal Charter, release a new solution developed for cross-border food transfers.</p><p>In an effort to streamline international trade and enhance efficiency, the United Kingdom has taken a significant step forward by adopting the Electronic Trade Documents Bill. On July 20, 2023, the <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3344">Electronic Trade Documents Bill (ETDB)</a> received Royal Assent, and is officially an act of law (now the Electronic Trade Documents Act), promising to transform the way international trade is conducted electronically. This pivotal legislation seeks to digitize trade documents, eliminating cumbersome paperwork and facilitating seamless cross-border transactions.</p><p>The Electronic Trade Documents Bill marks a milestone in the modernization of global trade practices. With this landmark legislation, the UK aims to harness the power of technology to revolutionize the way trade documents are processed, ensuring quicker turnaround times, reduced costs, and improved security.</p><p>This groundbreaking act holds immense potential for businesses engaged in international trade, as it replaces traditional paper-based documentation with secure electronic trade documents. Additionally, it enables the use of digital signatures and advanced encryption technology, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of trade documents.</p><p>Parallelly, in response to the growing demands of cross-border food transfers, Trace Labs, core developers of OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG for short), in collaboration with BSI, the business improvement and standards company established under Royal Charter, are pioneering an innovative solution that promises to revolutionize the industry. This new solution has been developed utilizing cutting-edge technology and industry expertise to address the complexities associated with international food transfers.</p><p>The solution is a direct result of the two-year “Trusted Bytes” project launched as part of The Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund’s “Manufacturing Made Smarter Challenge”. To support the smoother flow of food products into and out of the UK, BSI used its broad experience to develop a standards-based operating model for the Trusted Bytes Data Trust framework. The model is designed to make it much easier for all parties to source and confirm information about products and ensure compliance, streamlining the processes for border-crossing.</p><p>As part of the project, BSI helped to build the framework by combining the benefits of traditional standards with emerging supply chain standards and innovative technologies such as OriginTrail DKG — the open source software developed by Trace Labs. This approach demonstrates how standards can be leveraged to support future technologies that promote data sharing, enabling users to verify information provenance across industry stakeholders, government agencies, and regulators for seamless and secure international trade. Prior work on data trust led by the University of Lincoln supported this activity.</p><p>BSI and Trace Labs also developed the advanced Trusted Trader framework, which showcases the future of trade compliance, assurance, and risk assessment, building on the globally recognized Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) scheme. The framework transforms supply chain data into discoverable, verifiable, and AI-ready Knowledge Assets. This enables UK customs to assess risk levels associated with incoming shipments in real-time from the departure right up until the arrival on UK soil, with the potential to make customs processes more focused and efficient. Technology enabled by SecureSystem Gmbh and Contained Technologies supported BSI and Trace Labs in showcasing this Trusted Trader demonstrator.</p><p>The project also focused on enabling a trusted data exchange to connect the supply chain with central government and other critical partners, enhancing cross border facilitation, compliance, and security. The framework, developed within Trusted Bytes, is reusable and can be deployed by government agencies globally to help infuse trust and transparency into their cross-border processes.</p><p>Jurij Skornik, Trace Labs’ General Manager: “With the King signing off on the Electronic Trade Documents Bill (ETDB), businesses can now utilize electronic trade documents, laying a robust foundation for improving trade sustainability, increasing trade value, and enabling AI-powered trade solutions. The criteria set out in the bill are perfectly aligned with the logic of OriginTrail Knowledge Assets that can provide discoverability, ownership, and verifiability to any trade document — all backed by blockchain.</p><p>Supported by Innovate UK, Trace Labs already worked with BSI, SecureSystem, and other partners on a solution to facilitate international trade in the UK, using OriginTrail Knowledge Assets and the same principles as set out in the bill. This solution turns paper trade documents such as CMR and Bill of Lading into Knowledge Assets on OriginTrail DKG, giving them ownership (transferability) and verifiability.

 By Adrian Doerk  <p></p><p>Decentralized Identity is a rapidly evolving field. Its potential to transform the way digital identities are managed and protected has not gone unnoticed. The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) has been at the vanguard of this movement, working tirelessly to develop the technologies and standards necessary for its realisation. In Europe, the eIDAS regulation has set the stage for the creation of a European Digital Identity Wallet, a secure means for citizens to access online services throughout the EU. DIF and its members have been busy supporting this initiative through a range of activities, such as participating in large-scale pilots and developing concepts and prototypes for hardware binding and wallet attestation. In this blog post, we will explore the role of DIF in advancing the European Digital Identity Wallet and examine the various activities undertaken by its members in support of this crucial project.<br></p><p>Introduction to the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</p><p>DIF is a collaborative effort that brings together organisations, developers, and researchers from around the world. It seeks to promote the development and adoption of Decentralized Identity technologies, which have the potential to revolutionise the way we manage our digital selves. By working together, the members of DIF aim to create a future in which individuals have greater control over their personal data and are able to interact with others in a more secure and privacy-preserving manner.<br></p><p>In order to achieve this vision, DIF promotes the development of open standards and protocols. It also provides tools and resources that enable developers to build Decentralized Identity solutions. Since its inception, DIF has attracted a large and diverse membership, which includes both established industry players and innovative startups. This collaborative ecosystem is crucial to driving the adoption of Decentralized Identity technologies and ensuring their long-term success.<br></p><p>Understanding eIDAS, the European Digital Identity Wallet and the Large Scale Pilots</p><p>eIDAS, which stands for Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services, is an EU regulation that was first introduced in 2014. Its purpose is to establish a single framework for the secure and seamless provision of digital services across the European Union. One of the key components of eIDAS is the European Digital Identity Wallet, a software application enabling citizens and organisations the management of verifiable identity information and seamless access to online services.<br></p><p>The legislative process of the revised eIDAS regulation is accompanied by four large-scale pilots, which are being carried out across the EU and aim to provide policy makers with the necessary real world experience and feedback. These pilots serve as testbeds for the development and evaluation of the wallet's features, as well as its integration with online services. The results of these pilots will help inform the development of the wallet and ensure that it meets the needs of European citizens and businesses.<br></p><p>The Role of DIF and Its Members' Activities in Supporting the success of the European Digital Identity Wallet</p><p>DIF members have been actively involved in the design and development of &nbsp;identity solutions and digital identity wallets for years already. Many of them are now participating in the large-scale pilots, where they help to test and refine the wallet's features and functionality. <br></p><p>DIF members have been addressing key challenges in developing a secure European Digital Identity Wallet, including hardware binding and wallet attestation. They have been working on concepts and prototypes to securely bind the wallet to the user's device using techniques like secure hardware modules and cryptographic methods. Wallet attestation involves using cryptographic proofs to verify the authenticity and integrity of the wallet's contents, ensuring trustworthiness for service providers and relying parties. The secure wallet working group spearheaded by German Bundesdruckerei and wallet provider Lissi <a href="https://idunion.org/2023/05/09/konzepte-fuer-wallet-sicherheit-in-ssi/?lang=en&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">demonstrated a working prototype</a> within the scope of IDunion. This work could lay the foundation for the European Digital Identity Wallet and its users.<br></p><p>The Crucial Role of Relationships When Building Trust: A Case for DIDComm</p><p>Trust is a fundamental aspect of any identity system, and Decentralized Identity is no exception. In the context of the European Digital Identity Wallet, the ability to establish and maintain persistent relationships between individuals and organisations is essential for ensuring its success. DIDComm, a protocol developed by DIF, offers a potential solution to this challenge and could be an interesting addition to European Digital Identity Wallets.<br></p><p>DIDComm enables secure and privacy-preserving communication between parties that have been identified using decentralized identifiers (DIDs). This allows individuals and organisations to establish trusted relationships with persistent communication channels, which are persistent and enable organisations to push information to end-users instead of requiring a pull. DIDComm's use of end-to-end encryption and other security features ensures that these relationships remain secure and private, which is vital for preserving user trust and fostering a healthy digital identity ecosystem.<br></p><p>In addition to its potential role in the European Digital Identity Wallet, DIDComm has broad applicability across a range of industries and use cases. Its ability to facilitate secure and privacy-preserving communication makes it an ideal foundation for the development of a wide variety of Decentralized Identity solutions for citizens and organisations alike. <br></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The European Digital Identity Wallet represents an ambitious and transformative initiative that aims to provide a secure and seamless digital identity solution for citizens across the EU. The Decentralized Identity Foundation and its members have played an important role in supporting the development of digital identity wallets in general, contributing their expertise and resources to the advancement of this crucial global development. From participating in large-scale pilots to developing cutting-edge concepts and prototypes for hardware binding and wallet attestation, DIF members have demonstrated their commitment to the success of the European Digital Identity Wallet and the broader Decentralized Identity ecosystem. As we continue to explore the potential of Decentralized Identity technologies, the collaborations and innovations fostered by organisations like DIF will be essential for shaping a more secure and privacy-preserving future for digital identity management.<br><br></p><p>About the Author:</p><p>Adrian Doerk focuses on providing user-centric digital identity services with digital wallets, which ensure privacy and empowerment of the individual.

<p>ZKLadder is a venture studio building products that connect physical and digital environments. They empower creators and brands of all sizes to connect authentic physical objects with digital records, like NFT’s, using a self-sovereign design.</p><p>ZKLadder’s authenticity platform uses an innovative physical labeling solution based on unclonable three-dimensional identifiers and optical scanning technology. A unique 3D tag is adhered to a physical object and can be scanned and validated with the camera on any mobile device.</p><p>“The Ceramic data storage protocol is ideal for extending our core platform guarantees of self-sovereignty, open and permissionless access to data, and censorship resistance,” the ZKLadder team says. </p><blockquote>“Our labels last for decades, so it’s imperative that we leverage a sustainable protocol. You have to believe in the design, but moreover the people and their ability to evolve and thrive in Web3. This is why we selected Ceramic.”</blockquote> The Story of ZKLadder <p>ZKLadder is a seasoned Web3 engineering group that collaborates with mechanical engineering PHD’s and professors at Stony Brook University with deep experience and patented technology in consumer goods authentication. They have married a unique optical scanning and authentication technology with a scalable, trustless Web3 platform.</p><p>ZKLadder utilized ComposeDB on Ceramic to develop a solution that connects patented, tamper-resistant physical labels to NFT’s on any EVM compatible blockchain.</p><p>The tech offers a low cost way to prove the source authenticity of a physical thing using the camera on any phone. While it has wide applicability across many verticals such as merchandise, fashion and cannabis—ZKLadder has gone to market leveraging the real demand that exists today in generative art and photography markets.</p><p>Several well-known and successful artists have used the platform to create authentic physical prints linked to their NFT art collections. This system allows these creators to offer their collectors authentic, one-of-one prints of the NFT tokens they own.</p> The Challenge Before Ceramic <p>When initially designing their stack, one of the key decisions revolved around where and how to store the data necessary for ZKLadder apps, and consequently an end user’s mobile device to authenticate and identify a physical label through a scan.</p><p>Every physical label that gets linked to an NFT through the ZKLadder platform is accompanied by a digital &nbsp;'Certificate of Authenticity' (COA) that encodes the unique label data, describes the underlying physical object, and identifies its NFT counterpart.</p><p>“We could have chosen to store these COA’s in a centralized database for maximal control and convenience, but doing that would ultimately lead us down the path of a centralized (and fragmented) technology provider, and would severely limit our ability to pursue our roadmap of decentralization (open sourcing authentication stack, white labeling mobile app, establishing a DAO, etc.),” said the ZKLadder team.</p><p>Another alternative would have been to pursue an on-chain data storage strategy, which would ensure maximal data availability, but with their goal of eventually certifying hundreds and thousands of physical items across many verticals—it quickly became apparent that this would be cost prohibitive even on a Layer 2 or sidechain. Other challenges with on-chain storage included difficulty in updating the shape of data once it is deployed, and limits in indexing and query functionality.</p><p>“With Ceramic, and specifically ComposeDB, we found a solution that was flexible enough to store many types of data records (through straightforward model creation), and could do it at scale and at lower cost, without sacrificing on our goal of building an open and composable data set,” the ZKLadder team said.</p> Why ZKLadder Chose Ceramic &amp; ComposeDB <p>The ecosystem for application-scale decentralized data storage is in its early stages, according to the ZKLadder team.</p><p>“One major concern with many of Ceramic’s competitors was that they would not be production-ready for some time, with an even greater gap to reaching the kind of battle-tested performance guarantees that developers rely on,” they said.</p><blockquote>What excited us the most about Ceramic, besides all of the useful functionality being built on ComposeDB, was the maturity of the network, with many products and platforms appearing to utilize it in production and an active forum where problems and questions are addressed on a continuous basis.</blockquote><p>Seeing many builder groups utilizing Ceramic made ZKLadder’s team feel secure in following a trodden path. They also understand the power of network effects, and strongly believe that Ceramic will continue to grow and coalesce energy. </p><p>By joining the pool of apps building on ComposeDB, the team is opting into a world where collaborating with other builder groups is possible without having to worry about significant development overhead.</p> How ZKLadder Built With ComposeDB on Ceramic <p>ZKLadder relies on ComposeDB today, in production, to store a data set of 'Certificates of Authenticity' that their application uses to authenticate each physical label, and identify the underlying physical artwork and NFT that it is connected to.</p><p>To power this functionality, they primarily rely on two models:</p>  <a href="https://s3.xyz/streams/stream/kjzl6hvfrbw6ca5y7upkmpt2poqi4zpyt1x4jvjs2jdqzgblzh8go4urodcp4fu?network=MAINNET&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Label Model</a> - Stores data necessary for the authentication of each <a href="https://docs.iterati.art/core-concepts/inimitable-physical-labels?ref=blog.ceramic.network">unique physical label</a>, primarily the 'imageData' field that encodes each label’s unique combination of microbead colors and positions  <a href="https://s3.xyz/streams/stream/kjzl6hvfrbw6c7n1wzu7mx4xmcundh1r7t3sgsupkb5i10n0ykergeeavfc4wno?network=MAINNET&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Certificate Model</a> - Stores data necessary to link a label to an NFT, including the contract address and token ID, along with optional descriptions of the underlying physical object  <p>A typical interaction from an end user’s point of view (authenticating an item) would look like this:</p><p>An example of this flow in action can be found <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsWQ1KNt-BE/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p><p>“Through our art focused POC platform, called Iterati, we have certified over 500 physical artworks from several artists active on <a href="https://www.artblocks.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Artblocks</a>, <a href="https://www.brightmoments.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Bright Moments</a>, and <a href="https://www.fxhash.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">FXHash</a>, and distributed them to hundreds of collectors and enthusiasts, all using ComposeDB behind the scenes,” the team says.</p><p>At the moment, ZKLadder is using ComposeDB simply as a data storage solution in order to create a more resilient and censorship-resistant platform, but they are extremely excited about their longer-term roadmap of decentralizing the toolkit, allowing anyone, anywhere to tag and certify any form of physical object and own the COA itself as is possible with Ceramic’s DID-based authentication scheme.</p><p>“We envision a world where hundreds of creators, brands, and builder groups are able to, in a self-sovereign way, attest to the authenticity of any object, and for a wide variety of applications to have the ability to validate this claim of authenticity and then determine if it came from a trustworthy DID,” the team says.</p> Get in Touch <p>Generative artists and photographers looking to transform their digital art into something unique, authentic and physical can check out their platform here: <a href="https://iterati.art/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">https://iterati.art</a></p><p>Or if you're just curious about the tech and want to learn more feel free to reach out to their team here: <a href="mailto:chris.tiu@zkladder.com">chris.tiu@zkladder.com</a></p>

		<p>Used by more than five hundred institutions around the globe, the CAUDIT Higher Education Reference Models (HERM) are a standard set of business and data architectures relevant to higher education. Institutions can use these resources as a touchstone to increase the value and efficiency of their operations and as a tool to engage key stakeholders. The first version of the HERM models was launched in 2016 and has since evolved after a collaboration between the Council of Australasian University Directors of Information Technology (CAUDIT), UCISA, EDUCAUSE, and European University Information Systems (EUNIS), which adopted and endorsed the global standard in 2021.</p>
<p>One of the HERM models, the Business Capability Model (BCM), is a comprehensive framework for planning and managing adaptive business capabilities in a highly dynamic world. Institutions can use this resource as a reference for business stakeholders, enterprise architects, and technology strategists to engage in informed discussions regarding business effectiveness, needs, and challenges. More specifically, the BCM serves as an anchor for assessing perspectives such as strategic importance, maturity, business operational pain points, capital investment, and organizational structure.</p>
<p>Creating a Common Language<br>
Along with using enterprise storytelling to engage effectively with stakeholders, referencing the HERM models allows institutions to foster a holistic understanding of their organization and gain valuable insight into how they can guide operational and strategic planning. This closer look helps stakeholders to invest in the capabilities that will deliver the most important business outcomes and connect these business objectives to the information and technology necessary to support them. “In the past, organizations didn’t have a common language that identified the capabilities that were required to manageably achieve their business outcomes,” explains Dan Miller, Associate Vice President, EdgeMarket. “Oftentimes, we would have to speak in the language of vendors, which apart from a few standard terms, was vastly different. Now, the promise of a business capabilities model out of the HERM provides a well-developed taxonomy and lexicon that institutions can use as a roadmap to help align their business needs and IT strategies and architectures.”</p>
<p>Adopting these models also supports the exchange of architectural knowledge and best practices throughout the higher education community. “As more members of the consortium map themselves to this framework, we create a common language within the community,” continues Miller. “This agreed upon body of terms and definitions helps accelerate our understanding of member needs, enhance the ability of each institution to prioritize their investments and support interoperability and collaboration between member organizations.”</p>
<p>Adopting the BCM<br>
Seeing the value of the BCM and how these practices could help member institutions succeed in managing their business capabilities, Edge is currently working on adopting this model and will help members of the consortium to understand its uses and benefits. Chris Markham, Edge’s Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer, added, “We encourage institutions to explore the BCM and we will be offering educational opportunities to learn more about applying these standards to create a customized roadmap. Edge plans to explore new and extended services and use this model to plan procurements and categorize and evaluate our solutions and vendors in EdgeMarket. I believe the sky’s the limit with what we can accomplish by creating a common language within the higher education community. Much like institutions are cataloging and managing their curriculums to support business goals and serve the needs of their students and faculty, the BCM can empower organizations to apply the same approach to business management. By using the BCM as a tool, institutions can more accurately identify the overarching needs of their organization and better strategize IT solutions that will bring their short- and long-term goals to fruition.”</p>

		<p>A leader in STEM education, research, and economic development, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) recently implemented a plan to upgrade their high performance computing (HPC) resources on campus. As part of this initiative, NJIT partnered with Databank to build this HPC environment at their data center in Piscataway, N.J. Driven by their continued growth in research initiatives, this new addition aims to improve the performance of NJIT’s research computing environment and capabilities. To deploy this HPC environment and have the capacity to utilize this resource, NJIT needed significant bandwidth, both in the number of circuits, the amount of bandwidth per circuit, and the ability for those services to be available one hundred percent of the time.</p>
<p>To fulfill this need for redundant services, NJIT looked to long-time partner, Edge, to provide an exceptional connectivity experience through their optical fiber network, EdgeNet. In the past, Edge has provided external services to NJIT, including connectivity to the Internet, peering infrastructure, and cloud services platform. With this recent expansion, Edge is helping operate internal network resources that the University depends on by building and operating an optical infrastructure that sits inside EdgeNet.</p>

		<p>Tapping into expertise and experience<br>
When first exploring the implementation of this new HPC cluster, NJIT knew these resources would require high bandwidth and highly available services to connect back to the main campus. At first, the University considered investing in the optical hardware, but discovered the operational expenses for the fiber leases, the ongoing hardware support, and staff augmentation and training to build and manage this kind of environment could be challenging and expensive. Plus, multiple circuits needed to be built and maintained over these two geographically diverse fiber paths, in addition to having team members monitor the service, troubleshoot issues, and dispatch the correct resources to restore services in the event of an outage.</p>
<p>With these requirements and responsibilities being native to Edge, NJIT could tap into the knowledge, resources, and support of the consortium and meet the needs of this new HPC environment without having to make their own capital investment in the hardware infrastructure. Working with Edge, NJIT was able to achieve the bandwidth they needed today, while also receiving an economically scalable platform for the future. Plus, by counting on Edge’s experienced network team who are well versed in operating these types of networks across the region, NJIT reduced their need to hire additional staff and train them on these new technologies and hardware platforms.</p>
<p>Meeting current and future bandwidth needs<br>
The majority of Edge’s core infrastructure is a shared service for all member institutions to utilize. For this project, NJIT had specific requirements for the fiber and hardware that would be deployed to support these services. By dedicating the platform to NJIT, the University will have the room to grow and can add bandwidth circuits to the platform without incurring additional expenses. Most importantly, since the service is exclusively dedicated to NJIT and the specific application, they will not have to worry about other members’ activities or common disruptions that can be seen on the consortium network. As one of just three R1 universities in New Jersey, adding these new HPC resources will help NJIT continue to pursue national and international recognition in research and expand their influence within the innovation ecosystem.</p>

		<p>For many years, Edge has partnered with member institutions to help them develop technology strategies and find solutions that will assist in advancing their missions. As the wave of digital transformation continued to grow and new opportunities arrived, organizations were tasked with finding ways to keep pace in a rapidly changing world. Unfortunately, without the right information or expertise, many institutions have faced challenges in developing a strategic and cost-effective plan that will allow them to digitally evolve. “Oftentimes, institutions may be facing a lack of communication between technology systems or a lack of visibility into both business processes and data,” says Christopher R. Markham, Executive Vice President &amp; Chief Revenue Officer, Edge. They may also have uncertainty around their spend in technology; are their technology investments best matched for their institution’s goals, size, and capabilities? Edge can help reveal valuable insight into their current technology ecosystem and assess digital transformation readiness, along with ensuring that an organization can optimize their return on investment as they continue to grow their technology program.”</p>
<p>Designed to provide a 360-degree view, the Enterprise 360 (E360) Assessment is a comprehensive review of all things technology, where the EdgePro team examines an institution’s current-state technology program and digital footprint and helps pinpoint where they can optimize technology investments in software, equipment, and staff. “The ‘E’ in E360 means everything, so Edge will look at an organization’s IT strategy, operations, governance, economic approach, data, cyber infrastructure, cybersecurity capacity, and their entire technology stack,” explains Markham. “We also spend two days onsite to meet with stakeholders and team members to gain a deeper understanding of the technology program. After the assessment is completed, Edge will provide a detailed report of the areas within the current technology and cyber infrastructure to focus on immediately and then a road map for digital transformation going forward.”</p>
<p>Conducting a Holistic Assessment<br>
The E360 Assessment begins with an investigation of the vision of the institution and the current information technology and enterprise architecture that is in place to support these goals. “Edge will look at all of the key information technology disciplines; what we call reference disciplines,” explains Markham. “This includes groups like applications, cybersecurity, educational technologies, and service management. We then look at the vision of the whole group and how they’re being informed by the enterprise architecture. We investigate the technologies and business processes that gather requirements from the overall institutional groups and look for opportunities and solutions that could improve these processes.”</p>
<p>“Next, we determine what a migration plan might look like, an IT governance model, and how we would implement a governance group,” continues Markham. “We also want to determine how an organization can establish a permanent change management function once this governance group is implemented—allowing the institution to continue to grow and change as their needs evolve.”</p>
<p>As part of the E360 Assessment, Edge will also explore educational technologies and the pedagogical framework that are in place to support the overall technology strategy. “We look at the current instructional design and methodologies and conduct a detailed analysis of existing cyber infrastructure, including wireless connectivity and cloud migration strategy,” shares Markham. “Our chief information officer will conduct a cybersecurity assessment to examine the NSIT framework, as well as the Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS). This integrity assessment of an organization’s routing looks at the kind of controls and best practices that are in place to reduce routing threats.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>Cybersecurity Program Assessment</p>
<p>Included in the E360 Assessment is a cybersecurity program assessment conducted by Edge’s Virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) to evaluate the maturity of the organization’s security program, understand their current risk exposure, and identify ways they can reduce the risk of a data breach.</p>
<p>An organization will receive tailored, actionable recommendations to:<br>
Identify gaps&nbsp; •&nbsp; Improve overall security posture&nbsp; •&nbsp; Reduce risk&nbsp; •&nbsp; Mitigate the impact of security incidents</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Providing Actionable Items<br>
Throughout the six- to eight-week process, the E360 is a blended model of onsite visits and virtual meetings to connect with all functional areas of the college or university. Upon completion of the assessment, along with a final report outlining its findings, an institution will also receive a review of their business process models and the technology solutions and services that aim to support them. “In addition to an executive summary that evaluates all the domains, we provide a customized three-year roadmap for digital transformation,” says Markham. “Edge will also outline ways to measure the return on investment along the digital transformation journey. We show you how to measure if there is an increase in efficiency and productivity of labor units. For example, improving the time it takes to send files or data, or increasing uptime and reducing downtime of systems. The assessment also provides ways to improve workflow and reduce the cost of operation.

 8. Smart Contracts Unleashed: Unraveling the Magic of DIAM’s Digital Agreements for a Smarter&nbsp;Future! Image by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freepik.com">Freepik</a> Introduction <blockquote>In the digital era, where autonomy and security are paramount, traditional methods of contract execution fall short of the mark. Enter the realm of smart contracts, an ingenious innovation that’s reshaping the landscape of business interactions and transactions.</blockquote><p>In this comprehensive guide, we embark on a journey to decode the concept of smart contracts and delve into their profound importance within the realm of Decentralized Identity and Access Management (DIAM).</p> Understanding Smart Contracts: A Glimpse into the&nbsp;Future <p>At its core, a smart contract is a self-executing agreement that’s coded onto a blockchain. Unlike traditional contracts that require intermediaries and manual enforcement, smart contracts automatically execute and enforce terms as predefined conditions are met. This revolutionary technology operates on the principle of “if-then” logic, ensuring that agreements are executed without the need for intermediaries.</p> The Role of Smart Contracts in&nbsp;DIAM <p>Smart contracts shine particularly bright in the domain of DIAM. Let’s explore why they’re a game-changer:</p><p>1. Enhanced Security:<br>Traditional identity and access management systems often involve a central authority, introducing vulnerabilities. Smart contracts, on the other hand, operate on a decentralized blockchain, making them inherently more secure. Every action and transaction is cryptographically secured and immutable, minimizing the risk of tampering or unauthorized access.</p><p>2. Immutable Identity Attributes:<br>Smart contracts enable the storage of identity attributes on the blockchain in a tamper-proof manner. This ensures that your personal information, qualifications, and credentials remain unaltered and credible. With the power of blockchain, you’re in control of your identity like never&nbsp;before.</p><p>3. Transparent Identity Verification:<br>The transparency of blockchain underpins the verification of identity claims. Organizations can verify identity attributes without divulging sensitive information. This selective disclosure enhances privacy while building trust between&nbsp;parties.</p><p>4. Streamlined Credential Verification:<br>Smart contracts streamline the verification of credentials. Instead of relying on manual checks, third-party verifications, or lengthy paperwork, the blockchain-enabled process accelerates verification, reducing delays and enhancing efficiency.</p><p>5. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):<br>Smart contracts embody the principles of SSI, where individuals have full ownership and control over their identities. With your identity attributes stored on the blockchain, you determine what to share and with whom, granting you ultimate autonomy.</p> Embracing the Power of Smart Contracts in&nbsp;DIAM <p>1. Transparent Verification:<br>Imagine a world where your academic credentials, professional certifications, and personal information are verifiable at a glance. Smart contracts enable this transparency, allowing swift and trustworthy verification.</p><p>2. Self-Executing Consent:<br>With smart contracts, you can define the terms of consent for sharing identity attributes. These conditions are executed automatically, ensuring that data is shared only as per your predetermined preferences.</p><p>3. Automated Access Management:<br>Smart contracts revolutionize access management. They can automatically grant or revoke access based on predefined rules, reducing administrative burden and enhancing security.</p><p>4. Strengthened Trust:<br>Smart contracts foster trust in transactions and interactions. As identity claims are verified in a transparent and tamper-proof manner, parties can engage with confidence.</p> Conclusion: <blockquote>As we traverse the landscape of DIAM, smart contracts emerge as the bridge between innovation and security. They infuse transparency, security, and automation into identity and access management, fostering a new era of control and trust. In a world where autonomy and privacy are prized, smart contracts redefine the rules, empowering you to take charge of your digital identity like never&nbsp;before.</blockquote><p>Ready to embrace the power of smart contracts in DIAM? Step into a future where transactions and interactions are secure, transparent, and efficient — all powered by the ingenuity of smart contracts.</p><blockquote><a href="http://www.know.cards/">Know</a> more about&nbsp;us!</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://us3r.co/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">US3R Network</a> is a revolutionary development platform and dApps ecosystem that empowers developers to build with composable data using Ceramic. It offers an integrated suite of toolkits including <a href="https://u3.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">US3R dApps Profile</a>, <a href="https://s3.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">US3R Data Explorer</a> and <a href="https://console.s3.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">US3R dApps Developer Console</a>—enabling developers to harness the power of Ceramic's dynamic and composable data layer for decentralized storage. By leveraging Ceramic, US3R Network enables the easy creation of applications with interoperable and composable data that lives on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).</p> The Story of US3R Network <p>The current state of the web is centralized and controlled by a few large companies. These companies have a monopoly on our data and our identities. They can use our data to track us, target us with ads, and even sell our data to third parties. The current state of the web is not interoperable because user data remains in silos, we’re unable to share our data and interact with each other across different platforms.</p><p>US3R leverages the network effect, a principle that the team says is often exploited by applications such as Google and Facebook through user accounts or logins. These Web2 applications harness the network effect to attract users and extract value from their interactions.</p><p>However, unlike these traditional models, US3R Network incorporates Web3 protocols, which offer users more control by virtue of their accounts being keypairs that the users themselves control. Despite the added control, Web3 protocols also necessitate a different infrastructure to support UI/UX at the protocol layer. This allows users to interact with the protocol via a universal third-party client, removing the reliance on the official dApps. The US3R Network fulfills this need for offchain data, taking inspiration from tools like Metamask and Etherscan.</p><p>US3R Network created U3, a platform-less utility tool designed specifically for managing self-sovereign data and applications. This opens up a new avenue of possibilities, allowing users to gain control over their data. Additionally, US3R Network offers S3, a development platform that enables developers to build dApps utilizing self-sovereign data. This combined suite of tools and platforms makes US3R Network an innovative solution for users and developers alike to gain control of their data and identities.</p><p>US3R Network is built on three core components:</p>  U3 is a decentralized identity wallet that allows users to store their data and credentials on the blockchain. U3 is interoperable with other blockchains, so users can take their data with them wherever they go. U3 is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the EIP-4337 standard for decentralized identities.  S3 is a decentralized data layer that makes it easy to share and manage data across different applications. S3 is built on Ceramic, a scalable and secure data storage platform.  3R is a decentralized social layer that allows users to connect with friends and colleagues across different social networks. 3R is built on ActivityPub, an open protocol for federated social networking. ActivityPub allows users to own their data and control how it is shared.  <p>US3R Network is still under development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the web. By giving users control of their data and identities, US3R Network can make the web more interoperable, and user-centric.</p> How US3R Network Built With Ceramic <p>“The scope of Web3 was primarily focused on DeFi, with little room for non-financial applications,” the US3R team says. “It was a limiting factor, hindering 99% of non-financial use cases from being developed. Ceramic, however, brings about a paradigm shift, enabling the development of applications that extend beyond finance.”</p><p>Before adopting Ceramic, US3R S3 faced the challenge of supporting interactive dApps with dynamic and structured data. Traditional blockchains and storage solutions like IPFS, Arweave, and BNB GreedField were either too slow or lacked support for structured and dynamic data. Recognizing the need for a more powerful data infrastructure, US3R Network sought a solution that would enable them to build decentralized applications without sacrificing interoperability.</p><p>The decision to partner with Ceramic was driven by the recognition of Ceramic's innovative approach to data storage and its strong alignment with US3R Network's goals, the team says. Ceramic's ability to support mutable data and composable data stood out as a game-changer for US3R Network's development ecosystem. By leveraging Ceramic's technology and toolkits, US3R Network could offer developers the flexibility and capabilities required to build purely decentralized and interoperable dApps.</p><p>Integrating Ceramic into their development platform and ecosystem S3, US3R Network unlocked a new realm of possibilities. The seamless integration of S3 Data Explorer, and S3 Developer Console empowered developers to interact with mutable data and leverage composable data structures. These features provided developers with the necessary tools to efficiently build interactive dApps with dynamic and structured data.</p><p>S3 Data Explorer is crucial for the interoperability and composability of decentralized data on Ceramic because it provides a way to understand the structure and semantics of data. This is essential for building applications that can use data from different sources and combine it in new ways. More specifically, S3 Data Explorer can be used to:</p><p>Discover data. Data and data model explorers can be used to discover data that is available on the Ceramic network. This can be helpful for developers who are looking for data to use in their applications.</p><p>Understand the structure of data. Data and data model explorers can be used to understand the structure of data. This can be helpful for developers who want to know how to use data in their applications.</p><p>Learn about the semantics of data. Data and data model explorers can be used to learn about the semantics of data. This can be helpful for developers who want to know what data means.</p><p>S3 Developer Console is another important building block created by US3R. A visual developer Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a game-changer when it comes to improving the developer experience. With the ability to visualize data models, developers can comprehend and manipulate data structures more intuitively, enhancing their understanding and productivity. An embedded GraphQL query playground offers an interactive platform to readily test and debug existing models, simplifying the development process. These combined features facilitate the creation of applications built on decentralized data.</p><p>By enabling a seamless and efficient developmental process, a visual IDE significantly encourages the growth of a dApp ecosystem, where users have full control over their data. This control not only fosters trust in the digital landscape but also opens up opportunities for innovative applications that respect user autonomy and privacy.</p> The Results <p>Integrating with Ceramic yields significant results for US3R Network. Here are two key success metrics that demonstrate the impact of Ceramic on their development ecosystem:</p> Increased Development Efficiency <p>Before Ceramic, developers within the US3R Network ecosystem faced challenges when working with dynamic and structured data. The integration of Ceramic's technology simplified the development process and improved efficiency. Developers are able to leverage Ceramic's data model marketplace, IDE for editing and deploying data models, and powerful querying capabilities, resulting in a substantial reduction in development time and effort. The streamlined workflow and comprehensive toolkits provided by Ceramic empower developers to focus on building innovative dApps.</p> Enhanced Interoperability <p>Interoperability is a critical aspect of decentralized applications, allowing users and applications to seamlessly interact and share data across different platforms. With Ceramic as a foundational layer, US3R Network achieves enhanced interoperability within its ecosystem. By leveraging Ceramic's dynamic and composable data layer, developers are able to create applications that seamlessly communicate and share data with other applications and protocols.

<p>We are delighted to announce the joint publication of “<a href="https://openid.net/GAIN-in-2023">GAIN in 2023</a>” which is a collaboration between&nbsp; six organizations who continue to pursue the vision of interoperable high trust identity networks, as articulated in the “<a href="https://gainforum.org/GAINWhitePaper.pdf">GAIN Digital Trust</a>” paper, published in 2021 by 156 independent identity industry experts and stakeholders.</p>
<p>The paper explores all the ways in which the GAIN (Global Assured Identity Network) vision remains relevant in today’s fast-moving landscape – as well as the ways in which technology heightens the stakes. It then reviews the major areas of progress in the proofs-of-concept that are related to the GAIN collaboration:</p>
 
 The cross-border transfer of data that the GAIN Proof of Concept Community Group has achieved: they tested data and trust management protocols, including a demonstration that a government, a bank network and a mobile network can all share identity data across three separate countries.&nbsp; 
 The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation has also made meaningful progress on developing high-trust organizational identities and addressing use cases beyond financial services.&nbsp; 
 The Open Identity Exchange is architecting how trust can be exchanged across countries at the policy-level, and is working diligently through the mapping of trust frameworks in numerous jurisdictions within the Interoperability Working Group. 
 
<p><br>In addition to the OIDF, GLEIF and OIX contributions, we are also delighted to benefit from the thought leadership of the International Institute of Finance, the Cloud Signature Consortium, the Secure Identity Alliance. Together we have over 50 companies and numerous individuals helping to realize the GAIN vision.</p>
<p>We will share more on the final outcomes and recommendations at events throughout 2023-24 and look forward to further collaboration with the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more about the technical work of GAIN or to sign the Participation Agreement to join the GAIN POC Community Group, click <a href="https://openid.net/cg/gain-poc/">here</a>. To learn more about trust framework mapping, join the Open Identity Exchange Interoperability Working Group <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/workgroups?action=view&amp;Workgroup=884">here</a>.&nbsp; Other non-profits are welcome to join the initiative by contacting <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a> for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate. Find out more at<a href="http://www.openid.net/"> openid.net</a>.</p>

 <br>By Jan Lindquist, Christoph L. Fabianek and Sebastian Haas<br> <p></p><p>Introduction</p><p>In the era of digital transformation, data has become the lifeblood of businesses, especially in the realm of supply chain management. The ability to share and exchange data seamlessly across different organisations and systems is crucial for operational efficiency, cost reduction, and customer satisfaction. This is where data agreements come into play. Data agreements are essentially contracts that define the terms and conditions for data sharing between different entities from a source to a third-party. They set the usage policies for data access, ensuring that all parties involved adhere to the agreed-upon rules and regulations.<br></p><p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) has established a task force referred to as the "<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/data-agreement?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Data Agreement</a>". This group is actively developing a specification that delineates the structure of data agreements. DIF's data agreements are rooted in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles, and incorporate the recording of consent notices. However, as this post will expound, such an arrangement can be effectively applied across a wide array of supply chain management domains, including but not limited to agriculture, energy, and transportation.</p><p>Domain Specific Data Agreements</p><p>To facilitate data sharing in a more structured and well defined way a vocabulary or ontology is needed. To achieve this a Domain Specific Data Agreements (D2A) is used. Such agreements allow organisations to communicate through an intermediary the allowed usage policies for data access within a specific domain. The intermediary has then all the information to match and validate the usage policy in order to create a Domain Specific Data Disclosure Agreement (D3A).<br></p><p>The following diagram shows a parallel example between domain-specific data agreements and privacy based data agreements. A further explanation of privacy based data agreements can be found in this “<a href="https://igrant.io/papers/iGrant.io_DataExchangeAgreements_v2.2.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Data Exchange Agreements</a>” white paper from iGrant.io.</p><p>Agreement VC</p><p>One of the key technologies enabling data agreements are Verifiable Credentials (VCs). VCs are digital representations of information that a verifier might require, such as the age or the citizenship of an individual. In the context of data agreements, a VC could be created to represent the agreement itself. This VC would contain the details of the agreement and could be cryptographically signed by the parties involved. This ensures the authenticity and integrity of the agreement, providing a secure foundation for data exchange. An example for such a VC is provided in the listing below.<br></p><p>{</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2"],</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": ["VerifiableCredential"],</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"identifier": "https://babelfish.data-container.net/credentials/zQmeC…4H7",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"issuer": [</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"did:oyd:zQme7…Fmp%40babelfish.data-container.net",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"did:oyd:zQmY…W1z%40babelfish.data-container.net"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;],</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"issuanceDate": "2023-02-13T00:36:33Z",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"credentialSubject": [</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"id": "did:oyd:zQme7…Fmp%40babelfish.data-container.net",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "source",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "Data Source Name"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"id": "did:oyd:zQmY7…W1z%40babelfish.data-container.net",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "controller",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "Data Intermediary"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"id": "did:oyd:zQmY7…W1z%40babelfish.data-container.net",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"dataAgreement": {</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"purposes": ["the actual Domain-specific Data Agreement"]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;],</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"proof": [</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "Ed25519Signature2020",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"verificationMethod": "did:oyd:zQme7…Fmp%40babelfish.data-container.net",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"proofValue": "zqdK…3Ho"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "Ed25519Signature2020",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"verificationMethod": "did:oyd:zQmY7…W1z%40babelfish.data-container.net",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"proofValue": "z2pU…YVt"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;]</p><p>}</p><p>Semantic Overlay Architecture (SOyA)</p><p>Semantic Overlay Architecture (<a href="https://ownyourdata.github.io/soya/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">SOyA</a>) is another crucial component of data agreements.

SOyA includes groups of data records with the same attributes, references between data records, and additional information in the form of overlays for these data structures.

For instance, a manufacturer needs to share production data with a distributor, who in turn needs to share inventory data with a retailer. By leveraging DIDs, VCs, SOyA, and Domain Specific Data Agreements, this data exchange can be automated, secure, and efficient. It allows for better coordination, communication, and performance tracking across the supply chain, ultimately leading to improved efficiency, reduced costs, and increased customer satisfaction. The figure below shows the detailed data exchange between Organisation A and B.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In conclusion, data agreements are revolutionizing supply chain management by enabling secure, efficient, and automated data exchange. By leveraging technologies like DIDs, VCs, and SOyA, and implementing Domain Specific Data Agreements, organisations can reap the benefits of digital transformation in supply chain management. As we move forward, we can expect to see more innovative use cases and applications of these technologies in the realm of supply chain management.<br></p><p>This blog post was created in the course of the <a href="https://www.ownyourdata.eu/en/babelfish/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Babelfish project</a>.

<p>As we move into a future marked by unprecedented digital innovations, it’s natural to look towards Silicon Valley for the next big thing. Yet, sometimes it’s the simplest of ideas, from the most unexpected places, that can upset the established order. One such contender is Lions Gate Digital, a seemingly modest concept that could significantly disrupt the Silicon Valley tech giants.</p>



 The Power of Simplicity 



<p>Lions Gate Digital is a testament to the power of simplicity. While Silicon Valley giants invest in complex solutions and sophisticated technologies, Lions Gate Digital has taken a different approach, focusing on an easily understandable, yet powerfully effective concept. In a world growing weary of convoluted tech jargon and intricate systems, this simplicity offers a breath of fresh air.</p>



 User-Centric Approach 



<p>Lions Gate Digital also centers its approach around the user, ensuring its solution is not just simple, but also user-friendly and effective. Many tech giants have been criticized for becoming too detached from their user base, prioritizing technical advancements over user experience. This provides an opportunity for Lions Gate Digital to resonate with users, offering them solutions designed with their needs and experiences at the forefront.</p>



 The Advantage of Being Nimble 



<p>Large tech corporations are often compared to massive ships that take a long time to turn. They can be slow to react to changing market trends and customer needs due to their sheer size and bureaucracy. Conversely, smaller, more agile companies like Lions Gate Digital can adapt quickly to changes and pivot their strategy as necessary. This agility allows them to stay ahead of market trends and meet evolving consumer demands more effectively.</p>



 Leveraging Open Source 



<p>Silicon Valley giants have long capitalized on proprietary technology and platforms to maintain their market dominance. Lions Gate Digital, however, leverages the power of open source technology, allowing it to tap into a global community of developers and innovators. This approach not only speeds up innovation but also fosters a sense of community and collaboration that proprietary systems often lack.</p>



 Data Privacy and Security 



<p>In an era where data privacy and security have become significant concerns, the trust between companies and their users is more important than ever. Some Silicon Valley giants have faced criticism for their handling of user data, offering Lions Gate Digital an opportunity to differentiate itself. By prioritizing user privacy and security, Lions Gate Digital can build trust and loyalty among users, critical factors for success in today’s digital landscape.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>While it’s easy to assume that the next big digital innovation will come from a well-known Silicon Valley titan, it’s essential not to underestimate the power of simplicity, user-centric design, agility, open-source innovation, and a strong focus on data privacy. These are the factors that position Lions Gate Digital as a potential disruptor in the digital space, ready to challenge the dominance of established tech giants. Only time will tell whether this David can overcome the Goliath’s of Silicon Valley, but one thing is certain: the battle will be one to watch.</p>

             <p>In the Netherlands, suppliers of medical devices and hospitals have joined together to try to standardise and automate the exchange of product information. A uniform dataset has been established in consultation with suppliers, healthcare institutions, and other stakeholders. It has been agreed that data on medical devices, including relevant certification documentation, will be shared through the Global Data Synchronisation Network (GDSN). Since February 2023, the dataset is fully integrated within the network and datamodel.</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>On 23 June the Australian government released its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/criminal-justice/files/national-strategy-for-identity-resilience.pdf">National Strategy for Identity Resilience</a>&nbsp;which consists of ten principles to guide digital identity resilience, setting a precedent for how New Zealand’s own digital identity rules could be developed under the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Act. For example, it mentions a seamless Commonwealth, state and territory digital ID system, inclusive digital identification systems and, where appropriate and with an individual’s consent, Australian governments will use biometrics to make it harder for criminals to misuse identity credentials.</p>



<p>This Strategy also includes immediate, medium, and long term initiatives that aim to strengthen digital identification security arrangements across jurisdictions. These initiatives will be coordinated by the Department of Home Affairs, with close collaboration across the federal, state, and territory-levels of government. Compared to New Zealand, Australia’s extra legislative and regulatory layers of government mean that for such a plan and initiatives to be agreed to and in such a short timeframe, this is a positive sign of the importance for which the Australian government is signalling their priorities. These priorities we also see mirrored by the New Zealand government in the areas around identity, security and privacy which you will often hear talked about together frequently as they are interconnected when it comes to safe, reliable and secure interactions online.</p>



<p>I would recommend DINZ Members and friends have a read as we learn about what our neighbours across the ditch are doing as New Zealand’s own digital identity rules are developed.

<p>Many industry pros are increasingly channeling their inner&nbsp;Bill Gates in 2004&nbsp;and predicting the decline of the password. The PW prognosticating demonstrates some confidence in the IT world that a&nbsp;passwordless infrastructure&nbsp;is now sufficiently in place. “The most notable shift over the past couple of years has been that every major platform vendor is now supporting open standards for passwordless authentication that are in their flagship operating systems. So, this means for the first time that virtually every modern computing device has the capability to support passwordless authentication,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and chief marketing officer at FIDO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Passkeys promise a future without passwords, where we access our accounts as easily as we unlock our phones, with a much higher level of security. “It’s the closest to something that can be scaled to get rid of passwords that we’ve ever seen,” said Megan Shamas, senior director of marketing at industry association FIDO Alliance. A passkey is a digital authentication credential that is securely stored on your device. Instead of what Shamas called a “shared secret” method of passwords, passkeys are a unique key pair for every online service you use bound to the domain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce two significant developments to Ceramic that will improve efficiency and reliability of the network. These developments do not require any changes or upgrades to applications built on Ceramic.</p><p>We’ve introduced a new anchor status called REPLACED and the implementation of a more reliable method of communication between a Ceramic node and the anchoring service. Let's dive deeper into these exciting advancements.</p> REPLACED Status <p>Imagine a Ceramic user who creates a stream commit A, only to realize later that a more recent commit B supersedes it. Previously, the anchor request status for commit A would be marked as FAILED, causing unnecessary resource consumption on Ceramic nodes. However, with the introduction of the REPLACED status, we now have the ability to infer the status of commit A immediately after commit B's submission.</p><p>The new REPLACED status is not only more logically sound but also reduces the amount of resources Ceramic nodes need while waiting for a commit to anchor. This is a significant step toward optimizing the operation of the Ceramic network.</p> CAR Files for CAS Responses <p>An anchor commit acts as a reference to a previous commit in a Ceramic stream and an Ethereum transaction. In the past, when CAS (Ceramic Anchor Service) created an anchor, it relied heavily on IPFS to obtain the anchor commit and parts of a merkle tree. However, we recognized that this approach had its limitations.</p><p>To address this issue, CAS now responds with a CAR (Content Addressable aRchive) file instead of just sending the CID of an anchor commit. These CAR files contain the full anchor commit and all the necessary IPLD records in a single package. By eliminating the reliance on IPFS transport, we aim to eliminate any potential bottlenecks and enhance the overall reliability of the Ceramic network.</p><p>It is important to note that this particular feature has been rolled out in a fully backwards-compatible manner, ensuring that a Ceramic node upgrade is not mandatory. However, we strongly encourage all users to upgrade their Ceramic nodes to take advantage of the improved reliability offered by CAR files.</p> Conclusion <p>We are continuously working to optimize the performance and reliability of Ceramic. The introduction of the REPLACED status and the implementation of CAR files for Ceramic-CAS communication mark significant milestones in this journey. With these updates, we aim to enhance the efficiency of Ceramic nodes and provide a more reliable experience for our partners and their users.</p><p>Let us know your feedback on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">forum</a>! </p>

  What is the purpose of the four LSPs (EWC, DC4EU, Potential and Nobid)? The IDunion Comms Team has conducted an interview with Steffen Schwalm, msg, on this subject.
   
  
  
  
  
  

</div>
<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Four large scale pilots have been initiated under the EU’s Digital Europe research and innovation programme: The European Wallet Consortium (EWC), DC4EU, Potential and Nobid. Their aim is to test the EU DigitalWallet (EUDIW) and the other components in the eIDAS 2.0 ecosystem and pilot them in practical application across Europe. On this subject the IDunion communications team conducted an interview with Steffen Schwalm, Principal Consultant | Senior Manager Digital Identity &amp; Trust, msg.</p>



<p>What is the role of the Large Scale Pilots?</p>



<p>Their role can be illustrated quite well as a triangular structure: on one side of the triangle is the EU Commission, which is responsible for the regulation, and the eIDAS toolbox, which is used by the EU member states for establishing the technical framework of the EU digital wallet.</p>



<p>Below that we have the reference implementation for the European Wallet, and finally at the other end of the triangle we have the Large Scale Pilots (LSPs).</p>



<p>The idea behind this is to not just adopt regulations and standards where any malfunctions only become apparent during the implementation phase, but to combine regulations and technical specifications with immediate practical implementation.</p>



<p>This is precisely what the LSPs are all about: to provide direct feedback to all regulatory processes with concrete practical results, and to test all technical specifications in practical applications in order to find out what works and what does not. All this is happening in close cooperation with the EU Commission, the eIDAS toolbox and the reference implementation in order to create valid regulatory and technical foundations.</p>



<p>For example, issuing personal identification is not clearly described in the EU Architecture and Reference Framework <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">ARF</a>. Let us assume that there are five different opinions on this across four LSPs, so this is a clear indication to specify this more precisely.</p>



<p>So on the one hand we have a reference implementation that takes on specifications and explores their feasibility, and on the other hand we have the LSPs, which in turn examine the reference implementation in various use cases to check what practically works or needs to be adapted.</p>



<p>So it is much more than just establishing the rules and regulations plus a few technical standards, it is testing everything in time and creating practicality, thus avoiding any mistakes that were made with eIDAS 1.0.</p>



<p>Are all LSPs similar and do they have the same structure?</p>



<p>Yes, there is the basic rule for all of them that a LSP is always formally led by one or more EU member states. The companies are affiliated to them. </p>



<p>EWC is led by Sweden and Finland, DC4EU by Spain, Potential by France and Germany and for Nobid it is Norway and the Baltic States. The duration of all LSPs is two years – the start was on April 1, 2023.</p>



<p>Which of the four LSPs have the biggest opportunities?</p>



<p>All four LSPs have different focuses, so they are not directly comparable with each other. Also, I do not want to give an evaluation because our company msg is involved in the EWC.  In any case, Potential is very strongly focused on non-DLT and deals with a wide range of use cases, from bank account opening to e-prescription to e-government. DC4EU focuses on diploma and social security passport. Nobid focuses purely on non-DLT and payment. EWC’s activities are focusing on organisational ID, payment transactions and use cases in the area of travel, while taking a dual approach, i.e. non-DLT and DLT. </p>



<p>That said, no consortium is more important than the other, they rather need each other.</p>



<p>This brings us to our next question: to what extent do you think the Commission sees room for other DLT-based solutions besides <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Home">EBSI</a>, such as Hyperledger-Indy or Aries.</p>



<p>This is a good question given the current situation, in light of the fact that the ARF is actually technology-agnostic. On the other hand, the EU is explicitly funding an EBSI project to develop Digital Wallet solutions based on the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure. Since each consortium has to establish interoperability with the other consortia in order to enable mutual cooperation as intended by the EU Commission – all of them definitely have to establish interoperability between DLT and legacy (non-DLT) solutions. The focus of DLT is certainly on EBSI, due to existing EU funding and goals. </p>



<p>What is the motivation of the multitude of companies involved within the four LSPs, because given the large number, the funding amount for each individual organisation is rather small.</p>



<p>Whoever is now participating in the LSPs, even if only as an associated partner, is directly involved in the development of the European digital identity for the next ten to fifteen years. And if eIDAS 2.0 remains as it is currently planned, it makes great sense for both the technology providers and the relying parties to participate. At the end of the day, all companies involved in critical infrastructure services will have to adopt this solution, as well as the whole banking and healthcare sector, as well as the GAFA. Which means a major part of the industry. All companies involved in the LSPs can help shape the technology from the beginning, steer it in the right direction and develop their own business models from it.</p>



<p>In what way is IDunion represented in the EWC consortium?</p>



<p>IDunion is indirectly involved in the <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/about-us/members/">EWC</a> through the participation of many consortium partners and associated partners.</p>



<p>Thank you very much for the interview, Steffen.</p>



<p> You’re very welcome!</p>



<p>The interview was conducted by Benjamin Burde and Kordula Kiefer-Kempf from esatus AG.</p>

  <p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought humanity to a critical juncture. The recent international conference, AI for Good, organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), underscored the situation's urgency. Our society stands at a tipping point where the potential of AI could either accelerate progress towards the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or drive us towards an uncertain societal future. The ITU secretary general and other senior speakers asked for a global call for action.</p>














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>Such a call for action also comes from other initiatives around the globe. Here are a few examples. Calls for European Health Data Space digitally connecting healthcare practitioners while protecting patients' rights, development of national digital Identities including biometrics, advancing precision medicine and the use of genomic data, strengthening Internet of Things (IoT) governance for more efficient supply chains and many others. All these examples share a common governance requirement: regulating algorithmic decision-making.</p><p>Prioritizing the development of governance models for the deployment of AI is our immediately actionable, best hope for developing an AI that serves as a force for good. The task is complex and far-reaching. Everyone must coherently feed policymakers pertinent information to establish the right governance framework.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the existing multi-stakeholder framework of the SDGs offers a stage to structure the flow of concerns and the experience gained from projects impacting society through digital tooling.</p><p>Data fuel AI. As a result, data is also a promising avenue of progress for governance. To do so, we need to reshape our approach to data. By reimagining our relationship with data and promoting responsible data usage, we can simplify the regulation of AI deployment, leading us towards a sustainable and inclusive society.</p><p>Rethinking our relation to data and building the tools to make it happen is part of the mission of the Human Colossus Foundation. We promote data-centric architecture for the common good. As our contribution to the calls for action, this blog post introduces a series of upcoming publications and activities that link data governance to technological architectures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> AI &amp; SDG <p>Will Artificial Intelligence accelerate United Nations Sustainable Developments Goals ?&nbsp;</p><p>The SDGs represent a comprehensive roadmap towards a better future, encompassing crucial areas such as poverty eradication, education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability. However, the progress towards achieving these goals must catch up to projections as the 2030 deadline approaches.</p><p>AI has the potential to serve as a catalyst for progress, significantly accelerating our journey towards these goals. Yet, it also risks exacerbating existing disparities and creating a society where control over AI becomes a battle, benefitting only a few. A robust AI governance system can ensure the optimistic scenario's success.</p> The Imperative Role of Data <p>The existence of atoms weaves the very fabric of our physical reality. In the realm of information, data is the one thing AI algorithms hinge on. Brace yourself for an AI-driven data frenzy, with a mind-boggling year-on-year 56% surge in data production in 2020 alone. Brace even harder when you realise that we're sitting on a mind-blowing 64 zeta bytes of data, most of it unstructured. Unstructured data refers to data that does not have a specified format or organisation. This data is typically not easily searchable or categorised. So, get ready to dig deep into your organisation's resources to curate that data or brace for the havoc wreaked by poorly trained AI. The choice is yours, but the consequences are real.</p><p>Practitioners will appreciate the critical role of data in AI operations as they constantly search for more data. Unfortunately, we too often overlook data governance while it is the essential bedrock upon which policy maker can build a sound AI governance. Without data governance, information management systems fail to meet the data accuracy, accessibility, and security standards required to meet their end purpose: successful operations for better decision-making. Therefore, it is imperative to recognise the value of data governance before attempting to rule AI deployment.</p> Promoting Responsible Data Usage <p>AI, as a force for good, is about responsible data usage, a cornerstone of effective data governance. It entails ethical collection, storage, and data utilisation while prioritising privacy and security. Organisations can establish transparent and accountable data practices with robust data governance frameworks. Governance ensures that individuals' rights are respected while also addressing concerns around bias, discrimination, and the potential misuse of data. By fostering a culture of responsible data usage, we lay the foundation for a fair and just AI ecosystem.</p> Regulating AI Deployment <p>The intricate nature of AI that mixes data and algorithms poses challenges to effective regulation. However, we can simplify the regulatory approach by placing data governance at the forefront. By treating data as a first-class citizen, data governance aligns data usage with the values a community wants to protect through regulations and ethics. Then AI governance reduces to Machine governance. In other words, AI governance focuses on regulating AI deployment instead of AI development. In this view, AI governance is closer to AI solution certifications by defining domain-specific standards and assurance levels, for example. A data-centric approach enables policymakers and regulators to focus on data-related aspects, such as data quality, privacy protection, and accountability for algorithmic data transformation.</p><p>Streamlining the regulatory process through data governance has another subtle but essential consequence: decoupling the regulation of AI development from the regulation of AI deployment. Innovation is unstoppable. Thus regulating AI development is complex and will prove virtually impossible to enforce globally. Data governance does not stop AI development. It first structures and limits the data the AI system can ingest. Second, it constrains the algorithmic data transformation process that must respond to lawful purposes. The data governance approach to AI governance provides a granular framework that can meet domain-specific constraints and respect the underlying Human values embedded in responsible data governance.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, the data approach has the advantage of not exposing fundamental aspects of the regulation to the ever-changing technological landscape. Ruling data usage is to protect the core values of a community. The specific implementation risks are left to the certification of the deployment of solutions.&nbsp;</p> Responding to a Call for action as a first conclusion <p>The future of AI and its impact on society hinges on our ability to govern it effectively. While AI's potential to drive progress towards the SDGs is immense, responsible practices and regulations must guide the deployment of AI solutions.</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation firmly believes that by embracing data governance as the starting point, a foundation of trust, fairness, and accountability provides the bedrock for practical AI governance. Through responsible data usage, targeted regulations, and a commitment to inclusivity, we can harness the power of AI to reshape our world sustainably and inclusively.</p><p>Our beliefs are backed by actions developed through a data-centric architecture we promote as "Dynamic Data Economy". This architecture builds on the core concepts of distributed governance, decentralised semantics, and decentralised authentication.</p><p>Therefore, a contribution to the call for action within our reach is to expose the Dynamic Data Economy architecture through a stream of publications and events to promote an understanding of the relationship between data governance and technological developments.&nbsp;</p><p>The time for action is now, as the choices we make today will shape the trajectory of our society for years to come. </p><p>Thank You for your attention</p>
