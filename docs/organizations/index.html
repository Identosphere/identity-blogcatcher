  🚀 Decentralized Identity Foundation News  
<p>Credential Schemas launches<br>
<br>
The Credential Schemas work item is up and running following a successful kick-off meeting earlier this month.</p>
<p>“There was strong attendance and great energy. We had participants with deep experience in schema development and KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance, as well as newcomers to decentralized identity. We are currently focused on establishing the scope and use cases,” said DIF’s Executive Director, Kim Hamilton Duffy.</p>
<p>“It’s not too late to participate. We’re looking to involve a broad range of expertise, including people familiar with KYC reusable ID use cases, such as compliance experts.” she added.</p>
<p>The work item meets every other Tuesday at 10:00 PST / 13:00 EST / 19:00 CET, with the next meeting scheduled for Tuesday 2 July.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/linked-vp/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Linked Verifiable Presentations</a> specification has been approved.</p>
<p>The spec defines how to share, discover and retrieve Verifiable Credentials publicly via a service entry in a DID Document. It complements existing technologies for sharing VCs privately, like DIDComm messaging and OID4VC. Use cases enabled by Linked VPs include</p>
 
 Discover verifiable data about a website 
 Simplify the onboarding of suppliers and customers by linking relevant non-sensitive data such as to business registration credentials to the organization’s DID 
 Make mandatory data verifiable: provide imprint pages or terms of use statements as machine-readable, verifiable credentials 
 Decentralized business network: people share their educational background and work experience as verifiable credentials publicly 
 
<p>The specification is available here: <a href="https://identity.foundation/linked-vp/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://identity.foundation/linked-vp/</a></p>

<p>Last year we partnered with&nbsp;<a href="https://learnweb3.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Learn Web 3</a>&nbsp;(a free educational platform for Web3 developers) to publish a tutorial on&nbsp;<a href="https://learnweb3.io/lessons/build-an-ai-chatbot-on-compose-db-and-the-ceramic-network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Saving OpenAI Chats to ComposeDB on Ceramic</a>&nbsp;to showcase an easy-to-understand design architecture and how ComposeDB could be leveraged for storage. In that example we showed how to configure and deploy a local ComposeDB/Ceramic node, walking through data model design, server configurations, model deployment, and runtime definition generation, all of which are necessary steps a developer must undergo before running the application locally.</p><p>But what if developers could bypass local node configuration altogether and start testing their database design and application logic immediately? What if they could do so with the assurances of no lock-ins, and the open option to move to a self-hosted configuration in the future? And finally, what if they could benefit from all of these things while enjoying a seamless developer experience that makes storage setup easy?</p><p>That's where <a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB</a> comes in.</p> What is OrbisDB? <p><a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB</a>&nbsp;is an advanced decentralized database built on the&nbsp;<a href="https://ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a>&nbsp;and offers an ORM-like interface that developers can leverage when integrating the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/db-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB SDK</a>. Developers who have worked with Prisma or Drizzle with a Postgres instance will find this experience familiar and exceedingly easy to work with.</p><p>As for developer experience, what sets OrbisDB apart are the following:</p>  A user interface (UI) developers can run either locally or using a&nbsp;<a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">hosted Studio instance</a>, bypassing the need to define and deploy data models by hand (which is still an option if using the SDK). The UI also includes data visualization (you can view data relevant to your applications in table format), as well as other views for configuring add-ons like plugins (described below).  OrbisDB offers the option to leverage a variety of a growing list of plugins to enrich the data capabilities developers can incorporate into their application logic. Some example plugins offer gating ability, automatic resolution of ENS domains, sybil resistance, and more. Anyone can also build plugins and incorporate them immediately in the event they're running a standalone instance.  The&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/db-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB SDK</a>&nbsp;wraps user authentication, client creation, schema creation (if developers prefer not to use the UI), and querying all under one roof, therefore simplifying the list of dependencies developers need to worry about.  Finally, OrbisDB offers the option to run an instance locally (similar to the ComposeDB tutorial mentioned above), or on a shared (hosted) instance. This is a significant feature for overall development and testing velocity as it lets developers start writing and reading data right away without having to worry about node configuration. Once developers are ready to take their application to production after testing on the shared instance, setting up a self-hosted (standalone) instance is straightforward.  <p>For this tutorial, we will be leveraging the&nbsp;<a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">hosted Studio instance</a>&nbsp;to both define our data models and utilize a shared OrbisDB instance.</p> Let's Get Started! <p>Before we get started, you will need the following dependencies:</p>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?ref=blog.ceramic.network">MetaMask Chrome Extension</a>&nbsp;(or similar browser wallet for authentication)  Node v20  An&nbsp;<a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OpenAI API key</a>  A project ID you will need from&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect</a>&nbsp;  A free&nbsp;<a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB Studio</a>&nbsp;account - first, log in with your browser wallet. We will use this later to define our data models and obtain a context and environment ID   Initial Setup <p>First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot &amp;&amp; cd orbisdb-chatbot
npm install</code> <p>Next, create a copy of the example env file in your root directory:</p> <code>cp .env.example .env</code> <p>Visit <a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OpenAI Signup</a> page to create an account if you don't yet have one and generate an API key. OpenAI offers a free OpenAI API trial, with $5 worth of credit (which can take you a LONG way). Go ahead and assign your new API key to <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> in your new .env file.</p><p>Navigate to <a href="https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect</a>&nbsp;and create a free account and a new project (with a name of your choosing and the&nbsp;<code>App</code>&nbsp;type selected). Copy the resulting project ID and assign it as the value for <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID</code> .</p> OrbisDB Setup <p>If you're logged into your <a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB Studio</a> account, we can start connecting our application to a shared OrbisDB instance.</p><p>First, you will need to define a new context. Contexts are a Ceramic-native feature exposed in all data management methods, and make it easy for developers to organize data across different applications or projects (there is also the option to leverage sub-contexts, but we'll save this for a future tutorial). </p><p>Go ahead and click "+ Add context" within your root studio view - feel free to give your new context a name and description of your choosing:</p><p>If you click into your new context you can view its corresponding ID:</p><p>Go ahead and copy this value and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTEXT_ID</code> in your .env file.</p><p>On the right-hand side, you should also see details about your setup:</p><p>Copy the value found under "Environment ID" and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_ID</code> in your .env file. This ID is required to identify you when using the shared OrbisDB instance. </p><p>You will also see the endpoints for the shared Ceramic and OrbisDB instances in the same section. No need to copy these values as they are already hard-coded into the repository.</p><p>Defining Data Models</p><p>We will also use the Studio UI to define the data models our application needs. This demo application utilizes two simple data models found within the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/models/tables.sql?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tables file</a> in our repository:</p>  <code>posts</code> - this will contain each message within our conversation exchange. The "body" field will house the message itself, while the "tag" field will keep track of who the message came from (user vs. bot). This model will use the "List" account relation, which means an authenticated account can have an unbounded amount of instance documents that fall under this definition.  <code>profiles</code> - this model will allow us to assign additional data to ourselves and our chatbot, including a name, username, and fun emoji. The "actor" subfield will be used to differentiate between the user (using the value "human"), and your chatbot (using the value "robot"). In contrast to posts, this model will use the "Set" account relation based on the "actor" subfield, which means an account can have exactly 1 instance document given a value assigned to "actor". For example, this ensures that our application won't allow us to accidentally create &gt;1 document with an "actor" subfield matching "human".  <p>To start creating the models, navigate to "Model builder" from the Studio navigation. You can start by defining your "posts" table. After clicking "Create Model" you will be able to view the model ID:</p><p>Copy this value and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_POST_ID</code> in your .env file.</p><p>Go through the same steps for your "profiles" table. However, be sure to select the "Set" option under "Account relation". Copy the resulting model ID and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_PROFILE_ID</code> in your .env file.</p> Application Architecture <p>As mentioned above, the OrbisDB SDK makes it easy to instantiate clients, authenticate users, and run queries using the same library. As you'll note in the application repository, there are various components that need to be able to access the state of the authenticated user. While we're <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/pages/_app.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">wrapping all components </a>of our application within a <code>WagmiConfig</code> contextual wrapper (which will allow us to leverage Wagmi's hooks to see if a user's wallet is connected - learn more about this in our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/walletconnect-tutorial/">WalletConnect Tutorial</a>), we also need a way to know if the user has an active OrbisDB session.</p><p>While there are multiple ways to facilitate this, our application uses <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Zustand</a> for state management to circumvent the need for contextual wrappers or prop drilling.</p><p>If you take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/zustand/store.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">store file</a> you can see how we've set up four state variables (two of which are methods) and incorporated the OrbisDB SDK to authenticate users and alter the state of  <code>orbisSession</code>: </p> <code>type Store = {
  orbis: OrbisDB;
  orbisSession?: OrbisConnectResult | undefined;
  // setOrbisSession returns a promise
  setAuth: (
    wallet: GetWalletClientResult | undefined
  ) =&gt; Promise&lt;OrbisConnectResult | undefined&gt;;
  setOrbisSession: (session: OrbisConnectResult | undefined) =&gt; void;
};

const StartOrbisAuth = async (
  walletClient: GetWalletClientResult,
  orbis: OrbisDB
): Promise&lt;OrbisConnectResult | undefined&gt; =&gt; {
  if (walletClient) {
    const auth = new OrbisEVMAuth(window.ethereum!);
    
    // This option authenticates and persists the session in local storage
    const authResult: OrbisConnectResult = await orbis.connectUser({
      auth,
    });
    if (authResult.session) {
      console.log("Orbis Auth'd:", authResult.session);
      return authResult;
    }
  }

  return undefined;
};

const useStore = create&lt;Store&gt;((set) =&gt; ({
  orbis: new OrbisDB({
    ceramic: {
      gateway: "https://ceramic-orbisdb-mainnet-direct.hirenodes.io/",
    },
    nodes: [
      {
        gateway: "https://studio.useorbis.com",
        env: ENV_ID,
      },
    ],
  }),
  orbisSession: undefined,
  setAuth: async (wallet) =&gt; {
    if (wallet) {
      try {
        const auth = await StartOrbisAuth(wallet, useStore.getState().orbis);
        set((state: Store) =&gt; ({
          ...state,
          orbisSession: auth,
        }));
        return auth;
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
      }
    } else {
      set((state: Store) =&gt; ({
        ...state,
        session: undefined,
      }));
    }
  },
  setOrbisSession: (session) =&gt;
    set((state: Store) =&gt; ({
      ...state,
      orbisSession: session,
    })),
}));</code> <p>As you can see, we've hard-coded the Ceramic and OrbisDB gateways, whereas we've imported our environment ID that we previously assigned as an environment variable.</p><p>Our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/navbar.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">navbar component</a> sits at the same or greater level as all of our child components and includes our Web3Modal widget. You can see how we're using a <code>useEffect</code> hook to check if our session is active and either set our "loggedIn" state variable as true or false. This result determines if we generate a new session for the user by leveraging our <code>setAuth</code> method from our Zustand store, or if we simply set our <code>orbisSession</code> as the value of our valid active session.</p><p>Back in the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/pages/index.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">home page component</a> you can see how we're conditionally rendering our <code>MessageList</code> child component based on whether we have both an active orbis session AND the user's wallet is connected (allowing us to access their address).</p><p>Reading Data</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/message-list.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">message list</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/userform.component.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">userform component</a> files are responsible for performing the majority of writes and reads to OrbisDB. If you navigate to the message list component for example, take a look at how we've imported our client-side environment variables to identify our post and profile models, as well as our context ID. When this component is rendered, the <code>useEffect</code> hook first invokes the "getProfile" method:</p> <code>  const getProfile = async (): Promise&lt;void&gt; =&gt; {
    try {
      const profile = orbis
        .select("controller", "name", "username", "emoji", "actor")
        .from(PROFILE_ID)
        .where({ actor: ["human"] })
        .context(CONTEXT_ID);
      const profileResult = await profile.run();
      if (profileResult.rows.length) {
        console.log(profileResult.rows[0]);
        setProfile(profileResult.rows[0] as Profile);
      } else {
        // take the user to the profile page if no profile is found
        window.location.href = "/profile";
      }
      await getRobotProfile(profileResult.rows[0] as Profile);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      return undefined;
    }
  };</code> <p>Notice how we've constructed a <code>.select</code> query off of our OrbisDB instance (provided by our Zustand store), asking for the corresponding values for the 5 columns we want data for. </p><p>Next, we need to notate which data model we want our query to reference, which is where we use <code>.from</code> with our profile model ID as the value.</p><p>We also only want the records where the profile is for the human user, indicated on the following line.</p><p>Finally, we use the context ID that corresponds to this project as the final value that's appended to the query.</p><p>If a corresponding profile exists, we then invoke the <code>getRobotProfile</code> method to obtain our chatbot's information. If it does not exist, we take the users to the profiles page so they can create one.</p><p>Writing Data</p><p>Let's take a quick look at an example of data mutations. Within the same <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/message-list.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">message list</a> component you will find a method called <code>createPost</code> which is invoked each time the user creates a new message:</p> <code> const createPost = async (
    thisPost: string
  ): Promise&lt;PostProps | undefined&gt; =&gt; {
    try {
      await orbis.getConnectedUser();
      const query = await orbis
        .insert(POST_ID)
        .value({
          body: thisPost,
          created: new Date().toISOString(),
          tag: "user",
          edited: new Date().toISOString(),
        })
        .context(CONTEXT_ID)
        .run();

      if (query.content &amp;&amp; profile) {
        const createdPost: PostProps = {
          id: query.id,
          body: query.content.body as string,
          profile,
          tag: query.content.tag as string,
          created: query.content.created as string,
          authorId: query.controller,
        };
        return createdPost;
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      return undefined;
    }
  };</code> <p>While this looks similar to the syntax we use to read data, there are a few differences. </p><p>First, take a look at the first line under the "try" statement - we're calling <code>getConnectedUser()</code> off of our OrbisDB prototype chain to ensure that our active session is applied. This is necessary to run mutation queries, whereas it's not a necessary step for reading data.</p><p>You can also see that we've swapped out the <code>.select</code> and <code>.from</code> statements for <code>.insert</code> which references the model ID we want to use, thus creating a new row in the corresponding table.</p><p>Finally, we're referencing the user's message value for the body while ensuring we tag the message as coming from the "user" before running the query and checking on its success status.</p> Running the Application in Developer Mode <p>We're now ready to boot up our application! </p><p>In your terminal, go ahead and start the application in developer mode:</p> <code>nvm use 20
npm run dev</code> <p>Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">http://localhost:3000/</a> in your browser. You should see the following:</p><p>Go ahead and click on "Connect Wallet." You should see a secondary authentication message appear after you connect your wallet:</p><p>Signing this message creates an authenticated session (using <code>orbis.connectUser()</code> from our Zustand store). You can check the value of this session by navigating to the "Application" tab in your browser and looking for the <code>orbis:session</code> key pair:</p><p>Given that you have not yet created any messages, the application should automatically direct you to the /profiles page where you can assign identifiers to yourself and your chatbot:</p><p>Finally, navigate back to the homepage to begin exchanging messages with your chatbot. Notice how the values from your corresponding profiles appear next to the messages:</p> How Could this Application be Improved? <p>Since our message history is being written and queried based on static values (for example, assigning messages to the "user" tag), you'll notice that the same conversation history appears when self-authenticating with a different wallet address and creating a new session.</p><p>As a challenge, try thinking about how to implement different ways to improve the application design to improve this experience:</p>  Tagging the profiles and messages with values that align with actual authenticated accounts instead of static ones  Altering our message data model and application to accommodate different chat contexts, allowing a user to have different conversation histories   Next Steps <p>We hope you've enjoyed this tutorial and learned something new about how to configure and incorporate OrbisDB into your application! While this concludes our walk-through, there are other possibilities Ceramic has to offer:</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/ceramic?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Join the Ceramic Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://x.com/ceramicnetwork?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Follow Ceramic on X</a></p><p><a href="https://x.com/useorbis?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Follow Orbis on X</a></p><p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Start Building with Ceramic</a></p>

Thursday, July 25, 2024<br>
10 AM ET</p>
<p>For higher education institutions offering financial aid to students, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, means your institution is required to meet compliance standards for the security and protection of financial information, and to provide transparency related to how personal information is used and shared. Failure to meet these standards carries significant risk for institutions, including restrictions or loss of eligibility for Title IV funding. In this session, we’ll review how the latest revisions to GLBA compliance standards, aligned with the NIST 800-171 revision 3, will impact higher education. Our privacy and compliance experts will review how these revisions increase the compliance burden for institutions, and key steps that institutions can take to meet the new standard and maintain compliance to receive federal financial aid support.</p>

<p>IBM, Logius, Orbex Global Markets, Publications Office of the European Union, U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and Others Advance Open Standard for Enhanced Interoperability and Efficiency in Supply Chain and Digital Trade</p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 27 June 2024 – OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, announced the approval of Universal Business Language (UBL) V2.4 as an OASIS Standard, a status that signifies the highest level of ratification. Developed by the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/tc-ubl/">UBL Technical Committee (TC</a>), UBL V2.4 is the leading interchange format for business documents, revolutionizing global business transactions with its latest version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The standard works seamlessly with frameworks like ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML), extending the benefits of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) systems to businesses worldwide. UBL V2.4 maintains backward compatibility with earlier V2.# versions while introducing new business document types, now totaling 93. The European Union has recognized UBL’s significance by declaring it officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“UBL 2.4 represents a significant advancement, featuring enhanced support for B2C transactions, which will greatly benefit businesses and consumers alike,” said Kenneth Bengtsson, Chair of the UBL TC. “Additionally, it offers improved alignment with U.S. tax models, ensuring compliance and facilitating smoother transactions. These enhancements reaffirm our commitment to evolving and adapting UBL to meet the ever-changing needs of global commerce.”</p>



<p>As global sustainability efforts increase, UBL will expand its utility to encompass circular data exchange, reflecting the evolving needs of modern commerce. Looking ahead to the development of UBL V2.5, the TC will integrate circular economy data elements, marking a transformative step towards embedding sustainability into global supply chain data exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UBL TC is forming a new UBL Commodities Subcommittee (SC), which aims to streamline electronic transactions for raw materials, recycled goods, and agricultural products in global supply chains, with the goal of improving efficiency, transparency, sustainability, and reliability in commodity markets. The SC will standardize UBL document types and semantic library entries for global commodity trading and procurement processes.</p>



<p>The UBL TC encourages global collaboration and actively seeks input from stakeholders to ensure the success of UBL as a cornerstone for sustainability data exchange. The TC welcomes a diverse range of contributors, including ERP vendors; software and service providers; national, regional and local public authorities; procurement and trade communities; e-invoicing networks; supply chain communities; and logistics and transportation companies. Participation is open to all through <a href="mailto:join@oasis-open.org">membership in OASIS</a>, with interested parties encouraged to join and contribute to shaping the future of structured business document exchange.

<p>About the FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, www.fidoalliance.org, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

<p>In the records of financial history, few events have shaped the global economic landscape as profoundly as the establishment of the Bretton Woods system. In 1944, amidst the ruins of World War II, representatives from 44 Allied nations convened in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to create a new framework for international economic cooperation. The primary goal was to prevent the economic instability and competitive devaluations that had contributed to the Great Depression and the war.</p>
<p>The Bretton Woods system pegged major currencies to the US dollar, which was convertible to gold at a fixed rate. This effectively made the US dollar the world’s reserve currency, providing much-needed stability and fostering economic growth. However, by the late 1960s, the system began to unravel. The US faced mounting balance-of-payments deficits and dwindling gold reserves. On August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon unilaterally ended the dollar’s convertibility to gold, effectively dismantling the Bretton Woods system and ushering in the era of fiat currencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The transition to fiat currencies, while offering greater flexibility for monetary policy, also introduced significant challenges. Governments could now print money without restraint, leading to inflation, currency devaluations, and a series of financial crises. Today, the world faces a staggering $307 trillion in debt, excessive currency issuance, declining bank credit, and rising economic instability. This backdrop underscores the need for a new financial paradigm, one that combines stability with the technological advancements of the digital age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Bitcoin: Digital Gold 
<p>Bitcoin, created in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, was designed as a decentralised digital currency that could operate independently of central banks and governments. Often referred to as “digital gold,” Bitcoin possesses many qualities that make it an ideal candidate for a global reserve asset: it is scarce (with a cap of 21 million coins), durable, portable, and easily divisible. Bitcoin’s blockchain technology ensures transparency, security, and resistance to censorship, making it a robust vehicle to support fiat currencies and value exchange.</p>
<p>Despite its adoption and over $1 trillion in value, Bitcoin’s mainstream financial use faces challenges like scalability and programmability limitations. Its high decentralisation and security make transactions slower and resource-intensive. While its simplicity ensures robust security, it limits Bitcoin’s ability to handle complex transactions like digital agreements for loans or exchanges. Innovations like Ethereum, which introduced smart contracts in 2015, offer more functionality, leading to Layer 2 solutions aimed at uniting technologies and enhancing Bitcoin’s capabilities.</p>

<p>Layer 2 solutions are protocols built on top of a blockchain (Layer 1) to enhance performance and enable more complex functionalities. For Bitcoin, Layer 2 technologies like the Lightning Network and sidechains address issues of transaction speed, programmability and scalability, while bridges facilitate interoperability with other blockchain ecosystems. These solutions allow Bitcoin to interact with other blockchain ecosystems and innovations like Ethereum, enabling smart contracts and decentralised applications (DApps) that were previously not possible. However, there is a problem.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Inherent Problems 
<p>Scalability layers involve bridging Bitcoin off its main network and into these environments, creating security concerns that undermine its decentralised ethos. <a href="https://wbtc.network/">Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)</a>, for instance, is an ERC-20 token that represents Bitcoin on Ethereum networks. While it brings Bitcoin’s liquidity to more programmable finance platforms, it has several critical issues:</p>
 
 Centralisation Risk: WBTC requires users to trust centralised institutions to manage and safeguard the Bitcoin backing the WBTC. If these institutions act maliciously, users have no recourse, undermining Bitcoin’s decentralisation ethos. 
 Custodian Risk: The centralised custodians holding the actual Bitcoin can potentially be hacked or face regulatory pressures, putting users’ assets at risk. 
 Lack of Transparency: Users must rely on the custodians’ transparency regarding the actual reserves backing the WBTC, which may not always be reliable. 
 
<p></p>
<p>Recent cross-chain bridge hacks, such as the <a href="https://medium.com/immunefi/hack-analysis-nomad-bridge-august-2022-5aa63d53814a">Nomad Bridge exploit</a>, highlight these vulnerabilities. <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cross-chain-bridge-hacks-2022/">Chainalysis</a> reports that $2 billion has been stolen in 13 cross-chain bridge hacks, accounting for 69% of total funds stolen in 2022, with North Korean-linked hackers stealing approximately $1 billion. Currently, there are more than <a href="https://dezentralizedfinance.com/cross-chain-bridges/">70 cross-chain bridges</a> with over $25 billion locked and daily transaction volumes in the millions. Synapse, a popular cross-chain bridge, has surpassed $5 billion in transaction volume. Bridges are vulnerable due to their structure, combining custodians, debt issuers, and oracles, each presenting multiple attack vectors. For instance, the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/10/cross-chain-defi-site-poly-network-hacked-hundreds-of-millions-potentially-lost/">Poly Network</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wormhole-token-bridge-loses-321m-in-largest-hack-so-far-in-2022">Wormhole</a> attacks showcased vulnerabilities in cross-chain communication, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<p>To mitigate these risks, it is crucial for Bitcoin’s evolution to connect other innovation layers through information transmission rather than asset transfer, while decentralising staking on Bitcoin to avoid pooling assets together. This approach keeps Bitcoin native, secure, and decentralised, while enabling broader financial applications in scalable environments.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Native Bitcoin DeFi, Pioneering the New Bretton Woods System 
<p>Native Bitcoin refers to Bitcoin that remains on its main network while being collateralised for Layer 2 DeFi applications. Through BeL2, Bitcoin can participate in complex financial transactions without being transferred off the Bitcoin blockchain, maintaining its security and decentralisation. This allows Bitcoin to act as a versatile tool in DeFi ecosystems, leveraging its inherent strengths while expanding its functionality into smart services such as swaps, loans, and stablecoin issuance.</p>
 
 Staking: BeL2 employs non-custodial native Bitcoin staking in decentralised wallets, providing security for the network. 
 Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs): These provide private and verifiable proofs on Bitcoin staking transactions. 
 BTC Oracle: Connects BTC proof information into Layer 2 smart contracts, facilitating Bitcoin DeFi services without moving assets off the main network. 
 Arbiter Network: Utilises decentralised and collateralised nodes to facilitate time-based execution and dispute resolution, enhancing trustless financial operations. 
 
<p></p>
<p>BeL2 transmits information, not assets, across chains, preserving Bitcoin’s security and integrity while enabling smart contracts and decentralised applications for complex financial transactions. This approach eliminates reliance on centralised entities and ensures secure, decentralised financial operations. By keeping Bitcoin native, BeL2 ensures that the original blockchain remains the ultimate trust anchor for all transactions, thereby maintaining the foundational principles of Bitcoin’s decentralised ethos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Native Bitcoin Loan App Demo 
<p>In the context of BeL2’s transformative role in decentralised finance (DeFi), the BeL2 Loan Dapp Demo showcases its potential to enhance Bitcoin’s utility while maintaining security and decentralisation. This demo is the first native Bitcoin lending protocol built on <a href="https://starkware.co/cairo/">Starkwares Cairo</a> programming language, allowing users to lock their native Bitcoin as collateral without relying on Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) or cross-chain bridges. The BTC remains on the Bitcoin mainnet, ensuring non-custodial and non-liquidatable collateral.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Users lock their Bitcoin through a bespoke transaction script, and the loan terms, including interest rates and conditions for collateral release, are governed by a smart contract on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). BeL2’s arbiter network acts as an intermediary, facilitating communication between the Bitcoin and EVM chains and verifying transaction proofs. If a borrower, like Alice, fails to repay a loan, the lender, Bob, can retrieve the BTC. If Bob refuses to cooperate in unlocking the BTC after repayment, Alice can initiate arbitration, and the arbiter will co-sign to unlock the BTC.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This peer-to-peer system ensures fairness and security through zero-knowledge proofs and the arbiter network. Any malicious actions by the arbiter or parties involved are deterred by the ability to challenge and penalise misconduct, ensuring cooperation is the best outcome. This innovative approach enables Bitcoin holders to access liquidity while preserving Bitcoin’s core principles of decentralisation and security.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Principles for a New Native Bitcoin Bretton Woods System: 
 
 Decentralised Global Settlement: Native Bitcoin must act as a global settlement layer where all transactions are secured on Bitcoin’s main network, ensuring it remains the ultimate trust anchor for global finance. 
 Financial Innovation and Stability: By integrating native Bitcoin with smart contracts and DApps, we can support new financial products like BTC-backed loans and stablecoins, providing liquidity and stability to the global economy whilst uniting all layers. 
 Trustless and Transparent Operations: The implementation of information transmission through zero knowledge proofs and a decentralised arbiter network ensures trustless and transparent financial operations for native Bitcoin applications, reducing counterparty risk and enhancing transaction integrity. 
 
<p></p>
<p>BeL2’s vision is to become the defining piece of native Bitcoin infrastructure for a new Bretton Woods system. Emerging from the Elastos SmartWeb vision, which aims to create a decentralised internet where data, applications, and identities are secure, private, and user-owned, BeL2 strives to become a pivotal component of native Bitcoin infrastructure, transforming Bitcoin from digital gold into the cornerstone of a new global financial system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;BeL2 leverages Elastos’ secure <a href="https://elastos.info/">infrastructure</a>, using ELA as collateral for arbiters to ensure robust and trustless dispute resolution. ELA, an asset merged mined with over <a href="https://ela.elastos.io/">50% of Bitcoin’s</a> miner security, adds an additional layer of security and decentralisation to the BeL2 ecosystem, reinforcing both projects’ commitment to a secure and decentralised financial future.

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Earlier this month, I was lucky enough to be personally invited by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joergresch/">Joerg Resch</a>&nbsp;to attend Europe’s flagship digital ID conference in Berlin,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/agenda">EIC 2024</a>. For someone who regularly spoke on this circuit for over 10 years, it was a blast to be back, revelling in the richness of the presentations and discussion, highlighted in this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonibrennan_eic2024-dc4eu-personaldataprivacy-activity-7206782875801669632-70VT?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">post</a>&nbsp;by my predecessor at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kantara-initiative_eic2024-kantarainitaitive-activity-7204130422773985280-FVFw?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Kantara Initiative</a>. The brain is fully engaged for hours, absorbing expert insight, experience, and innovation that is found here at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC</a>&nbsp;in Germany and<a href="https://identiverse.com/">&nbsp;Identiverse</a>&nbsp;in the US, the world’s two biggest conferences in this space. I’m looking forward to a tiny fraction of the ground being covered and contextualised locally at our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;in just six weeks’ time.</p>



<p>The pre-conference&nbsp;<a href="https://sidi-hub.community/">SIDIHub</a>&nbsp;made significant progress in the challenging goal to achieve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/multi-stakeholder-cross-border-identity-eic24">digital identity cross border interoperability</a>. Participants were interested in learning about Aotearoa becoming the first common law country to implement a<a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/digital-government/programmes-and-projects/digital-identity-programme/about-the-digital-identity-programme/">&nbsp;regulated digital identity trust framework&nbsp;</a>on July 1st. This framework regulates stakeholders that opt in for accreditation, thereby increasing customer trust in their security and privacy settings. The US, UK, Canada, and Australia have digital ID trust frameworks in operation and piloted, but not yet nationally legislated. Credential authentication and verification continue to evolve both in policy and technology at different speeds, making it a complex issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At our recent DIA-hosted public/private sector working group meeting on digital identification standards, I commented that there is still much work needed globally before we can adopt comprehensive policies, protocols and standards for decentralised digital ID and its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/panel-the-wallets-we-want-eic24">container</a><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/panel-expert-digital-wallet-verifiers-eic24">wallets</a>. This is a plane we will continue to build as we fly it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high interest in digital ID led us to host/co-host two events in June: the capacity-filled ‘Digital Identity, Higher Education, Aotearoa’ sponsored by Middleware and featuring the University of Auckland, and a Town Hall-styled session on digital cash with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Te Pūtea Matua (RBNZ), in partnership with FinTechNZ. Both events showed how important broad digital trust is for ensuring cybersecurity and protecting against deepfakes, scams and hacking threats. Awareness and education are essential, so we thank our members for supporting DINZ initiatives, just as DINZ supports members’ initiatives like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nec.co.nz/biometrics-education-series/">the upcoming series from NEC</a>.</p>



<p>And finally, the DIA has released a new schedule of Identification Masterclasses through to August.</p>







<p>To register for any of the Zoom sessions, please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:identity@dia.govt.nz">identity@dia.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;with the G or HD reference number and a Zoom link will be supplied.</p>

<p>Theatre 4 was the place to be at Identity Week Europe in Amsterdam earlier this month, when a series of presentations and panel discussions on decentralized identity and blockchain proved one of the exhibition hall's top draws. </p><p>The session, on the afternoon of Day 2, began with a panel discussion, "Blockchain and ID" moderated by Alex Tourski, with Steffen Schwalm, Co-ordinator, TRACE4EU, Maarten Boender, INATBA Identity Workgroup, Sphereon.com and William Wang, Founder, Palau Digital Residency Program (RNS.ID).</p><p>Alex Tourski: "Why does blockchain need identity?" </p><p>Steffen Schwalm: "If you only want to prove identities, you can use a PKI. But if you want to combine identity and transactions in one system — for example, if you want to trace the parts and materials in your Tesla’s battery — you need a distributed ledger."&nbsp;</p><p>Maarten Boender: "I agree. How can you be held accountable for what’s written to the blockchain, unless the transaction is signed by your identifier? If you need to make the audit trail of your product evident, that’s much easier to do with DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology). The DID document can’t be changed and will be around for as long as the blockchain it resides on, which is available always and everywhere. There’s no single point of failure.</p><p>"There are not so many other systems with the properties of a DLT".&nbsp;</p><p>Alex Tourski: "Can DIDs be considered a universal identifier scheme, when there are around 200 DID methods?"&nbsp;</p><p>Steffen Schwalm: "We have multiple credential data models, signature formats and protocols. What matters is achieving interoperability. I don’t have a problem with 500 DID methods, as long as we have a universal resolver that works."</p><p>Maarten Boender: "There are many types of database. As long as everyone talks SQL, its’ fine. Consumers won’t need to think about 200 DID methods. You’ll only have one choice, whether to login with your EU digital identity wallet."&nbsp;</p><p>Alex Tourski: "How do we know blockchain-based identifiers will persist?"&nbsp;</p><p>William Wang: "Why do IP addresses exist? Because there's an underlying need to transfer information. If there's a better way of doing this in ten years’ time, IPs may vanish. Blockchain exists because there’s a need for instant transfer of value. Maybe another way will arise and blockchain will disappear. We can’t say anything will exist for sure, even in 5 years time."&nbsp;</p><p>Maarten Boender: "DIDs and DLTs will be essential tools for businesses that need to provide audit trails. Qualified electronic ledgers are part of eIDAS 2.0. They are managed by organizations that are certified and fully liable to maintain the ledger." </p><p>Steffen Schwalm: "I’m pretty sure nothing of current IT systems will still be here in 50 years' time. It’s the data that needs to persist."&nbsp;</p><p>Sovrin: an example of a blockchain-based identity system&nbsp;</p><p>Stephen Curran, who chairs the Sovrin Foundation's board of trustees, and is a long-term contributor to Hyperledger Indy, Aries and AnonCreds, took to the stage to give an update on the Sovrin Network. </p><p>“Picking up from the previous talk, Sovrin is a distributed ledger that's used for identity. It’s global, for public-private use and enables different ecosystems of users.</p><p>“We provide a platform for issuers to publish information, that enables verifiers to independently verify this information. Sovrin is a valid place for any ecosystem where DIDs are used. It’s not tied to the Hyperledger stack,” he added.&nbsp; </p><p>Stephen described the Lawyer Verifiable Credential, which is used to ensure certain systems can only be accessed by qualified lawyers. "The Law society of British Columbia issues a VC confirming the holder is certified to practice law. The data is held in a wallet, enabling the holder to present it directly to verifiers, such as these restricted systems, without the issuer knowing this has happened.&nbsp; </p><p>"The Verifier reaches down into where the DIDs are to verify it's exactly what the issuer said, using issuer’s public keys. </p><p>“The Government of British Columbia is also very concerned about the surveillance economy. The goal of AnonCreds is to share the minimum possible data that’s needed for each use case. We’re trying to remove correlateability, traceability and surveillance”.&nbsp;</p><p>Stephen also reminisced about "Sovrin’s infamous token days. We got through that. We had strong technology and governance, and that’s what we took forward. </p><p>"The technology is very solid and robust&nbsp;— we’ve had 100% uptime for the past 5 years”.&nbsp;</p><p>Enabling the Economy of Trust </p><p>Next on stage was Catherine Fankhauser, Head of Identity at SICPA, who provided an overview of how authentication, data authenticity and communication have evolved since the inception of the web, and the impact this has had on digital trust. </p><p>Turning to the new generation of decentralized technologies, she shared that adoption will be driven by credentials with daily utility. In the context of the EU Digital Identity Wallet, this means lower-assurance credentials that improve the user experience, for example via passwordless access to online services. </p><p>Catherine concluded her presentation by highlighting the Unlimitrust Campus, the world's first site dedicated to the Economy of Trust. </p><p>Are unique identifiers a good idea? </p><p>In the final session, Alex Tourski returned to moderate a panel discussion focused on unique identifiers, with Executive Directors Judith Fleenor of Trust over IP Foundation and Mary Camacho of Holochain, plus Maarten Boender, Stephen Curran and myself. </p><p>Alex Tourski kicked off the discussion by highlighting how the lack of persistent   unique identifiers for digital assets means content created in the early days of the internet is often irretrievable today, with broken weblinks all that remains. </p><p>He asked the panel to consider the proposition that "transparency means safety", citing his home country of Ukraine, where false rumours contributed to the war. </p><p>"When an Uber driver likes or dislikes me, should their feedback not be connected to an identifier, to ensure accountability?," he added.  </p><p>The panel's response was unanimous: assigning persistent unique identifiers to  natural persons is a bad idea — though persistent identifiers may make sense for organisations, and certain types of physical and digital objects. Moreover, there are many benefits from using a standardized identifier framework, such as the Decentralized Identifier (DID) specification. </p><p>Judith Fleenor pointed out that the Internet Protocol (IP) succeeded because it does the minimum required to establish a universal data transfer mechanism. Similarly, while content provenance is needed to address the explosion of fake content, creators must be able to use multiple identifiers, to minimize privacy risks. </p><p>Mary Camacho agreed, adding: "Not all societies are as well-governed and free as the Netherlands. In some places, knowing who took a photo could mean death for that person." </p><p>Alex Tourski asked the panel whether Privacy Enhancing Technologies can protect us from the dangers of unique identifiers. </p><p>In response, Stephen Curran stated that cryptographic techniques and identifiers are separate topics, and that clever cryptography doesn't mitigate the privacy risks of assigning unique identifiers to natural persons.   </p><p>Maarten Boender agreed: "We're trying to make it impossible to correlate a holder's use of their credentials, which is the opposite of creating a single identifier."  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

<p>Checkmarx, Cisco, Cyware, Google, IBM, Legit Security, Microsoft, Root, SAP, US NSA, CISA, and Others Join Forces to Build a Framework to Complement SBOM Data Formats, CSAF, CycloneDX, OpenVEX, and SPDX</p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 20 June 2024 – With escalating cybersecurity threats exploiting software supply chain vulnerabilities, there’s an urgent need for better understanding and proactive measures to identify and prevent future risks. Members of OASIS Open, the global open source and standards organization, have formed the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/tc-osim/">Open Supply Chain Information Modeling (OSIM) Technical Committee</a> (TC) to standardize and promote information models crucial to supply chain security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The aim of OSIM is to build a unifying framework that sits on top of existing SBOM data models–such as CSAF, CycloneDX, OpenVEX, and SPDX. OSIM is not intended to replace or endorse any one of these models. Instead, as an information model, OSIM will bring clarity to software supply chain partners, mitigate vulnerabilities and disruptions, reduce security risks, and make it easier for companies to plan for upgrades and contingencies.</p>



<p>“CISA is excited to be a part of this technical effort to bring greater visibility to the software supply chain,” said Allan Friedman, Senior Technical Advisor at CISA. “We have many of the basic building blocks for software transparency and security, including SBOM, VEX, and CSAF. This work by OASIS will facilitate automation for easier and cheaper implementation and tooling, and help provide a unifying supply chain framework and raise the level of collaboration across industries.”</p>



<p>“OSIM represents an important effort to address the need for greater structure and comprehensibility of software supply chains,” said Isaac Hepworth, Google, and OSIM co-chair. “By establishing standardized information models we can enhance transparency, interoperability, and resilience in end-to-end operations — ultimately aiding cyber risk management and protecting critical infrastructure.”</p>



<p>Recognizing the crucial role of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) in fortifying software supply chain security, the OSIM TC aims to create, for example, a standardized SBOM information model that would enhance understanding and interoperability across diverse SBOM data formats (i.e. SPDX and CycloneDX). Competing data models, like SPDX, CycloneDX, CSAF, and OpenVex, show the need for creating information models that would bring coherence across diverse specifications.</p>



<p>“OSIM’s approach not only drives a universal taxonomy of thought, it also brings clarity and ease to how we implement standards and frameworks to support multiple industry software supply chain security needs. OSIM facilitates the identification of similarities and differences across specifications, enhancing interoperability and simplifying processes. The current cybersecurity landscape can no longer be defended in a silo,” said Jay White, Microsoft, and OSIM co-chair.</p>



<p>The OSIM TC welcomes a diverse range of contributors, including software and hardware vendors, open-source maintainers, technology consultants, business stakeholders, government organizations, and regulatory bodies. Participation is open to all through <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OASIS-OPEN-MEMBERSHIP-AGREEMENT_2024_TC.pdf">membership in OASIS</a>, with interested parties encouraged to join and contribute to shaping the future of supply chain information modeling.</p>



<p>Support for OSIM<br><br>Checkmarx<br>“Checkmarx is proud to be working with OASIS and be part of the OSIM Technical Committee. A major part of Checkmarx’ mission to secure the applications driving our world involves sharing our time, experience, and threat intelligence to help make the software supply chain ecosystem safer. As one of the biggest challenges remains education and closing the knowledge gap, we believe standardization is a crucial step and are committed to assisting in laying the foundations.”<br>– Erez Yalon, VP of Security Research, Checkmarx</p>



<p>Root<br>“The OASIS OSIM is a vital project for enhancing security and trust in the software supply chain. As a part of the OSIM Technical Committee, Root is committed to advancing supply chain security and transparency, aligning perfectly with this initiative’s goals. By collaborating on data schemas, data modeling, and security standards, we aim to improve vulnerability management and software security, ensuring threats are identified and mitigated promptly. This enhances software integrity, benefiting our customers and strengthening trust in the broader digital ecosystem.”<br>– Ian Riopel, CEO, Root.io</p>



<p>SAP SE<br>“Having a unified information model for representation of objects in the supply chain domain would enable efficient integration models and interoperability. Especially with the wave for generative AI, such aligned models can bring benefits in development efficiency , reduced maintenance and operations for upcoming innovations in the domain.”<br>– Gururaj Raman, Chief Development Expert, SAP SE</p>

 Validity + Reliability + Viability = Credibility Image CC BY-ND Visual Thinkery for&nbsp;WAO<p>Digital credentials are playing an increasingly important role in recognising a broad spectrum of skills in the workplace. These range from the tangible to the abstract and innovative, but in all cases, we want credentials that are credible — that is to say, something worth&nbsp;earning.</p><p>In this post, we explore two distinct scenarios, a culinary school and a large organisation looking to recognise and encourage the creativity of its exmployers. In each, the core elements of validity, reliability, and viability are discussed in terms of developing a credible digital credential system&nbsp;.</p> Validity <p>Validity ensures that an assessment accurately measures what it claims to measure. In the context of digital credentials, this means that the assessment process leading to the badge should accurately evaluate the abilities, knowledge, or competencies it is intended to certify. This alignment between the assessment criteria and the attributes it assesses is important. Without strong validity, the integrity of the credential could be questioned, undermining its acceptance by educational institutions and employers.</p>  Culinary School: Issuing badges for skills like knife handling, pastry making, and creative presentation means assessing specific competencies. Each badge must represent true mastery of these skills. Assessments might involve practical tests where students must produce a dish that adheres to professional standards. These practical assessments must be designed to measure relevant culinary skills accurately, ensuring the badge directly reflects the student’s capability.  Creative Organisation: For certifying creativity, the assessments might require participants to propose innovative solutions to real business challenges. These should be evaluated for their originality, practicality, and impact, ensuring the badge reflects genuine creative thinking and problem-solving ability.   Reliability <p>Reliability focuses on the consistency and dependability of the assessment results. A reliable digital credential system ensures that all recipients are evaluated using the same standards, and that these standards are consistently applied. This consistency builds trust in the credentialing system, making the credentials more likely to be recognised across different sectors.</p>  Culinary School: It is crucial that all culinary tests are graded on a consistent rubric. If two students deliver dishes of similar quality, they should both earn the badge. This uniformity builds trust in the credentialing system by affirming its fairness and&nbsp;rigour.  Creative Organisation: When evaluating creative projects, it’s essential that all judges use the same criteria to assess the submissions. This ensures that every employee who meets the standard of creativity receives recognition, maintaining the reliability of the credential across the organisation.   Viability <p>Viability deals with the practical aspects of sustaining an assessment system. This includes considerations such as the costs involved, the resources required, and the technology necessary to issue and maintain the credentials. A viable digital credential system is scalable and sustainable, capable of adapting to growing demands and evolving educational environments.</p>  Culinary School: The school needs a system that can efficiently handle various forms of assessments, from practical cooking exams to theoretical tests. This includes logistical aspects such as scheduling, recording results, and managing digital badges. The technology used must support these activities without prohibitive costs.  Creative Organisation: For a badges relating to creativity, the system should support diverse submission formats and robust communication for feedback. It must also be scalable and adaptable to accommodate a growing number of participants as the organization evolves.   Credibility as convergence <p>In both examples, credibility arises from the effective integration of validity, reliability, and viability. A credible digital credential system not only accurately and consistently evaluates and represents diverse skills — from cooking to creativity — but also operates efficiently and sustainably within its intended scope. This credibility enhances the value of a digital credential, making it a recognized and sought-after mark of achievement.</p> Next steps <p>Understanding and applying the principles of validity, reliability, and viability can enhance the effectiveness and perception of digital credentialing systems. Whether in a culinary school or a large corporation, these principles ensure that credentials issued represent genuine skills and achievements, fostering trust and respect in the digital badges awarded. Through these dual examples, this post demonstrates how these principles can be applied across various disciplines, encouraging readers to think broadly about the potential of digital credentials in their own&nbsp;fields.</p><p>Need help thinking about digital credentials in your organisation? <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/we-are-open-coop">Get in&nbsp;touch!</a></p> Related posts   <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/Badge_Project_Blueprint">Badge Project Blueprint</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/making-credentials-work-for-everyone-13bf7ae86283">Making Credentials Work for Everyone</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/a-compendium-of-credentialing-c8afe73e03bd">A Compendium of Credentialing</a>  <p>Special mention and thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paddy-craven-8544965/">Paddy Craven</a> of City &amp; Guilds, who initially pointed us in the right direction around&nbsp;this!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/building-credibility-into-digital-credentials-59945d07ace0">Building Credibility into Digital Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>ABSTRACT: Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA) is an alternative to the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach, emphasizing the importance of a robust, scalable, and expandable architecture. The MVA methodology mitigates risks associated with reputation, competitiveness, and architectural deficiencies, and fosters collaboration among competitors. Real-world examples, such as SSL/TLS and the Gordian system, illustrate the successful implementation of MVA in software development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A business methodology focused on producing a Minimum Viable Product blossomed in the 21st century. Unfortunately, it can set businesses up for future failure because it doesn’t properly define the larger architecture that is needed to evolve a product past its earliest, minimal state.</p>

 The Old Methodology: Minimum Viable Product 

<p>A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a business methodology that advocates creating the simplest possible version of a product as a first release, to see if the market responds positively, or else to understand why it doesn’t<a>1</a>. If an MVP is successful, possibly through iterations of the initial work, the product can then be grown and ultimately find large-scale success in the market.</p>

<p>Twitter has long been used as an example of an MVP that did great, with Dropbox and Facebook being other examples of MVPs<a>2</a> (to various extents). By the criteria of these companies, MVP would seem to be a win-win methodology.</p>

<p>However, they’re not the full story.</p>

 MVP Biases 

<p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, current literature about Minimum Viable Products suffers from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">Survivorship Bias</a>. We hear about the success of companies that used MVPs, but we don’t know that their doing so actually led to success. In fact, the successes that we see might just be a false signal.</p>

<p>How many hundreds or even thousands of companies pursuing MVPs failed for each Twitter or Facebook that succeeded? How many companies found that they couldn’t scale their MVP, realized that they couldn’t take commercial advantage of an otherwise successful MVP, or simply were beaten by competitors with even more viable products?</p>

<p>We can’t measure the success of the MVP methodology by the anecdotal success of a few individual companies.</p>

</blockquote>

 MVP Dangers 

<p>The MVP system also has other dangers.</p>

<p>Some of these are related to company brand. Though a new company doesn’t have a reputation to damage, a series of unsuccessful MVPs could nonetheless curtail their future opportunities. Meanwhile, a more mature company might find their existing reputation blemished by a poor MVP. This is especially true today, as companies are increasingly saying that MVPs can be poor-quality releases<a>3</a>. That didn’t work out that well for Cyberpunk 2077, one of the highest profile and most controversial computer game releases of recent years, even though (like many modern-day computer games) it wasn’t quite released as an MVP, but not in a fully complete form either<a>4</a>.</p>

<p>There are also competitive dangers. Within a developmental niche, MVPs only work if everyone pursues them; otherwise, an MVP built on solid ideas could easily be out-competed by a firm who produced a slightly more mature prototype. Similarly, a company with more resources might be able to scoop up the ideas in a MVP and replicate them to their own advantage<a>5</a>.</p>

<p>However the biggest dangers of MVPs are probably architectural. By defining an MVP, a company can easily ignore the larger architecture issues that would have once been considered before starting work on any serious release. This can cause problems with scaling, with missing features that can’t easily be added, and with locked-in decisions that become part of the final product.</p>

<p>Twitter (“X”), for example, didn’t finalize its network architecture design until 2010<a>6</a>, four years after its advent. It would have been easy for a better architected social-medium system to get in there first; the fact that no one did is one of the pieces of luck that led to Twitter’s ultimate success. In fact, one of the developers at Twitter has noted this, saying: “In the end, Twitter barely made it, and product progress was slow for years due to post facto infrastructure investment.”<a>7</a></p>

<p>The biases and dangers implicit in MVPs suggest the need to at least experiment with other methodologies for product releases. The huge problems implicit in the potential lack of architecture in an MVP also suggest what that alternative methodology should be: a Minimum Viable Architecture.</p>

 A New Methodology: Minimum Viable Architecture 

<p>Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA)<a>8</a> is a methodology that has been discussed in somewhat different forms over the last several years. It doesn’t focus on the simplest product that can be released to consumers, but instead on the simplest architecture that can support future development within a product’s technological ecosystem.</p>

<p>The goal of an MVA is still to create a product that doesn’t strain the resources of a company and that doesn’t create a situation where a company’s ultimate success or failure depends on that singular release. However, that simple product must be created with the understanding of a larger architecture that has enough flexibility<a>9</a> that designers can fill in gaps in that architecture in the future. It’s just that the decisions for filling in those gaps are delayed as much as possible<a>10</a>. It’s a melding of agile methodologies with architectural concerns.</p>

<p>Though an MVA could be created with a full understanding of future expansions that may or may not be ultimately accomodated, it’s more powerful to create an MVA that is modular and expandable — that doesn’t depend on the architect thinking of everything, but instead future-proofs itself so that the architecture could include unthought-of elements in the future. As Jorge Lebrato says: “The architecture remains cohesive and each piece cooperates with the others, despite having had different rhythms.” The best MVA is a compromise between entirely ignoring the architecture (as is likely in an MVP) and designing it entirely (which would likely result in time cost and waste)<a>11</a>.</p>

 MVA Examples 

<p>The following examples contain some real-world usages of MVA instead of MVP.</p>

 SSL/TLS 

<p>When I co-authored the TLS spec in the ’90s, I did my best to future-proof it by simultaneously constraining the design and giving it enough flexibility to be expanded in the future. This is an example of a Minimum Viable Architecture whose usefulness has proven itself: TLS is now the most deployed security system on the internet, at the heart of almost every shopping, financial, or banking transaction.</p>

<p>This future-proofing was thanks in part to our architecting elements that we suspected would be required in the future, but which couldn’t be deployed in the then-present, primarily due to CPU limitations. Perfect forward secrecy<a>12</a> is an example. Users were able to simply turn it on when its usage became viable on standard hardware platforms.</p>

<p>However, our more notable work in creating an MVA came from our inclusion of ciphersuites. These are powerful encryption and decryption rules that do the actual cryptographic work of TLS. By defining them as modular plug-ins, we supported the future innovation of TLS, even in ways that we could not envision. And, there was considerable innovation. TLS 1.2 had 37 ciphersuites, though that dropped back to five with TLS 1.3<a>13</a>.</p>

 The Gordian System 

<p></p>

<p>One of my most recent endeavors is Blockchain Commons’ Gordian system<a>14</a>, which is a layered architecture for protecting digital assets and identity that has seen early successes with the protection of seeds with systems like SSKR<a>15</a> and CSR<a>16</a> and that focuses on the Gordian Principles of independence, resilience, privacy, and openness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blockchain Commons’ Mission: Advocating for the creation of open, interoperable, secure &amp; compassionate digital infrastructure to enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to create an MVA that future-proofs the Gordian products, the Gordian architecture identifies points of potential interoperability and breaks the architecture into discrete components across those interoperable interfaces, thus allowing individual elemetns to be replaced. This was done both at the large-scale application level and at the small-scale programmatic level. It’s important everywhere.</p>

<p>At the large-scale application level, the Gordian system achieves interoperability by the careful architecting of both discrete applications and the ways that they can interact. Airgaps are a traditional methodology for introducing security into a digital asset system<a>17</a>, but the Gordian system has expanded that to include Torgaps<a>18</a>, which is a way for making transactions between connected applications both secure and non-correlatable. This modular approach is one way to enable future-proofing, and it’s only strengthed by systems such as airgaps and torgaps that tightly constrain communications between the modules.</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>At the small-scall programmatic level, the Gordian system introduces a layered stack of specifications that together enable the private and secure transmission of sensitive data. This stack includes dCBOR<a>19</a>, Bytewords<a>20</a>, URs<a>21</a>, Animated QRs<a>22</a>, Envelope<a>23</a>, Gordian Transport Protocol<a>24</a>, and Gordian Sealed Transaction Protocol<a>25</a>. Together these specifications allow for the deterministic storage of binary data (dCBOR), the alphabetic representation of binary data (Bytewords), the tagged display of that representation with functionality to support multipart data (URs), the QR display of multipart data (animated QRs), the structured &amp; smart storage of content (Envelope), the communication of Envelopes (GTP), and the secure communication of Envelopes (GSTP). But we didn’t know what all the layers would be when we got started: this is another example of future-proofing, and one that easily arises from carefully layered specifications.</p>

<p>Similarly, when Blockchain Commons creates its progressive use cases we focus first on the requirements without needing to know the technology. The technological specifics can be filled in by ourselves or individual vendors in the future.</p>

<p>By abstracting and separating architectural elements—whether they be large-scale components, layered specifications, or additional requirements found in progressive use cases—the Gordian system will be able to incorporate options that we are not even considering. The ultimate goal of all of these designs is to ensure that our MVA architecture  does not limit itself, but instead remains flexible for the future.</p>



 
    
   

 Other MVA Examples 

<p>This type of MVA thinking is a pattern that can be widely successful and that doesn’t create some of the limitations that appear in MVP thinking. For example, when I was supporting the creation of the earliest specifications for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)<a>26</a>, I was pleased to see us arrive at a compromise where core DID specifications were separated from specific DID methods and from signature suites. It’s an architecture that allows for a lot of future expansion.</p>

<p>Similarly, some of my earliest Blockchain Commons work was with a company who was adapting the Gordian architecture. Even though they weren’t planning to initially implement multi-sigs, I ensured that they don’t make decisions that would lock them out of multi-sig usage in the future, because I was thinking of a MVA that went beyond the MVP they were focused on.</p>

 Coda: The Benefits of Coopetition 

<p>It can be quite hard for a single company to figure out an MVA. Thus, it’s great to work with other companies in your technology space.</p>

<p>This is particularly true if your industry supports coopetition, where business competitors can work together for a mutually beneficial good. If an industry  supports interoperability, or one company adding services to another company’s products, then it’s a great candidate for coopetition—and thus MVAs are even more likely to be successful.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has been able to take advantage of this. A variety of companies have participated in the Gordian Developer Community community<a>27</a>, each contributing their own ideas and requirements for the Gordian architecture. In turn, they’ve then gone off and created open-source libraries that adapt the architecture<a>28</a>, before beginning work on their own wallets that use the MVA that we cooperatively designed. A not-for-profit organization can be a great support for MVA work of this type; that’s what Blockchain Commons does.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Hollowing out spaces in architectures for future development and creating flexibility for the future through modular designs are two of the most successful methods for turning an MVP into an MVA. They give you something that supports minimal investment and agile development, while simultaneously maximizing the ability to scale and expand in the future.</p>

<p>We don’t always know the right solutions. We can’t predict what will work best. So the best we can do is create architectures that won’t lock us in to specific decisions about the future. By doing so, especially by working in coopetition to do so, we also ensure that no one company will lock us or our users into futures that we don’t agree with.</p>

  <p>This article was originally drafted in 2021, and then back-burnered for various reasons. It’s been great to see a real exposion in discussion of MVA in the years since by authors such as Ekaterina Novoseltseva <a>9</a>, Jorge Labrato<a>11</a> and Murat Erder and Pierre Pureur<a>10</a>, much of which reflects my own thoughts on MVA. Hopefully that means we’re moving in this direction!</p>

<p></p>
<p>On June 18, 2024 the OpenID Foundation’s Executive Director, Gail Hodges, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RAkY_Km9m8w?si=1m2P3bIPi-NoAmZB&amp;t=11691">spoke about Digital Identity at the G20</a> during the Digital Government and Inclusion Workshop. The following are her prepared remarks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bom dia and hello. I’d first like to applaud the Brazilian Government for your impressive work on Digital Identity here, in Brazil, and your G20 leadership. Brazil is modeling the kind of multi-stakeholder approach we need to enable Digital Public Infrastructure, data sharing and Digital Identity. The G20 is ideal forum to accelerate work in this area globally.</p>
<p>Today I’d like to suggest a vision for Digital Identity. We have a UN Sustainable Development Goal 16.9 for Identity, with the principle that 8 billion people should have access to an identity credential. What should our goal be for Digital Identity? Should 8 billion people also have the right to a digital identity credential? How can we achieve social inclusion if all 8 billion do not have the option to fully participate in the digital economy?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we have a Digital Identity for everyone, what should it feel like? I suggest that it should be as easy for people to assert their Digital Identity credential as it is to assert their email or phone number.</p>
<p>It is possible to achieve these goals – the technology is not the barrier. But it will take G20 leadership, national leadership, multi-stakeholder collaboration (like our conversation today), and crucially… it will take global open standards.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is one of the open standards bodies at the center of Digital Identity specification development. We seek to offer secure and interoperable standards that respect domestic sovereignty. Our most popular standard is OpenID Connect, which is currently used by over 3 billion people across millions of applications. The OpenID Foundation also supports 28+ countries that have selected our OpenID for Verifiable Credential specifications, and another 12 countries have selected the OpenID Foundation’s high security profile for data sharing called FAPI. In fact, Brazil is one jurisdiction where FAPI was selected, and the OIDF is proud to supports Brazil’s Open Finance and Open Insurance programs by offering certification to all ecosystem participants.</p>
<p>Last year the OpenID Foundation and 12 other non-profits announced a white paper titled “<a href="https://openid.net/human-centric-digital-identity-whitepaper/">Human-Centric Digital Identity</a>” in conjunction with the OECD’s Recommendations on the Governance of Digital Identity. In that paper we recognized that countries have a mix of operating models that align to their technical implementations. Some countries lean to centralized modeled others to “decentralized” models. Some countries are government-led and others are private sector-led.&nbsp; From our vantage point all of these are legitimate models. There is no single way to develop and deliver a Digital Identity program. However, if you want to achieve social inclusion and a human-centric approach, you need to stare hard at your domestic model to ensure no one is left behind.</p>
<p>So what about your country? For those of you in countries at the start of your Digital Identity journey, I suggest you answer one critical question early on in your program development. Will you use global standards or will you develop your own local specifications? It is your choice. But I encourage you to take that decision at the most senior levels. Global standards offer you confidence in the security model, technical interoperability, the ability to scale, interoperability across borders, and it is resistant to vendor and consulting provider lock-in. Local standards could place limitations on the ability of your people and your businesses to thrive outside of the local context, and it could open you up to security threats if you become the “weakest link” relative to your peers. Even if you choose to leverage open source code, I encourage you to ensure that the open source code and your local implementations are certified as conformant to global open standards.</p>
<p>I assure you, the trend is already toward global standards. It was the rallying cry in Cape Town last month during ID4Africa. In recent weeks I was delighted to hear friends focused on the global south countries from the World Bank, UNDP, GovStack, MOSIP, Center of Digital Public Infrastructure all encouraging use of global standards and moving towards certification to global standards. Similarly, the European Digital Wallet program has been shaking up stakeholders in the global north with its Architectural Reference Framework, which leverages global standards that all EU member states will need to conform to so that European countries can interoperate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Digital Identity standards are complicated: there is not a single place or a single playbook to follow at this time. I encourage you to embrace the complexity. The strategy you develop could well include global standards from ISO, the IETF, the W3C, the OpenID Foundation, as well as best practices from other organizations like NIST to help avoid bias in your biometric algorithms – and you might want to consider using open source code to help you accelerate down the adoption curve. Either way, you are likely going to have to embrace some complexity in-house in order for your residents and businesses to benefit from simple user experiences.</p>
<p>Some of you represent countries with mature Digital Identity programs. We applaud you for being early adopters. I have a different question for you. How will you serve your residents and businesses that need to transact across borders? Is it worth investing in capabilities that will allow cross-border interoperability? You might want to ask yourselves, what percentage of your GDP is driven by cross-border trade, how important your global diaspora is, and / or how often your citizens travel abroad. Or you might look at Digital Identity in terms of how it can enhance your national security posture.&nbsp;&nbsp; With $1.4T lost annually to cybercrime globally, we all have room to improve to better protect our residents, our businesses, and our security posture. I also encourage countries with mature Digital Identity programs to take a leadership role in the work to develop global open standards, and to work on achieving cross-border interoperability of digital identity in practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; As David said in the earlier panel, the transformation and Digital Identity leadership in the global south is impressive … but global south representatives and the entities that fund their transformation are much less active in global standards bodies working on Digital Identity.</p>
<p>Earlier, I offered a vision of what good can look like: 8 billion people with Digital Identity, using their credentials seamlessly. But what does it look like when it goes wrong and we do not have global standards? One example is the train tracks where train gauges do not line up and people and goods have to move from one train to another.</p>
<p>In a new project called the Sustainable and Interoperable Digital Identity HUB or SIDI Hub, we are challenging ourselves to tackle the question of cross-border interoperability of Digital Identity. SIDI Hub is a multi-stakeholder community comprised of more than 25 countries from the global north and global south, 25 non-profits, and many of the major multinational organizations. In the last 7 months since we formed SIDI Hub, we held 3 summits on two continents, and we will have three more summit on three additional continents this year. We encourage the G20 to leverage multi-stakeholder forums like the SIDI Hub to ensure that the principles you develop can be implemented in practice, all the way down to the protocol layer, in a way that millions of developers will be able implement against those policies by default. Only then can your residents benefit from digital identity as a “public good”.</p>
<p>I will leave you with one last tip. If you want to achieve domestic or global interoperability, you need to test and certify implementations to a common specification, and then maintain conformance to that specification. When you multiply this by millions of entities — and millions of developers— testing, certification and conformance become pivotal.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>The following comments were made in response to other speakers and the Q&amp;A:</p>
<p></p>
<p>First I’d like to agree with Adam: that the critical path for any jurisdiction is domestic use cases. My ask is to ensure that each G20 jurisdiction reserve some thought for cross-border interoperability. We have heard from Adam about the progress with the EU in cross-border interoperability, and we know in the African Union they also want to enable cross-border trade and interoperability of Digital Identity deployments across Africa. From Husdon’s comments we know that Latin American interoperability is also growing in interest, and if we had an Asian representative on the panel we would probably hear the same from them.</p>
<p>I’d like to elaborate on one of the key ways we need to enable cross border Digital Identity. It starts with identifying use cases. To date with SIDI Hub we have identified 30 potential “champion” cross-border use cases. Let me offer four examples that are bubbling towards the top.</p>
 
 In Africa, the most popular use case was “cross-border trade” – helping people living lives along a geographic border, a use case that ranked lower in Europe for obvious reasons. 
 A second use case was “helping people assert their educational and employment certifications across borders” a use case that can serve all migrants whether they are high income or low income. 
 A third example is the “refugee” use case.&nbsp; UNHCR currently cares for 120 million refugees and they need to deliver on their mission to serve these individuals from the countries they originate from, through the UN system including host countries, all the way to any future destination country or back to their home jurisdiction. 
 The fourth example is “opening a bank account” which can be for students, employee relocations or any other migration use case. 
 
<p>We will not select “champion use cases” until later this year, but we already know that we need these use cases to be able to flesh out the minimum technical requirements to enable cross border interoperability and to map the trust frameworks across borders.</p>
<p>About the OpenID Foundation</p>
 The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate.

					 Centering Students and Using AI within Meaningful Learning Environments
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room B</p>
<p>“How can AI be used to enhance meaningful learning environments in culturally responsive ways? This session focuses on innovative ways AI tools can be used in the classroom to support meaningful learning experiences and culturally responsive teaching. When designing meaningful learning experiences, teachers use AI to engage students in activities that are active, collaborative, constructive, authentic, and goal directed. Culturally responsive teaching is a student centered approach that enriches how AI tools are used within meaningful learning experiences.This happens when teachers situate students’ lived experiences, frames of reference, and ways of being as resources for learning. Participants will be provided a process for designing meaningful learning experiences, a list of AI tools that promote meaningful engagement, and a culturally responsive framework that advances meaningful technology integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session also addresses educational inequities that surface when learning experiences lack meaningfulness. Teacher centered practices have historically been related to passive technology use, deficit based beliefs about students’ potential, “one size fits all” instruction, and curricular choices that do not account for diversity. As a result, teacher centered approaches have and continue to perpetuate opportunity gaps that disproportionately impact students from historically marginalized communities. To bridge digital divides and fill opportunity gaps, participants will be exposed to the strategies, beliefs, conditions, and tools that support the shift towards student centeredness. “</p>

					 Lessons Learned, Actions Unleashed: Unlocking Our Potential
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room C</p>
<p>Let’s reflect on our AI work together. We’ll use a ‘retrospective’ (a project management tool) to candidly discuss what worked well and where we can grow. We’ll focus on solutions we can control and make this a fun, collaborative conversation. We’re looking for real solutions for real people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some questions to get us started…</p>
 
  What were the outcomes of new teaching methods, tools, etc. used? Are there opportunities to refine or expand?&nbsp; 
  Let’s talk silver linings. What wisdom can we extract from decisions that didn’t quite work out? 
  Describe something you crushed! What made it a success? 
  What action items can we identify to address challenges and improve the learning environment for ourselves and our students? 
 
<p>Even if you haven’t made any groundbreaking discoveries, join us anyway.&nbsp;</p>

					 Using AI Avatar Patients to Increase Student Readiness
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room A</p>
<p>Educators need to prepare students to enter the workforce post-graduation. Student’s readiness, which includes perceptions of knowledge, attitude, and ability, manifests in one’s sense of self-efficacy and is influenced by experiences. Additionally, experiences are impacted by context-specific readiness. The Context and Implementation of Complex Interventions framework defines context as a set of characteristics and circumstances that are active, unique, and embedded in the experience. Contextual readiness includes socio-political, community, organization, financial, and learning resources and opportunities that influence the experience. Experiences should promote active learning and simulate real-world scenarios to foster student readiness appropriately. Developing and delivering real-world learning experiences presents many challenges, including contextual characteristics, limited space for hands-on engagement, increased staffing needs, scheduling conflicts, and costs associated with patient actors or experiential opportunities. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) can address these challenges. AI is a computing system that can engage in human-like processes such as learning, synthesizing, self-correction, and data integration for complex processing tasks. AI technologies generate human-like content in response to complex and varied prompts and, blended with VR, immerse the user in simulated environments to make the experience more thoughtful and interactive, allowing for repeated practice to enhance skill development, conservation of resources, and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>This panel presentation will describe the pedological design and implementation of AI avatar patients into healthcare interprofessional curricula. It will present data on financial impact and students’ perceived readiness post-AI-VR experiences and offer recommendations for future integration into the broader educational curriculum.&nbsp;</p>

   Self-sovereign identity centers on placing data control squarely in the hands of individuals. The goal is to rectify a mistake that has grown exponentially since the late 90s—the dominance of certain companies over personal information.&nbsp; 
 The current model has data providers sending to data consumers directly, for the most part, with little to no consent from the data subjects themselves in

<p>Partnership aims to unlock up to $1.3 trillion of dormant Layer 1 Value, as US consumers get excited about the 3rd Age of Bitcoin</p>
<p>Location, Singapore, June 27th 2024: Elastos, the SmartWeb ecosystem provider, has announced a partnership with the L2 provider, BEVM, to develop a peer-to-peer Bitcoin-denominated loan offering around the former’s BeL2 protocol. Together the companies believe they can unlock up to $1.3 Trillion of dormant Layer 1 Bitcoin Value, which is supported by data from the latest <a></a>Elastos’ BIT (Bitcoin; Innovation &amp; Trust) Index suggesting more than two-thirds of US tech-savvy consumers are comfortable using Bitcoin.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Collateralize 80% of assets while the Bitcoin Layer is untouched 
<p>Elastos believes momentum is building around the Third Age of Bitcoin, where users will be able to transact using Native Bitcoin. Partnering with BEVM to develop this Bitcoin Native loan product will allow users to collateralize up to 80% of their assets in return for L2 credit (stable coins, for instance) based on terms defined in a Bitcoin-assured smart contract. The integrity of the currency is assured by BeL2’s unique ZK-proof process which means the Bitcoin Layer is untouched as the process can be completed without bridging, wrapping or otherwise interfering with the Bitcoin Layer. This maintains the integrity of the currency and avoids network congestion and additional fees that would otherwise result. This approach enables Elastos and BEVM to deliver a genuinely peer-to-peer loan product, which is completely disintermediated and anonymous. &nbsp;Verification (potentially through third party services) and resulting costs/delays would only be required in the event of a dispute between the two parties.</p>
<p>“The BeL2 protocol perfectly reflects what BEVM is all about; developing and supporting EVM-compatible DApps which can run in the Ethereum ecosystem to operate on Bitcoin L2. &nbsp;The loan offering is the perfect illustration of how such services could revolutionize the finance sector,” Hakan Sezikli, Co-founder of the BEVM Foundation.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Enabling Insight via BTC Oracle 
<p>Launched in December ’23, the <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastos-bel2-bitcoin-layer-2-solution/">Bitcoin Elastos Layer2</a> (BeL2) protocol is a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, enabling multiple functionalities such as staking and smart contracts to be denominated directly in the World’s most popular digital currency. BEVM will be collaborating with the Elastos’ BeL2 protocol to deliver a BTC Oracle to monitor and analyze all Bitcoin-based activity in real time. &nbsp;As the BeL2 protocol enables Bitcoin users to manage, literally, any relationship through the currency – from simple staking (‘interest’), to complex multi-party agreements through smart contracts – the BTC Oracle will become a vital source of insight into how the currency is being used.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 US tech-savvy consumers trust Bitcoin 
<p>This partnership comes as new data from the Elastos’ BIT (Bitcoin; Innovation &amp; Trust) Index indicates growing excitement among US tech-savvy consumers for Bitcoin. 63% of ‘tech savvy’ consumers feel either ‘perfectly comfortable’ or, even, ‘excited’ about transacting in Bitcoin and over half respondents in the US are using Bitcoin at least once a month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Respondents to the survey also suggest they trust Bitcoin as much as online banking or cash to protect savings:</p>
 
 24% US respondents would place most trust in Bitcoin 
 Compared with 25% who place most trust in online banks 
 23% who place their trust in cash 
 
<p></p>
<p>“What this data shows is that we’re reaching an inflection point in the understanding and embrace of crypto-currencies among early adopters in the US that reflects the global trend towards the Third Age of Bitcoin,” said Rong Chen, co-founder, Elastos. “We are on the verge of Bitcoin delivering a new era commerce, where users are in charge of their data and are no longer beholden to the Web 2 tech giants. This data shows there is work to do to encourage broader adoption in the US, but at Elastos it is our mission to develop technologies that will make it easier to interact and transact with Bitcoin.”</p>
<p></p>

<p>Policy experts from Africa, Europe, Latin America, and North America outlined next steps for global AI regimes and networked capacity&nbsp;building</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@nasa?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">NASA</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/photo-of-outer-space-Q1p7bh3SHj8?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a><p>By Lis Sylvan &amp; Niharika Vattikonda</p><p>Nearly a year and a half after the introduction of ChatGPT, artificial intelligence remains in the regulatory hot seat. While the EU AI Act put the so-called Brussels Effect into play, more regions across the globe are now weighing risks, rights, economic opportunities, and regional needs. On May 28th, the <a href="https://networkofcenters.net/">Global Network of Centers of Internet &amp; Society Research Centers</a> (NoC) and the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> at Harvard University (BKC) hosted a group of policy experts from Africa, Latin America, the US, and the EU to discuss this state of global AI regulation and outline next steps for collaboration across continents.</p><p>Lis Sylvan, Senior Director of Strategy and Programming at BKC, moderated the discussion with Carlos Affonso de Souza (Director of the Institute of Technology and Society of Rio de Janeiro), Mason Kortz (Clinical Instructor at the Cyberlaw Clinic at BKC), Gabriele Mazzini (European Commission, chief architect of the EU AI Act), and Ridwan Oloyede (Certa Foundation, coauthor of their recent “State of AI Regulation in Africa” report), with NoC Executive Director Armando Guio providing behind-the-scenes support. The group delved into how governments are weighing sectoral versus horizontal regulatory approaches; the role of the administrative state and existing data protection and competition regulators; the new models of AI regulation in Rwanda and Brazil; the impact of the EU AI Act across all jurisdictions; and the potential for truly global governance.</p> Origins and Approaches <p>De Souza contextualized the current moment of global AI regulation as a decade-long journey of AI regulation that started with charters and declarations of governing principles from various governments and entities. Over time, those charters and principles were reflected in national AI strategies, which have been in the works for five years and can be seen as the precursor to AI regulation; Brazil’s AI regulatory evolution, for example, closely followed this time frame. De Souza highlighted the impact of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on this evolution; after GDPR took effect, countries have established data protection authorities that have largely been the main point of contact for early AI governance. As a result of GDPR, he said, “data protection may be an accelerator, may be an entry point for countries in the majority world, because that’s the conversation that we have been having in the last decade, and that’s where resources [and] attention had been moving forward in those countries.” However, he cautioned against using data protection law as the sole basis of AI regulation, because the data protection framework does not necessarily address the full scope of challenges raised by the development of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Mazzini explained that the technical discussions about the EU’s proposed AI legislation date back to 2019. One of the key concerns with a sectoral approach, he said, was the risk of privileging certain sectors over others. The horizontal approach, though, results in added complexity as regulators needed to find regulations that would work across sectors and avoid repetitions; moreover, the scope of EU legislation is limited by the exclusion of national security, military, and defense sectors. While the EU AI Act takes an omnibus approach, Mazzini said it did not make sense to regulate AI as its own technology but rather a general-purpose tool with a variety of applications.</p><p>“What was clear to me since the get-go is that It didn’t make sense to regulate AI as a technology as such, because indeed what we are dealing with is a general purpose technology that has a variety of applications that we don’t even foresee today…” said Mazzini, “…and therefore, from my perspective, the idea to establish rules for the technology as such, regardless of its use, didn’t make any sense…We came up with this approach of establishing rules depending on the specific use to which that account is put, with the greatest burden, from a regulatory point of view, being on the high risk,” which Mazzini outlined to include applications of the technology that are linked to health and safety, including medical devices, automated cars, and&nbsp;drones.</p> Sectoral and Regional Approaches <p>In the U.S. and in the African Union, regulatory agencies have found it more effective to apply existing laws — across data protection, competition, consumer protection, employment, and other sectors — to govern AI, often taking a sectoral approach. Oloyede said that data protection authorities and competition authorities have largely driven the initial AI regulatory agenda, as these authorities are best equipped to enforce consumer protection, data protection, intellectual property, and competition laws as the basis for national AI governance strategies. “We might see some sort of like a clearinghouse model image where not every country in Africa, for example, will try to come up with a specific AI regulation,” Oloyede&nbsp;said.</p><p>Oloyede indicated that the sector-based approach has been dominant on the African continent, with countries including Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Rwanda, and Egypt beginning to develop roadmaps for AI governance and establish regulatory task forces. Oloyede said the sectoral approach has allowed regulators to develop specific policies for the deployment of AI in healthcare, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>According to Mason Kortz, this sectoral approach is typically favored in the U.S. because the U.S. regulatory approach values subject-matter expertise over technical expertise. The U.S. will likely have subject-matter experts regulate AI in their own domains, Kortz said — for example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development would regulate AI for housing. The U.S. approach relies on the country’s strong administrative state and directs specific federal agencies to take on different pieces of AI regulation. Meanwhile, certain state laws have sought to regulate specific use cases of AI in housing and employment contexts.</p><p>Kortz also noted that the current approach in the U.S. is a confirmation that existing rights-based regimes will be applied or extended to harms resulting from the use of AI systems; with a notoriously slow legislature, he said, only making small changes as needed is an advantageous approach, particularly when existing enforcement agencies may already have the power to make those changes. The U.S. common law system is well-suited to this approach, he said, as it lends judges relatively strong power to reinterpret the law in ways that are binding on lower courts without necessarily having to rewrite civil&nbsp;code.</p><p>“When it comes to some of the more rights-based statutes we have,” Kortz said, “I think, actually, we have a pretty good governance model right there, and we just need some small adjustments around the edges to modernize those statutes and bring them in line, not just with AI, but hopefully, if not future-proof them, at least provide a little more stability for whatever comes next after AI.” However, Kortz allowed that AI is so fundamentally transformative that certain existing laws, such as intellectual property law and copyright doctrine, may not be enough and global harmonization of AI laws should be a priority.</p> Global Collaboration and&nbsp;Capacity <p>Oloyede indicated that African countries have introduced solutions at the level of the Global Privacy Congress, although these solutions will need to reflect differing national and regional interests. Mazzini noted that generative AI and general-purpose AI create additional issues that require international collaboration — fighting misinformation, he said, will require such collaboration. However, de Souza cautioned that regulatory transformation must keep in mind how those laws will be applied in the future. In some cases, he noted, new liability regimes for AI are now stricter than the remaining body of law; Costa Rica, for example, has adopted a strict liability approach for high-risk uses of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>“If we turn out to have the chapters of liability on our AI laws more severe than what we have in our general law for other situations, if we are all in agreement that, in the future, AI is going to be in everything, the legislators that are designing those laws today, they are designing general laws on liability, because we will have AI in almost all sectors,” de Souza remarked. “So the decisions that we’re making today on liability, they might end up scrapping the provisions that you have on your civil code, consumer protection code, because the AI law will be the law that is more recent, more specific, and that may be the one that will be applying in most&nbsp;cases.”</p><p>This international collaboration will require capacity building across the globe, and Mazzini emphasized that the EU AI Act has prompted additional work to support the authorities in the EU that will implement and enforce the regulation. Although the AI Act will impact multiple private sectors, he said, its public enforcement will require both financial and knowledge-based resources. De Souza noted that the Brussels Effect will prompt a need for global bureaucracy to support global compliance with the EU AI Act, and well-resourced national authorities are needed to support that implementation. Oloyede, however, said that lessons learned from the GDPR rollout may inform a better approach to implementing the EU AI Act with a more nuanced understanding of the local context. While the EU AI Act will require capacity building to support new governance bodies with funding and resources, he said, it is essential to preserve existing collaborations with data protection and competition authorities and empower those authorities to address AI in their own&nbsp;domains.</p><p>Despite different countries taking more sectoral versus horizontal approaches, the global community is working to establish flexible approaches to AI governance in their respective regions. As Oloyede said, “AI is here today. Tomorrow is going to be a different technology. And we can’t keep legislating for every new technology that we have.” Mazzini described a need for international coordination when he said, “when it comes to this new type of AI that is sometimes is called ‘generative AI’ or ‘general purpose AI’ that we have specifically regulated in the EU — notably in the last few weeks, in final stages of the negotiations — I think I would like to see there certainly more international coordination, because there we are dealing with a number of questions that I think are pretty common across jurisdictions.”</p><p>Though approaches across the globe may be different, a common cross-cutting theme of the work is balance: protecting rights versus supporting innovation, legislating a critical technology while its capacity and impact is still developing, and providing necessary limitations while allowing nimble innovation.</p><p>The <a href="https://networkofcenters.net/">Network of Internet &amp; Society Research Centers (NoC)</a> is a collaborative initiative among academic institutions with a focus on interdisciplinary research on the development, social impact, policy implications, and legal issues concerning the Internet. The Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University served as NoC Secretariat from 2020–2023 and continues to participate in cross-national, cross-disciplinary conversation, debate, teaching, learning, and engagement.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/global-ai-regulation-protecting-rights-leveraging-collaboration-b0da8e6a704d">Global AI Regulation: Protecting Rights; Leveraging Collaboration</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

		<p>Dear Edge Community,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well. As we continue to adapt to the industry changes brought about by VMware’s acquisition by Broadcom, I want to share some important updates and reaffirm our dedication to assisting you through these transitions.</p>
<p>Pricing Changes Post-Acquisition: Following Broadcom’s post-acquisition adjustments to VMware’s licensing, contracting, and operational model, Edge will no longer manage an Enterprise Licensing Agreement (ELA) on behalf of our members. As a result, Edge will not be responsible for negotiating pricing, co-terming licensing dates, or participating in the quoting and billing process.</p>
<p>VMware Horizon Update: VMware Horizon is becoming a new organization, separate from VMware/Broadcom, called Omnissa. Licensing for Horizon must be procured separately from VMware and can also be fulfilled by partners like Carahsoft.</p>
<p>What This Means for Members:</p>
<p>Members will need to procure Broadcom/VMware licensing through standard reseller channels. Discounting will be determined by negotiations between each member and Broadcom/the reseller.</p>
<p>Edge still has procurement vehicles available for members to quickly process orders. These include:</p>
 
 The EdgeMarket TeCHS contract, fulfilled by SHI. 
 Other preferred resellers through our convenience contract via Carahsoft. 
 
<p>Additionally, Carahsoft will continue to assist the VMware reseller community in preparing your pricing and quotes.</p>

<p>Nick Price, who co-chairs DIF’s Travel &amp; Hospitality SIG and Nick Lambert, CEO of DIF member Dock Labs explored the potential for decentralized identity to revolutionize the traveler experience during a discussion with Rob Otto of Ping Identity, Cadrick Widmann of cidas and Roger Olivieira, co founder of Ver.id at EIC in Berlin last week.&nbsp;</p><p>Nick Price: “Hotels are still stressed about verifying and storing passport information. They have a very large number of customers on file, and a very low amount of usable information. You’re not surprised when they ask whether you have stayed before, though you’ve stayed many times. Decentralized identity promises a substantial improvement in these areas.&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of the valuable information that makes travel work will be self-attested. Travel is not just about crossing the border or making a transaction, it’s about 'This is me, I'm a vegetarian, I like some extra legroom on the flight', et cetera. </p><p>"Travel companies need that information. The customer wants to give it to us, but they don’t currently have the tools to do it. This is exactly what we’re building for a large project in the Middle East: a decentralized identity journey for the traveler across airlines, transport, hotels and the tourism experience.” </p><p>Rob Otto: “What consumers really want is a value exchange. When I give you my data, use it to improve my experience. Maybe I even want the hotel to know how I'm feeling today, so I present an 'introvert or extrovert' credential.”&nbsp;</p><p>"You don’t need decentralized identity to figure out someone is staying at a hotel for the tenth time, you just need a system that isn’t stupid.”&nbsp;</p><p>Nick Lambert: “People do care about privacy, but it’s incumbent on us to provide that control over their data. For example, if you want to book a hotel or hire a car, you only want to provide the information the hotel or car hire company needs. </p><p>"From an organizational perspective, holding all that data centrally is a honeypot for hackers to target and sell, as well as a GDPR / CCPA compliance risk. Companies are keen to get rid of the liability and pass it over to customers."&nbsp;</p><p>Roger Olivieira: “There are new regulations coming up where you won’t be allowed to store this data any more. Digital wallets are a good solution. They do three things very well: authentication, consent and digital signatures." </p><p>Cadrick Widmann: “But it’s hard for users to download a wallet just for one use case.”</p><p>Nick Lambert: “True. The user experience needs to be better than what exists today. For example, staff at Condatis (an Edinburgh-based CIAM provider, and DIF member) use decentralized identity to enter the office and access systems remotely, which is great. The challenge is integration with legacy systems.”</p><p>Roger Olivieira: “We solve that problem by putting a service provider between wallets and platforms, using common protocols like AuthO / OpenID Connect."&nbsp;</p><p></p>

 How to think about the three-sided marketplace of skills validation CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>After more than a decade of working with digital credentials like <a href="https://openbadges.org/">Open Badges</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a>, we still sometimes hear the sceptical question: “Who’s asking for&nbsp;this?”</p><p>While digital credentials offer far more than just helping people into a job, this remains a significant and powerful use case. However, creating an ecosystem where this is not only possible but also straightforward takes time. It’s a complex, three-sided challenge that requires more than simply asking users what they want; it involves anticipating their needs and providing innovative solutions that work for everyone involved.</p> The Appeal of Credentials <p>People and organisations are often attracted to digital credentials for their potential to recognise and validate a broad range of skills and achievements. They can help democratise learning, making it accessible and recognisable beyond traditional educational settings. For learners, these kind badges represent an opportunity to showcase their skills in a way that is immediately recognisable — and verifiable.</p> Challenges <p>Despite the initial excitement, many individuals and organisations find themselves asking, “Now what?” In our experience, this question stems from several challenges. Earners can sometimes have a lack of clarity on how to effectively use badges in practice, and so struggle to see how these credentials translate into real-world opportunities.</p>CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Issuers such as educational institutions and other organisations may find it difficult to convince stakeholders of the value of alternative credentials. Meanwhile, employers may exhibit uncertainty about the validity and relevance of these badges, leading to hesitation in recognising them as part of the hiring or promotion process.</p> Understanding the Three-Sided Marketplace <p>To address these challenges, it’s important to understand the interplay between the three main groups involved: earners, issuers, and employers.</p>  Earners: These are individuals who seek to acquire credentials to validate their skills and knowledge. A <a href="https://www.jff.org/jobseekers-want-digital-credentials-for-skill-sharing-are-employers-ready/">significant proportion are already using digital credentials</a> in the application process, with their main concern being whether these badges will be recognised and valued by employers and educational institutions.  Issuers: These include schools, universities, and other organisations that award credentials. Their challenge is to establish the credibility and relevance of their badges as a form of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markcperna/2022/07/25/workforce-credentials-are-going-digital-heres-why-this-helps-everyone/?sh=58d6ec8673e3">skills currency</a>.  Employers: These are the entities looking to hire or promote individuals with verified skills. <a href="https://www.aacu.org/research/falling-short-college-learning-and-career-success">Fewer than half of employers</a> say that they find university transcripts useful in helping them to evaluate job applicant’s potential to succeed at their company. So they need a quick and easy way to verify skills in a way that is a reliable indicator of&nbsp;ability.   Shifting the&nbsp;Question <p>So, rather than asking, “Who’s asking for this?” perhaps we should instead focus on understanding the needs and motivations of each group in this marketplace. By shifting our perspective, we can better appreciate the value of credentials and work towards making them more effective.</p><p>Just look at the progress we’ve made as an ecosystem:</p><p>✅ Clear value proposition — digital credentials offer tangible benefits, like <a href="https://digitalpromise.org/2024/04/11/unlocking-the-benefits-5-key-reasons-for-earning-micro-credentials/">job opportunities and career advancement</a>, by validating a wide range of skills. Secure, digital wallets make it possible for earners to feel like they truly own and control their credentials.</p><p>✅ Widespread adoption and recognition — increasing numbers of institutions and employers are recognising and accepting digital credentials, thanks to the work of organisations such as the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu">Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC), <a href="https://www.jff.org/">Jobs for the Future</a>, and <a href="https://www.thersa.org/design-for-life-our-mission/hubs/cities-of-learning/create-digital-badges-and-pathways">The&nbsp;RSA</a>.</p><p>✅ Robust technology infrastructure — advanced platforms and secure technologies are being developed to support issuing, verification, and management of digital credentials, based on foundational work of standards organisations <a href="https://www.1edtech.org/">1EdTech</a> and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>​.</p><p>✅ Collaboration between key industry bodies — industry leaders, educational institutions, and technology providers are working together to standardise and promote the use of digital credentials. See, for example, the work around <a href="https://www.skillsfwd.org/">SkillsFWD</a>, <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/">Opportunity@Work</a>, and the <a href="https://www.t3networkhub.org/">T3 Innovation Network</a>, and networking at events such as <a href="https://www.thebadgesummit.com/">The Badge Summit</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://epic.openrecognition.org/">ePIC</a>.</p><p>✅ Data standards and taxonomies — establishing consistent data standards and taxonomies helps in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">creating interoperable systems</a> where credentials can be easily shared and verified across different platforms. Credential Engine has developed the <a href="https://credentialengine.org/credential-transparency/ctdl/">Credential Transparency Description Language</a> (CTDL), supporting comparability across credential types and providers.</p><p>A huge amount of funding and effort has gone into getting us to this place. It’s going to take more money and time to get us over the line, so where should we focus our attention?</p> Creating Value for All&nbsp;Sides CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>To make digital credentials truly valuable for jobseekers, we need to address the concerns of all three&nbsp;groups:</p>  For earners: Credentials should lead to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">tangible benefits</a>, such as job opportunities or career advancement. We need clear pathways for using certain types of badges, with examples of how and where digital credentials have successfully led to job offers or promotions.  For issuers: It is crucial to developing robust standards such as <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/why-open-badges-3-0-matters-09bb231be864">Open Badges 3.0</a> to promote the credibility of their badges. Issuers can collaborate with industry leaders to ensure their credentials remain relevant and respected, as well as regularly updating the criteria for earning these badges based on industry&nbsp;needs.  For employers: Providing tools and frameworks to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-future-of-trust-in-professional-networks-4e75f09286b2">easily interpret and trust</a> these badges will encourage wider acceptance and use. Employers can partner with educational institutions to co-create badges and/or develop practical tests to verify the skills claimed by the credentials.   Final Thoughts <p>In summary, the question “Who’s asking for this?” may not be the most productive one. Instead, we should focus on understanding the interconnected roles of earners, issuers, and employers in the credentialing process. By doing so, we can move beyond the trough of disillusionment and realise the full potential of these <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/creating-a-culture-of-recognition-39ffdb6cf943">new forms of recognition</a>.</p><p>At WAO, we’ve been working closely with the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC) on storytelling and communications strategies that help everyone <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-to-find-the-right-mental-models-for-your-audience-c68097a7f0ed">understand and embrace</a> the value of digital credentials. The DCC is a key player in the ecosystem, and one of a number of organisations helping build a future where Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials are a natural and trusted part of the hiring&nbsp;process.</p><p>🔥 Do you need help with digital credentials?

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> (“coming in beta this fall<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/?cid=wwa-us-kwbi-features-slid--Brand-AppleIntellligence-Announce-&amp;mtid=20925e1t39169&amp;aosid=p238&amp;mnid=nHJFhcGO-dc_mtid_20925e1t39169_pcrid_78134256302923_pgrid_1250146041615591_&amp;msclkid=fb43aa7f55c8150c7b4ecc171ee3e360#footnote-1">*</a>“), announced yesterday, will help you with writing and creating images while giving you less lame answers from Siri. (Which they should re-name. Siri is Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/?cid=wwa-us-kwbi-features-slid--Brand-AppleIntellligence-Announce-&amp;mtid=20925e1t39169&amp;aosid=p238&amp;mnid=nHJFhcGO-dc_mtid_20925e1t39169_pcrid_78134256302923_pgrid_1250146041615591_&amp;msclkid=fb43aa7f55c8150c7b4ecc171ee3e360#footnote-1">Clippy</a>.) It “can draw on larger server-based models, running on Apple silicon, to handle more complex requests for you while protecting your privacy.” The “larger models” will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24174786/apple-openai-partnership-chatgpt-wwdc">white-labeled ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://x.com/maxwinebach/status/1800277157135909005">plus Apple’s own small language models</a> (SLMs).</p>
<p>Mozilla, which <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/mozilla-signs-lucrative-3-year-google-search-deal-for-firefox">got $400+ million a year from Google (for search in the Firefox browser) starting in 2020</a>, announce on June 3 that they will be <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-builders-accelerator/">Building open, private AI with the Mozilla Builders Accelerator</a>. Jive:</p>
<blockquote><p>This program is designed to empower independent AI and machine learning engineers with the resources and support they need to thrive. It aims to cultivate a more innovative AI ecosystem, and it’s one of&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozillas-biggest-ai-moments/">Mozilla’s key initiatives</a>&nbsp;to make AI meaningfully impactful — alongside efforts like&nbsp;<a href="http://mozilla.ai/">Mozilla.ai</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-launches-responsible-ai-challenge/">Responsible AI Challenge</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-rise25-ai-nominations/">Rise25 Awards</a>.</p>
<p>The Mozilla Builders Accelerator’s inaugural theme is local AI, which involves running AI models and applications directly on personal devices like laptops, smartphones, or edge devices rather than depending on cloud-based services…</p>
<p>We chose Local AI as the theme for the Accelerator’s first cohort because it aligns with our core values of privacy, user empowerment, and open source innovation. This method offers several benefits including:</p>
 
 Privacy:&nbsp;Data stays on the local device, minimizing exposure to potential breaches and misuse. 
 Agency:&nbsp;Users have greater control over their AI tools and data. 
 Cost-effectiveness:&nbsp;Reduces reliance on expensive cloud infrastructure, lowering costs for developers and users. 
 Reliability:&nbsp;Local processing ensures continuous operation even without internet connectivity. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Looks to me like both of these are Big AI writ small. It’s “local,” not personal. It’s made to serve your needs with what BigAI offers through APIs. It is still essentially AIaaS (AI as a Service), rather than truly personal AI (pAI): <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/10/personal-vs-personalized/">personalized</a> more than personal.</p>
<p>That’s also what I see when I read between the lines at <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/mozillaai/">Mozilla’s AI job openings</a>. Take <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/mozillaai/jobs/4357000007">platform engineer</a>. This person will (among other things), “assist in managing and orchestrating workloads across multiple cloud providers.” That’s fine. I’m sure true pAIs will do that too. But most of pAI will be more personal than that. It will deal with the mundanities of your everyday life. Not with coughing up answers that can only come from AIaaSes.</p>
<p>The problem with personalizing AI giant offerings is that they are large language models (LLM) trained on everything that can be crawled on the Internet, plus who knows what else. Not on your truly personal stuff. This is why “prompt engineering” worthy of the noun is ” <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04444">not for anybody</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prompt engineering is crucial for deploying LLMs but is poorly understood mathematically. We formalize LLM systems as a class of discrete stochastic dynamical systems to explore prompt engineering through the lens of control theory. We investigate the reachable set of output token sequences $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ for which there exists a control input sequence $\mathbf u$ for each $\mathbf y \in R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ that steers the LLM to output $\mathbf y$ from initial state sequence $\mathbf x_0$. We offer analytic analysis on the limitations on the controllability of self-attention in terms of reachable set, where we prove an upper bound on the reachable set of outputs $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ as a function of the singular values of the parameter matrices. We present complementary empirical analysis on the controllability of a panel of LLMs, including Falcon-7b, Llama-7b, and Falcon-40b. Our results demonstrate a lower bound on the reachable set of outputs $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ w.r.t. initial state sequences $\mathbf x_0$ sampled from the Wikitext dataset. We find that the correct next Wikitext token following sequence $\mathbf x_0$ is reachable over 97% of the time with prompts of $k\leq 10$ tokens. We also establish that the top 75 most likely next tokens, as estimated by the LLM itself, are reachable at least 85% of the time with prompts of $k\leq 10$ tokens. Intriguingly, short prompt sequences can dramatically alter the likelihood of specific outputs, even making the least likely tokens become the most likely ones. This control-centric analysis of LLMs demonstrates the significant and poorly understood role of input sequences in steering output probabilities, offering a foundational perspective for enhancing language model system capabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>But all that stuff applies mostly when we’re prompting a big LLM system.</p>
<p>What about using AI in our own lives, where the data that matters most are in our calendars, contacts, financial and health records, our travels, our correspondence (email, chat, whatever)? And how about all the location data we might get from our cars, phone apps, and phone companies? These should be much easier for a pAI to gather, examine, and help us do useful things. Caring about much less data also means a pAI will be less likely to give wrong (hallucinated) answers.</p>
<p>Today the mental frame almost everybody uses for AI is the Big kind, ingesting everything they can get their crawlers on, and munching all of it in giant compute farms. Those systems are great for lots of stuff, but they still don’t deal with personal data listed in the last paragraph.</p>
<p>Not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>Look at it this way. For each of us, there are three data pools:</p>
 
 The entire Net, which is what gets crawled by all the giant LLM operators, plus whatever else they can get their claws on. 
 One’s personal life, some of which is digitized in useful form (contacts, calendar, mail, stuff in folders inside PCs and attached drives). 
 Personal data that is in the hands of giants, but is rightfully ours. These include our driving record and driving practices (,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html">recorded by our late model cars and snitched to insurance companies and others</a>), our location data (kept and shared by car and phone carriers to the likes <a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/09/30/theres-a-multibillion-dollar-market-for-your-phones-location-data">of Google</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/how-federal-government-buys-our-cell-phone-location-data">the feds</a>), our TV viewing habits, (<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-stop-smart-tvs-from-snooping-on-you">gathered</a> by Google, Amazon, Roku, Apple, etc.). 
 
<p>The pAI greenfield is with the last two.</p>
<p>Tell us who is working on what there, preferably with open source, and not sitting on walled garden silicon.</p>
<p>[Later… ] Since readers told me I had small language models (SLMs) wrong in one of the paragraphs above, and I’m not sure I had them right, I rewrote them out of the piece. I invite readers to post comments to further correct and expand on the subject of pAIs and what they can do.</p>

<p>The BeL2 team is excited to announce the latest update to our Bitcoin-Elastos Layer 2 (BeL2) ecosystem: the Loan App Demo 0.2, now live at <a href="https://lending.bel2.org/">lending.bel2.org</a>. This update is a significant step forward in integrating Bitcoin with smart contract functionalities, enhancing both usability and security. Please remember this is a demo app today and not commercial, it is being built to showcase the underlying BeL2 technology as part of the larger roadmap. Let’s jump straight in!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s New in Loan App Demo 0.2 
  
<p>Since the last production release, showcased in Hong Kong, BeL2 has introduced several enhancements to improve user experience and functionality:</p>
 
 Enhanced Order Details: Comprehensive order details now include the status of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). 
 Manual BTC Transfer Confirmation: Borrowers and lenders can manually confirm BTC transfers before ZKP completion, saving time. 
 Tip Functionality: Borrowers and lenders can provide tips to each other to encourage faster confirmations. 
 Lender Time Unlock Branch 3: Adds flexibility for lenders. 
 Wallet Compatibility: Unisat is now supported throughout the entire process, expanding beyond the Essentials wallet. 
 Dynamic Timelock Values: The UI now dynamically follows timelocks provided by the contract, no longer relying on hardcoded values. 
 Repayment Countdown Bug Fix: Addressed the repayment countdown duration bug. 
 Order Cancellation: Lenders can cancel an order if it remains unpaid for more than six hours. 
 New Order Status Filter: A new “ongoing” status filter has been added. 
 Bug Fixes: Various minor bugs have been resolved. 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Updates to Essentials Wallet 
<p>To support the BeL2 loan app, Essentials has also received crucial updates:</p>
 
 Direct APK Download: Android users can now download the latest version (3.1.5) directly from <a href="https://d.web3essentials.io/">d.web3essentials.io</a>. 
 iOS Version Update: The iOS version has been updated and is available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/web3-essentials-crypto-wallet/id1568931743">App Store</a>. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 BeL2: Expanding Bitcoin’s Capabilities 
<p>BeL2 enhances Bitcoin’s scalability, programmability, and privacy, leveraging the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) while preserving Bitcoin’s integrity. BeL2 enables Bitcoin to interact with smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology.</p>
<p></p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Decentralised Loan App 
<p>The Loan App on BeL2 allows Bitcoin holders to use their BTC as collateral for loans in USDT. Key features include:</p>
 
 BTC as Collateral: Users lock their BTC in a smart contract to borrow USDT. 
 Fixed Interest Rates: Protection against crypto market volatility. 
 No Forced Liquidations: Safeguards against violent price fluctuations. 
 Smart Contract Automation: Ensures predictable, automated repayment schedules. 
 Relayers and ZKPs: Enhance security and privacy in transactions. 
 
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Vision Forward 
<p>BeL2’s focus is on refining its technology and providing robust SDKs for developers to build a wide array of financial applications on top of Bitcoin, executable on EVM ecosystems like Elastos Smart Chain. They are focused on continuously enhancing the efficiency and security of our ZKP mechanisms and optimise smart contract performance for seamless integration across blockchain ecosystems. The team are developing next comprehensive Software Development Kits (SDKs) to simplify the process of building financial applications on BeL2. These SDKs will include:</p>
 
 Smart Contract Templates: Pre-built templates for common financial applications. 
 API Integrations: Easy-to-use APIs for integrating Bitcoin with other blockchain ecosystems. 
 Developer Tools: Advanced debugging and testing tools. 
 Documentation and Tutorials: Extensive documentation and tutorials to guide developers. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Building a Financial Ecosystem 
<p>The Loan App serves as a framework for developing various financial applications, demonstrating how Bitcoin can be used as collateral within a decentralised financial ecosystem. Potential applications include:</p>
 
 Decentralised Exchanges (DEXs): Platforms for trading cryptocurrencies without a centralised intermediary. 
 Lending Platforms: Smart contract-based lending services with APR. 
 Payment Solutions: Enabling businesses to accept native Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for online platforms. 
 Investment Platforms: Decentralised platforms for investing in various assets using Bitcoin’s security and liquidity. 
 
<p>We invite the Elastos community to explore the capabilities of the Loan App Demo 0.2 and experience the integration of Bitcoin with smart contracts on the Elastos Smart Chain. Your participation and feedback are invaluable as we continue to innovate and expand the BeL2 ecosystem.</p>
<p>Join us at <a href="https://lending.bel2.org/">lending.bel2.org</a> and be part of the future where Bitcoin gains new functionalities and applications through BeL2. Together, we are building a more robust and decentralised financial landscape.</p>

<p>This document intends to provide a comprehensive understanding of attestation’s role in enhancing and advancing the digital security landscape, specifically with respect to authentication. It focuses on the core function of attestation: verifying the origin and integrity of user devices and their authentication materials. FIDO credentials are discussed with a focus on how they offer more secure alternatives than traditional password-based systems and how FIDO attestation enhances authentication security for both Relying Parties (RPs) and end-users. In this document, RPs are those entities that provide websites, applications and online services that require the need for secure user access by confirming the identity of users or other entities. FIDO Alliance’s historical journey is presented with practical analogies for understanding FIDO attestation, its enterprise-specific technical solutions, and privacy aspects involved in the attestation process.</p>



<p>Targeted for CISOs, security engineers, architects, and identity engineers, this white paper serves as a guide for professionals considering the adoption of FIDO within their enterprise ecosystem. Readers should possess a baseline understanding of FIDO technologies, the meaning of attestation, and have a desire to understand why and how to implement attestation.</p>

<p>New Committee Specification from the CACAO TC</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that CACAO Security Playbooks Version 2.0 from the OASIS Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) for Cyber Security TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) is a schema and taxonomy for cybersecurity playbooks. The CACAO specification describes how these playbooks can be created, documented, and shared in a structured and standardized way across organizational boundaries and technological solutions. This specification defines the CACAO Layout Extension for the purpose of visually representing CACAO playbooks accurately and consistently across implementations.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>CACAO Layout Extension Version 1.0<br>Committee Specification 01<br>04 April 2024</p>

<p>DIF's ED Kim Hamilton Duffy, Wayne Chang, CEO of SpruceID and Professor Linda Jeng, a lawyer, former financial regulator and founder of Digital Self Labs, took to the stage at EIC to discuss how Decentralized Identity (DI) can help mitigate threats posed by Large Language Models (LLMs), ably moderated by KuppingerCole's Anne Bailey. </p><p>The panelists' thoughts on the nature and scale of the problem</p><p>Wayne: “Until now, we’ve been able to get by holding a driver's license up to a webcam, but with new AI tech you can fool these systems - this is already showing up at the edges. AI voice generation is really good now. People are saying it's not a valid identification factor any more. </p><p>"Phishing attacks are also on the rise, for example people pretending to be a romantic partner before encouraging the target to invest in crypto. Using AI bots for mimicry makes it easy for scammers to quickly establish trust".</p><p>Linda: "The rights conferred by GDPR, to decide with whom you share your data, are already difficult to enforce. Deepfakes will make this even harder. </p><p>"I’ve been meeting East Berliners here who tell me surveillance capitalism reminds them of what it was like growing up under the Stasi".</p><p>Kim: "A lot of the threats are not new, what we are talking about is an acceleration of these. We were already uncomfortable online. Now, with the things we’re seeing due to the advent of cheap, easy-to-use deepfake tech, we are past breaking point."&nbsp;</p><p>How Decentralized Identity can help mitigate these threats</p><p>Wayne: “We need to add authenticity to communication. We don’t want to present a strong ID every time we want to use a chat app, so it makes sense to embed DI into comms channels, to prove I’m real.</p><p>“I define DI as the ability of any party to play the role of issuer, holder and verifier, based on cryptographic trust. Having digital credentials issued by many parties will enable trusted content certification, giving us confidence about what goes into an AI model.</p><p>Linda: “It’s not about identity, it's about data governance, and creating chains of trust to combat risks from synthetic data. </p><p>Kim. “I think of DI as a set of standards, technologies and principles that restore individuals’ control over their data. With these technologies, we have the possibility to build products and solutions on strong foundations.&nbsp;</p><p>"One of the key aspects with DI is the ability to provide a consistent experience across channels, creating a much safer environment for individuals. For example if you get a phone call from your CEO asking you to transfer money, with DI you can be sure it’s them and not a deep fake of their voice.</p><p>Recommendations for solution developers&nbsp;</p><p>Wayne: “Focus on the value for the end user. The DI standards uniquely enable you to provide a great user experience while also ensuring privacy and solution sustainability, including the ability to swap out vendors if needed without disrupting the service you’re providing."&nbsp;</p><p>Linda: "We have grown used to not having to pay for digital services. The incentives need to change. Think about new models where we get paid for our data, enabled by content authenticity and DI tech."</p><p>Kim: “We have to balance usability and privacy. It’s clear people want to use LMM based tech in their lives. On the other hand we’re seeing increasingly aggressive interfaces, for example asking you to give full access to your documents or even your desktop. With DI, finally there are ways to provide people both the convenience AND the trust”</p><p>Other opportunities</p><p>Wayne: “There’s exciting work happening at Kantara Initiative around automated compliance with data regulations. Imagine giving someone a license to your personal data. Then, if you're a Data Processor it’s easy to automatically demonstrate compliance using consent receipts. </p><p>"It makes the “Accept all” problem go away, as you can decide what kind of consent receipts should be automatically generated for which parties.”&nbsp;</p><p>Linda: “We need to spend time educating policymakers and the public, but in the end it comes down to end user demand for solutions. There’s no legal requirement for open banking in the US, but it’s happening anyway as people want to share their banking data with fintechs. Creating a smooth, easy UX will help to create the demand.”</p><p>Kim: "There’s a huge role for expanding the scope of trust to content authenticity, similar to the browser check mark that shows a website has a valid SSL certificate. C2PA (link) is fantastic, and is already using VCs. However, there is a risk of getting locked into who can verify these claims, if we use Certificate Authorities (CAs) as the root of trust. We are talking to them and there’s strong interest in generalizing the trust model.”</p><p>The panelists' key takeaways</p><p>Wayne: "One of the early goals of the internet pioneers was to have your personal agent in cyberspace. We need to get back to that original definition of personal agents, taking advantage of them to certify our content and things done on our behalf."&nbsp;</p><p>Linda: "We need the right to certify our data as authentic. Right now we can’t tell what’s synthetic versus from an original creator. It’s not judging whether the data is good or bad, it just gives us additional info about the data we’re using."</p><p>Kim: "Everything we’re talking about is already here, its just about connecting the pieces. If you're building products, this is a great time to get involved. Come and talk to us at DIF!"</p><p>Linda Jeng, Wayne Chang, Kim Hamilton Duffy, Kristy Lam and Elissa Maercklein published <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4854347&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Chains of Trust: Combatting Synthetic Data Risks of AI</a> earlier today.</p>

<p>Two predominant themes stood out at last week’s Identiverse 2024 conference in Las Vegas. First, there was the issue of how to defend against rapidly evolving advances in deepfakes, especially for live remote verification. Second, there was a common assumption that widespread adoption of passkeys is right around the corner, and that organizations must prepare to manage and secure passkeys when they become mainstream.</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CEO Andrew Shikiar touched on both topics in a session Wednesday (May 29) titled “<a href="https://identiverse.com/idv24/session/2089529/">FIDO, Passkeys and the State of Passwordless</a>.”</p>



<p>He announced the alliance’s new certification standard for facial-recognition technologies. The first (and so far only) organization to receive that certification is iProov. In a <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv24/session/2089484/">keynote address</a> Thursday (May 30), Shikiar added that the FIDO Alliance was ready to offer independent testing of facial-recognition technologies.</p>



<p>As for passkeys, the passwordless, FIDO-certified PKI-based WebAuthn credentials that reside on hardware keys, smartphones, PCs and in the cloud, Shikiar said the question was not if consumers would adopt them, but when.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance’s goal is “to make passkeys inevitable,” Shikiar said. No one at Identiverse expressed any doubt that they would be.</p>

<p>Today, the <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a> announced <a href="https://hrf.org/hrf-bitcoin-development-fund-grants-1-billion-satoshis-to-14-projects-worldwide/">a Bitcoin Development Fund grant</a> to Blockchain Common for its continued support of the development of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">FROST</a>, including holding <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/#upcoming-events">two more virtual FROST meetings for the developer community</a>.</p>

<p>FROST is a powerful quorum threshold signature scheme built using Schnorr signatures that offers many advantages over existing signature methodologies. That includes crucial integration with Distributed Key Generation: private keys can be created in pieces by discrete online servers, with no server ever having the whole key. Altogether, FROST can improve privacy, resilience, and security alike, making it truly a next-generation key-management system.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has long looked forward to the mainstream deployment of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Schnorr-Intro/">Schnorr</a> and FROST because of their considerable benefits over traditional key-management and signature schemes. We held out first <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/">FROST Implementer’s Round Table</a> in 2023 to give FROST library implementers and cryptographers a chance to talk with each other, and we were asked to do more. We also hosted a <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/summary/">FROST Developer’s Meeting</a> this year where we worked with Jesse Posner to offer wallet developers a look at what the future of FROST means.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons is thrilled by HRF’s recognition of our work. Their funding makes it possible to continue this work this year: we’ll be hosting a second round table for FROST library implementers &amp; cryptographers on September 18, then a second meeting for wallet developers on December 4. If you’re a cryptographer or library implementer, sign up for our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#frost-implementers">FROST implementer’s list</a> and if you’re a wallet developer, sign up for our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#gordian-developers">Gordian developer’s list</a> to receive the announcements on these events. Admission is free thanks to the support of HRF!</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has also placed FROST on our developmental road map for the year, to consider incorporating it our reference code and tools. More details as additional funding and our schedule firm up.</p>

<p>In the meantime, put September 18 and/or December 4 on your calendars so that you can join Blockchain Commons for these important events that will unveil the future of multi-party signatures and key management.</p>

		<p>CC* Regional Networking: Connectivity through Regional Infrastructure for Scientific Partnerships, Innovation, and Education (CRISPIE)&nbsp;</p>
<p>NEWARK, NJ, June 4, 2024 –Edge has been awarded an $857,000 grant from the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation (NSF)</a> to enhance network connectivity and access to advanced research networks and related cyberinfrastructure for seven higher education institutions in New Jersey, including a community college and several Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). The partner institutions include Brookdale Community College, Kean University, Montclair University, Ramapo College, Rider University, Rowan University, and Saint Peter’s University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project will improve access to advanced research networks and related cyberinfrastructure, aiming to reduce disparities for smaller and less resourced institutions. The initiative offers specialized training programs for IT personnel, faculty, and students, and establishes essential infrastructure elements using tools like perfSONAR for deploying network monitoring and optimization capabilities, leveraging globus file transfer and sharing service, a regional, centrally managed Data Transfer Node (DTN) for efficient data transfers and Science DMZ for direct access to regional and national resources, secured by the InCommon Federation for remote access to instruments and HPC resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital identity pioneers Markus Sabadello and Nat Sakimura crossed swords on stage during an absorbing discussion at EIC in Berlin this evening. </p><p>Markus kicked off by asking why the internet has become highly centralized, in spite of its beginnings as a peer-to-peer network. </p><p>Markus observed that technology embodies the values of the community that spawns it. He illustrated this by comparing W3C versus SD JWT VCs - contending that the W3C format offers more "Liberte" - as well as DIDComm versus OID4VC - arguing that DIDComm features more "Fraternite". Here's a flavor of their conversation (apologies to both for any mistakes in capturing your comments).</p><p>Markus: "One of the biggest discussions right now is how to get a VC into a wallet and present it. With OpenID4VC, there is asymmetry between issuer and holder, whereas with DIDComm, you have a model where everyone can connect to everyone else and establish true peer-to-peer relationships."</p><p>Nat: "The same can be said for STMP. The philosophy was that everyone runs their own mail server. I do, but how many others do? Instead, we have enormous mail servers like Office 365 and gmail. Just the fact that protocol provides Liberte, doesn't ensure decentralization."  </p><p>Markus: "No one said Liberte was easy. The easiest thing is to log in with Facebook!". </p><p>Nat: "What's the cost of enabling Liberte? It will make things more complex and error prone. </p><p>"You need to specify what is being decentralized. For example, IDPs are so-called centralized, yet there are hundreds of thousands of them. The number of wallets will be even more than the size of the population, but thinking about wallet providers, it will probably be far fewer than the number of IDPs. </p><p>"It's not only the technical architecture we need to look at, but also the operational and legal controls. Don't try to solve everything in a technical way."</p><p>Markus: "SSI arose to ensure we can have the same social structures and protections we enjoy in the real world, in the digital world.  We want Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite, and these ideas are baked into SSI standards."</p><p>Nat: "The goal is not the technology, but how to achieve Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite. Don't get too fixated on the technology." </p><p>Markus: "We can agree on that!"</p>

<p>DIF’s ED Kim Hamilton Duffy and SC member Steve McCown delivered a  Technical Mastery Sprint to a packed audience on the opening day of the 2024 European Identity and Cloud conference. </p><p>Steve highlighted the scale of internet security and data privacy problems, noting that some 25 billion login credentials had been leaked to the dark web by 2022, a 65% increase from 2020. Identity is the hackers’ real objective, since this is what enables lucrative fraud schemes. This threat impacts both individuals - what happens when your biometrics are stolen? - and organizations - 98% of whom have relationships with at least one vendor that has experienced a breach within the past 2 years, according to the Cyentia Institute.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve and Kim introduced key decentralized identity building blocks including Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), DID methods, DIDComm, wallets and agents, and how they can help address the current privacy and security challenges.&nbsp;They emphasized that these elements can be readily incorporated into existing systems, demonstrated by the growing use of decentralized identity to create on-ramps between Web2 and Web3 (and now Web5) applications. </p><p>Sam Curren demonstrated a new protocol that bridges DIDComm and OpenIDConnect, facilitating eIDAS-compliant integration of DI within the EU digital identity wallet to enable new use cases.</p><p>Steve and Kim spoke about how trust is established in a world where anyone can issue credentials, and highlighted several approaches that are gaining traction, including Trust over IP Foundation Trust Registries and DIF Credential Trust Establishment.&nbsp;</p><p>Kim outlined credential issuance and exchange flows and highlighted some implementation challenges, solutions and best practices, including credential storage and key management, and provided tips for managing a DI project and how to get started. She also outlined several existing government, educational, workforce management and supply chain use cases, and wrapped up the session with a live demonstration of DID creation and credential issuance using the Veramo CLI toolkit.&nbsp;</p><p>The session generated strong audience engagement, with Kim and Steve answering questions on topics including the trust relationship between issuers and relying parties, delegated authority (e.g. where a parent manages their child’s credentials), credential revocation, reconciling multiple user accounts, the need for centralized record keeping (e.g. for regulatory compliance), key storage and wallet recovery.&nbsp;</p><p>Look out for a more in-depth post where we provide their answers! </p>

<p>Alan Mayo goes beyond digital identity to consider identity in person, online, and by telephone. He has developed a structured way of describing identity that has, until now, been severely lacking. Alan questions the currently accepted status quo, suggesting that we will need to pass through an Identity 2.5 phase before reaching Identity 3.0.</p>

 Setting up a successful leadership transition <p>After years of working with and for a variety of different kinds of social impact organisations — from educational institutions to cooperative federations, small community-based charities to global non-profits — we’ve been lucky to see how our strategy and “critical friend” services can help leaders set foundations for an organisational programme or initiative.</p><p>It’s only lately that we’ve thought about some of what we do through the lens of “Fractional Leadership”. We are experts in cooperation, learning, technology and community, which means the type of leadership that we bring into projects is quite <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-business-case-for-working-openly-and-transparently-867e3fb04588">specifically OPEN</a>.</p> What is Fractional Leadership? cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Fractional leadership is essentially outsourcing a role or a part of a role to an expert who can help you hit the ground running. Such positions are great when you know you need a new department (e.g. Digital Transformation) or if you’re kicking off a new project that needs someone to lead. They’re also helpful when you know you want to hire someone full-time, but want to find the right person for your organisation.</p><p>Fractional leadership provides you and your organisation with some flexibility because it gives you the time and space to make the right decisions in staffing and for your organisation as a whole. It’s potentially less expensive than hiring someone full time and can be explicitly bound in a statement of work. It’s also a way to test whether or not a particular new position makes sense to your organisation.</p><p>It is a way to work with diverse experts who have wide-ranging experience that you would like to apply to your organisation as it grows, changes and transitions.</p> The shadow side of fractional leadership cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>As with any concept we pull from the world of bizniz into the social impact space, we need to be aware of how it can manifest inside an organisation that isn’t only trying to maximise&nbsp;profits.</p><p>Often, organisations in our space are unaware that what they need is a leader and look to us to create a specific “thing”. “We just need a digital strategy,” or “We just need a training programme,” are things that often come up in projects that obviously need something more. Working openly and helping people to understand how technology and funding intermingle, how community drives participation, how recognition motivates or how a learning programme can scale all require leadership.</p><p>Often funding in the social impact space is to develop a specific thing, not the impact that thing should have. Complex realities also mean that someone who might be a leader in one context might not have what it takes to lead in your context. This is why an open leader is so important. Fractional leadership in the open is a rare thing&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>A fractional leader needs to be adaptable and find ways to stay within the bounds the organisation has, while also setting a project or department up for future&nbsp;impact.</p> Preparing for a new colleague cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Still, experienced fractional leaders are well versed in making do with what they’re given. They can lay out plans and programmes with the future in mind. The strategies and processes put in place during a time of transition reflect a moment in time. Setting them up as iterative and designing them to evolve empowers future&nbsp;leaders.</p><p>We’ve offered “critical friend” services to help onboard the people who will take over from what we were asked to start. We’ve advise on workload and priority based on community engagement in tandem with organisational goals. We like to do the work of documenting and establishing open, productive processes and policies help future collaborators take over when the time&nbsp;comes.</p> Is Fractional Leadership for&nbsp;you? cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Your fractional leader can&nbsp;start:</p>  Developing a strategy that focuses on long term social&nbsp;impact  Creating processes or frameworks to measure impact or create processes for gathering data and&nbsp;insights  Building assets to begin implementing the change needed to achieve the impact you’re looking&nbsp;for  Supporting and working with others on your team to co-design principles and approaches that support your&nbsp;mission  Determining the skills and competencies necessary to lead the project, programme or department they’re working within and helping your organisation find someone to take&nbsp;over  <p>The whole point is that you can bring in engaged experts to help you get something going while looking for your forever person. There are lots of people working in the social impact space who have deep expertise in everything from finance to HR to product development and&nbsp;design.</p><p>Fractional leadership is something you can simply try out. As you create briefs or write out job descriptions just ask yourself, “Would a designated fractional leader give me more time and space to ensure this is a long-term success?” If so, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact">get in&nbsp;touch</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/fractional-leadership-in-social-impact-organisations-5c03daf9e08e">Fractional Leadership in Social Impact Organisations</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  🚀 Decentralized Identity Foundation News  
<p>DIF at ID4Africa</p>
<p>DIF was honoured to participate at the ID4Africa 2024 AGM in Cape Town last week.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIF's Catherine Nabbala and Damian Glover delivered a plenary presentation to the conference, together with Anand Acharya of Bhutan National Digital Identity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The session highlighted DIF’s work within the broader landscape of national ID schemes and provided real-world insights into the implementation of decentralized identity by the Thai and Bhutanese governments.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
The presentation elicited engagement with DIF from a variety of quarters, including several countries that are rolling out national digital identity programs, and others looking to do so.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our conversations with stakeholders evidenced a strong desire for Africa-specific digital infrastructure, and awakening interest in decentralized identity as a tool to empower citizens and promote cross-border interoperability while avoiding lock-in to ecosystems controlled by outside interests.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Universal Resolver<br>
<br>
The <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/iota-digital-identity-method-gets-support-from-decentralized-id-universal-resolver/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">IOTA Digital Identity (DID) method is now resolvable using the DIF's Universal Resolver</a>. The Universal Resolver is DIF-hosted infrastructure enabling resolution of any registered DID method through its flexible plugin model. This widely-used service is invaluable to the decentralized identity community. Accordingly,  DIF has invested in boosting its reliability and stability to ensure uptime and availability of the Universal Resolver.</p>
<p>The Universal Resolver was generously developed and contributed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/danube-tech/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Danube Tech</a>.</p>
<p>You can experiment with the Universal Resolver at <a href="https://uniresolver.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://uniresolver.io</a> and even follow our simple process for allowing your own DID method to run in the Uniresolver.</p>
<p>As a non-profit, DIF funds and hosts public good infrastructure like the Universal Resolver. Support our efforts by <a href="https://lnkd.in/gTyk6x4c?ref=blog.identity.foundation">joining DIF</a>.</p>
<p>DIF adds new liaison IOVF</p>
<p><br>
IOV Foundation’s mission is to create a new open financial ecosystem that provides accessible and fair services. They focus on Latin America, specifically demonstrating solutions for interoperability between governments (countries, cities) and organizations in Central and South America. Their current pilot focuses on building an identity platform for the Argentine Chamber of E-Commerce, aimed at managing event tickets and board meeting attendance.</p>

  🗓️ ️Community Events  
<p>Bridging the Gap: OpenID and DIDComm<br>
<br>
SC member Sam Curren and Artur Philipp from IDUnion unveiled OpenID-DIDComm, a new protocol that bridges OpenID4VC and DIDComm, enabling credential issuers and holders to communicate securely in a way that complies with EU requirements for credential exchange.</p>
<p>The community call was highly anticipated and was well attended, despite public holidays in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>Following an introduction by DIF’s Senior Director of Community Engagement, Limari Navarrete, Artur noted that there are many reasons why issuers and holders will need to communicate, though OpenID4VCI (OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance) only supports the initial credential exchange.</p>
<p>For example, an issuer may need to notify a holder that a credential has expired or been revoked. On the other hand, a holder may want to request a batch of additional credentials from the issuer (single-use SD-JWT credentials will be important to prevent correlation of the holder).</p>
<p>The mutual authentication that is integral to the DIDComm protocol provides resistance to phishing attacks, compared with approaches requiring switches to channels such as SMS or email. What’s more, the security properties of a DIDComm connection do not degrade over time. These and other features make DIDComm an excellent choice to establish a persistent communication channel between issuers and holders.</p>
<p>The next step is for the project team to validate that the new protocol does not interfere with OpenID4VCI, in consultation with the group developing the OpenID specification. Enabling DIDComm connections to be established over OpenID4VP (OpenID for Verifiable Presentations) will follow later.</p>

<p>This paper explores the emerging practices surrounding the use of synced passkeys which allow passkey use across multiple devices by syncing the passkeys over the cloud, specifically addressing the initial choices and considerations for service providers (aka relying parties or RPs). These practices are in their early stages and are likely to progress, since operating systems, browsers, and passkey providers are still in a phase of enhancing functionality. This document outlines crucial areas such as registration, authentication, passkey management, and accessibility for RPs to consider and presents a range of emerging approaches for adopting this technology. The objective is to guide RPs through these budding strategies, acknowledging that the specifics of ensuring secure and convenient passkey usage may evolve as the digital landscape continues to advance.</p>



<p>This paper is written with independence for each section, allowing readers to read specific topics of interest without the need to read the entire paper from the beginning.</p>



<p>This white paper is intended for various stakeholders of relying parties, including non-developers, such as information security executives, product owners, identity and access management practitioners, UI/UX designers, and accessibility practitioners.</p>

<p>Conformance with the AuthZEN request/response protocol marks a significant milestone in simplifying and standardizing authorization approaches</p>
 &nbsp; 
 The OpenID Foundation led the standardization of authentication protocols with OpenID Connect and now we are proud to host the AuthZEN Working Group as they seek to do the same for authorization.”<p></p>
 — Gail Hodges, Executive Director for OpenID Foundation 
 
<p>LAS VEGAS, NV, USA, May 28, 2024 /<a href="https://www.einpresswire.com/">EINPresswire.com</a>/ — The OpenID Foundation AuthZEN Working Group announced today that select leading authorization vendors successfully achieved conformance with the AuthZEN request/response protocol, marking a significant step in bringing interoperability and standardization to the authorization market. The industry leaders include 3Edges, Aserto, Axiomatics, Cerbos, Permit.io, Rock Solid Knowledge, SGNL.ai, Strata Identity, and Thales, demonstrating their commitment to documenting common authorization patterns, defining standard mechanisms for communication between authorization components, and recommending best practices for developing secure applications.</p>
<p>Established through the OpenID Foundation, the AuthZEN Working Group’s focus is to tackle the complexities of authorization, to promote decoupling and externalizing authorization logic from applications, and to simplify the implementation of a robust authorization layer that can be edited and audited with ease within diverse application environments. With members from leading authorization vendors, the group aims to unify and standardize the way authorization decisions are enforced across varying platforms, with an initial focus on a specification that ensures interoperability and integration between policy enforcement points and decision points. This initiative draws on the expertise of leading companies in the security and authorization space, fostering a collaborative approach to enhancing the scalability and security of access control systems.</p>
<p>The AuthZEN Working Group is currently focused on three key areas to improve interoperability:<br>1. Defining a standard for the communication flow between policy enforcement points and policy decision engines.<br>2. Creating a standard for communicating access policies to policy decision points.<br>3. Identifying and documenting common usage patterns and recommended best practices.</p>
<p>The working group recently completed successful interoperability testing, which included a defined interop scenario in the form of a Todo application. Participating companies include 3Edges, Aserto, Axiomatics, Cerbos, Permit.io, Rock Solid Knowledge, SGNL.ai, Strata Identity and Thales – all of whom achieved success in this testing.</p>
<p>The AuthZEN Working Group is open to all organizations committed to the goal of improving interoperability and standardization in authorization. For more information, visit <a href="https://openid.net/wg/authzen/">https://openid.net/wg/authzen/</a> and <a href="https://authzen-interop.net/">https://authzen-interop.net/</a>.</p>
<p>Quotes:<br>Gail Hodges, executive director for OpenID Foundation<br>“As more and more players offer externalized authorization, it is critical that we ensure safe and secure patterns across implementations. The OpenID Foundation led the standardization of authentication protocols with OpenID Connect and now, ten years later, we are proud to host the AuthZEN Working Group as they seek to do the same for authorization.”</p>
<p>Derek Small, co-founder and president for 3Edges<br>“The OpenID AuthZEN Working Group is tackling authorization challenges faced by organizations of every nature and size. Dynamic authorization is cataloging the rich authorization patterns that support authorization decisions between organizations and varying platforms. As this Working Group continues its mission to address interoperability and standards in support of authorization policies of today and those of the future, 3Edges remains committed to supporting the critical workings of the AuthZEN Working Group and to supporting this interop at Identiverse 2024.”</p>
<p>Omri Gazitt, co-founder and CEO for Aserto<br>“Interoperable authentication is mostly a solved problem, thanks to standards such as SAML and OpenID Connect. But we haven’t yet had our “OIDC moment” in the authorization space. The OpenID AuthZEN Working Group is the definitive effort to get us there, and Aserto is proud to be among the first vendors to adopt it. “</p>
<p>David Brossard, chief technology officer (CTO) for Axiomatics<br>“Put simply, the goal here is to become the OAuth of authorization. We’ve taken the lessons learned from the past 15 years working to implement authorization for our customers along with the standardization efforts within OASIS XACML to produce an even simpler, more lightweight PEP-PDP protocol. Axiomatics is proud to support the work to facilitate integration between applications and externalized authorization services, raising the quality and security of authorization.”</p>
<p>Alex Olivier, co-founder and chief product officer (CPO) for Cerbos<br>“Cerbos is a proud contributor and early adopter of the OpenID AuthZEN specification enabling external authorization portability. This standardization effort provides software builders with the confidence to adopt a more secure and scalable access control layer in their applications. “</p>
<p>Or Weis, CEO for Permit.io<br>“Enterprises spend months and sometimes years struggling to apply authorization to their applications. Reinventing wheels due to the lack of standards in the space. At Permit.io, we’re excited to be early backers of the AuthZEN standard and its promise to unify simplicity across the landscape.”</p>
<p>Andrew Clymer, co-founder for Rock Solid Knowledge<br>“With many years of experience building single sign-on (SSO) solutions based on open standards, we are proud to support the AuthZEN Working Group in delivering open standards for authorization. As an early adopter of the draft standard, we are excited to make our .NET authorization engine, Enforcer, accessible to heterogeneous environments.”</p>
<p>Atul Tulshibagwale, chief technology officer (CTO) for SIGNL.ai<br>“The AuthZEN standard will be critical to achieving externalized management of authorization. SGNL is proud to have initiated standardization activity by contributing the first draft spec and is happy to participate in the interoperability event.”</p>
<p>Gerry Gebel, vice president of product and standards for Strata Identity<br>“Interoperability is a core capability needed for enterprises to securely deploy authorization services in complex environments comprised of systems from multiple vendors. Strata is honored to support the demo with the Hexa Policy Orchestration’s integration with Open Policy Agent (OPA). Identiverse is the logical place for this first interoperability demonstration to occur since the AuthZEN working group was founded based on meetings held at this event.”</p>
<p>Bertrand Tavernier, vice president/chief technical officer for Thales (secure communication and information systems)<br>“Thanks to the support of the OpenID AuthZEN Working Group and leveraging our long-standing experience with the OASIS XACML standard, we were glad to demonstrate the capability of our AuthzForce solution to combine XACML policy expressiveness and versatility with the new, ultra-lightweight AuthZEN authorization API for the great benefit of customers, especially in edge computing environments.”</p>

<p>Welcome to the 4th edition of CeramicWorld! Last month has been busy with new features and developments happening across the Ceramic ecosystem. Here’s a TL;DR for what has happened:</p>  Ceramic released an a new library for building points on Ceramic  Index is making strides in powering decentralized AI  Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) is moving away from IPFS pubsub  Ceramic’s Data Feed API is here    A new library for building points on Ceramic has dropped 🔥 <p>Ceramic core team has just released the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramic-solutions/points?activeTab=versions&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">points library</a>, designed to facilitate developers in initiating experimentation with reputation systems on Ceramic and accelerating iteration. The points library serves various use cases, including implementing rewards for community engagement, incentivizing collaboration, or facilitating community quests and educational initiatives.</p><p>As an illustration of its functionality, the Points library has been integrated into the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/sandbox?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Sandbox</a>. By following the steps outlined in the Sandbox, you can earn your first points, stored on Ceramic! 🔥</p><p>And that’s not all. In addition to the points library, there is also a <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/demo/fullstack-app?ref=blog.ceramic.network">points demo application</a> that you can use as the basis of your own project. This example app showcases how the points library can be utilized to incentivize community members for their engagement, such as participation on key social platforms. To learn more, check out the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/web3-points-library-tutorial/">comprehensive tutorial</a>, and watch the accompanying video walkthrough:</p> <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/libraries/points?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Start building with points library</a>   Powering Decentralized AI with Composable&nbsp;Data <p><a href="https://index.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Index</a>, a composable discovery protocol, is revolutionizing web discovery by empowering users to curate personalized search engines, known as indexes, tailored to their specific needs.</p><p>Built on Ceramic's decentralized graph database, <a href="https://mirror.xyz/indexnetwork.eth/pETWkxZcN3OW0fUWohAo6vAh4IPqfnF6h5v9O-Pwi_k?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Index is driving decentralized AI</a>. It leverages a decentralized semantic index, utilizing ComposeDB, to enable semantic interoperability and a highly relational composition of use cases. By integrating AI-based discovery functions with Ceramic's decentralized network, Index ensures data integrity, privacy, and personalized discovery experiences across peers, mitigating privacy risks associated with centralized systems. This interconnected approach fosters a discovery experience where responses are both personalized and trusted, exemplified by a chat setup drawing from both community and private indexes.</p><p>Today, Index network is partnering with a number of projects in the ecosystem, including Ceramic, Lit Protocol, Fluence, Disco, Intuition Systems, Verax, and Olas Network, among others.</p><p>Just a few days ago Index team <a href="https://docs.index.network/docs/resources/libraries/langchain?ref=blog.ceramic.network">announced the collaboration with LangChainAI</a> which enables developers to seamlessly build their composable semantic indexes with LangChain's suite of LLM pipelines. The new integration is supported in both Python and JavaScript.</p> <a href="https://index.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Explore the Index Network</a>   Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) is moving away from IPFS pubsub<br><br>Earlier this month, the core Ceramic team shared an update regarding the work that has been done to enhance Ceramic network's reliability, scalability, and performance, particularly focusing on the Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS). As the team is approaching the release of Ceramic’s Recon protocol, CAS is transitioning away from using IPFS pubsub to synchronize Streams in Ceramic. To facilitate this, a new HTTP-based mechanism has been developed for sharing Time Events from CAS to Ceramic nodes. This eliminates the dependency of newer Ceramic nodes on IPFS pubsub.<br><br>To ensure seamless data delivery and prevent potential data loss, it's crucial for all Ceramic nodes to be upgraded to at least v5.3. Learn more <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/upgrade-your-ceramic-node-to-v5-3-before-the-6th-of-may/1563?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.    New Ceramic features: SET Account Relations, Immutable Fields and shouldIndex flag<br><br>Earlier this month, a set of new features providing a sophisticated toolkit for data management, have been added to Ceramic. More specifically, you can now use the following tools to build your applications:<br>- <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/relations?ref=blog.ceramic.network#model-to-model">SET account relation</a>&nbsp;- enabling users to enforce a constraint where each user account (or DID) can create only one instance of a model for a specific record of another model.<br>- <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/schemas?ref=blog.ceramic.network#type-validation-directives">Immutable fields</a>&nbsp;- allow specific data to be prevented from being altered.<br>- <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/interact-with-data?ref=blog.ceramic.network#removerestore-record-from-index">shouldIndex flag</a>&nbsp;- gives developers an option to manage the data visibility by choosing which fields should be indexed.<br><br>Learn more about these features in a <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/exploring-ceramics-new-features-set-account-relations-immutable-fields-and-should-index-flag/">written tutorial </a>and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2BRQqPI354&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">video walkthrough</a>.    Data Feed API is here!<br><br>Data Feed API is finally out. The new Data Feed API formalizes the underlying Ceramic event streaming protocol and allows developers to build data(base) products using raw event streams.<br><br>The release finalises the initial stage of implementation of Data Feed API with additional features and improvements coming in the near future.

<p>Earlier this month, Otto Mora from Polygon ID and Kim Duffy from DIF hosted a webinar titled "Credential Schemas: Streamlining KYC." We were thrilled with the enthusiastic participation and valuable feedback we received from attendees. </p><p>Throughout the webinar, we conducted interactive polls to gather real-time feedback from participants. Here's a recap of the key highlights, discussions, and feedback throughout the session.</p> Understanding Decentralized Identity <p>We began with an introduction to decentralized identity, explaining the technologies and principles that empower individuals to control their digital identities and personal data. Key benefits include:</p>  Privacy &amp; Security: Ensuring data is shared only with necessary parties, protecting against misuse.  Streamlined Onboarding: Facilitating efficient customer onboarding with trustworthy data.  Bi-Directional Trust: Reducing fraud and fostering confidence in interactions.  Trust &amp; Transparency: Enhancing economic and social opportunities through new markers of trust and reputation.  <p>We asked participants “In your opinion, what is the most impactful use case for decentralized identity?”. At 36%, “Enhancing privacy and security” took the lead, with “Streamlining onboarding processes” coming in second at 27%.</p><p>The responses to “Other” included interesting applications such as:</p>   Governance, membership, voting, and sybil resistance  Virtual rights management (VRM)  <p>And others added powerful cross-cutting differentiators of SSI including user-controlled identity and interoperability.</p><p>For the rest of the webinar, we focused specifically on the "streamlined onboarding" benefit.</p> Real-World Use Cases <p>We explored various use cases where credential schemas can make a significant impact in onboarding:</p>  KYC/KYB: Streamlining financial transactions with verified identity claims.  AML: Reusable claims to help identify and protect against money laundering.  Age Verification: Ensuring age-appropriate access to services and content.  <p>We asked participants which credential schemas they (and their companies) are  interested in. KYC took the lead, which was not surprising given the webinar theme.</p><p>We had a freeform option to enter other credential schemas of interest, and participants responded with:</p>  Known customer credential  Verifiable product-related sustainability information  <p>For the rest of the webinar, we focused specifically on Decentralized Identity and credential schemas as they benefit KYC/KYB use cases.</p> Challenges in Traditional KYC/KYB <p>We reviewed challenges with traditional KYC/KYB processes, including:</p>  High Costs: Traditional methods are costly and resource-intensive.  Compliance Complexity: Meeting compliance requirements like AML assurance is challenging.  Time Inefficiencies: Current processes are time-consuming and require substantial manual effort.   The Role of Credential Schemas <p>We highlighted the importance of credential schemas as data templates that ensure consistency and interoperability across systems. The benefits include:</p>  Facilitating Innovation: Enabling innovators to focus on new applications rather than compatibility issues.  Enhancing Interoperability: Ensuring credentials are broadly recognized across different systems.  Encoding Best Practices: Capturing best practices and recommendations from experts.  Boosting Efficiency: Reducing the need for custom integration work.   DIF’s new Schema Work Item <p>We announced DIF's new schema work item, to be launched at the end of May, dedicated to credential schemas including:</p>  Basic KYC Model: For identity verification across financial services and other sectors.  AML Schema: To comply with anti-money laundering regulations.  Proof of Age: To verify age or age range for access to age-restricted content.  Proof of Humanity: To confirm real human identities, useful for community governance and anti-fraud.   General Discussion <p>The discussions provided us with great insights; one such key insight is that such schemas do not need to provide the complete answer – if they can shave off 80% of the verification work, then that’s a win.</p><p>We also discussed the importance of schema discoverability to promote convergence, which we'll discuss more later.</p> Thank You for Your Participation <p>We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who joined the webinar and contributed to the conversation. Your feedback was invaluable and underscored the relevance and potential impact of credential schemas in streamlining KYC processes.</p><p> As discussed during the call, an interdisciplinary, holistic approach is key to the success of this effort, and we'd love to continue the discussion with you!</p><p> Contact <a href="mailto:membership@identity.foundation">membership@identity.foundation</a> if you'd like to get involved. We are targeting an end of May start date. You can join the work item later, but getting involved now ensures we factor in your availability.</p>

<p>Face Verification Certification launched to bring confidence to ID ecosystem among rising online identity theft and bias concerns&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>May 29, 2024 – The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> announced today the launch of the first globally available certification program to test and certify the performance of remote biometric identity verification technology when verifying a user against a trusted identity document for accuracy, liveness, and bias. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/face-verification/">Face Verification Certification</a> program comes at a time of soaring demand for face biometric identity solutions and recognition of the importance of robust enrollment and identity re-binding processes to the overall security of online accounts. <a href="https://www.iproov.com/liveness-detection">Dynamic Liveness</a>, the science powering the <a href="https://www.iproov.com">iProov</a> Biometric Solution Suite’s Remote Onboarding Solution and Authentication Solution, is the first product to pass the rigorous certification testing.</p>



<p>The certification program, consisting of 10,000 tests at a minimum, assesses a biometric system’s performance across different demographics, including skin tone, age, and gender. It measures resistance to spoof and deepfake attacks with Imposter Attack Presentation Accept Rate (IAPAR), and also assesses the usability and security of solutions by measuring False Reject and Accept Rates (FRR and FAR respectively). The certification also tests “selfie match” capabilities to ensure a user’s “selfie” matches their government-issued ID in the initial account setup process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combating bias and deepfake threats in biometric ID systems</p>



<p>Biometrics has <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Authenticate-2023-Barometer-Report.pdf">ranked top as global consumers’ preferred way to log in</a> and the method they think is most secure for the last two years. However, as governments and businesses globally roll out remote identity solutions, two urgent issues remain to address – bias in some biometric systems and new security threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations including NIST have been closely <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/12/nist-study-evaluates-effects-race-age-sex-face-recognition-software">monitoring the disparities in performance for some time</a> – with NIST’s most recent <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_demographics.html">evaluation of solutions across different demographics</a> ​​released this year. The issue of bias is tightly linked to brand reputation too; new research from FIDO Alliance released today has found 50% of American and British consumers said they would lose trust in an organization if its biometric system was found to be biased, while 22% said they’d stop using a service entirely. Similarly, generative AI’s boom has also heightened security apprehensions about online verification; the same survey revealed over a third of consumers (37%) are more concerned about verifying themselves online due to the rising number of deepfakes. In ENISA’s latest remote ID report, researchers observed that while deepfake injection attacks are increasing and more sophisticated, deepfake presentation and injection attacks remain the <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/remote-id-proofing-good-practices">top two biometric attack types most difficult to mitigate</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bringing trust to the ID ecosystem</p>



<p>Commenting on the news, Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director &amp; CEO of the FIDO Alliance, said: “Remote identity solutions unlock huge benefits for governments, organizations, and consumers alike, but as appetite grows across the globe, there are understandable concerns mixed with excitement. Identity theft is rising, while bias in biometric systems has caused organizations to delay or reconsider implementations at a time when inclusivity and accessibility have never been more important.</p>



<p>“Certification unlocks the power of open standards and catalyzes ecosystem-wide innovation and opportunity. With iProov’s market-first certification for biometric face verification now completed, we look forward to serving additional providers who understand the value of independent, accredited lab testing. This new certification program provides a launchpad that enables all stakeholders to fast-track deployments that are robust enough for the modern threat landscape and work well for everyone, anywhere in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leading biometrics solutions provider, iProov, has become the first vendor to complete the rigorous certification process. iProov provides market-leading biometric solutions that protect the world’s most security-conscious organizations from deepfakes and other types of identity fraud. Andrew Bud, founder and CEO at iProov said: “Biometrics are a powerful tool that organizations can utilize to facilitate secure, inclusive, and user-friendly interactions online. Each of these three fundamental components must be given equal consideration as organizations evaluate their options. With the FIDO Face Verification Certification program, organizations now have a trusted compass for navigating these decisions. We applaud The FIDO Alliance for addressing the importance of biometric identity verification to strengthen the full user identity lifecycle. Independent certification creates a much-needed quality benchmark for this evolving technology and further demonstrates our ability to provide trusted identity assurance in an age of AI threats and identity fraud.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Testing requirements are built upon proven ISO standards and are developed by a diverse international authority of stakeholders, including industry, government, and independent subject matter experts. Participating vendors can benefit from identifying gaps in product performance and demonstrating clearly to the market their solutions can be trusted, which can reduce individual testing needs and boost adoption. Two independent labs are currently accredited to support this certification – <a href="https://ingeniumbiometrics.com/">Ingenium Biometrics</a> and <a href="https://www.tuvit.de/">TÜV Informationstechnik (TÜV NORD GROUP)</a> – with more expected to follow later this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program expands upon the Alliance’s existing <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/biometric-component-introduction/">Biometric Component Certification</a> and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/document-authenticity/">Document Authenticity (DocAuth) Certification</a> programs and demonstrates FIDO’s ongoing commitment to meet marketplace demand and address evolving threats with third-party certifications. Combined, these programs provide unrivaled end-to-end assurance to implementing organizations, consumers and vendors and support the world’s migration to more secure digital verification systems and passwordless security.</p>

<p>May 29, 2024 – The FIDO Alliance today released new design guidelines to help accelerate <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/implement-passkeys-overview/">passkey adoption</a> and deployment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Design Guidelines aim to help online service providers design a better, more consistent user experience (UX) when signing in with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The guidelines are developed for designers, engineers, product managers, content strategists, and UX researchers to use for reference and guide their initial implementation of passkeys and expansion of passkey support over time.</p>



<p>The new guidelines are available at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/design-guidelines">https://fidoalliance.org/design-guidelines/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As organizations are increasingly deploying passwordless authentication based on FIDO standards around the world, the end users of passkeys – along with the practitioners implementing them – have become top priorities for successful adoption,” said Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CEO of The FIDO Alliance. “Our <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/content-ebook-consumer-password-and-passkey-trends-wpd-2024/">research</a> shows consumers and employees are adopting phishing-resistant passkeys at a rapid pace while relying organizations are experiencing cost savings and fewer security incidents.&nbsp; By continuing our investment in the evolving user experience, the FIDO Alliance is committed to ensuring brands have a consistent and accessible set of guidelines that are fully aligned with design best practices and FIDO technology requirements. We encourage online service providers everywhere to use these publicly available guidelines to enhance the user experience and enjoy greater success with FIDO passkey deployment and adoption.”</p>



<p>Following the first release of FIDO UX guidelines for passkeys in 2022, the 2024 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/design-guidelines/">Design Guidelines</a> have been updated with optimization included for service providers evaluating and deploying passkeys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2024 Design Guidelines are organized into five sections to provide clear guidance, confirm design principles, and offer flexibility:</p>



 
 User experience research: Provides confidence that the guidelines are informed by design research 



 Principles: 10 UX principles and 3 content principles for passkeys that are core to any passkey implementation 



 “Get started” design patterns: Patterns are the heart of the guidelines, containing self-contained experiences that can be combined to match unique business needs 



 Optional design patterns: Patterns that can be added after the “get started” patterns over time 



 Resources: Provides additional resources like events, Figma UI kits and community groups to jump-start work with passkeys 
 



<p>The FIDO UX Working Group created the guidelines and comprises 131 UX researchers, designers, and PMs from 31 global brands. The guidelines were created in partnership with usability research firm Blink UX – with added underwriting support from 1Password, Dashlane, Google, HID, Trusona, U.S. Bank, and Yubico.</p>

 How can we verify users are genuine in an online world? 



<p>Online identity theft has steadily risen in recent years, while the generative AI boom has driven a new wave of deepfake-powered attacks that threaten remote enrollment and identity security. Meanwhile, bias in biometric systems has been monitored for some time, varying significantly across solutions and impacting consumer trust and perception of the technology.</p>



<p>As the adoption of remote identity verification technology rises, two critical concerns and challenges need to be addressed: bias and new security threats.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance recently sponsored an independent study of 2,000 respondents across the U.S. and the U.K. to understand consumer perception towards remote identity verification, online security, and biometrics. This eBook reveals those insights on remote biometric face verification, including how many people have used biometric face recognition successfully, and their opinions on verification accuracy, potential discrimination, and concerns about deepfakes.</p>



 Key findings 



 
 Consumers want to use biometrics to verify themselves online more, especially in sensitive use cases like financial services – where one out of two people said they would use biometric technology (48%). 



 One in four feel they experience regular discrimination when using automated facial biometric systems (25%). 



 Equity in biometric systems is vital to trust – with half saying they would lose trust in a brand or institution (50%), with one out of five saying they’d stop using a service entirely if found to have a biased biometric system (22%). 



 Over half of respondents are concerned about deepfakes when verifying identities online (52%). 
 



<p>Read the full results of the survey in this eBook and learn about these consumers’ experiences with biometric face verification technologies, and discover how organizations can improve global digital access, authentication, and security when leveraging these remote identity verification technologies.</p>

Name: Leo<br>
Current Council Member: Not elected as a CR council member</p>
<p>Background: “I am Leo, dedicated since 2017 to advancing Elastos in crucial areas like DPoS, BPoS, exchange listings, and mining pools. I’ve made significant contributions in forging vital partnerships, aiding Elastos’ progress. With 7 years of web3 project development experience, I’ve invested in dozens of web3 companies, with two yielding hundredfold returns. The fusion of technical prowess and astute investments underscores my capabilities. As an active member and staunch supporter of the Elastos community, I’m committed to contributing my expertise to its cause.”</p>
<p>Contribution Goals: “Creda possesses AI technical capabilities, providing services and ecosystem support for Elastos, making it one of the hottest tracks in the web3 space in 2024.”</p>
<p>Improvements: “In the past year, some CR proposers have violated CR rules and refused to cooperate. We hope that the next CR council members and proposers uphold principles of fairness, justice, and transparency to ensure adherence to and enforcement of CR rules.”</p>

Name: Zero<br>
Current Council Member: Yes</p>
<p>Experience:<br>
“In the past year, as a CR committee member, I have witnessed the rapid development of the Elastos ecosystem, particularly with the introduction of the BeL2 strategy and the community’s support and efforts towards this strategic transformation. Through the CR mechanism, we reached multiple consensuses that propelled the ecosystem’s prosperity and development, fostering technological innovation and community co-construction. I believe the new CR committee will continue to lead the Elastos community in driving innovation, enhancing collaboration, and achieving ecological prosperity.”</p>
<p>Background:<br>
“I have been part of the Elastos community since 2017 and have participated in the development of various ecosystem projects, specializing in product design and development. Through running for the CR committee, I hope to further contribute my skills and experience to the Elastos community.”</p>
<p>Contribution Goals:<br>
“If elected, I will contribute to CRC by supporting the BeL2 strategy to drive technological innovation, strengthen community collaboration, and enhance the efficiency of ecosystem resource integration.”</p>
<p>Improvements:<br>
“The CRC needs to improve decision-making transparency and community participation. If elected, I will work to enhance the transparency of the decision-making process, ensuring that community members can better understand and participate in decisions. Additionally, I will promote more community activities and communication channels to foster interaction and collaboration among members, thereby strengthening community cohesion and overall development.”</p>

 Mark E. Blair, M.D. 
<p>Email: <a>markeblairmd@gmail.com</a><br>
Name: Mark E. Blair, M.D.<br>
Current Council Member: Yes</p>
<p>Experience:<br>
“As a current member of the Cyber Republic Council (CRC), my experience over the past 4 years has been both rewarding and enlightening. I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with dedicated members like Sir Kahuna and Vegas Mike as part of ‘The Strawberry Council.’ Together, we have upheld the philosophy of ‘derived from the community, for the community,’ driving strategic initiatives that promote decentralization and community involvement within the Elastos ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Background:<br>
“In my role, I have focused on enhancing Elastos’ contributions to the Bitcoin ecosystem and digital/data rights, especially through my work as the Head of Strategy for BeL2 since December 2023. This position has allowed me to explore investment opportunities and strategize the rollout of BeL2 infrastructure, providing me with a unique perspective on how to further our community’s goals.”</p>
<p>Contribution Goals:<br>
“For another term, my aspirations include continuing to drive innovation and growth. I hope to continue to support the rollout and adoption of BeL2, which will not only increase use cases for the Bitcoin ecosystem but also boost Elastos’ visibility and adoption. Additionally, I am committed to exploring outside investor opportunities to increase the project’s ecosystem development and long-term viability.”</p>
<p>Improvements:<br>
“In my opinion, while the CRC is currently effective in serving as a DAO, there are areas that could be further improved:</p>
 
 Increased Community Engagement: Encouraging more active participation from community members, ensuring their voices and ideas are heard and integrated into our strategic plans. 
 Transparency and Communication: Enhancing transparency in decision-making processes and improving communication channels between the CRC and the wider Elastos community. 
 Strategic Partnerships: Forming strategic partnerships with other blockchain projects and organizations to foster collaboration and mutual growth. 
 Innovation and Flexibility: Implementing a framework that allows for greater innovation and flexibility in adopting new technologies and approaches, keeping Elastos at the forefront of blockchain development.”

Name: chen2rong2<br>
Current Council Member: No</p>
<p>Background:<br>
“I haven’t run for a council seat previously, and I will not run next year. However, I feel obligated to offer my help at this critical juncture of the Elastos initiative if I am elected. I have been with the Elastos project since the beginning. And I believe there is a need for a bridge between internet developers and crypto developers so they can work together to build a new Web3. I wish to share some of my thoughts with the Cyber Republic communities, especially in the DePIN area, because Web3 is a network first and foremost.”</p>
<p>Contribution Goals:<br>
“‘You own your data’ — that’s for everyone. Web1, Web2, and Web3 are for all internet users, not just crypto enthusiasts. I will try to help build the SmartWeb, our interpretation of Web3, in any way I can. The SmartWeb can’t survive unless project developers, internet influencers, and e-business vendors can make profits on their own.”</p>
<p>Improvements:<br>
“Currently, there is also a divide between the eastern and western members of the Cyber Republic communities. I hope to be an interpreter and help people see that both the world and the internet are common ground for us all.”</p>

 Greater agility, faster innovation, increased engagement Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Excuse us as we go full on bizniz mode for the rest of this post. We’re quite serious about the benefits of openness and have built our cooperative as well as our individual careers on the fact that Open Source is about more than just code. What follows is the “business case” for shifting your organisation to a more open model. We’ve borrowed liberally from the <a href="http://theopenorganization.org/">Open Organization community</a>, a group of people (including one of our members) who have written about the models and behaviours inside of FOSS for many&nbsp;years.</p><p>The evidence is clear: open working leads to greater agility, faster innovation, and increased engagement. Members of your organisation are more capable of working toward goals in unison and with shared vision. Ideas from both inside and outside the organisation receive more equitable consideration. Members clearly see connections between their particular activities and an organisation’s overarching values, mission, and&nbsp;spirit.</p><p>These advantages translate directly into better business performance and a stronger bottom line. If you want your organisation to obtain better results with the resources you currently have available, then embracing open working practices is one of your best paths toward sustainable success.</p><p>But don’t just take our word for&nbsp;it:</p>  Agility: According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/how-to-create-an-agile-organization">McKinsey &amp; Company</a>, organisations that adopt information transparency across their operations can achieve up to 30% gains in efficiency and customer satisfaction.  Innovation: <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/12/how-open-innovation-can-help-you-cope-in-lean-times">Harvard Business Review</a> reports that companies that support open and collaborative working environments can see a speed increase of up to 30% in their innovation cycles.  Engagement: Research by <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-employee-satisfaction.aspx">Gallup</a> reveals that highly engaged business units realise a 41% reduction in absenteeism, 17% increase in productivity, 10% higher customer ratings, see a 20% increase in sales, and are 21% more profitable.   5 Characteristics of an Open Organisation <p>Open Organisations are <a href="https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/open-org-definition">defined</a> as exhibiting the following characteristics:</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Let’s explain what’s meant by each of&nbsp;these:</p> Transparency <p>This is fundamental to open organisations and involves everyone involved on a project to access all relevant materials by default. As a result, this means that team members are all able to review, assess, and contribute effectively to the work being done. Moreover, transparency means team members being not only informed about decisions and processes, but being encouraged to participate in discussions and provide feedback. Both successes and failures are discussed openly, meaning that valuable lessons can be learned, goals can be clarified, and roles well-defined. All of this enhances the overall organisational accountability.</p> Inclusivity <p>Open organisations actively welcome diverse viewpoints and ensure that everyone has a voice in the future of both the project, and organisation as a whole. This can be achieved not only through well-established technical channels but also through social norms that encourage a range of perspectives. It’s important that there are clear protocols for participation so as to promote an inclusive environment where feedback is valued. Leadership for inclusivity includes proactively including overlooked voices and ensuring that all relevant opinions are heard and considered. This approach enriches the decision-making process and also reinforces a sense of duty among employees to contribute meaningfully to discussions about their&nbsp;work.</p> Adaptability <p>The adaptability of open organisations is characterised by their flexibility and resilience, based on collective problem-solving and collaborative decision-making. To allow true adaptability, feedback mechanisms need to be accessible to both internal and external members. This allows for peer support and agency which can have clear impact on operational methods. This orientation towards continuous learning and the readiness to adapt based on feedback helps organisations avoid repetitive mistakes. It also helps them stay responsive to the changing needs of their environment.</p> Collaboration <p>In open organisations, collaboration is the default mode of operation. These is a general belief that working together produces superior outcomes, not only in project work, but also in terms of improving organisations. Ensuring a spirit of openness means that work is not only shared within the organisation but is also available for improvement by external parties, leading to greater innovation and continuous improvement. The ease with which people can discover, provide feedback on, and join ongoing work is a useful barometer for how different, welcoming, and collaborative open organisations are compared to&nbsp;others.</p> Community <p>The community aspect of open organisations is based on shared values and principles that guide participation and decision-making. These values should be clear to all members and help define the organisation’s boundaries and success criteria. Team members within this community approach are empowered to make significant contributions based on a common ‘language’ to prevent miscommunication. Sharing knowledge and experiences is encouraged to further the group’s work, which strengthens the communal bond and ensuring collective progress towards organisational goals.</p><p>As you can see, these characteristics are interconnected and intertwined, leading to a virtuous cycle of openness.</p> Practical Steps Towards&nbsp;Openness Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Ultimately, working openly is about cultural change. A change in attitude as much as a change in processes.</p><p>To transition to more open working practices, consider the following steps:</p>  Clear guidelines: Work together to document and share clear guidelines on what open working could look like in your organisation. This includes how information is shared, how feedback is given and received, and how decisions are&nbsp;made.  Culture of transparency: Encourage leaders and team members to share their work and the reasoning behind their decisions openly. This can be facilitated through regular meetings, shared digital workspaces, and open forums where ideas and projects are discussed transparently.  Inclusive communication: Ensure that all team members have equal access to communication tools and platforms. Use a variety of channels to accommodate different working styles and preferences, and encourage everyone to contribute to discussions and decision-making processes.  Collaboration across boundaries: Use technology and collaborative tools to break down silos within your organisation. Encourage teams to work together across departments and even invite external partners or customers to contribute to projects where appropriate.  Community engagement: Create spaces (physical/virtual/hybrid) where employees can interact, share ideas, and support each other. Regular community-building activities and team-building exercises can strengthen the communal bonds and enhance the shared sense of&nbsp;purpose.   Addressing Potential Challenges Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>While transitioning to an open working environment offers many benefits, it also comes with challenges that need to be managed. For example, information overload can be avoided by sharing information in a structured and digestible way so as not to overwhelm team members. Try using tools that allow for information to be categorised and easily searched.</p><p>While transparency is to be encouraged, clearly define sensitive information to ensure that robust security practices are in place to protect it. Provide training to team members around data protection standards and the importance of respective privacy and confidentiality.</p><p>While open working encourages broader participation, this needs to be balanced with the need for efficiency. So set clear objectives and deadlines for collaborative projects to avoid decision-making bottlenecks or&nbsp;delays.</p><p>Some team members may resist changes to traditional ways of working. Overcome such cultural resistance by demonstrating the tangible benefits of open working practices through pilot projects and sharing success stories. Provide training and mentoring to help adaptation to the new ways of doing&nbsp;things.</p> Conclusion Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>The shift towards working openly and transparently is a strategic move that can significantly enhance an organisation’s agility, innovation, and engagement. By encouraging a culture of openness based on transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community, organisations can create an environment where every member feels valued and empowered to contribute.</p><p>This approach not only drives better business performance but also cultivates a sense of shared purpose and commitment among employees. Embracing open working practices isn’t just an ‘initiative’ but a pathway to sustainable success and a robust bottom line. By implementing clear guidelines, engendering a culture of transparency, ensuring inclusive communication, promoting collaboration, and engaging the community, organisations can navigate potential challenges and realise the full benefits of open&nbsp;working.</p><p>As you would expect of an organisation called We Are Open, our cooperative can help you and your organisation on this journey. <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">Get in touch</a>, or take our <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/open-course/">free email-based course</a>, to find out&nbsp;more!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-business-case-for-working-openly-and-transparently-867e3fb04588">The Business Case for Working Openly and Transparently</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>IDunion SCE, the neutral and democratically organised European cooperative created from the IDunion research consortium, has been offering their managed network infrastructure for industrial and productive use since April 2024.</p>

<p>As a neutral basic infrastructure, the distributed and redundant network enables every company to independently store and manage identity information and all types of company-related data. Companies can store unique and distinctive company identity-related identifiers (DID – Decentralised Identifier) on the IDunion network, which are permanent, unchangeable and verifiable and do not require the use of a central register. The identifiers can be linked to user-defined company data or company attributes. All company data can be managed according to predefined parameters and can of course also be revoked. IDunion SCE makes the identifiers available to companies as required and assigns corresponding write authorisations for network use on an individual contractual basis.</p>

<p>The network is based on the open source software Hyperledger Indy. All network nodes are operated exclusively by cooperative members in accordance with the principles of the IDunion SCE and monitored by the latter as a neutral body. The IDunion SCE and the infrastructures it manages and supports are subject to the principles of openness, neutrality, sovereignty, transparency, integrity and cooperative competition. All members of the cooperative have the same voting rights, regardless of their company size. This ensures that all participating companies can have an equal influence on the technical and organised development of the IDunion SCE and thus the ecosystem. Companies can join the European co-operative as members at any time.</p>

 Nancy Cam-Winget, Cisco

 Mike Kiser, SailPoint 
 Geraint Rogers, Daon

<p>This summary draws out general themes and comments are not attributed to individuals or their organizations.</p>
 Technology is Never Neutral 
<p>“Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral”</p>
<p>-Melvin Krantzberg</p>
<p>People and organizations have been working to build artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools for many years now. For decades, companies have been using predictive AI for a range of purposes, including fraud detection, security, etc. When the pandemic hit, Moderna used AI to speed up the development of the vaccine.</p>
<p>On the flip side, such models can (either inadvertently or by design) deepen disparities, promote bias, or create other harms. After all, if Moderna can apply these tools for public health, bad actors can use similar models to create biological weapons.</p>
 New Tools, New Harms 
<p>AI has been present for some time, but with the emergence of Generative AI (coupled with vast increases in computing power now available), there are far more tools available – and to a much wider audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The panelists agree that this expanding audience, while it fosters inclusion and democratizes technology, creates meaningful new risks. With OpenSource AI LLMs now available (e.g. via HuggingFace) would-be bad actors have extremely powerful tooling at their fingertips. Each and every benefit of AI might be mirrored in illicit industries.&nbsp;</p>
 Identity 
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/F4WZ_k0vUDM?si=O3SRoVSWDyGdmn8_">Nachricht von Ella | Without Consent</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p> One of the most insidious risks that the panel discussed is AI’s impact on Identity – not just Digital Identity, but Identity itself. Synthetic content is becoming pervasive and the threat of viable impersonation can no longer be ignored. The use of quantum-resistant digital signing to validate provenance becomes a priority for any content generated today.</p>
<p>Gen AI has changed the game. It’s a way of life in business operations now. Barriers to entry are so low – and this has had amazing benefits but they are mirrored in the dark world.&nbsp;</p>
 AI Development 
<p>Coding is now largely an AI-facilitated activity. As developers come to rely more and more upon LLMs to support their work, there is a risk that expertise – particularly in cybersecurity – may wane at the exact time that organizations like CISA are calling for more focus. Furthermore, research suggests that AI-assisted code is substantially more insecure&nbsp; – but that developers using AI wrongly feel that their code is more secure (see “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622">Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants</a>” out of Cornell) With more than 50% of code being AI generated today, there is substantial risk that bad code will enter the supply chain via AI.</p>
<p>It is in this context that there is a risk to the OIDF and other standards bodies that build safe and interoperable protocols. When novice developers, unfamiliar with the specifications, seek LLM guidance on OIDF standards, they may receive poor guidance as to how to implement or bad code itself.</p>
 Outsourced Ethics 
<p>As more and more thought gets outsourced to LLMs, there is a risk that humans will miss important opportunities to think critically about the ethical implications of any given work product. This may happen by virtue of efficiency-seeking, negligence, or decreasing levels of capability as specialisms shift to AI. Since all technologies are value-laden either by intention or by outcome (e.g. as a result of the training data and other system inputs), there’s a risk that human values will be replaced by algorithmic values if AI facilitated innovation isn’t kept in check.&nbsp;</p>
 What Can We Do? 
<p>There are many organizations and regulators now grappling with the challenges that emerging AI presents on a societal level. An audience poll revealed that the majority of OIDF members present agreed that the Foundation needs to keep a watchful eye on AI and act, now or in the future, to mitigate the risks posed by AI. Such mitigations might include:</p>
 
 Standards Development: ensure that threat models consider the latest attacks and that standards evolve to meet given the new risks that LLMs present for real people with regards to asserting and protecting their identities online.&nbsp; 
 LLM Accuracy: explore methods by which OIDF can help ensure that LLMs produce guidance that is aligned to the latest specifications and best-practice configurations.

<a href="https://elastos.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/3.-去中心化人工智能和数字版权管理案例.mp3">https://elastos.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/3.-去中心化人工智能和数字版权管理案例.mp3</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/05/openai-scarlett-johansson-sky/678446/">controversy</a>, Scarlett Johansson <a href="https://x.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1792679435701014908">disclosed</a> that she had been approached by OpenAI to voice their latest ChatGPT 4.0 system. After declining the offer, she was dismayed to find the released AI voice, named “Sky,” closely mimicked her own, raising ethical concerns about the unauthorised use of her voice. This incident highlights the need for decentralised AI and digital rights management to ensure creators retain control over their contributions and identities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Problems with Centralised AI Systems 
<p>Centralised AI systems, like those managed by OpenAI, control vast amounts of data and intellectual property. These systems can replicate individual contributions without proper consent or compensation, as seen in Johansson’s case. Centralised control can lead to misuse and ethical violations, undermining the rights of creators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Elacity’s Decentralised Digital Rights Management (dDRM) 
<p>Imagine a future where you can go to an open market and purchase Scarlett Johansson’s AI voice directly from her for your personal AI, seek her advice on the film industry, or use her 3D avatar to create a custom movie. In this decentralised AI marketplace, professionals from various sectors offer their AI-trained services. You could access legal advice from an AI trained by top attorneys, receive medical consultations from doctor-developed AIs, or engage in therapy sessions with AI counsellors. Students benefit from AI tutors for personalised learning, while creatives can hire AI voice actors, writers, and editors for high-quality content.</p>
<p>Professionals can use AI personal assistants for administrative tasks, and fitness enthusiasts can access AI personal trainers for customised workouts. This decentralised AI marketplace democratises access to high-quality services, fostering innovation and personalisation across various fields, where everyone is fairly rewarded. AI processing for all is performed on the user’s device like your Iphone or Laptop using edge computing with complete privacy over third-party servers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.ela.city/">Elacity’s</a> dDRM system built on the <a href="http://elastos.info">Elastos SmartWeb</a> offers a solution through blockchain technology and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Here’s how it can revolutionise AI and empower creators:</p>
 1. Decentralised AI Training and Ownership: 
 
 AI Capsules: Creators can encapsulate their contributions, like voice recordings, into encrypted AI Capsules stored on decentralised networks. This ensures creators retain ownership and control over their data. 
 Collaborative Training: In a decentralised AI ecosystem, multiple stakeholders can collaboratively train AI models, with contributors receiving fair compensation through smart contracts. 
 
 2. Smart Contracts and Tokenisation: 
 
 Tokenisation: Digital Capsules are indexed with ERC-721 tokens for distinct ownership and managed with ERC-1155 tokens for access, distribution, and royalties. Smart contracts enforce transparency and fairness. 
 Automated Royalties: Smart contracts automate royalty distribution, ensuring creators are paid immediately and fairly whenever their contributions are used. 
 
 3. Global Decentralised Marketplace: 
 
 Marketplace for AI Capsules: Elacity’s platform supports a marketplace where AI Capsules can be traded. Creators can directly monetise their contributions, fostering a global economy free from centralised control. 
 Transparent Transactions: Blockchain technology ensures all transactions are verifiable and secure, reducing the risk of unauthorised use. 
 
 4. Decentralised AI Playback: 
 
 
 
 Runtime Execution Environment: Elacity’s decentralised runtime operates on the user’s device, executing AI locally and ensuring complete privacy. This setup eliminates the need for centralised servers, allowing AI models to run securely and privately on individual devices. Users retain control over their data and interactions, enhancing security and privacy in AI applications. 
 
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Benefits of Decentralised DRM for AI 
 
 Empowers Creators: Creators maintain control and receive direct compensation, preventing unauthorised use as seen in Johansson’s case. 
 Ensures Transparency and Security: Blockchain provides transparent, secure, and immutable transactions. 
 Encourages Collaboration: Decentralised AI promotes collaborative training, benefiting from diverse data sources while protecting individual rights. 
 
<p>The controversy involving Scarlett Johansson and OpenAI highlights the need for a decentralised approach to AI and digital rights management. Elacity’s dDRM system, leveraging blockchain technology, provides a secure, transparent, and fair solution for managing digital assets. By empowering creators and protecting their rights, Elacity paves the way for a more democratic and ethical digital economy where AI systems are co-trained and managed fairly.

<p>Spring conference season is in full swing and the Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) is heading to Europe to participate in several major conferences:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) </a>— June 4-7, Berlin, Germany 



 <a href="https://www.terrapinn.com/exhibition/identity-week/">Identity Week Europe </a>— June 11-12, Amsterdam, Netherlands 



 <a href="https://diceurope.org/">Digital Identity unConference Europe (DICE</a>) — June 18-20, Zurich, Switzerland.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>We will also be attending the second regional summit of the <a href="https://sidi-hub.community/about-sidi/">Sustainable &amp; Interoperable Digital Identity (SIDI)</a> Summit 2024 series.</p>



<p>Trust Over IP, which celebrates its fourth birthday this month, has long been known for its dual stack that emphasizes why we must combine technical interoperability with governance interoperability in order to establish truly interoperable digital trust ecosystems.</p>







<p>Although in our early history we were best known for our work on the governance side of the dual stack, at these June conferences our emphasis will be on two new technical specifications for which we just published Implementers Drafts: the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2024/04/11/toip-announces-the-first-implementers-draft-of-the-trust-spanning-protocol-specification/">Trust Spanning Protocol</a> and the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2024/04/03/toip-announces-the-implementers-draft-of-thetrust-registry-protocol-specification-v2-0/">Trust Registries Protocol</a>. Both of these protocols are designed to maximize interoperability and authenticity and minimize risk, while still enabling each ecosystem to make the choices they need for their specific context.</p>



<p>The following is a schedule of all the conference sessions and talks in which ToIP members or our partners will be participating.</p>



 



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join us at EIC for a panel of ToIP Steering Committee Members, moderated by Executive Director, Judith Fleenor.</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5643/1">Panel: The Emerging Trust Layer for the Internet: Using Minimum Viable Protocols to Achieve Maximum Interoperability</a> 



<p>Friday, June 07, 2024 13:30—14:30</p>



<p>Interoperability is not created alone and that is why ToIP collaborates with other standards organizations and certifications bodies.&nbsp; Executive Director, Judith Fleenor has invited the Executive Directors from <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/">Open Identity Exchange</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a>, <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">Open Wallet Foundation</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> to unpack the role each foundation plays, how we collaborate to create the full picture for digital trust, and why it is so important for organizations and individuals to support and participate in several foundations, not just one.</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5709/1">Panel: Executive Directors Speak: Why We Need More Collaboration</a> 



<p>Friday, June 07, 2024 14:30—15:30</p>



<p>At last year’s EIC Judith gave a keynote on <a href="https://youtu.be/Hhv5-xbcmkw">Decentralized Identity Why is it all the rage?</a>&nbsp; Her premise was that the technologies that enable decentralized identity could be used, not only for traditional identity and access management, but more importantly for content authenticity and to assist in the challenges that AI brings.&nbsp; This year, Al will be a big topic at EIC, and several ToIP Steering Committee members will be addressing these topics in various sessions throughout the week.</p>



<p>On Wednesday Wenjing Chu, Futurewei Technologies and Drummond Reed, Gen Digital will be on the panel:</p>

<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text

  You’re reading this on a machine with an operating system: Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS, or Android. But that’s not your OS. It’s your machine’s. How about one for you, that runs on your machine but is entirely yours? Let’s call it a Personal OS, or a POS. The POS will have a kernel onto which […]

<p>You’re reading this on a machine with an operating system: Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS, or Android.</p>
<p>But that’s not your OS. It’s your machine’s.</p>
<p>How about one for you, that runs on your machine but is entirely yours? Let’s call it a Personal OS, or a POS.</p>
<p>The POS will have a kernel onto which abilities (not just applications) can be added. An extreme example of how this might work is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GftSkyUsA94">Neo learning ju jitsu</a> in The Matrix:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GftSkyUsA94"></a></p>
<p>That OS amplified&nbsp;Neo’s own intelligence, in his own head. We’re far from that today. But we can at least add abilities to a POS of our own. Those too can give us more agency of many kinds.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there is only one POS so far. It’s called <a href="https://paios.org/">pAI-OS</a> (<a href="https://github.com/pAI-OS/paios">Github code</a>), and it’s led by <a href="https://kwaai.ai">Kwaai</a>.* To my knowledge, pAI-OS is the first and only truly personal operating system. (If others do the same, let me know and I’ll talk those up too.) And it is built to run our own AIs. Let’s call them PAIs, where the A can mean amplified or augmented (<a href="https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/">sourcing Doug Englebart</a> for the latter).</p>
<p>So, what kind of abilities are we talking about?</p>
<p>Let’s start with something that could hardly be more mundane and important: memory.</p>
<p>In Laws of Media, Marshall McLuhan said (five decades ago) that computing promises “perfect memory—total and exact.” For many millennia, our species has been outboarding memory through speech, the written word, and collecting all of that in libraries and museums. And now, in the digital age that dawned with microcircuits and the Internet, we now occupy a <a href="https://www.digitallife.center/index.php/digital-life">digital world</a> where everybody can publish whatever they want. To peruse that, we made search engines. Those ruled from the late ’90s until approximately yesterday, when AIs took over servicing our interest in answers to questions. Google, Microsoft, ChatGPT, Perplexity.ai, and others have moved into a space we might call AI answerware.</p>
<p>Running all that answerware are corporate AIs. Lets call them CAIs. Nothing wrong with CAIs, but also nothing personal, because they are not ours. I explain the difference in <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/10/personal-vs-personalized/">Personal vs. Personalized AI</a>. Here’s a graphic from that post showing a bit of what abilities might run on your PAI:</p>
<p></p>
<p>PAIs can extend our own memories by accumulating personal stuff we need to know better, and our ability to meet, access, and use the external abilities of the CAI world. So we’ll have our agents + their agents, working together.</p>
<p>For an example of how that might work, take a look at <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">The most important standard in development today</a>: <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/">P7012:&nbsp;Standard for Machine Readable Personal Privacy Terms</a>, which “identifies/addresses the manner in which personal privacy terms are proffered and how they can be read and agreed to by machines.” After seven years with a working group, it is now in the IEEE editing and approval mill, edging toward becoming a finished standard by next year. It works like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here your agent (a PAI, represented by the ⊂ symbol) proffers your privacy terms (<a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/tools/terms/p2b1/">here is one example</a>) to a corporate agent (which might or might not be a CAI, but is still represented with the reciprocal symbol ⊃. (This should be familiar to ProjectVRM veterans as the <a href="https://projectvrm.org/category/r-button/">r-button</a>. We may finally get to use it!)</p>
<p>The ceremony here is the exact reverse of what we have today with the cookie popovers on most website home pages. This can and should be done ⊂ to ⊃. So should signing and recording the agreement, or the choice of the site, should it tell you to screw off. (An agent running on your PAI will record that diss.)</p>
<p>I also bring this up because it will be a key required ability—not just for you and me but for the world, starting with Europe, where <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/a-guide-to-lawful-basis/">the GDPR lists six lawful bases for processing personal data</a>. They begin—</p>
<blockquote><p>(a) Consent: the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose.<br>
(b) Contract: the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they have asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract.</p></blockquote>
<p>By now everyone knows that (a) Consent has failed. It’s an expensive and meaningless dance, with high cognitive (mostly cynical) overhead, and almost no accountability. Now they’re ready for (b) Contract, especially in ceremonies where the individual (not a mere “user”) takes the lead.</p>
<p>I believe there is less limit to what each of us can do with a PAI than there is to what we can do with a laptop or a phone. Because our PAI is our own. It runs on a deeper machine OS, but is not limited by that. Your PAI, running on your POS, may prove to be the first truly personal layer ever put on a machine OS.</p>
 
<p>*Full disclosure: I am now the <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/about">Chief Intention Officer</a> there. At this stage, it’s a voluntary position.</p>

<p></p>
 Node12 
 
 Email: breakingyield@gmail.com 
 Current Council Member: No 
 Background: “My background with Elastos dates back to February 2018 albeit with limited community involvement until November 2023 when I read the Bel2 whitepaper. Having a long-term interest in Defi, Bel2 was the Elastos development that compelled me to pursue an expanded role. My professional background consists of 20 years in financial services with multiple executive-level roles in private equity investment management and management consulting with a focus on asset management.” 
 Contribution Goals: “Based on my professional background, I would have the greatest impact in the areas of finance and accounting. Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&amp;A), Capital Requirements / Project Evaluation, Budgeting, Financial Modeling.” 
 Improvements: “Given a finite amount of capital (ELA/BTC) and unlimited opportunities, I would like to see metrics to evaluate ROI for new and ongoing proposals.”

 Tyro and his Friends 
 
 Email: ligreatmen@gmail.com 
 Current Council Member: Yes 
 Experience: “As a current member of the Council, I have witnessed the challenges and growth of Elastos over the past year. Each proposal is crucial to the development of Elastos; however, considering various rules and realities, it is not easy to decide whether to approve each proposal. The votes of the Council members represent their own opinions and aim to consider the concerns of other community members as much as possible. Therefore, in the new round of elections, I have organized nine community members to participate together, named Tyro and his friends! Before each new proposal is formally voted on, the nine of us will discuss it internally to form a consensus. After which, I will cast the final vote on behalf of the group. This is an extension of the CR consensus, and we believe it can better represent the community’s opinion.” 
 Background: “I am a long-time supporter of this project, and I still believe we can make it! I want to participate in this project more deeply!” 
 Contribution Goals: “Carefully review and vote on each proposal, ensuring the stable operation of our node. Continuously promote Elastos on social media and actively engage with community members.” 
 Improvements: “I personally believe that the CRC can encourage greater involvement. Although there are only 12 nodes, if each node is comprised of several community members, forming mini DAO teams within a DAO framework, that would be even more ideal.”

 Iggispopis CRC 
 
 Email: biroigor@biroigor.sk 
 Current Council Member: No 
 Background: “I have many years of experience in strategic management, marketing, and finance, which has given me a comprehensive perspective on solving complex challenges and leading projects to successful completion. As an OG member of the Elastos community, I have always supported transparency, efficiency, and active participation in decision-making processes. I am inspired by the growth and potential of Elastos as a technological platform for the decentralized web, which is why I decided to run for a position on the Cyber Republic Council.” 
 Contribution Goals: “If elected, my priority will be to address technical barriers that hinder the broader adoption of Elastos technologies such as RPC, Explorers, Bridge, and the development of the Essentials wallet. I plan to propose removing the ‘Abstain’ option in voting, changing the decision to a simple ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. I will actively communicate proposals and projects with the community on Telegram, where members are most active and interaction is practically immediate. Conducting surveys and polls will help us gather valuable feedback and understand the community’s views on various proposals and the direction of Elastos.” 
 Improvements: “I believe there is room for increased transparency and community engagement within the CRC. Currently, the community is not sufficiently involved in managing and deciding on proposals and their funding. Many do not express their opinions on the Cyber Republic website. I plan to actively communicate these proposals on Telegram, where members are most active. I also aim to ensure better information about the progress of projects funded by the CR treasury.”

 Metaverse4Good 
 
 Email: roger.darashah@elastoselavation.org 
 Current Council Member: No 
 Background: “Roger is a communications professional with over 30 years of experience working in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. He previously managed multi-market programs for HP (for the PR firm Edelman) covering 40 countries; adapting messages and assets for local consumption and collaborating with teams across cultures, backgrounds, and nationalities. Roger speaks French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian. He also served as Chief Operating Officer at India’s largest PR firm, Adfactors; operating from Mumbai across local and international clients including the Tata Group, Mphasis, and Schneider Electric. In 2020 he co-founded LatAm Intersect PR, a firm operating in 12 countries with an audience-based programming approach. Roger also co-founded the community Metaverse4Good to discuss and define a set of behaviors that would ensure Web3 remained a truly open, accessible, and inclusive environment for all.” 
 Contribution Goals: “Firstly, to communicate the real benefits of the SmartWeb; not only in technical terms but from a consumer/societal perspective. Secondly, to help ensure Bitcoin attains its true potential as a decentralized currency of confidence. These are the issues that I’ll be highlighting through compelling content, storytelling, and case studies; where the users are the protagonists rather than any particular brand.” 
 Improvements: “I believe that we should now singularly focus on the current product stack and proposition: BeL2; to liberate and use otherwise ‘dormant’ Bitcoin (through staking); to create multiple sustainable business models and revenue streams for the entire ecosystem. Elastos’ BTC Oracle; combining on/off-chain data to understand who is using Bitcoin and for what, and to create/refine business models based on these insights.”

 Strawberry Republic 
 
 Email: wildstrawberrysupernodes@gmail.com 
 Current Council Member: Yes 
 Experience: “As members of the Strawberry Republic, formerly known as the Strawberry Council, our collective experience over the past four years in the CRC DAO has been both rewarding and transformative. Our perfect voting record stands as a testament to our commitment and reliability, reflecting our dedication to incorporating community sentiments into every decision we make. With the rebranding to Strawberry Republic and the return of Vegas Mike, a founding member of the original Strawberry Supernodes, we are energized by the synergy and perspectives he brings back to the team. Together, we are united in our vision for Elastos, dedicated to amplifying the voice of the community and supporters, whether they are interacting with us online or offline.” 
 Background:
 
 Sir Kahuna: “With over two decades of experience in the construction industry, I am the owner of a profound construction company specializing in residential development, commercial, and industrial infrastructure projects. My approach is characterized by a drive to achieve grand visions, a principle that I also apply to my role within the Elastos ecosystem. As a founding member of the Wild Strawberry Supernodes, I have been dedicated to securing the Elastos blockchain since its early days in 2018. Beyond hosting Supernodes, securing the Elastos network, and running a construction company, I am a junior graphic artist, where I channel my creativity into producing engaging NFT collections and dynamic graphics.” 
 Vegas Mike: “As a coffee-fueled entrepreneur and seasoned graphic designer, my career spanning over 25 years has been dedicated to pursuing creative excellence. My foundation in graphic design and garment manufacturing has allowed me to consistently produce top-notch designs and apparel that embody innovation and practicality. I am adept at anticipating industry trends and utilizing cutting-edge software technologies, ensuring my work remains relevant and leading-edge.” 
 
 
 Contribution Goals: “As the Strawberry Republic, our dedication to the Elastos community remains steadfast. If re-elected for the 2024/25 CRC term, we will continue to prioritize the community’s best interests in every decision and vote. Our approach is fueled by a deep passion and love for Elastos, which we actively express through grassroots art initiatives and dynamic social media engagement. Additionally, we will vigorously promote Vegas Mike’s online store featuring Elastos, BEL2, and Bitcoin merchandise, bringing your favorite crypto logos and art to life. We are also keen on exploring collaborations with startups to drive innovation within the Elastos platform.” 
 Improvements: “If re-elected, one of our primary goals is to enhance transparency and communication between the CRC and the Elastos community. We are committed to collecting community sentiment before casting our votes, ensuring that every decision reflects the true interests and perspectives of the community members.”

 Yew/Mark 
 
 Email: ywj970104@hotmail.com 
 Current Council Member: No 
 Background: “My name is Yew and I am from Malaysia. I am just an average crypto enthusiast like many of you in this community. My real-life job is a Teacher, and I teach students sports and physical education. However, provided this opportunity to have a seat in this council and being here as an active community member since last year, the potential of this project being recognized globally is huge from observing Rong, Sunny, Sash, Jon, and other team member’s discussions, updates, and ongoing developments here. What is lacking now in my very honest opinion is community voice and recognition which is why my partnership with Mark in this seat is to represent Community Voice and to ensure this Voice is heard.” 
 Contribution Goals: “My contribution would be to express the community’s thoughts, feedback, and proposals to direct Elastos in the direction that the community wants and to ensure Elastos grows to be an excellent organization that is recognized globally. This partnership between myself and Mark is to represent the community and showcase Community Voice to ensure a community-focused project development.” 
 Improvements: “Recognizing community feedback, thoughts, and proposals.”

 Gelaxy 
 
 Email: jiangzehua@gelaxy.io 
 Current Council Member: Yes 
 Experience: “Participating in CR meetings and proposal discussions in the past year has helped make our team better. Understanding the current community dynamics and project development can provide great help for functional development on the chain. I hope to continue our efforts in the next year, provide some technical suggestions for relevant decisions, and contribute to the better development of Elastos.” 
 Background: “The Gelaxy team is mainly responsible for the development of main and side chains. The implementation of many proposals requires the participation of the chain team. It is necessary to be able to discuss and know the relevant details at the CR committee meeting.” 
 Contribution Goals: “Participate in proposal discussions, understand the details of the proposal, and give suggestions and opinions on technical implementation.” 
 Improvements: “I hope that it will be easier to initiate the proposal and allow community members to easily participate in the advancement of the proposal, not just the CR members themselves; some members of the community will apply for proposals. Funding is not very standardized, I hope ELA application can be more standardized.”

 Bean 
 
 Email: <a>go.elastos@gmail.com</a> 
 Current Council Member: Yes 
 Experience: “In the past year as a member of the Council, I have focused on enhancing community engagement and supporting project development. If re-elected, I aim to continue these initiatives, improve transparency, and strengthen community communication to ensure sustainable growth.” 
 Background: “I have a background in investment and have been involved with the Elastos ecosystem for years. My interest in blockchain technology and belief in Elastos’ vision inspired me to run for the CR council. I am dedicated to using my experience to support the community and contribute to its growth.” 
 Contribution Goals:
 
 “Provide professional advice to the CR and ecosystem based on my knowledge and experience.” 
 “Work with council members to improve transparency and communication within the community.” 
 “Work with ecosystem partners to develop support systems for new and existing projects to help them succeed.” 
 
 
 Improvements:
 
 “Efficient Decision-Making: Streamlining our decision-making processes can help us respond more quickly to emerging opportunities and challenges. This includes improving coordination among council members.” 
 “Comprehensive Support for Projects: Developing a structured support system for projects within the ecosystem can ensure their success and sustainability. This includes providing mentorship, resources, and networking opportunities to help projects grow.” 
 “Professional Advice and Expertise: Leveraging the knowledge and experience of council members to provide professional advice can help guide the CRC and the broader ecosystem towards informed and strategic decisions.”

 Sash | Elacity 🐘 
 
 Email: <a>sash@ela.city</a> 
 Current Council Member: Yes 
 Experience: “As a dedicated member of the Elastos community and a current council member with a 100% voting track record, I have been deeply involved in developing and promoting Rong Chen’s vision. My focus has been on bridging the technical aspects of Elastos with community culture, ensuring that the innovative potential of our platform is both understood and utilised by the broader community. This is particularly highlighted as the Founder and CEO of Elacity, innovating dDRM and Head of Operations at BeL2, allowing Bitcoin to communicate and execute services to EVM without bridging assets.” 
 Contribution Goals: “My primary goal is to continue fostering understanding and integration of Elastos’ technical capabilities within the community. By leveraging my experience and the insights gained from previous council terms, I aim to enhance the accessibility and adoption of our decentralised technologies. This includes promoting the development and deployment of Digital Capsules and Bitcoin Finance within the Elastos SmartWeb, expanding the functionality and reach of the Elacity and BeL2 platforms.” 
 Improvements: “I believe there is significant potential in increasing community engagement and transparency. My initiatives will focus on enhancing communication channels between the council and the community, reducing the reliance on closed chats, and promoting more transparent interactions. Based on my experience, platforms like Telegram often create silos and negative feedback loops despite everyone’s best intentions. With the newly established CRC DAO LLC, I propose shifting more operations and features to the CRC website, which will help ironically ‘centralise’ and streamline open communications. This move will ensure that social media platforms are primarily used for marketing purposes, allowing the CRC website to become the main hub for community engagement and operational updates”.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By highlighting your consistent track record, dedication to Rong Chen’s vision, and focus on community and technical integration, your entry will resonate well with voters who value experience, commitment, and a forward-thinking approach.</p>
<p>These candidates bring a wealth of experience and a wide array of perspectives to the table. The CR election promises to be a significant step forward in shaping the future of Elastos. We encourage all community members to engage with the candidates and participate in the voting process.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Digital ID has been increasingly in the news lately, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=chamber/hansardr/27632/&amp;sid=0017">Australia</a>&nbsp;begins to ramp up its systems pilots development following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7196986150773792768/">the passing of legislation</a>. In Aotearoa there’s been<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202405/nz-cabinet-minister-champions-digital-id-in-government-transformation-at-data-summit?utm_source=MarketingList&amp;utm_campaign=dc16ec863f-Top+Reads+17-05-202417%2F5%2F24+11%3A59+AM&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_3ab9d4375a-dc16ec863f-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D">&nbsp;a lot happening too</a>&nbsp;as Minister Collins opened<a href="https://nzgovdata.co/">&nbsp;this year’s Summit</a>&nbsp;where DINZ was on stage later.</p>



<p>Contained within the avalanche of consultations posted in March and early April, was the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DISTF-Rules-Draft-April-2024.pdf">second revision of the rules</a>&nbsp;that support NZ’s own<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2023/0013/latest/LMS459583.html">&nbsp;Digital Identity Trust Framework (DISTF) Act</a>. The Department of Internal Affairs(DIA) presented to a packed virtual lunchtime audience on it earlier this month. Digital Identity NZ’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/dinz-distf-working-group/">DISTF Working Group</a>, comprising both private and public sector participants,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DINZ-Response-DISTF-Rules-submission-May-2024.pdf">responded in detail</a>, reflecting the overall message that, despite good intentions to improve security, data protection, and privacy to reduce online fraud, there are alot of moving parts for stakeholders to consider. The fact that it is ‘opt-in’ for stakeholders and that alternative/non-digital channels should always be offered to people and organisations because it is not compulsory, should help provide time to become comfortable and confident with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/biometrics-special-interest-group-sig/">DINZ Biometrics Special Interest Group</a>&nbsp;made a&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DINZ-Submission-Biometrics-Code-Exposure-Draft-May-2024.pdf">deeply considered submission</a>&nbsp;on the Office of the Privacy Commissioner’s (OPC)<a href="https://privacy.org.nz/news/consultations/biometrics">&nbsp;exposure draft of a Code of Practice for biometrics under the Privacy Act 2020</a>. We continue to assert that a code is premature with potential for unintended consequences, whereas well drafted, clear guidance at the outset will deliver better outcomes for all New Zealanders. As if the above two were not enough, the<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2024/0044/latest/whole.html">&nbsp;CDR/CPD bill&nbsp;</a>is set to be introduced to Parliament, which also has a critical digital identity component.</p>



<p>Since the CPD and the Biometrics Code (should it be implemented) are mandatory for specific digital ID service providers undertaking particular identity-related processes, whereas the DISTF is opt-in, I sense that the weight of regulatory burden will result in tough choices for the industry in this small market, despite the good intentions of all stakeholders. In my view, we’ll have to be conscious of the potential for market stall. Could the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2024/0044/latest/whole.html?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=5e09a5a86b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_03_18_11_43_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-5d57a7a812-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D">CDR/CPD bill</a>&nbsp;help unify our data and streamline our sector and service laws to better suit our market size?</p>



<p>Meanwhile, sectors continue to analyse the role of digital identity and the potential to operate schemes within the DISTF, with financial services leading the way. This is demonstrated so clearly by the&nbsp;<a href="https://comcom.govt.nz/about-us/our-role/competition-studies/market-study-into-personal-banking-services?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=8c96051db1-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_03_18_11_43_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-5d57a7a812-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D#projecttab">Commerce Commission’s consultation on personal banking</a>, which highlights the importance of robust digital identification for frictionless bank-switching and faster progress towards Open Banking.</p>



<p>With the above very much in mind,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7194476205281087488/">Payments NZ and DINZ co-hosted a highly productive investigative sprint earlier this month</a>&nbsp;across its combined membership. We brought together experts, representatives from the private, public and NGO sectors, and heard inspiring presentations from Australia’s&nbsp;<a href="https://connectid.com.au/">ConnectID</a>&nbsp;and our very own<a href="https://mattr.global/">&nbsp;MATTR</a>.</p>



<p>The research and education sector have been deeply engaged with digital identity for many years and continue to lead on many fronts. Learn more at our lunchtime webinar on Thursday 13 June simply titled ‘<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/digital-identity-higher-education-aotearoa/">Digital Identity, Higher Education, Aotearoa</a>’, when DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.themiddlewaregroup.com/">Middleware</a>&nbsp;showcases fellow DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university.html">University of Auckland</a>.</p>



<p>The following week, DINZ and FinTechNZ members with a general understanding of ‘digital cash’ should diary note 20 June for a ‘town hall’ styled dynamic submission with The Reserve Bank of New Zealand – Te Pūtea Matua on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/hub/news/2024/04/consultation-opens-on-a-digital-currency-for-new-zealand#:~:text=The%20Reserve%20Bank%20of%20New%20Zealand%20%2D%20Te%20P%C5%ABtea%20Matua%20is,coins%20will%20still%20be%20available.">criticalities (including digital ID) surrounding ‘digital cash</a>’ – a Central Bank Digital Currency as a potential alternative to physical cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DINZ and FinTechNZ members who are familiar with ‘digital cash’ should watch for details about a town hall meeting on Thursday, June 20, with The Reserve Bank of New Zealand – Te Pūtea Matua, discussing a potential Central Bank Digital Currency as an alternative to physical cash. The meeting will cover important topics such as digital ID.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, the Ceramic network was meant to be an open and customizable platform for developers to build on. The core Ceramic team is excited to keep delivering on that promise and launch Ceramic’s new Data Feed API.</p><p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/networking/data-feed-api?ref=blog.ceramic.network">The Data Feed</a> provides a new API for Ceramic that allows developers to receive notifications of updates to JSON documents that are managed via Ceramic. This feed of document updates allows developers to customize the way their data is indexed and queried, and enables the development of new custom database products on top of Ceramic. Databases built on top of the Data Feed API get the advantage of powerful querying capabilities custom-tailored to the needs of the application, while retaining interoperability and composability of the underlying data with all other databases built on the Data Feed API throughout the Ceramic ecosystem.</p> What is the Data Feed API <p>The Data Feed API enables developers to keep track of all the new state changes happening to documents in the Ceramic network, as they are observed on a Ceramic node. These state updates can either be from writes sent to the Ceramic node through the HTTP Client, or writes discovered from the network for Streams belonging to Models that are indexed on the Ceramic node. Ultimately, the Data Feed API can be used to build custom indexers and other database products, e.g., <a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB</a>.</p> Supported API Methods <p>The Data Feed is a read-only API, allowing you to retrieve the feed data through HTTP GET methods. The Data Feed operates on the aggregated state of documents (such as Models and ModelInstanceDocuments), abstracting away the lower-level concerns of the underlying event streaming system. This allows developers to build with familiar JSON documents while taking advantage of automatic application of updates to document state with built-in schema validation.</p><p>Feed data can be accessed via a new HTTP endpoint on the js-ceramic node with the URL path <code>api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents</code>. The feed utilizes Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push messages with the following schema:</p> <code>FeedDocument = {
  resumeToken: string
  commitId: CommitID
  content: any
  metadata: StreamMetadata
  eventType: EventType
}
</code> <p>So for example, the following request:</p><p><code>curl http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents</code> </p><p>will return the following response:</p> <code>data: {
  "resumeToken": "1714742204565000000"
  "commitId": "k6zn3t2py84tn1dpy24625xjv65g4r23wuqpch6mmrywshreivaqiyaqctrz2ba5kk0qjvec61pbmyl15b49zxfd8qd3aiiupltnpveh45oiranqr4njj40",
  "content": "{...}",
  "metadata": {
    "controllers": [
      "did:key:z6MknE3RuK7XU2W1KGCQrsSVhzRwCUJ9uMb6ugwbELm9JdP6"
    ],
    "model": "kh4q0ozorrgaq2mezktnrmdwleo1d"
  },
  "eventType": 2
}
</code> <p>The Data Feed API can also be consumed through event listeners to continuously pull and process events from the feed. For example:</p> <code>import { EventSource&nbsp; } from "cross-eventsource";
import { JsonAsString, AggregationDocument } from '@ceramicnetwork/codecs';
import { decode } from "codeco";

const source = new EventSource('&lt;http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents&gt;')
const Codec = JsonAsString.pipe(AggregationDocument)

source.addEventListener('message', (event) =&gt; {
	console.log('message', event)
	//use JsonAsString, and AggregationDocument to decode and use event.data
	const parsedData = decode(Codec, event.data);
	console.log('parsed', parsedData)
})

source.addEventListener('error', error =&gt; {
	console.log('error', error)
})

console.log('listening...')
</code>  Resumability <p>The Data Feed API also comes with a resumability feature that provides “at least once” delivery semantics. Resumability is the ability for a consumer of the feed to pick up “where it left off” after downtime. Without resumability, an indexer that goes down has no way of receiving and indexing data that was propagated while the indexer was offline. The goal of resumability is to ensure that a consumer of the Data Feed API can be guaranteed to receive the most recent data for each Stream at least once, even in the event of failure.</p><p>Resumability in Data Feed API is enabled by the <code>resumeToken</code> property, which is added to every object emitted by the Data Feed API. This property enables you to initiate a connection and ask for the entries starting immediately after <code>resumeToken</code>.</p><p>For example, let’s say your application got an entry containing <code>resumeToken: "1714742204565000000"</code> . When connecting, you can pass the token value as a query parameter, as follows:</p> <code>// ... same as a code snipped above
const url = new URL("&lt;http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents&gt;")
url.searchParams.set('after', '1714742204565000000') // Value of the last resumeToken
// Connection to &lt;http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents?after=1714742204565000000&gt;
const source = new EventSource(url)
</code> <p>Note that the internal structure of the resumeToken is meant to be considered opaque and may change in the future. You should not try to craft resumeTokens manually, instead, you should always use the resumeToken of the last event you received and processed successfully from the Data Feed resuming the feed with a new connection.</p> What’s coming next? <p>This release marks the initial public release of the Data Feed API with quite a few significant updates already on the horizon.</p><p>One of the upcoming significant updates will be introduced with the new Event Streaming API, powered by ceramic-one (a new implementation of the Ceramic protocol, written in Rust), which will allow developers direct access to the underlying event streams that have historically been hidden behind document-based APIs.</p><p>In addition to that, the core Ceramic team is committed to listening to your feedback and feature requests and taking them into account for future releases.</p><p>At this stage, the core Ceramic team would like to see early adopters trying out the new API and sharing the early feedback with the team.</p> Share your feedback with the Ceramic team! <p>Do you have ideas for how Data Feed API can enable the development of your projects? Or maybe you have questions or feedback on what could be improved? Share your thoughts with the core Ceramic team on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Forum</a>. We would love to hear from you!</p>

<p>Identity providers including Canadian Bank Note (CBN), Veridos (a joint venture between German security tech company Giesecke+Devrient and federal technology company Bundesdruckerei) and Thales shared digital and mobile identity innovations, developments and lessons learned from real-world deployments during Day 2 of ID4Africa in Cape Town. </p><p>The discussion concluded that Digital Identity is a powerful tool to increase inclusion and opportunity. A successful program is one everyone can use, including issuers, holders and verifiers. Convenience, security and interoperability are critical success factors. </p><p>Why build on global standards?<br>Trust - global standards are what enable relying parties / verifiers to trust digital IDs</p><p>Security - digital IDs are always verified electronically using standardized protocols, eliminating the need for error-prone physical inspection</p><p>Ecosystem development - building on standards enables ecosystems to benefit from network effects. For example, wallet provider like Google and Apple are working to persuade entities like Uber and Airbnb to adopt mDOC - reducing the need for ecosystem conveners to find verifiers for the ecosystem </p><p>Scalability - building on standards facilitates planning for the future and readiness to expand into new use cases. For example, the TSA (the body that manages security of air travel in the US) has started accepting mobile IDs for domestic air travel in some states where ISO mDL has been implemented </p><p>Cost reduction - avoid being locked in to a single vendor and reduce the cost of ongoing maintenance and support. Digital Identity based on the 3-party model enables holders to present credentials directly to verifiers, meaning there is no longer a need to maintain verification infrastructure, unlocking major financial savings compared to federated identity schemes, Mark Sullivan said</p><p>Benefits of participation in standards development</p><p>Canadian Bank Note (CBN) is involved in both standards development and implementation. "Digital Identity will be constantly changing for a while now. Participating in the standards process enables us to bring the latest and greatest in Digital Identity back into our solutions space", said Mark Sullivan, Director of Digital Services </p><p>Standards development gaps </p>  Standards integration. CBN is currently focusing on ISO mDL, as it is the only credential format that formalizes credential exchange today   Cross-border trust. Don't reinvent what already exists. For example, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Public Key Directory is a database holding national cryptographic keys used in authentication of e-passport information - need something similar to ensure interoperability between countries  <p>Adoption insights</p>  The tools and standards are in place, but there is still hesitance to start building  Issuing Digital Identities is not enough to ensure adoption; there must be services associated with these identities  Governments' role is to create digital infrastructure which individual agencies and private sector orgs can leverage to make customers' lives easier and safer   Ease of use is critical: Digital Identity needs to be as easy to use as presenting a physical ID card. CBN recommends tight integration of UX/ UI teams into the software development process; their UX team benefited from deep dive research into other apps that require trust to be established, such as mobile banking  <p>Addis Ababa scoops ID4Africa 2025 AGM host city</p><p>The National ID Ethiopia team are celebrating in Cape Town tonight after being announced as winners of the competition to host the ID4Africa 2025 AGM!</p>

		<p>Slalom and New Jersey Institute of Technology Launch “Sophie”–A Prototype Digital Student Concierge</p>
<p>NEWARK, NJ, May 22, 2024 – The EdgeCon conference series continues to solidify its place as a destination event for higher education decision makers, with EdgeCon Spring garnering the event’s highest-ever attendance rate and attendee satisfaction rate. Edge members and vendors are taking note, and choosing the event as a key venue for innovative announcements.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.slalom.com/us/en">Slalom</a> and longtime Edge member, <a href="https://www.njit.edu/">New Jersey Institute of Technology</a> (NJIT), chose EdgeCon as their venue to officially debut a prototype AI Student Success Tool to attendees.</p>
<p>EdgeCon served as the ideal environment for the debut, given the prevalence of higher education membership in attendance, as well as the timely discussions of how AI is transforming higher education. Currently being referred to in development as Sophie, the AI tool is called the NJIT Digital Student Advisor, and is a prototype “digital student concierge”. Sophie was built using Soul Machines technology, with chat capabilities provided by GPT 3.5, and hosted in Microsoft Azure. The prototype was designed to work on any cloud platform with a native LLM integration (AWS, Google, etc.).</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“Launching the prototype for our digital student advisor ‘Sophie’ in partnership with NJIT is just the beginning of a transformative journey for higher education in New Jersey. As we embark on a journey to humanize the future of AI, we’re not just shaping technology, we’re shaping the future of education itself, unlocking limitless possibilities for personalized learning and student success.”&nbsp;</p>

		<p>In this prototype stage, Sophie was programmed to address a specific use case regarding a student interested in switching majors. The Q&amp;A format shown in the demo was developed around typical questions a student may ask when switching majors or attending NJIT for the first time. Further development will focus on additional use cases to support students in their journey when accessing academic or social services at NJIT. The overall purpose is to create and improve upon a digital humanizing experience for students and faculty – one that is both informative and supportive.</p>
<p>Ed Wozencroft, Vice President for Digital Strategy and Chief Digital Officer, Vice President Digital Strategy CIO, NJIT, shared, “NJIT’s Artificial Intelligence Initiative seeks to embed AI in all facets of our university–from teaching and learning; to research and innovation; our operations and infrastructure – all while remaining human-centered. Undoubtedly AI is here to stay, and higher education must adapt to succeed. With great partners like Slalom, we can quickly develop and deploy great tools and services that change the nature of education and improve the value proposition of investing in a now highly personalized higher education.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the prototype is in its early stages, NJIT is currently in development discussions with Slalom to determine the next phases and potential release dates. Stay tuned for launch dates and availability.</p>

<p>DIF SC members and staff are among 2000+ participants from 101 countries participating in the ID4Africa 2024 AGM in South Africa.</p><p>Almost half of the delegates present at the event in Cape Town are representing African governments, as the ID4Africa movement celebrates its tenth year. The opening morning was rich with strategic and operational insights,  including</p>  The stakes are high. Digital identity is critical to "defeating the scandal of invisibility" and ensuring equal access to education, healthcare and economic opportunity, according to Mr Mthiyane, policy director of South Africa's Department of Home Affairs  Optimism tempered by realism. Digital identity is growing fast, but it's still early days. It has taken 30 years for e-passports to reach universal adoption, and ID4AFrica Executive Chairman Dr Atick expects a similar timescale for full adoption of digital ID, though this will be on a bigger scale  Theory versus reality. Some believe citizenship and access credentials should be kept separate. In practice, "You can't think of the technology without considering the national context" Dr Atick stated. This was borne out by the accounts of countries with multiple or porous borders, where establishing citizenship is a key step, though not all services require it    Need for policy and technology alignment. In a poll taken during the initial plenary session, 88% believed a policy requiring a unique National ID Number (UID) to access services should be a priority for lawmakers. Such a policy comes with its own challenges, including how to address the risk of exclusion and safeguard citizens' privacy.  Mix of physical and digital credentials. ID cards are not about to disappear. Most if not all of the programs outlined by speakers combine a UID (often linked to birth registration), a physical card and a digital ID (usually stored and presented via a mobile app). Most programs have adopted a multi-modal approach, with enrollment, authentication et cetera possible online, offline and in-person. That said, digital identity is seen as an important tool to accelerate progress towards Identity For All (UN Sustainable Development Goal 16.9). For example, Malawi's digital ID scheme has helped it transition from a situation where most citizens lacked any legally recognised ID in 2017, to being on track to become the first African country to achieve UN SDG 16.9.    Digital identity as Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). This is the overall theme for the 2024 AGM and was reflected in several panel discussions after the lunch break focused on public policy. A number of related questions were discussed, including how countries can leverage digital identity programs to bootstrap a wider DPI while avoiding being locked into any particular technological approach or stack. Uganda's UGHub team shared that they are pursuing a strategy to establish DPI using protocols, not point solutions. Benefits include 100% uptake of electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) by banks and the rapid deployment of e-signatures across many sectors.  "I urge you to look at UGHub as an example of how to successfully establish DPI" Dr Atick commented.   Evolving privacy approaches. Most schemes rely on centralized databases to store foundational ID data. Privacy and security measures include UID randomization, data encryption, strong access management (including requiring government agencies to prove compliance with privacy laws), explicit user consent for data sharing and tokenized / decentralized authentication. Interest in standards-based privacy enhancing technologies such as decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials is growing.  <p>These insights elicited many challenging questions from the audience. </p><p>Implementation insights from Ethiopia's Fayda ID program</p><p>DIF Steering Committee member Yodahe Zemichael kicked off the presentations from national ID teams by providing an update on Ethiopia's Fayda program. </p><p>Launched in 2022, Fayda provides a foundational ID for citizens and refugees. Key achievements to date include</p>  Personal data regulation passed, creating a strong foundation for Fayda acceptance and uptake  integrated 44 organisations including banks and telcos covering more than 60% of the population, enabling them to securely onboard customers  Started authentication for real-time KYC by relying parties - currently processing 8,000 requests per day  <p>Mr Zemichael described the key points of Ethiopia's strategy for digital credentials:</p>  Enabling citizens to download a legal ID credential as a printable document with embedded QR code, share via a mini-app or show as a plastic printed card (all 3 are equally accepted)   Enable online and offline authentication for eKYC. Most authentication is offline to date (via an authenticator app). This is beneficial for privacy, and Mr Zemichael believes it will continue to be the mainstay of KYC processes for some time   Security and privacy are of utmost importance. The national ID team is looking to support W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) standards in time   <p>Mr Zemichael shared valuable learnings from the Fayda rollout, including </p>  Strong demand for physical credentials - requires printed cards to be delivered to citizen's homes  Enrolling people is an expensive affair including extensive educational activities plus a physical presence in multiple locations. As a result, Fayda is being scaled up  gradually  Importance of citizen education and support, including a national call centre which is open 6 days a week and fields a high volume of queries  <p>The day wrapped up with a fascinating session on DPI, that showed the wide range of approaches being adopted by African nations. Three examples illustrate this diversity</p>  Zambia started by digitizing healthcare records, as this was the most urgent use case. The national ID team is now looking at which outputs can be re-used in other use cases, creating opportunities to build DPI 'on the fly'  Senegal started by identifying digital assets that already existed within different agencies. The country is now building a federation scheme that enables all agencies to leverage these assets  Malawi adopted a 'greenfield' approach that capitalizes on the previous lack of identity infrastructure, enabling the country to create a best-practice digital ID program from scratch without needing to integrate legacy systems and platforms   <p>Dr Atick wrapped up the first day's proceedings by concluding that Africa has talent, digital public infrastructure and choice. </p><p>More updates from the DIF team tomorrow! </p>

 A less technical community-centric guide Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>It’s <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2023/03/16/verifiable-credentials-and-open-badges-3-0-whats-changed/">been a while</a> since the upcoming changes to the Open Badges specification were first proposed. The <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/impl">change to v3.0</a> has now been ratified, with six organisations at the time of writing having platforms that are <a href="https://site.imsglobal.org/certifications">certified compatible</a>.</p><p>We’d like to give a shout-out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerrilemoie/">Kerri Lemoie</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nateotto/">Nate Otto</a> who have tirelessly pushed this work forward, ensuring that the original community-focused mission has continued now that the standard is stewarded by&nbsp;1EdTech.</p><p>The video below gives a overview with the rest of the post helping break down the changes in a less technical way. We can’t say “non-technical” because, well, it’s a technical standard. But we hope that it what follows helps you understand some of the changes and what it means in practice.</p> 1. Enhanced&nbsp;Security <p>Open Badges 3.0 adopts the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC) data model, which enhances the security and integrity of credentials. Unlike with previous versions of the specification, the verifiable data that they contain can be validated without having to check back with the issuer each&nbsp;time.</p><p>This matters because organisations go out of business, web pages get taken down, and life moves on. By ensuring that the badge contains everything required, it can be used for truly lifelong learning for decades to&nbsp;come.</p><p>For example, imagine a cooperative that issues digital badges to its members for skills like collaborative decision-making or sustainable practices. When co-op members with these badges present them to, say, a partner organisation, they can trust that the badge is genuine without needing to contact the co-op directly.</p><p>This is particularly useful in large networks like those we support through our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">storytelling and communications work</a>, where verifying a member’s skills quickly and accurately is valuable.</p> 2. Control and&nbsp;Privacy <p>The introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier">Decentralised Identifiers</a> (DIDs) in Open Badges 3.0 gives badge earners more control over their personal data and how it is shared. DIDs are like personal web addresses for people’s digital identities that they can manage independently.</p><p>For community-oriented organisations, DIDs mean that members can manage their own credentials without relying on a central authority. For example, a member of a social enterprise could share their badges with a funder directly from their personal digital wallet, enhancing privacy and&nbsp;control.</p><p>Also, because DIDs are big long strings of numbers you can also use them anonymously. This could be useful for verifying the claims of sources who want to remain unidentified, for example that a whistleblower actually worked at an organisation that they’re reporting. It’s also possible to control multiple DIDs for different facets of your life, should you wish, such as work, activism, and your social&nbsp;life.</p> 3. Richer&nbsp;Metadata <p>Open Badges 3.0 allows for richer metadata within badges, which means more detailed information about achievements, how they were earned, and what they represent. This includes supporting multimedia content, making badges more descriptive and informative.</p><p>Credentials like badges are useful in helping us tell the story of where we’ve been and where we’re going. This is sometimes called the ‘learner journey’. With Open Badges 3.0, a badge can include images, links, videos, and more, to provide a narrative of how the badge was earned. For those that can remember back 20 years to the interest in eportfolios, each badge is essentially a mini-eportfolio, and can also be part of a wider portfolio.</p><p>For example, a badge for a professional development course could include video testimonials, project examples, and peer evaluations directly within the badge. This makes it easier for potential employers or collaborators to get a true sense of what the badge represents, enhancing the value of the credential to all&nbsp;parties.</p> 4. Interoperability <p>It’s one of those words that it’s difficult to avoid when talking about technical systems, and not one that we use in every day conversation. But ‘interoperability’ just means the ability of different systems, organisations, or products to work together effectively without special effort from the user. Various systems and devices can communicate, exchange data, and use the information that has been exchanged.</p><p>That’s might not sound too exciting, but with its alignment to the VC data model, Open Badges 3.0 is designed to work seamlessly with other digital credentials systems, including those used by educational institutions and businesses. For example, we’re working with the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">Digital Credentials Consortium</a>, and systems can issue all different kinds of achievements, because of the interoperability between Open Badges and&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>For instance, a non-traditional learner who has earned badges as part of their self-taught skills development might want to share these with a university to get onto an MSc course. The university’s system can automatically recognise and understand the badges thanks to the shared VC model. This eases the process of credit recognition and transfer, making it simpler for learners to continue their education or seek job opportunities without so many bureaucratic hurdles.</p> 5. Revocation and Status Management <p>To ‘revoke’ a badge simply means to say that it is no longer valid. There are many reasons why an individual or organisation may wish to do this, and not just because of errors in issuing or poor behaviour by the recipient.</p><p>For example, imagine that an B-Corp has a training programme which they update. While they could simply leave the old badges as-is, to provide less of a headache for people trying to understand the difference between current and previous alumni of the programme, they can now revoke, update, or withdraw badges efficiently.</p><p>With Open Badges 3.0, this process is transparent and straightforward, ensuring that only the most current and accurate badges are in circulation. This helps maintain trust in the badge ecosystem, which is vital for the credibility of our collective efforts in promoting digital credentials.</p> Conclusion <p>I’ve been unreasonably excited about a technical specification for 13 years now, ever since the first MacArthur-funded pilot at Mozilla. This latest update to Open Badges 3.0 is a significant step forward in making digital credentials more secure, user-centered, and meaningful within various communities, including educational institutions, professional networks, and social organisations.</p><p>Along with the work that we’ve been doing around creating <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">plausible utopias for Open Recognition</a>, I’m really looking forward to seeing how this development helps further empower individuals and communities, enhances trust in digital credentials, and supports the broader landscape of lifelong learning.</p><p>If you’d like help with understanding either the basics or the latest developments in credentialing technology, <a href="mailto:hello@weareopen.coop">get in touch</a>! We’ve also got a free email-based course called <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/reframing-recognition/">Reframing Recognition: strategies for success in going beyond microcredentials</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/why-open-badges-3-0-matters-09bb231be864">Why Open Badges 3.0 Matters</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>On April 24, 2024, the FIDO Alliance held its first ever in-person FDO Workshop at the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica Nangang Campus in Taipei. The event attracted over 100 attendees from 30 different organizations. This workshop was dedicated to unveiling the power of the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/device-onboarding-overview/">FIDO Device Onboard</a> (FDO)—a revolutionary open standard that simplifies and secures the device onboarding process by moving away from legacy approaches that often rely on inefficient and insecure passwords and other knowledge-based credentials.</p>







<p>[Pictures from FIDO Taipei Workshop]</p>



<p>The sessions included “FDO 101,” “FDO Certification Programs,” “How to Deploy FDO” and diverse showcases from leaders in edge computing and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/download-iot-specifications/">IoT</a>. Companies including Intel, ASRock, Red Hat, Dell, VinCSS, and Infineon demonstrated how they have developed, applied, and used FDO in their solutions. We are excited to share slides from the workshop:</p>

<p>Traditionally,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/password-manager">passwords</a>&nbsp;have served as the primary means of securing digital identities, yet their limitations are becoming increasingly evident. To pave the way for a passwordless future, accessibility is paramount. Any alternative authentication method must be inclusive, catering to users across diverse technological environments.

<p>The Honorable Rohit Chopra<br>Director<br>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&nbsp;<br>1700 G St NW<br>Washington, DC 20552&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="mailto:rohit.chopra@cfpb.gov">rohit.chopra@cfpb.gov</a></p>
<p>May 16, 2024</p>
<p>Director Chopra,</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is a non-profit organization whose mission is to lead the global community in creating open standards that are secure, interoperable and privacy-preserving. As part of that mission, we have worked closely with many ecosystems to advance Open Banking and consumer financial data sharing globally. We hope to be of service to the CFPB as we are to many other government partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are writing to follow up on our <a href="https://openid.net/oidf-comments-cfpb-rule-1033-regarding-open-banking/">letter</a> submitted on December 29, 2023 in response to the CFPB’s NPRM on Personal Financial Data Rights.&nbsp; This letter is written in light of submissions by other commenters and subsequent discussions with parties in the ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As detailed in our original letter, the OpenID Foundation believes that the final rule should include reference to a Qualified Industry Standard (QIS) for a Communication Protocol.&nbsp; More specifically, we believe this QIS should be required and separate from the QIS for “data in a standardized format” (“Data Format”) as proposed in §1033.311(b). We appreciate that such a change will have an impact to the definitions of 1033.131 and 1033.141(a). We respect the baseline included in 1033.421(e), however as security and implementation experts, we believe it would be suitable to address the security and interoperability risks more completely within this ecosystem as advised in this letter. Since the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act was passed in 1999, the domain of cloud based services, the related security risks, and the global standards to address those risks have evolved substantially.</p>
<p>Specifications for a Data Format and a Communication Protocol are critical to the developer interface required in §1033.301(a), as the standards serve two different purposes. A Data Format standard should prescribe, among other things, naming conventions, standard codes and formatting, data models and schema. A standardized Data Format promotes business interoperability, by allowing third-parties to aggregate and analyze high-quality data with ease.</p>
<p>In contrast, a standardized Communication Protocol ensures that data is shared in a manner that ensures security, and enables privacy and technical interoperability.&nbsp; Technical interoperability is a key element to achieve scale in the development and implementation of an Open Banking ecosystem – in particular to ensure that small or new market entrants wishing to receive data are able to easily participate.&nbsp; As mentioned in our original letter, the OpenID Foundation global community has developed a Communication Protocol that has become a de-facto industry standard for API ecosystems in general, and Open Banking / Open Data ecosystems in particular: FAPI – a profile of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.</p>
<p>The FAPI profile has been selected by multiple leading private and public Open Banking ecosystems. The FAPI profile is a security and interoperability enhanced version of OAuth 2.0 which closes critical security gaps that OAuth 2.0 alone does not address. Current global ecosystem adoption of FAPI include:&nbsp;</p>

<p>US FDX&nbsp;</p>


<p>Recommended</p>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;



<p>Beyond the 12 countries above and their milestones, we are seeing tangible growth:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Billions of successful FAPI API calls, with secure, interoperable and consent-based movement of user data or payments&nbsp; 
 2,800 FAPI implementations certified globally (<a href="https://openid.net/certification/">https://openid.net/certification/</a>) 
 44 million active users in Brazil (20% of the population) 
 6.5 million active users in the UK (15% of the UK population) 
 
<p>Given the critical role FAPI is playing in the US and abroad, hope is that the CFPB will explicitly add a requirement for a Communication Protocol and that the OIDF’s FAPI profile will in due course be selected as a QIS to fulfil the proposed requirement for a Communication Protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the rulemaking docket and other discussions, we understand that the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) intends to apply to be a standard setting body (SSB) under proposed §1033.141, and that they would meet the requirements for the Data Format. Were FDX to be designated an SSB, it could select the FAPI profile as a QIS for the Communication Protocol to complete their market offering and help offer a scalable and interoperable solution – this would be the preferred outcome for the OIDF.&nbsp; Alternatively, if FDX were to choose not to specify a Communication Protocol that delivers interoperability and security to the level required for a financial services ecosystem, the OIDF would consider applying to be an SSB so that the FAPI profile could be used as a QIS for the Communication Protocol enabling US ecosystems conform to this critical requirement.</p>
<p>We would also like to make very clear the nature of the risks that arise should the CFPB not modify the requirements to explicitly require a Communications Protocol. These risks are broken down into four categories.</p>
 US Ecosystem Interoperability Risks: 
 
 There will be a diverse set of Communication Protocol variants delivered by data providers as no consistent standard is required. As a result there will be significantly greater complexity for authorized third parties to deal with when integrating with the developer interfaces delivered by the in scope data providers. This results in an increased cost burden on the authorized third parties, and they will be unlikely to all implement to all available interfaces.. 
 This increased cost burden is likely to reduce the likelihood of organisations choosing to become authorized third parties at all, reducing competition and choice for consumers. 
 If authorised third parties cannot easily implement to all data providers, they will build first to the interfaces of the largest data holders. This means consumers with smaller data holders will have reduced choice and services from authorized third party services. 
 The overall result is that the US would end up with one of the world’s worst and most inconsistent user experiences amongst all the current global deployments of Open Banking and Open Data deployed to date. 
 
 Time to Market Risks: 
 
 While it is clear that the CFPB is extremely keen to have an Open Banking ecosystem established in the US market there is a difference between banks having delivered compliant developer interfaces, and authorized third parties and consumers adopting Open Banking. If there is not a defined Communication Protocol market adoption will be slow. A Communication Protocol makes it easier for authorized third parties to deploy by reducing cost and complexity of developing and delivering new product offerings for consumers, and in turn their time to market to deploy and scale. &nbsp; This enhances the ability of the ecosystem to offer fair access to financial services, and treat customers fairly.&nbsp; 
 While adding a Communication Protocol requirement to the rule may seem to make it harder for data providers to deliver compliance on a timely basis, it actually makes it easier because it reduces the optionality available to implementers. In addition, FAPI conformance tests are freely available to implementors to use, software is deployed at scale in other markets, and many service organisations have deployment experience. By leveraging these capabilities, Saudi Arabia deployed FAPI across their ecosystem in less than 12 months, and UAE is likely to launch in less than 12 months later this year.&nbsp; 
 
 US Ecosystem Security Risks: 
 
 It is very likely that many US data providers will take the lowest cost approach to compliance with the regulation (as has been seen in other previous contexts) contributing to undesirable diversity in US implementations. 
 These implementations are unlikely to have all been subject to thorough security assessment, and real “battle testing” that a standardized Communication Protocol like the FAPI security profile has had.&nbsp; This means implementations will not be consistently secure by default. 
 Implementations that have not deployed and certified to the highest security profiles are at risk of being the “weakest links” amongst not just US but global Open Banking and Open Data deployments. That will make the US and these specific implementations attractive to sophisticated attackers, putting US consumers at higher risk. 
 These concerns introduce safety and soundness concerns to Open Banking participants and consumers. 
 
 International Interoperability Risks: 
 
 The diversity of implementations will set-back the US market in its ability to interoperate with other Open Banking implementations around the world. The majority of global ecosystems to date have selected FAPI, explicitly naming it in their regulations, and requiring certification to FAPI.&nbsp; 
 If the US does not choose a Communication Protocol that facilitates global interoperability by default, only the largest entities will have the compliance and technology resources to conduct cross border Open Banking transactions. Small and medium sizes data holders and third party service providers will not have the resources to enable global interoperability at all, or they will be forced to pay premiums to intermediaries that facilitate cross border services. Ultimately this impedes the ability to provide fair access to financial services, and treat customers fairly in the global marketplace.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Presuming that the mission of the CFPB is to protect the interests of American consumers,&nbsp;we strongly encourage the CFPB to reconsider the details and conformance criteria related to QIS, and to consult with NIST on benefits of defining a Communication Protocol as we advise. We also encourage the CFPB to move with speed so that the first data holders (those obliged to be compliant in spring 2025) must update their systems to global standards for a Communications Protocol, like FAPI. If the changes are not put into effect now, it will become materially more difficult to course correct later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also understand from your comments at the recent FDX conference that you are concerned about the governance model of standards bodies and certification providers. The OIDF believes our governance model will meet the CFPB requirements, and if necessary, we would work in good faith to close any gaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that this letter will be submitted into the public docket for further consideration and would welcome meeting with you or your staff to discuss our recommendation in further detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elastos is teaming up with Conflux, known as the “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/24/chinese-ethereum-conflux-draws-spotlight-as-hong-kong-welcomes-retail-traders/">Chinese Ethereum</a>,” to simplify blockchain interactions globally. This partnership aims to make Bitcoin transactions and exchanges smoother using Conflux’s strong <a href="https://confluxnetwork.org/">infrastructure</a> and Elastos’ advanced <a href="http://Bel2.org">BeL2 technology</a>.</p>
<p>Conflux is special because it’s the only regulatory-compliant, public, and permissionless blockchain in China. This opens up big opportunities, especially in Asia. Conflux processes transactions quickly and securely, supports asset transfers between different blockchains, and can handle a lot of transactions at once without any slowdowns. It also has a built-in system for staking, which rewards users, and a unique fee structure that makes it easy for new users to join. The whole system runs on the CFX token, which is central to its economy.</p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Asian Markets and the launch of Hong Kong’s First HKD-Backed Stablecoin 
<p>Conflux is perfectly positioned to open up blockchain adoption in Asia. By complying with Chinese regulations, it can facilitate blockchain growth in this highly potential region. Conflux has partnered with fintech company AnchorX to launch Hong Kong’s <a href="https://coingape.com/conflux-network-announces-first-hong-kong-dollar-backed-stablecoin/">first Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin</a>, called axHKD. This stablecoin integrates traditional finance with blockchain, making cross-border transactions and virtual asset trading easier and more efficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Power of BeL2 
<p>BeL2 technology enables Bitcoin to interact with smart contracts on other blockchains, expanding its use. It allows developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) using Bitcoin’s security and liquidity. BeL2 focuses on making cross-chain interactions and smart contract integrations smoother, enhancing Bitcoin’s capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 New Financial Opportunities 
<p>With the launch of the axHKD stablecoin, new financial opportunities arise. Bitcoin holders will be able to use BeL2 to take out loans in stablecoins, using their BTC as collateral, but without bridging it like traditional wrapped alternatives. This introduces Bitcoin maximalists to traditional finance without selling assets, while allowing lenders to work with Bitcoin holders to offer secure finance services and earn interest. To learn more about BeL2’s loan DApp, <a href="https://elastos.info/news/bel2-loan-app-bitcoin-finance/">read here.</a> To watch a demo video, <a href="https://ela.city/cinema/view/0x9057304a41919008d79b3bb3fcebd69414e38b1f/98">check out at Elacity!</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How We Collaborate 
 
 Enhanced Transactions: BeL2 allows Conflux users to perform Bitcoin transactions securely and efficiently. 
 Cross-Chain Exchanges: BeL2 enables seamless exchanges between Bitcoin and other assets. 
 Smart Contract Integration: BeL2 facilitates new DeFi applications by integrating Bitcoin with smart contracts. 
 Loan App: Bitcoin holders can use their BTC as collateral for loans in stablecoins like axHKD, bridging traditional and digital finance. 
 
 
 Making the SmartWeb a Reality 
<p>Combining Conflux’s infrastructure with BeL2’s capabilities paves the way for the SmartWeb, a decentralized internet enhancing security, privacy, and control over digital assets.

<p>【ニューヨーク=川上梓】ホンダや日産自動車、米フォード・モーターなど日米企業120社で構成する企業連合が、電気自動車（EV）電池に関するデータの活用で欧州発の企業連合と連携する。電池の材料やリサイクルにつながる情報を相互に安全に共有・運用できるインフラを企業主体でつくり、EVの普及につなげる。</p>
<p>ホンダや日産、米自動車大手「ビッグ3」、IT（情報技術）企業など120社でEV電池の情報をデジタル上で管理する国際規格づくりを進めている「モビリティ・オープン・ブロックチェーン・イニシアチブ（MOBI）」が、欧州発の企業連合「GAIA-X（ガイアエックス）」と組む。</p>
<p>ガイアエックスは欧州で企業間のデータ連携を推進している。日米中心の企業連合のMOBIと、欧州のガイアエックスが組むことで、日本、米国、欧州の3地域の企業間で、電池の材料や劣化状態、充放電などの情報を相互に共有し、運用できるようにする。</p>
<p>具体的には、暗号技術を使って機密性を保ったうえで企業がデータを記録・管理できる「ブロックチェーン（分散型台帳）」の技術を使う。今後、両者で実証を始める。</p>
<p>相互運用が進めば、企業は利用できるデータの数や範囲が増え、サービスの低コスト化につながる。電池の劣化状態が見える化されれば、将来的に電池の残存価値をEVの中古車価格に反映できるようになる。利用者にとっては1つのアプリケーションから利用できるEVや充電インフラの種類が広がり、EVを利用しやすくなる。</p>
<p>電池の情報を巡っては、日本の経済産業省傘下の団体と欧州の官民データ基盤「カテナX」が連携を決めた。ガイアエックスはカテナXの上部組織にあたり、製品に使う素材や二酸化炭素排出量などのデータを企業間でやりとりする仕組みをつくっている。</p>
<p>電池の情報を管理・共有する仕組みは欧州で先行してきたが、米国企業も導入を検討している。22年に成立したインフレ抑制法でEV補助金を受けるため北米域内で電池材料や部材を調達することが条件になったためだ。</p>
<p>特に電池の材料であるレアメタル（希少金属）は中国への依存度が大きい。米国企業としては、日欧企業と連携することで電池の材料調達に関する情報を透明化したい狙いもある。</p>

The Value of an Identifier Metasystem; Is eIDAS wrong?"</p> What is an Identifier Metasystem? <p>An identifier metasystem intermediates different digital identity systems and mechanisms, promoting interoperability and preventing conflicts. It provides a layer of abstraction above individual identifier systems, enabling them to work together seamlessly.</p><p>Starting with identifiers and identifier systems, examples you may be familiar with include:</p>  National identification systems (e.g., Social Security Numbers, National ID cards)  Domain Name System (DNS) for internet addresses  International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) for books  Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) for software systems  <p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are also identifiers that can further act as an identifier metasystem. The DID spec defines a common structure and syntax for identifiers, along with methods for resolving them to retrieve associated metadata (such as public keys and service endpoints). This allows different DID methods, each with their own specific implementation details, to be used interchangeably within a single system.</p> The Difference Between General Identifiers and DIDs <p>In general, identifiers – often stored in organization or application databases – lack context, making it difficult to determine their scope and uniqueness. In contrast, DIDs are globally unique identifiers that provide clear context. This difference is akin to the distinction between a web page describing content at another page and a hyperlink – with the latter, you are guaranteed to reach the source and obtain the latest information.</p><p>At an IT systems level, the lack of context and uniqueness in general identifiers can cause headaches for companies when merging or migrating systems, as conflicts may arise.</p> Key Benefits of the Identifier Metasystem <p>The identifier metasystem provided by DIDs offers several key benefits:</p>  Interoperability: Different systems using different DID methods can still interact and exchange data without conflicts or the need for extensive customization.  Flexibility: Organizations can choose the DID method that best suits their needs and constraints, while still maintaining compatibility with other systems.&nbsp;  Future-proofing: As new DID methods are developed, they can be easily integrated into existing systems without requiring major changes to the underlying infrastructure.  Normalized and Auditable Data Storage: DIDs enable organizations and applications to store identifiers in a normalized and auditable manner, facilitating easier rotation and updates to identity systems without substantial overhauls.  Enhanced Privacy: DIDs offer a way to bind credentials privately and securely, proving that certain credentials were indeed issued to a specific user without compromising privacy.   Addressing Common Misconceptions <p>Some common hurdles to adopting DIDs result from the following misconceptions:</p>  Belief that you have to support all DID methods: There are numerous DID methods, but implementers can choose which method(s) to support based on their requirements and restrictions.  Uncertainty around which DID method(s) to use and support: Implementers often hesitate because they're unsure which DID method to choose. The straightforward advice is to pick one that's appropriate to your use case, which aids in future-proofing and simplifies integration across diverse systems.  Belief that there are simpler ways to achieve the same results: The benefits of DIDs as an identifier metasystem can be overlooked due to the technical details of DIDs themselves. However, focusing on the benefits of the identifier metasystem provides clearer business value and future-proofing.  <p>Another potential concern around use of DIDs is the lack of an advanced standard (“W3C Recommendation” status or similar) for DID resolution and dereferencing. This is addressed as part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/04/did-wg-charter.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DID WG Charter update, effective 25 April 2024</a>, in which the DID Working Group will take over the DID resolution work currently underway at the W3C Credentials Community Group.</p> DIDs as Future-proofed Variants of Existing Tokens or Identifiers <p>Even if a system is currently required to use JSON Web Keys (JWKs), adopting the `did:jwk` method could serve as a bridge, allowing easier rotation and updates to identity systems without substantial overhauls. This approach enables organizations to store identifiers in a normalized and auditable manner while ensuring compatibility and avoiding potential conflicts in the future.</p> The European Union (EU) Perspective <p>Privacy Concerns</p><p>Some pushback towards DIDs has resulted from the perception that they can contribute to privacy violations and tracking. In some frameworks, this has led to the rejection of DIDs.&nbsp; However, employing DIDs is not inherently riskier than corresponding mechanisms; for example did:jwk offers the same privacy characteristics as JWK. And in the general case, DIDs have the potential to offer significantly improved privacy protection (see point 5 under Key Benefits of the Identifier Metasystem, above). </p><p>Regulatory Challenges and Recommendations</p><p>Regulatory recommendations around traditional identifiers like X.509 certificates are well-established, and moving away from them may not be an option. However, even in this environment, `did:x509` could be used to adhere to the existing requirements while future-proofing through the identifier metasystem and improving the ability to migrate in the future.</p> Implementing DIDs: Decisions Across an Organization <p>The benefits of DIDs as an identifier metasystem sometimes get lost due to the technical details of DIDs themselves. However, focusing on the benefits of the identifier metasystem provides clearer business value and future-proofing.</p>  System architects should view the adoption of DIDs as a strategic decision that aligns with long-term business goals, focusing on the overarching benefits of DIDs.  Product managers need to determine requirements, restrictions, and other characteristics relevant for the use case's regulatory requirements (e.g., inability to use blockchain) or user requirements.  Architects and developers should select the appropriate DID method(s) based on the above requirements, as well as any other operational considerations (tool support).  <p>The choice of DID method is also influenced by the role of participants. For institutions, the `did:x509` or `did:web` method can be preferred, while for individuals, the `did:jwk` method may be more appropriate, allowing for a cycle through various credentials while maintaining privacy and future-proofing.</p><p>Implementers should focus on building technical systems that support DIDs regardless of the environment, ensuring that the broad range of considerations is addressed, such as open standards/source, possible cost to users, whether other elements support DIDs, and whether DIDs are simply stored or if the ecosystem has first-class support for them.</p> Potential Risks and Concerns <p>While DIDs offer significant benefits as an identifier metasystem, there are potential risks and concerns to consider:</p>  Incentive for Migration: While DIDs make sense as a consideration when designing new systems, there may not be enough incentive for organizations to rewrite or migrate existing systems to adopt DIDs, given the potential costs and effort involved.  Control and Governance of DID Methods: There are questions around who gets to determine the "method" part of a DID (e.g., `did:method`), how to ensure there are no collisions or name squatting, and who gets to control and govern the various DID methods.  <p>Organizations should carefully evaluate these risks and concerns alongside the potential benefits of DIDs as an identifier metasystem when making decisions about adoption and implementation.</p><p>While the concerns around migration incentives and control of DID methods are valid, they should not overshadow the significant advantages DIDs offer in terms of interoperability, flexibility, future-proofing, and enhanced privacy.</p><p>To mitigate these risks, organizations can:</p>  Conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis to determine the long-term value of adopting DIDs, considering factors such as reduced integration complexity, improved data normalization, and enhanced privacy capabilities.  Engage with the DID community and participate in the governance processes of relevant DID methods to ensure that their concerns and requirements are addressed.  Develop a phased adoption plan that prioritizes the implementation of DIDs in new systems and gradually migrates existing systems over time, minimizing disruption and spreading out the costs.  Collaborate with industry partners, standards bodies, and regulatory authorities to establish best practices and guidelines for DID adoption and governance, promoting a more stable and predictable ecosystem.  <p>By proactively addressing these risks and concerns, organizations can confidently adopt DIDs as an identifier metasystem, leveraging its benefits to build more resilient, interoperable, and future-proof identity solutions that enhance privacy, simplify integration, and provide a solid foundation for the evolving digital identity landscape.</p> Conclusion <p>As the digital identity landscape continues to evolve, DIDs are well-positioned to play a crucial role in shaping a more connected, secure, and user-centric future. Organizations that recognize the value of an identifier metasystem and embrace DIDs will be at the forefront of building a more resilient and innovative digital identity ecosystem.</p> Thank you <p>We would like to thank Sam Curren for leading this session and all IIW attendees who contributed. Thank you to Damian Glover, Andor Kesselman, and Markus Sabadello for their valuable input to this article.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is thrilled to welcome Mastercard to the Board of Directors as a <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/sponsoring-members/">Sustaining Member</a>. Since joining in 2022 as a Corporate Member, Mastercard has been involved in several OIDF Work Groups. The Foundation welcomes Mastercard as a global technology leader in the payments industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Mastercard have long been leaders in the Identity space and benefit from years of experience building rails that power global payments and collaborating on solutions to address the challenges we now face our industry,” said OIDF’s Executive Director, Gail Hodges. “We are delighted that they have furthered their commitment to the important work of the Foundation during such a transformative time.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adam Sommer, VP of Security Standards, will serve as Mastercard’s primary representative on the OIDF board with Mark Andrus, Director, Industry, Policy &amp; Standards Engagement, serving as Adam’s alternate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Increasingly, governments around the world are positioning Digital Identity and Financial-grade Security at the center of their strategies to grow secure, digital economies.&nbsp; The Foundation is looking forward to many years of continued partnership with Mastercard as we work to build interoperable standards that meet the moment and secure our digital future.&nbsp;</p>
 About the OpenID Foundation 
 The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate.

<p>First public review for v1.4 - ends June 12th</p> 


<p>We are pleased to announce that Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) Version 1.4 from the OASIS OpenDocument TC [1] is now available for public review and comment. This is the first public review for OpenDocument v1.4.</p>



<p>The OpenDocument Format (ODF) is an open XML-based document file format for office applications to be used for documents containing text, spreadsheets, charts, and graphical elements. The file format makes transformations to other formats simple by leveraging and reusing existing standards wherever possible. As an open standard under the stewardship of OASIS, OpenDocument also creates the possibility for new types of applications and solutions to be developed other than traditional office productivity applications.</p>



<p>OpenDocument Format v1.4 joins ODF v1.3 (approved as OASIS Standard in 2021) in providing updates to the international standard ODF v1.2, approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO/IEC 26300 (2015). OpenDocument Format v1.4 makes several timely improvements.</p>



<p>The documents and related files are available here:</p>

<p>With the support of our members, OASIS Open’s initiatives have the potential to help address some of the challenges faced in global trade and logistics, enabling greater interoperability, transparency and efficiency in the supply chain. On a parallel path to de-risking our supply chains, open standards can help to address some of these challenges.</p>



<p>Open standards can facilitate data sharing between different systems and stakeholders, helping to improve supply chain visibility and reduce data silos. This can help to improve efficiency and reduce delays in the supply chain.</p>



<p>Electronic data interchange (EDI) is a standardized electronic format for exchanging business documents. Open standards for EDI can help to improve the accuracy and timeliness of data exchange, reducing errors and delays in the supply chain.</p>



<p>Open standards for blockchain can enable secure and transparent sharing of data between different stakeholders in the supply chain. This can help to improve trust and reduce fraud in international trade.</p>



<p>Open standards for IoT can help to improve supply chain visibility by enabling real-time tracking of goods and assets. This can help to improve efficiency and reduce delays in the supply chain.</p>



<p>Open standards for electronic customs clearance can help to streamline the customs process and reduce delays in the supply chain. This can help to improve efficiency and reduce costs for businesses involved in global trade.</p>



<p>OASIS members are currently forming the Open Supply Chain Information Modeling (OSIM) Technical Committee, which aims to standardize and promote information models for supply chains. Read the latest blog on OSIM <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2024/05/02/introducing-oasis-open-supply-chain-information-modeling/">here</a> and consider <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/join-a-tc/">joining the TC</a> before its first meeting on 4 June.</p>

<p>By Markus Sabadello</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to write a few words about the&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a>&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>, which is a group where I have been contributing as co-chair for many years.</p> The fundamental role of the DIF I&amp;D WG <p>DIF was established in 2017, and has grown a lot in terms of members, working groups, and work items. The I&amp;D Working Group is one of the working groups that has existed since the beginning DIF, unlike many others which were added later. The reason for that, I would argue, is the fact that the concepts of “identifiers” and “discovery” are fundamental to pretty much any digital identity system.</p><p>In digital identity, we always need identifiers — digital addresses that we can use to refer to individuals, organizations, and things. Without identifiers for participants of a network, and without the ability to discover metadata about such identifiers, we cannot express connections or relationships, we cannot share data or exchange messages, and without that, we cannot establish higher level concepts such as reputation and trust. Another factor for establishing this working group was the (back then) new technology that became Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and would later be standardized at the W3C. So in the early days of DIF, it was logical to dedicate one of the initial working groups to the topic of identifiers.</p> The scope of the DIF I&amp;D WG <p>The scope of this working group is defined in its&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_ID_WG_charter_v1.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Charter</a>. It includes pretty much any topic related to the specification and implementation of decentralized identifiers (including, but not limited to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">W3C DIDs</a>). For example, topics include the creation and resolution of DIDs, discovery data formats and protocols, relationships between different identifer systems (e.g. DIDs and domain names), the establishment of control authority over an identifier, security and trust in identifier infrastructure, and the work on concrete&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#methods">DID methods</a>.</p><p>Explicitly out-of-scope are complex higher-level topics and protocols that use identifiers but are not primarily about the identifier infrastructure themselves, for example authentication or credential exchange protocols. For those topics, there are other exciting DIF&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#wgs">working groups</a>!</p> Noteworthy work items of the DIF I&amp;D WG <p>The working group maintains a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#work-items">list of work items</a>&nbsp;it has worked on in the past or is currently working on. In general, work items may be specifications or code or anything else that falls withing the working group’s scope. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of our work items:</p>  The&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Universal Resolver</a>&nbsp;is one of the best-known work items that has existed since the beginnings of DIF. It provides resolution capabilities for many DID methods developed by the decentralized identity community.  The&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">.well-known DID Configuration</a>&nbsp;specification provides a way of linking a DID to a web origin.  The&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/did-registration/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DID Registration</a>&nbsp;specification defines functions for creating, updating, and deactivating DIDs in an interoperable way.  The&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/linked-vp/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Linked Verifiable Presentation</a>&nbsp;specification defines how to discover Verifiable Presentations using simple DID Resolution, without requiring more complex protocols such OpenID or DIDComm.  Work items also include various open-source tools and libraries, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did-resolver</a>&nbsp;(JavaScript),&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-jwt?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did-jwt</a>&nbsp;(JavaScript),&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-common-java?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did-common-java</a>&nbsp;(Java),&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-key.rs?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did-key.rs</a>&nbsp;(Rust).  Concrete DID methods&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/index.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did:peer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did:ion</a>&nbsp;have also been developed in this working group.   Interesting topics in the DIF I&amp;D WG <p>Besides “formal” work items such as the ones listed above, our working group also frequently discusses various topics related to decentralized identifiers, or receives guest presentations. In the past, such topics have for example included:</p>  Presentations about new DID methods, e.g. did:dht, did:oyd, did:self, did:webs, did:key, did:bid, did:plc, did:algo, did:polygonid, did:cheqd, and others.  Management of DIDs over time, rotating keys, referencing historical versions of DIDs.  Trust in DIDs and the DID Resolution process, DID document validation, and the relationship between DIDs and existing trusted infrastructures such as domain names or X.509 certificates.  Proposals for new functionalities related to DIDs, such as Linked Resources, service profiles, DID method enumeration, and much more.  <p>We have recently also seen demonstrations of browser plugins, and even a ChatGPT plugin that can resolve DIDs! And we are always happy to receive suggestions for new topics.</p> How to participate in the DIF I&amp;D WG <p>Easy!&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/join/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Join DIF</a>&nbsp;and participate in our working group. We have a Slack channel and bi-weekly meetings where we can discuss any topic related to decentralized identifiers and discovery!</p><p>Our working group page is&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/tree/main?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here</a>, and our agenda including recordings and notes is&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/blob/main/agenda.md?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here</a>.</p><p>We welcome you!</p><p>The activities of the author in the DIF I&amp;D WG are carried out with the support of&nbsp;<a href="https://blockstand.eu/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">BlockStand</a>&nbsp;funds. BlockStand aims to create an online blockchain community that shall engage in continuous collaboration and exchange of ideas to bolster the European Union’s leadership in the field.</p>

<p>Join the Decentralized Identity Foundation community call on 27 May at 09:00 PDT / 12:00 EDT /&nbsp; 18:00 CEST to learn how organizations can leverage&nbsp;the combined capabilities of OpenID4VC and DIDComm through an emerging specification under development at IDunion, opening the door to a myriad of new possibilities in identity-centric applications and services. Moderated by Sam Curren. Register <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZwvf--hrT0tE9D9j2U8BkxzVn8Ogs_iftas?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here</a></p><p>In the ever-evolving landscape of digital identity and communication protocols, OpenID4VC protocols working in parallel with DIDComm represents a significant opportunity for businesses to bolster security, enhance privacy, and streamline operations. By combining a familiar authentication and access pattern with VCs and augmenting it with secure generalized communication, developers can unlock new functionalities for digital identity while ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks such as the Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services (eIDAS) 2.0 regulation in the European Union.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://openid.net/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">OpenID</a>, renowned for its simplicity and widespread adoption, provides businesses with a standardized framework for user authentication across multiple applications and websites. The OpenID4VCI and OpenID4VP protocols (collectively referred to as OID4VC) follow the familiar pattern and apply it to the exchange of Verifiable Credentials. These verifiable credential protocols were selected by the eIDAS 2.0 effort in Europe as the protocols for VC exchange.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm</a>, built on the principles of self-sovereign identity (SSI), picks up those trusted connections and offers a decentralized and privacy-enhancing protocol for secure communication. DIDComm makes communication between entities using DIDs safe and simple, and easy to use, providing a way to create secure and streamlined communication solutions. DIDComm can accommodate protocols for nearly any purpose, while retaining its properties of privacy and security. Learn more about DIDComm <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/ss/">here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://idunion.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">IDunion</a>'s goal is to create an open, global ecosystem for decentralized identity, aligned with European values and regulations. IDunion is leading this important effort to define protocol extensions to allow OpenID and DIDComm interoperability.</p><p>Running side by side, OpenID4VC and DIDComm hold the promise of revolutionizing digital identity management and communication. By incorporating a familiar pattern for the exchange of verifiable credentials alongside a secure communication channel with capabilities that extend beyond verifiable credentials, businesses can benefit from enhanced security and trustworthiness of digital identities while maximizing their benefits.</p><p>This pairing of open protocols also enables businesses to address regulatory requirements more effectively, particularly in the European Union where the eIDAS 2.0 regulation sets the standards for electronic identification and trust services. Businesses operating within the European Union can leverage OpenID4VC protocols for credential issuance and presentation to satisfy the requirements of eIDAS 2.0, while utilizing DIDComm to securely communicate and coordinate with parties for features beyond the scope of the OID4VC protocols. By adopting a decentralized approach to identity and communication, businesses can ensure compliance with eIDAS 2.0 while safeguarding sensitive information and building trust with their customers and stakeholders and growing their services and business opportunities.</p><p>The integration of OpenID VC Protocols and DIDComm opens the door to a myriad of new possibilities in identity-centric applications and services. By leveraging the combined capabilities of these protocols, businesses can easily realize the benefits of verifiable credentials built on direct communication between trusted connections.</p><p></p>

 Exploring the Evolution of Trust in Networks Over the Next&nbsp;Decade <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/towards-a-manifesto-for-open-recognition-07b2606efd81">Previously</a>, we discussed working towards a manifesto for <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>, an initiative which involves envisioning what we might call ‘plausible utopias’. This is work for and on behalf of the Open Recognition is for Everybody (ORE) Community, which is stewarded by <a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> and sponsored by <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a>.</p>Image CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>In this post, we explore these plausible utopias over five-year and ten-year time horizons, bearing in mind the balance between institutional credentials and community-based recognition. It’s not a case of either/or but both-and. We need credentials from institutions to prove everything from our identity to our ability to perform at a high level. But we also need a way of giving and receiving recognition in ways that go beyond credentials. In short, we want to create a world that eliminates unfair hoops and hurdles that go along with systemic injustices and institutional bias. But read on for more specifics.</p> What is Open Recognition? <p>A quick reminder of what we mean by Open Recognition, from <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">this&nbsp;post</a>:</p><blockquote>Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.</blockquote> Open Recognition by 2029: A Five-Year Outlook Image CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>Considering the significant interest and investment in skills-based hiring, it is likely to fully develop within the next five years. The progress of this trend is likely to be unevenly distributed; the USA, where the bulk of the funding is available, will no doubt lead the&nbsp;way.</p><p>Skills-based hiring is an approach to recruitment that prioritises a candidate’s skills and competencies over traditional credentials. This includes the actual abilities required to perform a job well, and is a combination of technical skills, ‘durable’ (aka ‘soft’) skills, and the ability to problem-solve. The idea is that it widens the talent pool, reduces bias inherent in the hiring process, and aligns candidates more closely with the needs of the&nbsp;job.</p> Going Beyond&nbsp;Work <p>While it can be useful to put people into categories and to match them to jobs, there is more to life than work. So while skills-based hiring is an important step into a plausible utopia for Open Recognition, let’s paint a broader and more holistic&nbsp;picture.</p><p>The definition of Open Recognition used above includes “recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions.” We envisage a continuing focus on the right of self-determination of all people, including within online and offline networks. We also see a world in which peer recognition is valuable and honoured in hiring and acceptance processes. This means, where appropriate, badges for everything from knowledge within indigenous communities to recognition for the determined and resilient person who shows up for others, no matter&nbsp;what.</p><p>CVs and resumes will start to be replaced by digital portfolios which can be shown via mobile devices and shared with others via web links. Whereas CVs and resumes are claim-based, in that the person they represent claims to know or have done a thing, badges are evidence-based, as they provide evidence that the person can do something — or stands in a particular relationship to another individual or organisation. In addition, digital portfolios will begin to hold <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">Verifiable Credentials</a>, both those issued by governments or higher learning institutions, as well as VCs issued in communities and by&nbsp;peers.</p><p>Community learning is particularly well-placed to provide the recognition of talents which are so valuable in all aspects of society. People who participate in communities of practice develop all sorts of skills that often go unrecognised. For example, facilitation skills are useful not only in the world of work, but also in the contexts of family life, sports, and activism. Being able to quickly see what experience and abilities you have within a group of people can be particularly useful, especially in times of&nbsp;need.</p> Open Recognition in 2034: A Ten-Year&nbsp;Vision Image CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>The next decade could see significant shifts in how we approach education and professional development. There has long been talk about the ‘disruption’ of formal education systems which are (mistakenly) labelled as being fit only for the Industrial Revolution. While teachers do a great job in difficult circumstances, when looking a decade into the future, we can begin to imagine a world where educational journeys are bespoke, mapped out through different forms of recognition.</p><p>Some of this recognition may be through formal institutional credentials, gained as a result of summative assessment. In other words, you are still likely to get credentials for passing exams, but these will increasingly be&nbsp;digital.</p> Innovations in Recognition <p>But there are more ways to prove that you know or can do a thing than through high-stakes examinations. One of our favourite ways of using badges for Open Recognition includes pledging for a badge and then working towards it. Another is self-issuing badges for skills you have taught yourself, and then asking others to endorse those badges. Other approaches include mentorship, participation in community events, and interest-based badges — for example with creative pursuits.</p><p>We expect some strides to be made towards the automation of what is often called APL (Assessing Prior Learning) or RPL (Recognition of Prior Learning). While it will still be useful to keep a human in the loop, AI technology is advancing to help us use Rich Skills Descriptors (RSDs) to help with misunderstandings around semantics.</p><p>Take volunteering, something which is sadly on the decline in the western world. There are many different ways to donate your skills to groups or organisations that need help. With a little help from technology, it will be normal to be matched with opportunities based on the recognition you have received in the form of&nbsp;badges.</p><p>In ten years time, the digital portfolios of credentials, badges and other pieces of recognition will be commonplace. They will be built on top of open technology, like open source wallets, and using W3C standards. The best way to ensure that the ecosystem around Open Recognition flourishes in the future is to build it in the&nbsp;open.</p> Trusting Recognition Image CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>Both the short term and long term vision described here relies on the evolution of trust within our networks. Luckily, for over a decade, technologists have been working on standards and methods to help people verify their skills through both claims and evidence. Hundreds of millions of digital credentials based on standards-compliant technologies are issued every year. We are no longer working on <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/advocating-for-learner-centric-badge-systems-21a65be4a725">spreading awareness</a> of what digital credentialing is or could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>Years ago, we needed to get people to accept the idea of digital credentials as a plausible alternative to physical credentials. What we need now is an ecosystem that places value not only on the reputation of the issuer, but the story the earner wants to tell about themselves. Because this ecosystem is built on open standards and increasingly on top of open technologies, we are building trust into digital credentialing writ&nbsp;large.</p> Conclusion <p>None of this vision is free, cheap or easy. In fact, it’s taken over a decade and millions invested into wide reaching projects and problem spaces. When you’re building an alternative to a system that was built before the invention of the World Wide Web, it can take some time to convince people that a different way is possible. Open Badges, Verifiable Credentials and the people who build and make the projects and ecosystem around these technologies need support to continue advancing a system that is designed to level the playing field for everyday learners and&nbsp;earners.</p><p>If you’re looking to enhance your professional development programme or educational initiative through Open Recognition, get in touch with <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> — we’re here to&nbsp;help!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Plausible Utopias: the future of Open Recognition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 “FIDO Drives Strong&nbsp;&nbsp;Authentication Results&nbsp;&nbsp;for the State of Michigan’s&nbsp;&nbsp;MiLogin” 



<p>The State of Michigan’s Department of Technology, Management &amp;&nbsp; Budget (DTMB) is a principal department of the state’s government&nbsp; responsible for providing a wide range of support functions to other state&nbsp; agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The department’s broad spectrum of responsibilities includes technology&nbsp; services, labor market information, facilities management, financial&nbsp; services, procurement, retirement services, real estate management, the&nbsp; Michigan public safety communication system, fleet and records&nbsp; management, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DTMB also plays a crucial role in cybersecurity for the state,&nbsp; providing resources and tools to protect against cyber threats and&nbsp; manage the State’s IT infrastructure. One of the DTMB’s efforts is the&nbsp; MiLogin digital identity solution, which enables over 10 million users to&nbsp; access state government services securely and conveniently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DTMB was looking to secure MiLogin, Michigan’s application that allows&nbsp; users to access multiple state applications and services with a single user&nbsp; ID, with strong authentication that improves user experience and decided&nbsp; to go with passkeys, based on FIDO authentication.&nbsp;</p>



 Passkeys are a password replacement that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices. Unlike passwords, passkeys are resistant to phishing, are always strong, and are designed so that there are no shared secrets. 



 Key Objectives&nbsp; 



<p>The State of Michigan aimed to address several key objectives with the integration of passkeys:</p>



<p>Enhance the digital user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal was to streamline the digital user experience, particularly in providing users with seamless access to critical state&nbsp; government services. DTMB aimed to simplify the login process, making it more user-friendly and efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reduce help desk support dependency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing the strain on help desk resources due to login access issues, DTMB sought to reduce users’ need to access help desk support. By implementing changes to enhance the login process, the goal was to empower users to navigate.</p>



<p>Fortify security resilience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no shortage of risk and vulnerabilities associated with traditional username and password authentication. A key&nbsp; objective was to fortify the system against security threats and phishing incidents, by adopting advanced FIDO strong&nbsp; authentication to mitigate the risks commonly exploited by bad actors seeking unauthorized access.</p>



 The Importance of Open Standards and Interoperability&nbsp; 



<p>Before deciding to implement passkeys, the DTMB explored a proprietary passwordless login solution offered by a cloud based identity-as-a-solution (IDaaS) provider. However, the solution lacked the interoperability required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DTMB determined early on in its process that open standard and interoperability were critical and required&nbsp; components of its strong authentication strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A standards-based approach provides interoperability across popular device types and web browsers, maintains vendor&nbsp; neutrality, allows for cost savings through community adoption, and a pathway to adopt future innovations in the FIDO&nbsp; ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 The Solution: FIDO Drives Results&nbsp; 



<p>Passkeys checked all the boxes for the DTMB, utilizing open standards and an interoperable approach for authentication.</p>



<p>The DTMB found that passkeys provide the following advantages:</p>



 
 Passkeys are based on open standards, ensuring interoperability without&nbsp;&nbsp;necessitating additional software for users to download.&nbsp; 



 Multiple vendor support for FIDO standards and the tech’s rapid&nbsp;&nbsp;adoption promotes the long-term continuity of FIDO authentication as a&nbsp;&nbsp;service.&nbsp; 



 FIDO standards accommodate various authenticator types (such as&nbsp;&nbsp;biometric sensors, hardware keys, etc.) across desktop and mobile&nbsp;&nbsp;devices, catering to the DTMB’s user base’s diverse authentication&nbsp;&nbsp;requirements.&nbsp; 



 Prioritizing user and ecosystem partner security, passkeys provide strong&nbsp;&nbsp;phishing resistance.&nbsp; 
 



 MiLogin’s Path to Passkeys&nbsp; 



<p>The DTMB’s passkey rollout involved a meticulous process to ensure a seamless, secure transition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Extensive research on passwordless authentication solutions was conducted, engaging the DTMB’s cybersecurity review&nbsp; board in the evaluation process. Upon selecting passkeys for further exploration, the DTMB delved into the analysis of&nbsp; various FIDO options and sought feedback from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working together with Deloitte, which is the DTMB’s trusted systems integrator for the State’s enterprise digital identity&nbsp; solution, a comprehensive strategy was planned for the design, development, and implementation phases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the design phase, insights from the FIDO Alliance’s usability study results were working into screen and workflow&nbsp; designs. Findings from the DTMB’s MiLogin human-centered design usability study were also used to create a user&nbsp; experience tailored to address the diverse needs of various personas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The development phase focused on integrating MiLogin with FIDO authentication methods, accompanied by the creation&nbsp; of animated user help guides and tutorial videos to drive greater user adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Post-implementation, the DTMB monitored production metrics and gathered feedback from end-users, ensuring the&nbsp; success of the implementation and identifying areas for functionality enhancements in future releases.</p>



 MiLogin’s Impressive Passwordless Results&nbsp; 



<p>Within the first six months of release, MiLogin achieved impressive results for the State of Michigan: </p>



 
 100,000+ customer devices enrolled in passkeys&nbsp; 



 ~18,000 new passkey enrollments per month&nbsp; 



 Increased FIDO-based logins with zero reported issues&nbsp; 



 Decreased help desk initiated password resets with 1,300 fewer calls&nbsp; related to password resets in a single month.&nbsp; 
 



 



<blockquote>
<p>“I am proud that our MiLogin team has brought passwordless authentication to our public&nbsp; digital identities. Passwordless brings additional protections to our public digital identities, and&nbsp; helps protect our systems from account takeover attempts such as brute force and password&nbsp; spray attacks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
– Jayson Cavendish, Chief Security Officer, State of Michigan, DTMB&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>The Road Ahead for Passwordless in the State of Michigan&nbsp;</p>



<p>The State of Michigan anticipates a significant increase in passkey adoption, targeting over 10 million public users.&nbsp; They also plan to implement passwordless authentication for their workforce, integrating with their state directory&nbsp; services solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO authentication is a part of the State of Michigan’s Zero Trust Identity strategy to establish a secure identity in citizen&nbsp; interactions with state services. It will also improve the user experience, generate cost savings for the state, and increase adoption of the State’s digital identity solution by diverse state agency partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what advice does the DTMB have for other other organizations? The State of Michigan recommends understanding&nbsp; diverse user bases and use cases, prioritizing user experience, and incorporating usability studies, clear end-user messaging,&nbsp; and a well-designed communication plan for a successful FIDO authentication implementation.</p>

<p>As mentioned in our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/web3-points-library/">post introducing our points library</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Solutions SDK</a> also contains examples (found within the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/demo?ref=blog.ceramic.network">demo directory</a>) designed to help developers understand how to use the libraries within a larger application context. The remainder of this article will walk through a tutorial of the "full-stack app" example. If you prefer to follow a video tutorial, visit our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75IZp2oYncM&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">YouTube video</a> of this tutorial. </p> The Use Case: Rewarding Points for Joining a Community <p>This example offers a simple demonstration of how one could use the points library to reward community members for their engagement such as joining key platforms. To keep things simple, this tutorial will walk through the act of joining a Discord server as the trigger.</p> Getting Started <p>While an identical version of this example lives directly in the SDK repository, we've pulled it into a separate codebase for this walk-through. To get started, clone the code, install your dependencies, and duplicate the example environment file:</p> <code>// if you don't have pnpm installed
npm install -g pnpm@9

// otherwise: 
git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example &amp;&amp; cd points-example
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env</code> <p>Next, we'll need to configure a few environment variables:</p><p>NEXTAUTH_SECRET</p><p>We will be using&nbsp;<a href="https://next-auth.js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">NextAuth</a>&nbsp;as our open-source authentication solution (in order to verify Discord server membership). You can create a secret easily by running the following in your terminal:</p> <code>openssl rand -base64 32</code> <p>DISCORD_CLIENT_ID and DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET</p><p>This app will use Discord as the authentication provider (wrapped by NextAuth). To obtain these credentials, navigate to the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Discord Developer Portal</a>&nbsp;and set up a new application. On the left-hand panel, click on "OAuth2" and bring over your Client ID and Client Secret from the "Client Information" box.</p><p>Finally, since you'll be running the application locally, set the following URI value within the "Redirects" box (found under "Client Information"):&nbsp;<code>http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord</code>.</p><p>CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY</p><p>This is the private key your application will use to instantiate a static key:did in order to write points using the library. This DID will act as the identifier for the issuer of points for your application (you).</p><p>If you have the&nbsp;<a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.7.x/api/modules/cli?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB CLI</a>&nbsp;installed globally, you can run the following command in your terminal to create one:</p> <code>composedb did:generate-private-key</code> <p>AGGREGATION_ID</p><p>A default value for this environment variable has been provided for you within the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/.env.example?ref=blog.ceramic.network">.env.example</a>&nbsp;file. Please leave this as-is. You can reference the "extending the default library interfaces" below to learn more about this variable.</p><p>PROJECT_ID</p><p>We will be using&nbsp;<a href="https://walletconnect.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect's</a>&nbsp;Web3Modal for Web3 authentication. In your&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/pages/_app.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">_app.tsx</a>&nbsp;file, you will need to enter an active value for the&nbsp;<code>PROJECT_ID</code>&nbsp;constant defined on line 10.</p><p>You can set up a developer account for free by visiting&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in?ref=blog.ceramic.network">cloud.walletconnect.com</a>. Once authenticated, create a new app and copy over the "Project ID" value (found in the dashboard view for that corresponding app).</p> Extending the Default Library Interfaces <p>For our use case let's assume the following about our point reward structure:</p>  Participants can earn points related to engaging on certain platforms (such as Discord)  There are various ways participants can earn points across each platform (for example, following, posting, liking, and so on)  <p>As such, our application logic has the following requirements:</p>  Our application needs to easily access platform-specific subtotals for each participant  Our application also needs to easily access "global" totals for each participant as a sum of all eligible behavior  <p>The points library's default implementation of the <code>PointsAggregationInterface</code> serves only the second requirement above:</p> <code>type SimplePointsAggregation implements PointsAggregationInterface
  @createModel(
    description: "Simple points aggregation to an account at a specific date"
    accountRelation: SET
    accountRelationFields: ["recipient"]
  ) {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
  date: DateTime!
}</code> <p>This default model defines a <code>SET</code> accountRelation using the "recipient" subfield, which ensures that there can be only 1 model instance document any given account can create that points to a specific recipient. This will be useful for logging the global total for each participant, but would not be ideal for our first requirement.</p><p>Conversely, the <code>SimplePointsAllocation</code> model, the default type implementation of the <code>PointsAllocationInterface</code> (found in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/blob/main/composites/points/schemas/1-init.graphql?ref=blog.ceramic.network">schemas</a>), defines a <code>LIST</code> accountRelation, and is designed to track the history of allocation events rather than the current sum.</p><p>We've therefore chosen this example to show how easily developers can extend the defaults to meet more nuanced use cases. For this example app, we've defined a new type to fit our needs:</p> <code>type ContextPointAggregation implements PointsAggregationInterface
  @createModel(
    description: "A simple context-based point aggregation model"
    accountRelation: SET
    accountRelationFields: ["recipient", "context"]
  ) {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
  date: DateTime!
  context: String! @string(maxLength: 100)
}</code> <p>The extension you'll notice is that our SET relation now sits on two fields - "recipient" and "context". If, for example, we wanted to sum up all Discord-eligible behavior under a "discord" context value, this new accountRelation scheme ensures that our application (as the issuer) can create only 1 model instance per recipient+context combination.</p><p>For this tutorial, we've already pre-deployed this special type to the default node endpoint (if you want to create your own custom extensions, you will need to set up a node first). The model's stream ID is the corresponding value for the <code>AGGREGATION_ID</code> key provided for you in your .env file.</p> Using the Points Library in the Application <p>You can find the points library being used in our app's server logic as API routes and a context utility. If you look at our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/utils/context.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">context.ts</a> file, you can see how we've imported our <code>CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY</code> and <code>AGGREGATION_ID</code> environment variables to instantiate our reader and writer classes:</p> <code>import { PointsWriter, PointsReader } from '@ceramic-solutions/points'
import { getAuthenticatedDID } from '@ceramic-solutions/key-did'

<p>At its pre-IIW workshop on Monday, April 14, the OpenID Foundation convened a panel on Post-Quantum Computing and Identity. The panelists included:</p>
 
 Andrea D’Intino, Dyne.org 
 Nancy Cam-Winget, Cisco 
 John Bradley, Yubico 
 Rick Byers, Google 
 Gail Hodges, OpenID Foundation (moderator) 
 
<p>This summary draws out general themes and comments are not attributed to individuals or their organizations. You can also view this summary by the OpenID Chairman, Nat Sakimura.</p>
<p>  </p>
 Dissecting the Threat 
<p>Traditional public-key cryptography (PKC) will not withstand the code-breaking power of quantum computers. Put simply, today’s encryption methods depend upon complex mathematical problems that conventional computers cannot solve. PKC is used widely: to protect private data at rest, to secure messages (data in transit), to prevent unwanted third parties from hijacking digital sessions, and many other things. In the case of the OpenID Foundation, &nbsp;our standards – from OIDC to OID4VP and Federation – leverage PKC to secure identity data. As an increasingly digital society, it is how we all secure private data, business processes, government secrets, and critical infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a world of quantum computing, however, certain algorithms become more feasible to run (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor’s algorithm</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm">Grover’s search</a>). With these algorithms in play, those mathematical problems that underpin PKC become breakable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The panel discussed several ways in which modern identity infrastructure is vulnerable to these threats.</p>
<p>Tokens – OpenID Connect, Verifiable Credentials, and other standards rely heavily on tokens. The Identity Token at the end of an OIDC flow, for example, is a JSON Web Token (JWT). Tokens depend upon encrypted digital signatures that will come under threat in a post-quantum world.</p>
<p>Certificates and Transport Layer Security – the panel discussed the dependence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) on certificates and digital signatures. Digitally signed certificates come under threat when those signatures can more easily be forged in a post quantum environment.</p>
<p>Hardware Security Modules – create, store, and (ideally) never transmit key material. Today, this irrefutably establishes signature provenance. However, if the key-generation algorithm used by that HSM isn’t quantum-resistant, then any keys generated are vulnerable. Furthermore, there are key transmission and import processes undertaken today by large enterprises who require scalable and resilient signing capabilities: unless those transfer protocols are quantum-resistant, private keys may be intercepted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, quantum threatens not only our data, but also our Roots of Trust: once these systems are broken, how will anyone be able to reliably trust that they know the nature of any entity they are interacting with online?</p>
<p>For more information about the threat of quantum in the context of today’s cryptography, see <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5108747984306176/google-s-threat-model-for-post-quantum-cryptography">Google’s Threat Model for Post-Quantum Cryptography</a>.</p>
 Not a Y2K Event 
<p>When asked whether there were parallels between the quantum threat and Y2K, the panelists agreed that the analogy doesn’t hold: Y2K was a predictable event with a known timeline. The “post-quantum cross-over” is much less clear cut and the threats more insidious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most importantly, the threats of quantum computing actually begin long before the technology is available. While quantum computers do not seem to pose an immediate threat, since they are not readily available, the panelists agreed that much of today’s encrypted data is sill threatened. In part, this is because nation-state actors, in particular, may have these capabilities on the foreseeable horizon.</p>
<p>It is also because data captured today can be stored (and is being stored) with the intent of future decryption. This includes data stored today that could lead to the reverse engineering of signing keys years into the future. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes data stored or transmitted by individuals, companies, governments, and all other actors online. Encrypted digital transactions, like payments and secure messages, intercepted today can be stored and decrypted tomorrow. As such, there are major implications for the way we secure any secrets that will still matter in the future – whether that be state secrets or the private keys of our hardware.</p>
 Preparation is Key 
<p>…no pun intended…</p>
<p>The panelists agreed that, given the recognizable threat, players across the landscape must work to develop and align around quantum-resistant algorithms that can be implemented at scale. This alignment will enable organizations to roll-out future-proofed hardware and protect today’s data against the threats of tomorrow. In the interim, many players are introducing “quantum-safe” solutions and offering guidance as to how organizations can best position themselves today. Some of these solutions involve actively testing and “doubling up” pre/post-quantum controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All panelists agreed that not all safeguards are “post-quantum.” Many best-practices of today will continue to be protective and, as yet, are not sufficiently commonplace (see, for example,&nbsp; <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/CSRB_Review_of_the_Summer_2023_MEO_Intrusion_Final_508c.pdf">Cyber Safety Review Board’s recent recommendations</a> to Cloud Service Providers). These include best practices for key storage, key rotation, passkey (or password) management. Today’s essential hygiene remains critical and the ecosystem will continue to be only as protected as its weakest link. The panelists argued that a robust cybersecurity position has dependencies across the whole supply chain. If we want to solve the problems, the industry must continue to advocate for comprehensive standards and controls that protect.</p>
<p>This includes supporting global efforts to find quantum-resistant algorithms that scale and complement existing infrastructures. For example, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms">NIST is in the middle of a six-year competition</a> to standardize algorithms fit for essential use cases. There were four winners of the 2022 competition:</p>
 
 Kyber (a key exchange mechanism) 
 CRYSTALS-Dilithium (signing) 
 Falcon (signing) 
 Sphincs+ (signing) 
 
<p>The panel saw examples of how some of this had been implemented, including dyne.org’s implementation of <a href="https://dyne.org/W3C-DID/">Dilithium-signed Decentralized Identifiers</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 What does this mean for OpenID Foundation? 
<p>Members of the panel and OIDF members in the room reached consensus that, given the post-quantum vulnerabilities to identity tokens, credentials, and trust ecosystems, this is an area that requires immediate attention on behalf of the Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OIDF standards have a role in underpinning trust today. Our standards are designed to mitigate modern security threats. <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI</a>, for example, provides data schemas and security guidance appropriate for use cases requiring financial-grade privacy and security. <a href="https://openid.net/third-implementers-draft-of-openid-connect-federation-specification-approved/">OpenID Federation</a> also has a role underpinning trust between counterparties through cryptographically signed entity statements. Both standards have a place addressing the risks in today’s cybersecurity landscape: broad adoption of these and other emerging standards will reduce risk today.</p>
<p>However, while OIDF standards utilize modern cryptography, all Work Groups&nbsp; need to keep a watchful eye on emerging standards for quantum-resilience. At a point in the not-too-distant future, they will need to bake new cryptographic best practices into the standards. In the mean time, we can increase our advocacy and cross-industry collaborative efforts to test and refine quantum-safe algorithms.</p>

<p>By Duncan Sparrell, sFractal Consulting</p> 


<p>Cybersecurity threats have evolved significantly over the years, with cyber attackers constantly finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in software systems. From worms and viruses to the more recent ransomware attacks, the cost of cybercrime continues to rise. Not only are financial losses mounting, but the potential impact on critical infrastructure such as healthcare systems is also a cause for concern. Recent breaches like Log4Shell, SolarWinds, and XZ underscore the vulnerabilities within our software supply chains. These incidents highlight the critical need for understanding software supply chains, their vulnerabilities, and ways to prevent, detect, mitigate, and recover from attacks. To do this requires understanding the supply chain, which is hard in today’s environment.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2024/04/30/call-for-participation-oasis-osim-tc/">OASIS Open Supply Chain Information Modeling (OSIM)</a> Technical Committee aims to standardize and promote information models for supply chains.</p>



<p>The Role of OSIM</p>



<p>OSIM members will work to standardize the representation of information related to supply chains. Unlike data models, information models operate at a higher level of abstraction. They offer a holistic view of the supply chain ecosystem, facilitating a better understanding of the existing data formats, where similarities exist, where gaps exist, and how to utilize the inherent information in them.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Exploring Information Models</p>



<p>While data modeling focuses on implementing data structures, information modeling provides an abstract model that precedes knowledge modeling. Despite the current emphasis on data modeling, there’s a notable lack of attention given to information modeling, particularly in sectors such as supply chain software and cybersecurity. To address this gap, exploring specific use cases and adopting tools like <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-jadn-im/blob/published/imjadn-v1.0-cn01.md#2-information-modeling-overview">JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN)</a>, an OASIS specification for information modeling, is essential.</p>



<p>Using Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) as an example, the acute need for SBOMs has spurred significant work in recent years, highlighting the value of SBOMs and driving the implementation of several different SBOM data formats (e.g. <a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX</a> and <a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX</a>). And those formats can portray data other than SBOM (e.g. vulnerability exploitability, licensing). So what makes an SBOM an SBOM? That is a question OSIM can answer with an SBOM information model. Besides being used to compare the features of the various data formats, the resulting information model can then be used as input to knowledge model graphs for defining the semantics/knowledge/meaning.</p>



<p>Another example is Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (<a href="https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/vex_one-page_summary_0.pdf">VEX</a>) which is even newer and also has multiple evolving data formats (<a href="https://oasis-open.github.io/csaf-documentation/">CSAF</a>, <a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openvex">OpenVex</a>, <a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX</a>). What makes a VEX a VEX? And what elements are in common with SBOM or have relationships with elements in an SBOM? This question becomes even more important as SBOM and VEX begin to appear in regulations and contractual procurement documents.</p>



<p>Standardizing Supply Chain Information Models</p>



<p>The U.S. government, through agencies like the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (<a href="https://www.ntia.gov/page/software-bill-materials">NTIA</a>) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sbom">CISA</a>), is recognizing the need for transparency and accountability in software procurement. They are requiring vendors to disclose what’s in their software through SBOMs to aid in identifying vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>However, the existence of various competing data models (SPDX, CycloneDX, CSAF, OpenVex) highlights the necessity for creating information models. By establishing a standard framework that sits atop existing data models, it defines the essence of “what is an SBOM?”, “what is a VEX” and it becomes easier to identify commonalities and differences across diverse specifications. Such a model could streamline interoperability and facilitate software conversion processes. While challenges persist, efforts to standardize supply chain information modeling aim to bring clarity and coherence to the complex landscape of software supply chains.</p>



<p>The goal of OSIM isn’t to create yet another competing standard but to provide a unifying framework. By standardizing OSIM, we can bridge the gap between existing data models emphasizing interoperability and collaboration among multiple standards.</p>



<p>Collaboration is Key<br><br>OSIM is paving the way for a safer and more resilient digital future with a secure software supply chain ecosystem. Achieving creation and widespread adoption of OSIM of supply chain information models will require collaboration among stakeholders across industries. Whether you’re a customer, a vendor, or a solution provider, your involvement is crucial.</p>

<p>20% of the world’s top 100 websites now support the password alternative</p>



<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., 02 May, 2024 – World Password Day may soon need a rebrand, as the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> survey released today shows that half of people in the US and UK have begun ditching the password in favor of more convenient and secure passwordless alternatives.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/content-ebook-consumer-password-and-passkey-trends-wpd-2024/">independent survey</a> commissioned by the FIDO Alliance found that 53% of people have enabled passkeys on at least one of their accounts, with 22% enabling them on every account they possibly can. In separate research, the Alliance found that passkeys are now supported by 20% of the world’s top 100 websites and 12% of the top 250.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This shift away from passwords toward passkeys is being driven by three key trends; people’s concerns over password security, their frustrations in using them, and the growing availability of passkeys on major websites and services.</p>



<p>The Alliance’s research found that in the last year, 24% of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities, and 26% had to reset or recover at least one password every month. In addition, 45% of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account. This is hugely significant for passkey adoption, as 61% of people familiar with passkeys consider them to be more convenient than passwords, and 58% believe they offer greater security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The availability of passkeys has also increased steadily over the last year, with <a href="https://aka.ms/VasuJoyWPD2024">Microsoft today announcing</a> that Microsoft accounts, including a wide range of services like Bing, Microsoft 365 and Xbox.com – now also support passkeys. This is added to support from large global consumer brands, such as Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Google, Hyatt, Nintendo, PayPal, PlayStation, Shopify and TikTok. In all, more than 13 billion user accounts can now leverage passkeys for sign in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result of high-profile passkey deployments like these, awareness of the technology has grown to 62% of people, according to the research. Among people with some knowledge of passkeys, those enabling them on at least one account rises substantially to 74%, while those enabling passkeys on every account possible rises to 32%. This suggests that adoption will only increase as more people become more familiar with passkeys.</p>



<p>“It was just two years ago that FIDO Alliance, alongside the world’s largest platform providers, introduced the vision for passkeys to accelerate the scale and usability of password-free sign-ins. The market’s reaction since then has been nothing short of phenomenal, with hundreds of services enabling billions of consumers to use passkeys,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance. “We expect this trend to accelerate in the months and years ahead, and our research makes it clear that when offered, people prefer the better security and usability of passkeys over passwords.”</p>

<p>Notes to editors:</p>



 
 The independent survey was conducted by Sapio Research in April 2024 among 2,000 consumers across the UK and US – with 1,000 in each country. Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. In this particular study, the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than 2.2 percentage points from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample. 



 To calculate the proportion of the world’s top websites and services that support passkeys, the FIDO Alliance combined publicly available information with its own data on passkey deployments.&nbsp; 
 



<p>About the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.<br>Contact<br><a href="mailto:press@fidoalliance.org">press@fidoalliance.org</a></p>

<p>For those in our community who have been staying up-to-date on our thoughts and experimenting thus far as they relate to points, you already know why we see points as a logical vehicle for Web3 reputation systems. As our co-founder, Danny importantly points out in his blog post entitled <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/points-how-reputation-tokens-collide-where-it-goes-from-here/">Points: How Reputation &amp; Tokens Collide</a>, points not only align the incentives of the platform and its users, but Web3 enables point systems to be more open and composable by "...making every event driving points both transparent and verifiable..."</p><p>Given Ceramic's native composability, provenance, performance, and flexible-by-design characteristics, "points built on Ceramic" became an obvious idea for a design pattern that would appeal to teams looking to integrate reward systems into their projects. In March, we released a post called <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/points-on-ceramic/">Building Points on Ceramic - an Example and Learnings</a> meant to walk readers through a points proof-of-concept application we deployed for EthDenver '24. Later that month, we also released another post to announce <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/toward-the-first-decentralized-points-system-oamo-becomes-the-first-points-provider-on-ceramic/">Oamo as the first points provider on Ceramic</a>.</p><p>This is all to say - as an organization, we've strived to be thoughtful and deliberate about how we approach the opportunity Web3 points presents while aiming to maintain quick iteration and experimentation as engineering and product norms.</p><p>As such, we've been working on a new experiment that we're excited to share with you - a points library built on Ceramic!</p> Why Develop a Points Library?  <p>Given that we identified points as an ideal use case for Ceramic, building a points library presented an opportunity to help developers start experimenting with and iterating on Ceramic much faster. We also predicted that the approach would accelerate developers' learning rate by packaging Ceramic within an easy-to-understand paradigm. Finally, a use case-specific library allowed us to:</p>  Predefine library interfaces and base models for users, helping them bypass this development stage  Eliminate the friction of compiling and deploying a composite  Enable immediate utility and experimentation by removing the need for node setup  Help developers focus on their core application logic by baking straightforward functionality into the library  <p>...and so on.</p> Which Use Cases is it Built for? <p>Throughout this post, we'll take a high-level walk through the anatomy of the points module (and the broader SDK it lives in) which should reveal how flexible and extendable the library is. However, here are some scenarios we considered that helped inform its design and utility:</p><p>Rewarding Community Engagement</p>  A project wants to incentivize meaningful participation by rewarding points for engagement across key social platforms  The project must track a history of point allocation events per participant, as well as have easy access to a participant's total  <p>Incentivizing Collaboration</p>  A project wants to reward collaborators for contributing to a codebase  Various types of contributions under this system are eligible for point rewards  <p>Quests or Education</p>  An education platform wants to reward students for completing class modules  Points are distributed in correlation to quiz or test scores at the end of each module   What is the Points Library? <p>The points library is the first module within our larger <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Solutions SDK</a>, designed to be the eventual home for any experimental tooling our team creates for certain common patterns or use cases we've identified as priorities. While the individual libraries (points, for example) sit at the core of this SDK, this repository will also contain example applications, API documentation, and other helpful modules to support developers looking to get started.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/libraries/points?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Points Library module</a> (which is now available as an NPM module - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramic-solutions/points?activeTab=readme&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">@ceramic-solutions/points</a>) removes the common points of tension mentioned above by:</p><p>Delivering a hosted node endpoint</p><p>This is the default endpoint if no alternate is provided by the user (for test purposes only - not intended for production). This feature was designed to accelerate developer experimentation. Of course, the library also supports private endpoints as well.</p><p>Predefined Interfaces and Default Models</p><p>The points library relies on two schema interfaces (implemented by two default models) for keeping track of points. These interfaces can easily be extended by developers who desire more complex use cases, or developers can leverage the default models out of the box with no additional configuration.</p> <code>interface PointsAllocationInterface implements PointsInterface
  @createModel(description: "Interface for a single allocation of points to an account") {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
}

interface PointsAggregationInterface implements PointsInterface
  @createModel(description: "Interface for an aggregation of points to an account") {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
  date: DateTime!
}</code> <p>While the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/blob/main/libraries/points/README.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Points Library Readme</a> offers more detail, these interfaces broadly speak to the two primary utilities we anticipate developers will need. Model instances of <code>PointsAllocationInterface</code> will keep track of the history of allocation events (and if extended, can include fields to capture additional details such as when and why points were allocated). Conversely, <code>PointsAggregationInterface</code> is designed to keep track of the sum of points for a recipient at any given time (and like allocation docs, can also be extended to keep track of more nuanced data points like contextual subtotals).</p><p>Built-in Reader and Writer Classes</p><p>The two core library modules consist of a points reader class and a separate writer class, allowing developers multiple ways to instantiate an instance (the easiest of which simply requires a private key if using the default node endpoint and default models). Each class includes built-in methods to read or issue points and can accommodate extensions of the interfaces without the necessity of additional wrapping.</p> What Will You Build with Points? <p>While we covered a few examples of typical use cases for points, there are so many other possibilities out there for developers to explore. Perhaps you want to reward your community for showing up to in-person events or collaborating on projects. Maybe you want to build a service that analyzes on-chain behavior (such as interacting with certain smart contracts or holding certain assets) and uses a framework of weights to award contextual points.</p><p>We'd love to learn how you're using reward systems across your communities and projects, and whether this initial library has what it needs to support your use case. Feel free to contact me directly at <a href="mailto:mzk@3box.io">mzk@3box.io</a>, or start a conversation on the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Forum</a>.

  🚀 Decentralized Identity Foundation News  
<p>The community welcomes Ankur Banerjee to the Helm of DIF TSC</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIF is excited to announce that Ankur Banerjee has been elected as the new co-chair of the DIF Technical Steering Committee (TSC). Ankur plays an increasingly critical role at DIF, and last year he was elected to the DIF Steering Committee. He joins current co-chair Andor Kesselman, and together they are bound to drive DIF's mission forward with renewed vigor and vision.</p>
<p>“We are extremely fortunate to have Ankur join us in a TSC leadership role," said Kim Hamilton Duffy, DIF’s Executive Director. "As decentralized identity technology continues to mature, it finds broader adoption across diverse markets and use cases, making the need for interoperability and compliance with emerging regulations more critical than ever. Ankur’s deep expertise across both consumer and enterprise spheres aligns perfectly with our strategic goals. His leadership will be crucial in navigating these evolving landscapes and ensuring that DIF remains at the forefront of technological innovation and standards development.”</p>
<p>"I am deeply honored to take on the role of co-chair of the DIF Technical Steering Committee. Decentralized identity technology is at an inflection point for adoption, where the basic building blocks of the standards are built and settled. I look forward to supporting DIF member organizations in accelerating their industry-wide efforts to make it easier for developers to build usable, privacy-preserving experiences that give users control of their data,” said Ankur Banerjee.</p>
<p>We encourage all our readers and members to extend their warmest welcome to Ankur. More <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/welcoming-ankur-banerjee-to-the-helm-of-dif-tsc/">here</a>.</p>

DIF recently spoke to Founder and CEO Cole Davis, who shared his insights into the industry's workings, and his approach to modernizing the music supply chain.   </p><p>Where did the idea for Switchchord come from?&nbsp;</p><p>I started playing the bass guitar at 15, and played throughout high school and college. After college I was playing in a band while working at a bank when we received a cease and desist letter telling us we had to change our name. It got me curious about the legal side of music and I decided to go back to school to study law.</p><p>After gaining a foundation in corporate law I switched to entertainment law. While helping ad agencies and filmmakers get the rights to use music in their productions, I was surprised by the lack of operational workflows and communication tools to enable this. In the music industry there are a mass of legal contracts that drive behavior. You need to prove you have the right to take certain actions based on these contracts, like license a certain copyright in a particular media. The identity and communication infrastructure was essentially nonexistent.</p><p>There are two sides to the music industry. The first is music publishing, which involves songwriters who write compositions–think melody, lyrics, and chord progressions. These compositions receive copyright protection, and usually songwriters sell or license these copyrights to music publishers. The music publisher makes money by licensing the composition and then shares the revenue with the songwriter.&nbsp;</p><p>The second part of the industry is recorded music. Recording artists make recordings of compositions, resulting in a sound recording. These sound recordings receive separate copyright protection, and this copyright is usually owned by the record company who “signed” the recording artist. So any time you hear music, there are technically two copyrights involved, and those two copyrights are usually owned by different entities.</p><p>The music publishing side gets very complex. Often songs are written by multiple songwriters who are “signed” to different music publishers, meaning multiple publishers co-own the copyright. Some music publishers then hire publishing administration companies to license their songs for them. And many music publishers hire “sub-publishers” in foreign territories for local administration and licensing . There’s no central record of ownership or administration rights. Instead, you have many third-party databases that have built up over time, all doing relatively the same thing and that are divorced from the legal contracts that actually govern copyright ownership and administration rights. Information relating to these legal relationships is usually delivered via texts and emails, often resulting in inconsistencies across the entire supply chain. The transaction costs are enormous.&nbsp;</p><p>I started researching the problem intensively, eventually quitting my job as a lawyer to study technology full time.&nbsp; I was originally focused on blockchain but eventually migrated to the W3C’s emerging decentralized identity framework.&nbsp;</p><p>How do these problems affect songwriters and recording artists?&nbsp;</p><p>Streaming fraud is a really big issue — there are estimates that 10% or more of all streams are fraudulent in some way. There are bad actors who try to “game” the system of common royalty pools. Sometimes they will hijack existing legitimate streaming accounts and turn them into a bot farm to stream the bad actor’s music. Or the bad actor will upload music they don’t own and hope to make money before the music is taken down.</p><p>Then there are ‘black box’ royalties that are unallocated, and can’t be distributed due to incomplete or incorrectly registered information. This is a global phenomenon in the music industry. In the US, these are often held in escrow by collective licensing agencies&nbsp;like the Mechanical Licensing Collective, which licenses certain music publishing rights to streaming platforms in the US — their unallocated royalty pool&nbsp;is estimated at $500M or more — who collectively try to figure it out. Eventually, after years, this money gets paid out based on market share.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also ramifications for attribution. If you’re not credited correctly, it can be a career killer for a songwriter.&nbsp;</p><p>Generative AI is the new big problem. Everything will need digital signatures at source, or you’re not sure whether it’s human or AI created.&nbsp;</p><p>What approach have you taken to address these challenges?&nbsp;</p><p>All these issues are identity problems in disguise. We need digital signatures on everything, and data supply chains based on machine-readable data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first requirement was to represent a copyright in a digital form so that it could interact with existing copyright management platforms, effectively turning the copyright itself into a messaging hub that can connect different systems.</p><p>The second requirement was an identity system that can map contractual relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>With these in place, you can build verifiable data “pipes” between different industry databases, creating a routing system to pass data relating to verifiable identities and verifiable legal relationships. That helps keep ownership and administration rights in sync across the supply chain.&nbsp;</p><p>Our first product is designed to move data from the point of origin, such as a recording studio, into various copyright management platforms as quickly and easily as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Where does decentralized identity come in?&nbsp;</p><p>All our products rely on decentralized identity. It’s the key technology to make everything work.&nbsp;</p><p>The music industry uses lots of different types of identifiers. Some are ISO standards and others are proprietary. To get paid, you need to be identified correctly by the supply chain, which relies on getting these different identifiers into downstream databases.&nbsp;</p><p>We verify and bind all these identifiers to a single Decentralized Identifier (DID), enabling you to bring all of your identifiers with you without any manual data entry. In addition, these DIDs are able to make statements about their legal relationships and contractual authorizations, in the form of verifiable credentials, that can be proven to other parts of the supply chain. This enables everyone in the music industry to stay in sync, with a single identity for all their identifiers, industry memberships, and legal relationships.</p><p>With an open-source identity system at the foundation, we make data supply chains between songwriters, publishers, copyright management systems and the recorded music side of the industry, with protocols for sending metadata around the system.&nbsp;</p><p>What lessons have you learned during the development of Switchchord?&nbsp;</p><p>The key is to integrate with what already exists. We see decentralization as extremely powerful but it’s a process, it doesn’t just magically happen.&nbsp;</p><p>How do you babystep people into this new world? If you’re modeling legal relationships or an identity for a copyright, you can get into tricky issues with governance. For example, if you have four writers, each with a different publisher, and you want to represent the copyright with a DID, who acts as the DID controller?</p><p>There are usually two roots of trust in each of these situations: a legal root of trust and a cryptographic root of trust. You have to marry all these worlds. We’re working with the industry on that.&nbsp;</p><p>We use did:web for now as it’s easy. We don’t want to force songwriters to have their own wallet, or to use the same infrastructure to manage their keys. We’re realistic about that.&nbsp;</p><p>What is your vision for the future?&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, we want everyone to be able to bring their own identity. You’ll be able to insert these DIDs directly into legal workflows, with agents controlling the data flows. The copyright itself can have a Decentralized Web Node (DWN) where data can be written to and shared. Any time you see a statement being made about copyright ownership or administration rights, we see an opportunity to present that statement as a verifiable credential. That will be very helpful at getting to the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>Because we see decentralization as a spectrum that can occur over time, we closely follow some of the recent upgrades to did:web that extend things like key management. So DID methods like did:plc, did:webplus, did:tdw, or did:webs, which uses KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure). Until the infrastructure exists to let people BYOI (bring your own identity), we’ve left our DID method selection purposefully modular.</p><p>DIDComm is also great. If you need to contact people, we’d like to enable that within the framework of decentralized identifiers. That goes back to my original frustrations with licensing music into things like movies and the complete lack of communication infrastructure.</p><p>What do you see as the wider significance of these new types of decentralized approaches?</p><p>In my previous careers I’ve worked with other industries such as oil and gas and real estate. The basic questions are the same: how to map legal relationships within a complex supply chain, and how to represent assets as digital versions that are intrinsically tied to the legal system.</p><p>The decentralized identity framework is the future of commercial transactions. It’s the most important thing out there. There’s cool stuff you can do with blockchain and payments, but that’s not everything. You don’t need blockchain for the vast majority of these use cases, just digital signatures and verifiable data.&nbsp;</p><p>What value do you get from DIF membership?&nbsp;</p><p>DIF is a really good rallying point for people who are trying to tackle these kinds of hard problems using decentralized technology. It’s the body I’m most involved in, though I’m also involved with ToIP, W3C, and C2PA. The community is really approachable.&nbsp;</p><p>I was a judge on the DIF hackathon. It was so cool to see people start to use this stuff. I was really happy to be involved.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually it would be great to introduce DIF to some of the music industry standards bodies we participate in, like DDEX and ISNI. I think DIF could play a role as this connective layer across different industries who are all tackling similar problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Last month, at the Gartner Identity and Access Management Summit in London, industry leaders showcased successful, interoperable implementations of the Shared Signals Framework (SSF) and Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP). This included <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2024/02/unifying-efforts-amplifying-security-shared-signals-interoperability/">Okta</a>, SailPoint, and <a href="https://sharedsignals.guide/#aboutssf">Cisco</a> as well as security startups <a href="https://sgnl.ai/2024/03/biggest-insights-for-identity-professionals-from-the-gartner-iam-summit-in-london/">SGNL</a>, VeriClouds, and Helisoft. &nbsp;The SSF suite of standards underpins Zero-Trust architectures and promises to enable a more secure digital future for everyone.</p>
<p></p>
 The Shared Signals Framework is a Game Changer 
<p>Today’s businesses and their users demand seamless access to services. Often, this involves many concurrent logged in sessions to countless applications – and these sessions can last days or even weeks at a time. Over the course of the session, plenty can change:</p>
 
 A user may change their location 
 A malicious application may be found on a device 
 Users may be granted new privileges (or privileges may have been revoked) 
 
<p>Furthermore, there may be suspicious activity on user accounts that have meaningful implications for other dependent services – like an email address that is used to login to many other online services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The industry has worked hard over the last decade to make single sign-on and federated identity possible. This greatly improved the experience for users and opened many doors to make adoption of SaaS widespread. However, closing doors when needed was more of an afterthought, and hasn’t been fully solved.</p>
<p>While many security solutions now exist, a lot of actionable data sits siloed within individual tools, applications, and dashboards—and it hasn’t historically traveled across service providers. This lack of data sharing constrains the implementation of a Zero Trust security posture.</p>
 Enter SSF: the Solution 
<p>The Shared Signals Framework is an open API built upon a suite of protocols that enable applications and service providers to communicate about security events in order to make dynamic access and authorization decisions. It acts as a signaling layer on a back channel that helps to secure sessions at near real-time. </p>
<p>Back in 2019, Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/re-thinking-federated-identity-with-the-continuous-access-evaluation-protocol">introduced</a> a standards-based approach to continuously evaluating access authorization. The Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (<a href="https://caep.dev/learn">CAEP</a>) created a simpler way for IdPs and services to convey information about a given session. Meanwhile, the OpenID Foundation published the Risk &amp; Incident Sharing and Collaboration (RISC) specification to define a standardized way to communicate account-level risk events. The two initiatives merged within the OpenID Foundation and formed the Shared Signals working group. CAEP and RISC are now profiles on top of the Shared Signals Framework (SSF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now a maturing standard, SSF is an API with a standard format for expressing both account-level and session-level Security Events. It offers seamless, privacy-preserving data-sharing about security events between service providers. Organizations can easily integrate SSF into their security infrastructure and begin sending and receiving Security Events across an ecosystem. This enables organizations to deliver Zero Trust security underpinned by continuous risk assessment efficiently and at scale.</p>
 Security through Collaboration 
<p>In a <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/04/2003313510/-1/-1/0/ESF%20CTR%20IAM%20MFA%20SSO%20CHALLENGES.PDF">recent report by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a>, the authors note that the Shared Signals Framework is an emerging, promising standard gaining traction in the industry. They state “support for and the development of these standards in the enterprise ecosystem will enable a variety of security use cases, ranging from limiting access to managed devices to quickly revoking access when accounts are compromised.” They further recommend broader support for the development and implementation of identity standards as a crucial underpinning of security.</p>
<p>The interoperability session held at the Gartner IAM Summit in London demonstrates, not only the latest in security protocols, but also the industry’s shift towards collaborative security enabled by Open Standards. By sharing these security events across an ecosystem of trusted parties, organizations have more informed Zero Trust implementations and are empowered to mitigate threats more effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Input to the Work Group 
<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">OIDF Shared Signals Work Group</a> is very active and welcomes a wider set of requirements from implementors. For example, implementors at April’s Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) discussed the possibility of using the Shared Signals Framework to communicate lifecycle and security signals between participants (issuers, wallets, etc.) in mobile driving license (mDL) and other digital identity ecosystems. Such an approach would lower the burden on issuing authorities to deploy across wallets and ensure their policies are enforced consistently.</p>

 About the OpenID Foundation 
 The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate.

More specifically, you can now use the following tools to enhance your applications:</p>  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/relations?ref=blog.ceramic.network#model-to-model">SET account relation</a> - enabling users to enforce a constraint where each user account (or DID) can create only one instance of a model for a specific record of another model.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/schemas?ref=blog.ceramic.network#type-validation-directives">Immutable fields</a> - allow specific data to be prevented from being altered.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/interact-with-data?ref=blog.ceramic.network#removerestore-record-from-index">shouldIndex flag</a> - gives developers an option to manage the data visibility by choosing which fields should be indexed.  <p>In this blog post, we are going to dive into these features in more detail. For a video walkthrough, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2BRQqPI354&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">this video tutorial</a>.</p> SET account relations <p>SET relations in ComposeDB enable developers to define relations between the data models that follow specific constraints and include the user as part of the relationship. SET account relation allows users to enforce the constraint that a specific account (DID) can have only one instance of a model for a specific record of another model.</p><p>The best example to illustrate the “like” feature of a social media application. SET relation can be utilized to make sure that the user (DID) can “like” a specific post only once, while at the same time allowing the user to like multiple posts.</p><p>Let’s have a look at how SET Relations can be used in practice.</p> Ceramic Layer <p>To use SET account relation in Ceramic, you will first have to define a SET <code>accountRelation</code> in your model definition. An example below consists of two simple models - <code>POST_MODEL</code> representing the model definition for social media posts, and <code>LIKE_MODEL</code> representing the model definition for users liking the posts.</p><p>The model definition for <code>POST_MODEL</code> has the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/relations?ref=blog.ceramic.network#types-of-relations">accountRelation</a> as a list, meaning that one user account will be allowed to create multiple posts.</p><p>The model definition for <code>LIKE_MODEL</code> has a <code>SET</code> accountRelation and includes the fields which should be used to create the unique relation - <code>postID</code> and <code>userID</code>. This defines that a specific user can create only one "like" record for a specific post.</p><p></p> <code>const POST_MODEL: ModelDefinition = {
  name: 'Post',
  version: '2.0',
  interface: false,
  implements: [],
  accountRelation: {type: 'list'},
  schema: {
    $schema: '&lt;https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema&gt;',
    type: 'object',
    additionalProperties: false,
    properties: {
      content: {type: 'string', maxLength: 500},
      author: {type: 'string'},
    },
    required: ['content', 'author'],
  },
}

const LIKE_MODEL: ModelDefinition = {
  name: 'Like',
  version: '2.0',
  interface: false,
  implements: [],
  accountRelation: {type: 'set', fields: ['postID', 'userID']},
  schema: {
    $schema: '&lt;https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema&gt;',
    type: 'object',
    additionalProperties: false,
    properties: {
      postID: {type: 'string'},
      userID: {type: 'string'},
    },
    required: ['postID', 'userID'],
  },
}

</code>  ComposeDB Layer <p>Now let's see an example of how you can use SET account relations in ComposeDB. Similar to the example above, the key component that allows you to define the SET account relation for a specific model is the <code>accountRelation</code> scalar alongside the fields that should be used to define the unique relation.</p><p>Take the example below. Here we have two models defined using GraphQL schema definition language. The first model is a model for storing data about a Picture - the source and the dimensions of the image. The model definition Favourite implements the behavior of the user setting a picture as a favorite. Note that this model has an <code>accountRelation</code> defined as SET. The field that is used to define the relation is <code>docID</code>, which refers to the document ID of the picture record.</p> <code>type Picture @createModel(description: "A model for pictures", accountRelation: SINGLE) {
  src: String! @string(maxLength: 150),
  mimeType: String! @string(maxLength: 50),
  width: Int! @int(min:1),
  height: Int! @int(min:1),
  size: Int! @int(min:1),
}

type Favourite @createModel(description: "A set of favourite documents", accountRelation: SET, accountRelationFields: ["docID"]){
  docID: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "Picture")
  doc: Node @relationDocument(property: "docID")
  note: String @string(maxLength: 500)
}

</code> <p>All this means that the user will be able to set only one image as a favorite. They can set different pictures as favorites, but only one record per picture.</p> Immutable Fields <p>Another feature that has been recently added to Ceramic is Immutable Fields. With Immutable Fields, you are able to define which fields (for example, some critical data) should remain unchangeable no matter what and be accessible as read-only data. Any attempt to alter the data set as immutable would result in an error message.</p> Ceramic Layer <p>Defining specific fields as immutable is pretty simple. Below we have an example of a simple model defining a Person - their address, name, and other details. To make these fields immutable you simply need to include them into the <code>immutableFields</code> array. In the example below, fields like <code>address</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>myArray</code>, and <code>myMultipleType</code> will be set as immutable, meaning that once this data is created, it will be unchangeable:</p> <code>const example_model : ModelDefinition = {
  name : 'Person',
  views : {},
  schema : {
    type : 'object',
    $defs : {
      Address : {
        type : 'object',
        title : 'Address',
        required : [ 'street', 'city', 'zipCode' ],
        properties : {
          city : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 5},
          street : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 5},
          zipCode : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 5},
        },
        additionalProperties : false,
      },
    },
    $schema : '&lt;https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema&gt;',
    required : [ 'name', 'address' ],
    properties : {
      name : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 10},
      address : {$ref : '#/$defs/Address'},
      myArray : {type : 'array', maxItems : 3, items : {type : 'integer'}},
      myMultipleType : {oneOf : [ {type : 'integer'}, {type : 'string'} ]},
    },
    additionalProperties : false,
  },
  version : '2.0',
  interface : false,
  relations : {},
  implements : [],
  description : 'Simple person with immutable field',
  accountRelation : {type : 'list'},
  immutableFields : [ 'address', 'name', 'myArray', 'myMultipleType' ],
}</code>  ComposeDB Layer <p>In ComposeDB, a specific field can be set as immutable by adding a directive <code>@immutable</code> to the fields that should remain unchangeable. For example:</p> <code>type ModelWithImmutableProp@createModel(
  accountRelation: SINGLE, 
  description: "Test model with an immutable int property"
  ) {
    uniqueValue: Int @immutable 
    uniqueValue2: Int @immutable
  }
}</code> <p></p><p>Here, we set that fields <code>uniqueValue</code> and <code>uniqueValue2</code> are going to be immutable.</p> shouldIndex Flag <p>Last but not least, let’s talk about the shouldIndex Flag available in Ceramic and ComposeDB. shouldIndex Flag allows you to control the stream indexing by toggling a boolean metadata flag. It enables you to manage data visibility and indexing. By setting the shouldIndex Flag to <code>false</code>, you can disable the stream from being indexed, making it “invisible” for indexing operations. Let’s take a look at how you can use this feature.</p> Ceramic Layer <p>When working with model documents, <code>ModelInstanceDocument</code>, there is a new method called <code>shouldIndex(boolean-value)</code> where false would indicate the stream corresponding to this model should not be indexed, and can be called with value = true to reindex an existing document, e.g.:</p> <code>const document = await ModelInstanceDocument.create(ceramic, CONTENT0, midMetadata)
// Unindex
await document.shouldIndex(false)
</code>  ComposeDB Layer <p>There are two ways to signal that a stream shouldn’t be indexed using ComposeDB. The first one is by including the <code>shouldIndex</code>option in a mutation query, setting it to <code>true</code> if it should be indexed and set to <code>false</code> in the contrary:</p> <code>const runtime = new ComposeRuntime({ ceramic, context, definition: composite.toRuntime() })
await runtime.executeQuery&lt;{
updateProfile: { viewer: { profile: { name: string } } }
}&gt;(`
  mutation UpdateProfile($input: UpdateProfileInput!) {
    updateProfile(input: $input) {
      viewer {
        profile {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
`, { input: { id: profileID, content: {}, options: { shouldIndex: false } } },
)</code> <p>The second way is to use a mutation type called enableIndexing, just like a create or update mutation, it should be paired with the model’s name, sending the streamId and shouldIndex value as part of the input, e.g.:</p> <code>const enableIndexingPostMutation = `mutation EnableIndexingPost($input: EnableIndexingPostInput!) {
  enableIndexingPost(input: $input) {
    document {
      id
    }
  }
}`

await runtime.executeQuery&lt;{ enableIndexingPost: { document: { id: string } } }&gt;
enableIndexingPostMutation, { input: { id, shouldIndex: false } },)
</code> <p>Note that the shouldIndex flag doesn’t delete the data. If set to <code>false</code>, the stream will still exist on the network; however, it will not be indexed and will not be available for data interactions.</p>  Summary <p>The powerful new features in Ceramic and ComposeDB offer users a sophisticated toolkit for data management. From enforcing unique constraints with SET account relations to securing key data with immutable fields and controlling indexing operations using the shouldIndex flag, these features empower developers to build robust and efficient data models for their applications.

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>April brings change in many forms – not just shorter days and falling leaves from our deciduous trees. For business it’s not only a new trading quarter and for some a new financial year, but also the arrival of policy exposure drafts from Government agencies that sometimes stack three, four or five deep. This is hard enough for people or organisations, but for consensus-driven community/industry groups it is quite daunting. I’ve always found it strange that while agencies recognise the value of group responses, additional time for the process is not afforded to them by default. However, it’s great that most agencies do so when approached. You know who you are, so thank you!</p>

<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to reliability, scalability, and performance, the Ceramic core developers have spent a lot of the last year making significant architectural improvements to our Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS). To further advance the goal of a reliable and performant anchoring system, the CAS is moving away from IPFS. This change requires developers to upgrade their Ceramic nodes to v5.3+ by 6th of May, 2024 to avoid potential data loss.</p> About the change <p>The Ceramic team is getting closer to releasing Ceramic’s Recon protocol, intended to dramatically improve the performance, scalability, and reliability of cross-node data synchronization. Utilizing our new custom Recon protocol requires moving away from IPFS pubsub as the mechanism for synchronizing Streams in Ceramic. In preparation for this change, the Ceramic team has built a new direct HTTP-based mechanism for sharing Time Events from the CAS to Ceramic nodes. This means that newer Ceramic nodes no longer have any dependency on IPFS pubsub to learn about Time Events from the CAS. Older Ceramic nodes, however, may still be relying on pubsub to learn about Time Events. Since the correct delivery of Time Events is a requirement to avoid data loss, it is important that all Ceramic nodes on the network be upgraded to at least v5.3 by the 6th of May, 2024, to avoid potential data loss.</p> What does this mean to Ceramic developers? <p>Developers must upgrade their Ceramic nodes to v5.3+ by the 6th of May, 2024. After the 6th of May, the CAS will no longer publish Time Events to IPFS pubsub which means that if you don’t upgrade to v5.3+, your node won’t get notifications about anchor successes, which in turn may result in data loss.</p> How to get support? <p>If you need support regarding the upgrade or choosing the best path forward for your project, please create a post on <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/upgrade-your-ceramic-node-to-v5-3-before-the-6th-of-may/1563?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic developer forum</a> with your project details and the core Ceramic team members will reach out to you.</p>

<p>Andrew Shikiar, FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CEO</p>



<p>Adoption of passkeys has grown rapidly since the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/">introduction</a> of sync capabilities less than two years ago, with passkeys being offered by a large and growing proportion of the world’s most visited websites and services. This adoption has come in large part because passkeys offer a true password replacement, helping address the well-known security and user experience weaknesses of knowledge-based authentication like passwords and even other second-factor methods like SMS OTPs.</p>



<p>Market adoption of new technology naturally moves faster than the associated policy and regulatory guidance – which for user authentication still generally reflects the password-centric worldview from when such guidance was developed. This is why we are excited that NIST has taken a lead amongst government agencies and moved quickly to provide <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/giving-nist-digital-identity-guidelines-boost-supplement-incorporating">new supplemental guidance</a> confirming that synced passkeys meet Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2).</p>



<p>This new NIST guidance makes clear that passkeys – like other FIDO authenticators – can support both AAL2 and AAL3 requirements. Synced passkeys can be AAL2 and device-bound passkeys can be AAL3.</p>



<p>Crucially, the NIST supplement also cites that synced passkeys deployed in a manner consistent with the guidelines as being phishing resistant. This has obvious benefits in a world where 87% of hacking-related breaches are caused by weak or stolen passwords and where there has been a 967% rise in credential phishing since 2022.</p>



<p>Passkey adoption to be boosted by the ‘reassurance of assurance’</p>



<p>While the rate of passkey adoption to date has been nothing short of phenomenal, some organizations – particularly those in regulated industries – understandably want to see that key government bodies accept and recommend new technologies like passkeys before supporting them at scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have heard this from our partners and constituents across the globe about NIST in particular, whose digital identity guidelines are a global gold standard that are frequently cited by other countries. Today’s supplemental guidance from NIST stands to remove a critical barrier to passkey adoption, which now stands to be further accelerated.</p>



<p>However, there is still work to do. We are working closely with other agencies across the globe to educate them about passkeys and the importance of phishing-resistant authentication, and are encouraging them to update legacy policies, guidelines, and regulations to ultimately allow all organizations, wherever they are, to confidently provide more secure and more convenient authentication to their users and customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building NIST guidance into business best practices</p>



<p>Identity and authentication architects should contemplate NIST’s supplemental guidance as part of their broader digital identity strategy. For example, for every use case where password + OTP was used in the past, a synced passkey deployed in accordance with the new NIST guidance is not only sufficient to meet AAL2 requirements, but also more effective. In the vast majority of deployment scenarios, synced passkeys will provide a significant security and UX improvement over today’s authentication patterns – almost all of which are susceptible to phishing.</p>



<p>If organizations have specific business, regulatory, or other security requirements, they can choose whether to accept a synced passkey as the primary authentication method, a second factor, pair it with a risk engine, or require a device-bound key. Today’s guidance frees architects up from thinking about authentication layers and to instead focus on business requirements and related threat models. And today’s primary threat model of phishing and social engineering can be directly addressed by utilization of passkeys.</p>

<p></p>      MOBI and Gaia-X 4 moveID Web3 Interoperability Initiative           <p>Global Consortia Collaborate to Implement Trusted Self-Sovereign Identities and Verifiable Credentials for Vehicles and Batteries Enabling Circular Economy</p>
          <p>Los Angeles, 22 April 2024 — <a href="https://dlt.mobi/">MOBI</a> and <a href="https://www.gaia-x4futuremobility.de/en/projects/moveid">Gaia-X 4 moveID</a> proudly announce a joint initiative aimed to advance cross-industry interoperability. The initiative focuses on the joint implementation of two pioneering <a href="https://dlt.mobi/standards/">MOBI standards</a> — <a href="https://dlt.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MOBI-VID0002TS2024-Version-2.0.pdf">MOBI Vehicle Identity</a> (VID) and <a href="https://dlt.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2024/4/MOBI-BBC0001TS2024">MOBI Battery Birth Certificate</a> (BBC). More specifically, the initiative centers around linking physical objects — e.g., vehicles and their parts such as batteries — to Web3 digital identities and credentials. The goal is to demonstrate technical interoperability using <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) open-standards to establish a secure Self-Sovereign Data and Identities framework. The collaboration builds upon W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) to manage identities of vehicles and vehicle parts along with their credentials for transactions and claims, foundational for a circular economy.</p>
<p>Gaia-X 4 moveID is set to fundamentally reshape the landscape of mobility and vehicle services, fostering a unified digital ecosystem with <a href="https://www.51nodes.io/en/ssi-self-sovereign-identities/">Self-Sovereign Identities</a> (SSI) for all traffic participants. By crafting the essential technical and economic foundations, moveID is leading the charge toward a decentralized, user-focused mobility service ecosystem, leveraging SSI and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) alongside open-source software and standards. This pioneering ecosystem is designed to support a wide range of applications, including peer-to-peer parking and charging infrastructures, ensuring seamless data availability for smart mobility services, and creating open markets for data providers, AI applications, and mobility infrastructure services.</p>
<p>MOBI, a global nonprofit Web3 consortium, unites public and private sector efforts to create cross-industry interoperability through the creation of standards and building of critical infrastructure for Self-Sovereign Data (SSD), SSI, and verifiable transactions. This infrastructure comprises two federated networks: <a href="https://citopia.global/">Citopia</a>, a decentralized marketplace leveraging VCs, and the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/">Integrated Trust Network </a>(ITN), a DIDs Registry. Citopia and the ITN work together to deliver regulatory-compliant and standardized communication protocols for near-real-time transactions. Implemented in tandem, MOBI VID and MOBI BBC standards form the groundwork for a globally interoperable, open, and connected ecosystem; critical to unlocking a vast array of new applications for a resilient and circular economy.</p>
<p>Within the circular economy value chain, countless public and private stakeholders operate with distinct processes for managing sensitive business and consumer data. In complex, connected networks where trust incurs significant frictional costs, current centralized solutions are unable to provide adequate interoperability and extensibility needed to enable secure data exchange and authentication between stakeholders. The initiative will demonstrate the effectiveness of a Web3-enabled approach rooted in global standards by equipping vehicles and vehicle parts — such as batteries — with trusted self-sovereign identities for verifiable claims and transactions.</p>
<p>The initiative’s future potential is promising, with plans to explore standardized know-your-business (KYB) and know-your-customer (KYC) processes for Phase II. While Phase I focuses on testing technical interoperability, Phase II will involve testing business interoperability, a more complex endeavor that necessitates the creation of shared standards for the onboarding of consumers, businesses, and regulators’ trusted identities and credentials.</p>
<p>“A <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/bad-bots-account-for-73-of-internet-traffic-analysis/#:~:text=Bad%20Bots%20are%20increasing%20dramatically,%2C%20and%20in%2Dproduct%20abuse.">recent study</a> estimates that 73% of all internet traffic comprises bad bots and fraud farm traffic. Generative AI increases these risks dramatically. Today, approximately 20 billion IoT-connected devices lack trusted, verifiable identities and credentials, rendering them unable to securely engage in eCommerce,” said Tram Vo, MOBI CEO and Co-Founder. “With trusted and verifiable identities and claims, IoT devices — such as vehicles and batteries — can act as autonomous economic agents to securely share and authenticate data for every transaction, ensuring regulatory compliance and a higher degree of trust throughout the entire value chain.”</p>
<p>“A holistic, transparent system architecture for the exchange of data in road traffic which meets the new data sovereignty needs is not available today. There are individual companies that already offer services. But these services are tailored to specific applications, vehicles, or customer groups. With its open and EU compliant digital identity architecture, moveID helps to solve that challenge in the future markets,” explains Peter Busch, project manager at Gaia-X 4 moveID consortium lead Bosch.</p>

 Specifications 

<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/person/christophera@lifewithalacrity.com"></a></p>

<p>One of Blockchain Commons biggest priorities is producing interoperable specifications that can be used by principals in the digital asset &amp; identity field to create apps and hardware devices that support independence, privacy, resilience, and openness for users. In Q1, we worked to advance some of our specifications into true standards and also interacted with  standards being developed by the rest of the field.</p>

<p>dCBOR. Our <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/">Internet-Draft for Decentralized CBOR (dCBOR)</a> went through drafts 6, 7, and 8 this quarter. CBOR expert Carten Bormann joined us as a co-author and we continued to make tweaks based on expertise from the CBOR community, most recently revising how we defined leaves (“enclosed CBOR”). dCBOR is crucial for deterministic data formats such as <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a> because it ensures that data is always encoded in the same way, no matter when or where the encoding is done. We have high hopes that dCBOR will be an IETF standard soon.</p>

<p>Hashed Data Elision. We previously authored an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-envelope/">Internet-Draft for Gordian Envelope</a>, which we’ve continued to update in connection with our dCBOR updates. We’ve been getting less traction here, so we supplemented it this quarter with a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-appelcline-hashed-elision/">problem statement on Deterministic Hashed Data Elision Internet-Draft</a>. We also presented on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soI-j6LF4Xg">hashed data elision at IETF 119 Dispatch</a>. Our core premise was that privacy and human-rights needs are not well supported in IETF standards. We believe that hashed data elision (including Gordian Envelope) should be used as an easy method to address those needs. Unfortunately, the IETF hasn’t been strong on privacy concerns. Previous RFCs on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6973">Privacy</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6973">Humans Rights Considerations</a> are mere recommendations with no weight. The bottom line seems to be that unless an existing protocol expresses a desire for privacy standards, there’s no place for hashed data elision in the IETF, though the <a href="https://www.irtf.org/">IRTF</a>, which focuses on “Research” instead of “Engineering”, might be a home for it.</p>


<p><br><br></p>

<p>FROST. FROST, a <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">threshold scheme for Schnorr signatures</a>, originated with a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852">paper</a> in 2020. We’ve been looking forward to its deployment in wallets because of its improved resilience and privacy, plus other advantages such as being able to change thresholds offline. See <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">our FROST page</a> and <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Schnorr-Intro/">Layperson’s introduction to Schnorr</a> for some foundational info. In the last six months, we’ve been doing our share to help FROST become a reality. In Q4, we held an <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/">implementer’s round table</a> to allow people working on FROST to talk to each other. This quarter, one of those implementers, Jesse Posner, gave a presentation at our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCM8dDql6oo">most recent Gordian Developers meeting</a> to help to introduce developers to the powers of Schnorr and FROST. Dare we say: winter is coming? At least, FROST is.</p>

 Specification Docs 

<p><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/images/2024-Q1-Research.jpg">
    
</a></p>

<p>We want to make sure that our specifications are easily adaptable, especially to developers who might want to implement them. As a result, in Q1, we added two new implementation guides and revised how we flag the status of our specifications.</p>

<p>Multipart UR Implementation Guide. Multipart Uniform Resources (MURs) are Blockchain Commons’ biggest success because they allow for the interoperable and efficient creation of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/animated-qrs/">Animated QRs</a>. They’ve been adopted by over a dozen wallets, mainly to pass PSBTs, but they can also pass other large data sets over an <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/airgap/">airgap</a>: we’ve even <a href="https://youtu.be/t-GGZ9FyuT8">tested megabytes!</a> (video link). The pioneering MUR developers based their implementations on our reference code. This quarter we supplemented that with a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2024-001-multipart-ur.md">MUR Implementation Guide</a> that still focuses on our code, but offers explanations of how MURs work and precise instructions on how to make them work for you. Also see our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRYgEczhekg&amp;list=PLCkrqxOY1Fbp-P1Yv-7gmu75i2QS2Z6vk">January Gordian Developers Meeting</a> for a walk-through of the Implementation Guide.</p>

<p>Request &amp; Response Implementation Guide. The heart of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a> is its ability to elide information while still allowing both certification and verification of that data. That’s the Hashed Data Elision concept that we presented at IETF. However, Gordian Envelope has much more functionality than just hashed data elision, including literal functions, which can be used in a request-response system where one interoperable system asks for something and another provides it. Our request/response docs were spread across a variety of smaller docs such as the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-012-envelope-expression.md">Expressions Research doc</a> and our source code, so we conslidated it all into a single <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2024-004-request.md">Gordian Transport Protocol Implementation Guide</a>, which describes the layers that build up to GTP and how to do requests and responses with Gordian Envelope. As for why you might want to, our new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig-RR.md">Improving Multisigs with Request/Reponse</a> document presents an important case study on the usage of this system: it makes very difficult processes, like creating a multisig with multiple devices, much more accessiblem by reducing decision, research, and human-initiated actions, and thus much more likely to be used.</p>

<p>Updated Research List. All of our specifications can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/research/?tab=readme-ov-file#blockchain-commons-research">Research list</a>. Since we have specifications at a variety of levels of development, from pure investigation on our part to implementation by multiple partners, we introduced a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/research/?tab=readme-ov-file#status">status listing</a> that tells developers exactly how mature each specification is.</p>

 Reference Releases 

<p>Specifications are just one step in creating interoperability. We also produce reference apps and libraries that demonstrate how to use our specifications and how to incorporate best practices.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">
  
</a></p>

<p>Gordian SeedTool 1.6. Our top reference app has long been Gordian SeedTool, which demonstrates specifications like <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a>, <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">SSKR</a>, and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/">URs</a> as well as best practices for safe and resilient digital-asset holding. We’ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/releases/tag/releases%2Funiversal%2F1.6">version 1.6</a> for a long time, but it’s now finally out, through GitHub and the Apple App Store. It includes updates to our newest specifications, new best-practices for UIs, and integration of Tezos assets.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/releases/tag/v1.1.0">
  
</a></p>

<p>Gordian Server 1.1. Our oldest supported reference app is Gordian Server, a Macintosh app that installs, maintains, and run Bitcoin Core. It demonstrates our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/quickconnect/">Quick Connect</a> URI, but more importantly it shows off some of our architectural fundamentals, such as maintaining partitioned services that are separated from each other by a <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/torgap/">TorGap</a>. The new 1.1.0 release of Gordian Server updates for Apple’s native Arm64 (M1+) chips and also works with newer version of Bitcoin Core, up to and including the newly released <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/26.1/">Bitcoin Core 26.1</a>. It also contains a major update that’s been a few years coming that replaces the older RPC password files with the much more secure <code>rpcauth</code> system. (Thanks to Peter Denton for this update and check out his <a href="https://fonta1n3.github.io/FullyNoded/">Fully Noded</a> for a wallet that integrates with Gordian Server!)</p>

<p>Rust Crate Updates. Over recent quarters, we converted our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/libraries/">fundamental crypto libraries</a>  to Rust. We are continuing to keep them updated with our newest specifications and continuing to polish them, such as our recent work on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-rust"><code>bc-envelope-rust</code></a> to streamline the API and reduce calls to <code>clone()</code>.</p>

 Constrained Devices Research 

<p>Specifications, reference apps, and reference libraries represent some of our more mature work, but we’re also constantly researching other fields that might improve the management and usage of digital assets and identity online. One of our fields of research recently has been on constrained devices.</p>

<p>JavaCards. Could we hold assets or private keys on NFCs or JavaCards? We’ve discussed the topic at some of our recent Gordian meetings and have a <a href="https://signal.group/#CjQKIHy0JTnKLDSbMmtRXANQt4It6SwWTf65TXO-ZXtfV037EhBAYMV-y5nb7sxiEAJSBVC_">Signal group</a> dedicated to the topic, which you’re welcome to join. We’re hoping to do more with it in 2024.</p>

<p><code>no_std</code> in Rust. Our Rust crate for <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-dcbor-rust"><code>bc-dcbor-rust</code></a> now supports <a href="https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html"><code>no_std</code></a>. The <code>no_std</code> crate attribute allows Rust code to run on embedded systems and other constrained environments that don’t have access to the standard library. This means that dCBOR can now be used to serialize and deserialize data in firmware for IoT devices, microcontrollers, and smart cards. It’s another step forward in our support of constrained environments.</p>

 Provenance Research 

<p>How can you validate the provenance of data or identity? This is a natural expansion of our work with Gordian Envelope, which allows validation of data even when it’s been elided, so it’s been another source of research in the last quarter.</p>

<p><a href="https://c2pa.org/">
  
</a></p>

<p>C2PA. We have joined the <a href="https://c2pa.org/">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA</a>, which is focused on developing standards for certifying the provenance of media content. We’ve talked with them some about Gordian Envelope as a possible tool for this purpose.</p>

<p>Source-Code Provenance. We’ve long been thinking about source-code provenance and the validation of software developers, going back to our support for Joe Andrieu’s <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/final-documents/amira.pdf">Amira Use Case</a>, which grew out of <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">RWOT5</a>. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/blob/master/_pages/envelope-usecases-software.md">software release use cases</a> discuss many of the issues and how to resolve them with Gordian Envelope. More recently, we’ve been investigating SSH signing, which is now <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-23-ssh-commit-verification-now-supported/">supported at GitHub</a>. We’re working on a doc of best practices and also an SSH tool that will link up the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust"><code>envelope-cli</code></a> with <code>ssh-keygen</code>. We’ve got a working prototype and expect to be able to talk more about the project, and the issues with software-release provenance, next quarter.</p>

 Identity Research 

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9KuIlAg4wg"></a></p>

<p>Work on identity, ultimately stemming from Christopher Allen’s <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">“Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>, and continued work on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">VCs</a> at <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, was one of the things that got Blockchain Commons going in the first place. However, our partners and patrons have all been focused more on digital assets, so that’s where most of our work has been concentrated over the last five years. Nonetheless, we keep our foot in the identity pond, particularly for some of our <a href="https://advocacy.blockchaincommons.com/">Advocacy work</a>.</p>

<p>eIDAS Dangers. Late in 2023, Christopher published an article on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/eidas/">“The Dangers of eIDAS”</a>, which is Europe’s new European Digital Identity regulation. Unfortunately, besides having some deeply flawed security models, it also ignores many of the dangers of the past.</p>

<p>Identity Dangers. What are those dangers? That’s the topic of “Foremembrance”, a book that Christopher been working on for a few years that remembers how overidentification led to genocide during World War II. On March 27, which is Foremembrance Day, Christopher gave a talk on the topic on Twitter. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9KuIlAg4wg">YouTube video</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/blob/master/meetings/2024/03-27/foremembrance-presentation.pdf">presentation</a> are both available.</p>

 The Future 

<p>Many of these topics will continue onward, especially our more research-focused projects, such as our look at SSH signing and software provenance. We’re also hoping to do some major work with one or more of our partners to turn many of our specifications into deployed reality.</p>

<p>Our next Gordian Meeting, on May 1st, will have another feature presentation: Dan Gould will talk about <a href="https://payjoin.org/">PayJoin</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, our <a href="https://advocacy.blockchaincommons.com/">advocacy</a> is heating up again as the Wyoming legislature prepares for its meetings in May through September. We are engaged in discussions and early agenda setting with the co-chairs of the Wyoming Select Committe on Blockchain. We are hoping to see topics such as digital attestations from the Secretary of State, best practices for data minimization, and duties of care and best practices for digital identity on the agenda, as well as topics that we’ve pushed in the past such as Wyoming eResidency.</p>

 

<p>Blockchain Commons needs funding to continue its work as an architect for interoperable specifications and a central forum for their discussion because many of our funding sources dried up due to the economic conditions of recent years. If you’re a developer, please consider becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">Benefactor</a> to lend your name to our efforts, and if you’re a company, especially one using our work, please consider becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">Sustaining Sponsor</a>.  We’re also open to working with partners on special projects that are open-source and aligned with our objectives, or that accelerate the deployment of our specs in your products. If sponsorship or a special project interest you, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">drop us a line</a> for more information.</p>

<p>We have further been seeking grants to continue our work. If you have the inside track on any grants that you think would be well-aligned with our work, or just want to make suggestions, again <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">drop us a line</a>.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons is literally a commons: we are producing work that we hope is useful for the rest of the community, some of which is now widely deployed. But, the name might have been too apt, because the <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/tragedy-of-the-commons-impact-on-sustainability-issues">Tragedy of the Commons</a> has long said that public resources of this sort are depleted. Help us replenish our resources to make sure the Commons continues!</p>

		<p>EdgeCon Spring 2024<br>
Excelling in a Digital Teaching &amp; Learning Future<br>
</p>
<p>In partnership with The College of New Jersey (TCNJ), Edge hosted EdgeCon Spring on April 18 at TCNJ’s scenic campus in Ewing Township, New Jersey. With a theme of Excelling in a Digital Teaching &amp; Learning Future, the event was a big hit with attendees with 92% giving EdgeCon Spring “Excellent or Very Good” ratings and 100% responding “Definitely or Likely” to attend a future EdgeCon. Throughout the event, attendees had the opportunity to engage with a growing community of digital learning professionals while discovering innovative solutions to help their institutions solve today’s biggest digital learning challenges. The event also featured a keynote speaker, breakout sessions, and industry leading vendors from across the academic enterprise.</p>
<p>Exploring the Evolving AI Landscape<br>
The day’s events began with an exciting session entitled, AI and the New Era of Learning: How Higher Education Must Respond. Keynote speaker, C.

With this in mind, Watson drew from his new book, Teaching with AI: A Practical Guide to a New Era of Human Learning, to discuss concrete approaches and strategies higher education can adopt, both within the classroom and across larger curricular structures, to best prepare students for the life that awaits them after graduation.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>Promoting Genuine Student Engagement<br>
As AI becomes integrated into many aspects of our lives, there is a growing concern in higher education that students will use these tools to complete assignments. Ellen Farr, Assistant Director and Judi Cook, Executive Director of TCNJ’s Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, shared ways to creatively design assignments that promote genuine student engagement. Using these innovative strategies, an institution can modify their assessment approach, either using or limiting AI tool use to create captivating, challenging assignments that inspire authenticity and excitement in their students.</p>
<p>The Realities of Digital Learning &amp; Instructional Design Support<br>
Innovation in higher education is fueled by new approaches to instructional design and technology, partnered with advances in pedagogical theory and process. Unfortunately, many schools do not have the resources or budget to incorporate new digital learning strategies and cannot burden faculty and staff with additional tasks. Edge’s Joshua Gaul, Associate Vice President &amp; Chief Digital Learning Officer, demonstrated how EdgeLearn can help lessen the burden at a non-profit price and allow institutions to advance their online programming with ease.&nbsp;</p>

Technological advancements have made multimedia a main language for conveying information and knowledge. Cecily McKeown, Instructional Multimedia Specialist, Hudson County Community College, led a discussion on how multimedia learning environments tailored to the context can allow students to integrate and interpret relationships. With a goal of promoting learner-centered teaching, this theory can help students actively build new knowledge by experiencing and integrating new information with their prior knowledge. McKeown explored the concept of visual thinking by delving into the cognitive psychology behind media-based instructions and their role in humanizing digital learning and fostering stronger teacher-student relationships.</p>
<p>Keeping Up with GenAI at Montclair State University<br>
In January 2023, the instructional design team at Montclair State University began ideating a response to the advances in artificial intelligence, which broke headlines in late 2022. Since then, Instructional Technology and Design Services (ITDS) has produced a suite of web-based resources, workshops and training, and consultations to guide University faculty through discovery and exploration of GenAI to be leveraged pedagogically and mitigate misuse. Instructional Designers from Montclair State University, Joseph Yankus and Gina Policastro, shared their experience composing these resources, facilitating small and large-group faculty development, the lessons learned, and the goals for the upcoming year.</p>
<p>Tips for Accessible Digital Media<br>
From presentation slide decks and word-processed documents to PDFs and videos, these resources can be important tools for student learning. Ann Oro, Senior Instructional Designer, Seton Hall University, shared ten easy tips for improving the user experience of a course’s digital documents and discussed the importance of headings, alternative text for images, tables, accessibility checkers, lists, font selection and color, slide titles, saving files as PDFs, reading order, and captioning.</p>
<p>Implementing Dual Rubrics<br>
Simple Rubrics support learning by offering a checklist of expectations, a mechanism for delivering formative/summative evaluation, and a framework for learner reflection and self-remediation. Dual Rubrics go further to also support teaching by offering a means for making an inference about students’ mastery of learning outcomes/competencies. Karen Harris, Senior Instructional Designer and Assessment Specialist, Rutgers University, explored how implementing Dual Rubrics in the Canvas LMS, at the course or program level, can offer a data-driven opportunity to incorporate learning insights that support quality improvement in instructional effectiveness and curricular design.</p>

		 Announcing EdgeCon Spring 2024 Keynote Speaker 
<p>Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others, have had an astonishing impact on the ways we learn, work, and think over the past year.&nbsp; Initially, the concern for many in higher education was how students might use these tools to complete assignments; however, a much more complex and daunting challenge has emerged.&nbsp; A 2023 Goldman Sachs report analyzed tasks versus jobs and concluded that two-thirds of current occupations could be partially automated by AI. This doesn’t mean that two-thirds of jobs will be replaced by AI, though some positions will indeed be lost to the new technology; rather, most of our graduates will soon be asked to collaborate with AI to complete significant portions of their work each week.</p>
<p>Drawing from the presenter’s new book, Teaching with AI: A Practical Guide to a New Era of Human Learning (Johns Hopkins University Press), this keynote will explore the evolving AI landscape and detail the companion challenges and opportunities that are emerging for higher education.&nbsp; While academic integrity and AI detection will be discussed, the core focus of this keynote will be on concrete approaches and strategies higher education can adopt, both within the classroom and across larger curricular structures, to best prepare students for the life that awaits them after graduation.</p>

 Why do we need a Trust Spanning Protocol? 



<p>No one would question that the Internet has completely transformed the global information economy. It has become indispensable for connectivity and reliable content delivery. But as it has grown, so have the threats against it and the vexing challenges in deciding what to trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, AI is pushing those concerns into overdrive. A <a href="https://www.cyberark.com/press/cyberark-establishes-artificial-intelligence-center-of-excellence-to-combat-attacker-innovation-with-identity-security-innovation/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20recently%2Dpublished,cited%20as%20the%20%231%20concern.">2023 study by CyberArk</a> found that 93% of security professionals expect AI-enabled threats to affect their organization in 2023—with AI-powered malware cited as the #1 concern. No less an industry luminary than Marc Andreessen recently said that <a href="https://twitter.com/tsarnick/status/1775332956447674633">the war against detecting AI fakes was unwinnable</a>—our only solution was to find a way to “invert the problem” by being able to prove <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/">content authenticity</a>.</p>



<p>Why, after 30 years of steadily compounding security issues, does industry not yet have a fix? Why, with technologies like <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/dnssec-what-is-it-why-important-2019-03-05-en">DNSSEC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>, and industry bodies like <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA/Browser_Forum">CA/Browser Forum</a>, do we still have daily headlines about data breaches, ransomware attacks, identity theft, and malware infestations? Why, with the explosive interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence">generative AI</a>, are many experts more worried about it being used to attack us than to protect us?</p>



<p>The answer is the reason the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation</a> was founded four years ago. In short, authenticity, confidentiality, and metadata privacy features were never built into the core fabric of the Internet. To solve the root of this problem and not the symptoms, we need a next-generation trust layer on top of the existing Internet.</p>



<p>The heart of this layer is a protocol that is to digital trust what the Internet Protocol (IP) is to digital data. That is the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-tsp-specification">ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol</a> (TSP).</p>



 Where can I get a high-level overview of TSP? 



<p>First, start with <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">this blog post</a> we published in January 2023 when we launched the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force (TSPTF). It explains the overall purpose of the TSP and where it fits in the ToIP stack.</p>



<p>Second, read the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/08/31/mid-year-progress-report-on-the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">Mid-Year Progress Report on the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol</a>, published last August 2023 to summarize the seven pillars of the TSP design. With the exception of some terminology evolution, these seven pillars have not changed as we worked through multiple stages of Working Drafts over the past seven months.</p>



<p>Today we are pleased to announce the release of the first <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-tsp-specification">Implementers Draft</a>.</p>



 What does the Implementers Draft cover? 



<p>This table summarizes the 10 major sections of the specification:</p>



Verifiable Identifiers (VIDs)VIDs are the first of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/08/31/mid-year-progress-report-on-the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">seven pillars</a> — cryptographically-verifiable identifiers that provide technical trust in the TSP. Covers: why they are necessary, how they provide access to public keys and ToIP endpoint addresses, how they are verified, and how keys can be rotated.MessagesTSP is a message-based asynchronous communication protocol. Covers: message envelopes, payloads (confidential, non-confidential, headers), signatures, relationship setup and out-of-band introductions.Nested MessagesTSP messages can be nested one or two layers to achieve metadata privacy. Covers: payload nesting, nested relationship VIDs.Messages Routed through IntermediariesTSP messages can be routed through intermediaries for several reasons, e.g., asynchronous delivery, reliability, and performance. However the primary focus is metadata privacy protection. Covers: message routing, direct neighbor relationships, endpoint-to-endpoint (“tunneled”) messages, private VIDs, single intermediaries, two-or-more intermediaries.Multi-Recipient CommunicationsTSP messages may be sent to multiple recipients. Covers: multi-recipient lists and anycast intermediaries.Control Payload FieldsTSP messages can be multi-purpose, so rather than dedicated control messages, the specification defines control payloads. Covers: relationship formation (parallel, nested, third-party introductions), relationship events (key updates, routing info, and relationship cancellation).Cryptographic AlgorithmsThe authenticity and confidentiality properties of TSP relies on public/private key cryptography. Covers: public key signatures, public key authenticated encryption, encryption and decryption primitives, Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE), Libsodium Sealed Box.Serialization and EncodingTSP uses <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">Composable Event Streaming Representation</a> (CESR) for message serialization and encoding. CESR supports popular data encoding formats including JSON, CBOR, MsgPak, and others. Covers: envelope encoding, payload encoding (non-confidential, confidential, nested), signature encoding.TransportsTSP’s authenticity, confidentiality and metadata privacy properties are designed to be independent of the choice of transport protocol. Covers: transport service interface, transport mechanism examples.Appendix A: <br>Test Vectors(Still being completed) Test vectors for common use cases. Covers: direct mode messages, direct mode nested messages, routed model messages.



 How does TSP differ from other trust protocols? 



<p>Proposing a fundamental new Internet-scale protocol for digital trust is an ambitious undertaking. Why did the ToIP Foundation take this path? Let’s start by looking at related efforts in this area.</p>



 Related protocols 



<p>This table summaries other well-known protocols that address various facets of digital trust:</p>



OpenID Connect (OIDC)An authentication layer on top of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth#OAuth_2.0">OAuth 2.0</a> authorization framework specified by the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> as a RESTful HTTP API using JSON as a data format. Supports basic user profile information access; optionalYeahHighlight features include encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID providers, and session management.OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OID4VC)A family of protocols from the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">OpenID Connect Working Group</a> built on top of OIDC for issuance (OID4VCI) and presentation (OID4VP) of verifiable digital credentials, plus a wallet-based user authentication protocol (SIOP).DIDCommSpecified by the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm Working Group</a> of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF), DIDComm is a peer-to-peer secure messaging protocol in which the endpoints are specified by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> (decentralized identifiers).TLS (Transport Layer Security)A cryptographic protocol from the IETF best known for enabling secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> browser connections; also widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP. Provides security, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity through the use of X.509 digital certificates.MLS (Message Layer Security)Specified by the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/">MLS Working Group</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force">IETF</a>, MLS is a security layer for end-to-end encrypted messages in arbitrarily sized groups. Its security properties include message confidentiality, message integrity and authentication, membership authentication, asynchronicity, forward secrecy, post-compromise security, and scalability.RCS (Rich Communications Services)A text-based mobile messaging protocol specified by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSMA">GSMA</a> to replace SMS messages with a richer feature set including in-call multimedia. RCS does not natively support end-to-end encryption; Google added it using the Signal Protocol in their own implementation. Apple has said it will support RCS once GSMA standardizes end-to-end encryption.Signal ProtocolA non-federated cryptographic protocol specified by the <a href="https://signalfoundation.org/">Signal Foundation</a> that provides end-to-end encryption for voice and instant messaging conversations. The protocol combines the Double Ratchet Algorithm, prekeys, and a triple Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (3-DH) handshake.Matrix ProtocolAn application layer communication protocol for federated real-time communication specified by the <a href="https://matrix.org/about/">Matrix Foundation</a>, it provides HTTP APIs for securely distributing and persisting messages in JSON format over an open federation of servers. It can integrate with standard web services via WebRTC to facilitate browser-to-browser applications.DNSSECA suite of extension specifications from the IETF for securing data exchanged in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name System</a> (DNS). The protocol provides cryptographic authentication of data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality.ISO/IEC 14443-4:2018A half-duplex block transmission protocol designed for a contactless environment, it defines the activation and deactivation sequence of the protocol. It is intended for use with other parts of ISO/IEC 14443 and is applicable to proximity cards or objects of Type A and Type B.



 Related cryptographic data structures 



<p>Protocols are not the only ingredient required for Internet-scale digital trust. This table summarizes some of the standard cryptographic data structures that have been developed:</p>



X.509 digital certificatesAn ITU standard defining the format of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate">public key certificates</a> used in many Internet protocols, including TLS, as well as&nbsp; digital signatures. An X.509 certificate binds an identity (a hostname, or an organization, or an individual) to a public key using a digital signature. A certificate is signed either by a certificate authority (CA) or self-signed. X.509 also defines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list">certificate revocation lists</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification_path_validation_algorithm">certification path validation algorithm</a>.Encrypted/signed PDF filesPortable Document Format, originally developed by Adobe, became an ISO standard in 2008. A PDF file may be encrypted; PDF 2.0 defines 256-bit AES encryption as the standard but also defines how third parties can define their own encryption systems for PDF. ISO 32000-2 defines how PDF files may be digitally signed for secure authentication.Verifiable digital credentialsWith the emergence of digital wallets, multiple formats for cryptographically verifiable digital credentials have been developed, including the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a>; <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#!iso:std:69084:en">ISO mDL/mDOC</a>; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">IETF SD-JWTs</a>; <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/anoncreds">Hyperledger AnonCreds</a>; and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2024/03/21/authentic-chained-data-containers-acdc-task-force-announces-public-review/">ToIP Authentic Chained Data Container (ACDC)</a>.C2PA content credentialsThe <a href="https://c2pa.org/">C2PA</a> standards define a model for binding cryptographically verifiable provenance information to digital media content together with a model for evaluating the trustworthiness of that information.



 How and why is TSP different? 



<p>As the sections above show, many thousands of person-hours have been invested in protocols and cryptographic data structures designed to address the Internet’s multitude of security, confidentiality, and privacy issues. So why have the members of the ToIP Foundation spent four years developing TSP?</p>



<p>The fundamental reasons are summarized in this table:</p>



Minimalist design as a spanning layer for higher-layer protocolsThe single most important design goal for the TSP—and the biggest differentiator from the protocols listed above (with the possible exception of DIDComm)—is the critical role of a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050415042854/http://www.csd.uch.gr/~hy490-05/lectures/Clark_interoperation.htm">spanning layer</a> in a protocol stack. The reasons it must be “as simple as possible but no simpler” is explained at length in Principle #3 of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack</a>. The TSP does not include many of the features of the protocols above precisely because it is designed so those features can be provided in higher-level protocols. The benefit is that all of those higher-level protocols can be much simpler and more future-proof because they automatically inherit all the technical trust features achieved at the TSP layer.Decentralized peer-to-peer architectureBy building on HTTP and RESTful APIs, the OpenID family of protocols are inherently Web-centric (client/server). The TSP does not make that architectural assumption. Like the IP protocol, it can work between any two peers across any kind of network or software architecture.VIDs &amp; DIDsLike DIDComm, all TSP endpoints use cryptographically verifiable identifiers (VIDs) such as those defined by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) specification. VIDs not only support full decentralization, but they provide portability and cryptographic agility for lifetime relationship management.Public Key Authenticated Encryption and SignatureTSP combines modern Public Key Authenticated Encryption and Public Key Signature to provide the strongest protection against both key compromise impersonation and sender impersonation. This is achieved by using either IETF RFC9180 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9180/">HPKE</a> (Hypbrid Public Key Encryption) defined Auth Mode primitives, or HPKE Base Mode or Libsodium Sealed Box primitives enhanced with an <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2001/079">ESSR</a> (Encrypt Sender Sign Receiver) pattern.Payload agilityTSP uses the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">CESR</a> text-binary dual encoding format that supports composability of both text and binary primitives—including JSON, CBOR, and MsgPak—in the same message.Cryptographic agilityAnother key feature of <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">CESR</a> is code tables for all types of cryptographic primitives. For example, it can transmit any of the cryptographic data structures listed above. This enables TSP ecosystems to standardize on precise signature and encryption algorithms yet still evolve them over time.Transport independenceAlthough the name “Trust Over IP” suggests a dependence on the TCP/IP stack for transport, in fact a core design goal of TSP is to provide end-to-end authenticity, confidentiality, and metadata privacy entirely independent of the underlying transport protocol.



 What implementation projects have been announced? 



<p>In parallel with the first Implementers Draft, at next week’s <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> #38 we will be announcing the first two TSP implementation projects—each one led by one of the primary authors of the TSP specification:</p>



 
 A Rust open source implementation led by co-author Wenjing Chu is being proposed as a new project at the <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">OpenWallet Foundation</a> (OWF) sponsored by OWF Premier members Futurewei, Gen, and Accenture. 



 A Python open source implementation is being developed by co-author Sam Smith and his colleagues at the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust">Web of Trust GitHub community project</a>.

To use this version of ComposeDB, developers will have to upgrade their Ceramic server to v5.3, as it is not compatible with earlier versions of Ceramic. <br><br>This release included a few patches that enabled upgrading ComposeDB and Ceramic server independently. Depending on which versions of Ceramic and ComposeDB you have been initially running and whether or not you have been using deterministic documents, you should consider a few upgrade considerations. <br><br>Check out <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/breaking-change-notice-composedb-v0-7-is-out-upgrade-your-ceramic-server-to-v5-2/1531?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=ceramic_world3">this forum post</a> for more details and instructions on how to upgrade.    Ceramic roadmap update<br>Recently, we published our quarterly Ceramic roadmap update. Over the past few months, the core Ceramic team has been making strides in improving the Ceramic server performance, shipping ComposeDB features like SET account relation, and, most importantly, taking big steps towards enabling developers to create custom indexes by announcing the Data Feed API alpha release.<br>Check out the detailed roadmap overview <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/ceramic-roadmap-update-04-04-2024/1544?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=ceramic_world3">here</a>.    Build using ComposeDB's new SET account relation<br>Recently, we have added a new account relation to ComposeDB - SET account relation. It complements the&nbsp;<code>SINGLE</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>LIST</code>&nbsp;account relations by creating a new type of relation that must be unique per combination of user account (DID) and instance of a model. With SET account relation you can now implement features like "post likes" meaning that each user can "like" a post only once.<br><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/relations?ref=blog.ceramic.network#model-to-model?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=ceramic_world3">Check out the documentation</a> and start building using the SET account relation.

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, April 10, 2024 –</p>
<p>Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Assistant Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, Edge, and Ecosystem for Research Networking (ERN) Steering Committee member, is joining an esteemed group of scientific and cyberinfrastructure researchers at the Ecosystem for Research Networking (ERN) Summit 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ecosystem for Research Networking Summit provides the scientific and cyberinfrastructure research community an opportunity to come together and discuss ERN mission and accomplishments, hear from domain researchers and CI professionals at smaller institutions about the the successes and challenges related to leveraging local, regional, and national resources for projects, and learn about funding resources and partnership opportunities, as well as regional and national communities.</p>
<p>This year’s summit will be held April 11-12, 2024 at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center in Pittsburgh, PA. There will be open discussions and conversations on focus areas and policies as they pertain to areas of community interest including AI, quantum, Big Data, cybersecurity and protecting data, research instruments, workforce development, applications for ERN, education and training.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“As the co-chair of the ERN Broadening the Reach working group, gaining a better understanding of the advanced computing and resource requirements and how the ERN can support the needs of the smaller institutions, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and Minority Serving institutions is an important aspect of our mission. I am excited to learn from the community how the ERN can expand outreach and increase collaboration opportunities for broadening the reach and impact in support of the research community in the smaller-less resourced institutions.”</p>

		<p>Featuring a keynote speech titled Re-imagining American Innovation: Bridging the Gap to Unlock America’s Stranded Brilliance presented by Dr. James Martin, NSF Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering Committee member, and Vice Chancellor for STEM Research and Innovation at the University of Pittsburgh, the two-day summit will also include domain researchers and CI professionals at smaller institutions about the successes and challenges related to leveraging&nbsp; local, regional, and national resources for projects, and learn about funding resources and partnership opportunities, as well as regional and national communities. In addition to representation from small schools, HBCU’s, and MSI’s, we are grateful to National Science Foundation ( NSF) colleagues who will also be in attendance, providing opportunities for interaction between attendees and the NSF program directors. The full Summit agenda is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sQif6TaQmB8wEFprHWWn26NU_fFXK6Xd/edit">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>Elaborates Dr. Barr von Oehsen, Director of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, “Scientific discoveries have always been driven by advances in instruments of observation. Today, experimental tools are more advanced and more costly to construct and maintain, and the interpretation and simulation of data is more dependent on the use of cutting-edge computing resources, services, and knowledge. Consequently, many academic institutions lack access to these facilities. Our aim is to democratize access to research instruments, and the ERN Summit provides a platform for devising strategies to achieve this objective.”</p>

 Unpacking the foundations of Verifiable Credentials Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Did you ever consider that looking at a tree only reveals half of its story? Much like a tree’s roots, which stretch as a wide and deep as its branches, the visible aspect of technology barely scratches the&nbsp;surface.</p><p>In this post, we’re going to look at the the underpinnings to technologies such as microcredentials, particularly those based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a>. We share two crucial insights: the importance of understanding the ideological foundations we use, and how seemingly-similar technologies can differ significantly beneath the&nbsp;surface.</p><p>The old adage ‘technology is not neutral’ may be true but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Technologies achieve widespread use do so because of rich, complex backgrounds.</p> The Role of Standards <p>In our everyday lives, we interact seamlessly with technologies that allow us to pay for a coffee with our smartphones using Apple or Google Wallet. We scan QR codes to find a link to websites. We use digital boarding&nbsp;passes.</p><p>All of these examples are built upon standards — agreements on how technologies should operate, which are developed collaboratively by individuals and organisations. These people either have a deep interest in the topic, work on it professionally, or&nbsp;both!</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>The aim behind Verifiable Credentials is for them to be integrated into society to the same extent as payment methods and boarding passes. The difference is that they help us prove our identity and our achievements.</p><p>As we highlighted in a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-to-find-the-right-mental-models-for-your-audience-c68097a7f0ed">previous post</a>, standards ensure consistency:</p><blockquote>A standard can be just the usual way of doing something. A standard can also be a reference to make sure things can be understood in the same way, no matter where or what is referencing the standard.</blockquote><blockquote>For example a kilogram in France is the same as kilogram in Germany, and a kilogram of feathers weighs the same as a kilogram of bricks. The kilogram is the standard, but where it is applied or what it is used for is up to whoever is using&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>This consistency is of critical importance for credentials to remain valid and recognised, long outliving the organisations that initially adopt&nbsp;them.</p> Community Interaction <p>Standards don’t spontaneously arrive, but are rather the fruits of community interaction. This collaboration happens in formal settings such as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> or the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a>, or through more informal groups, as was the case with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a>. The latter laid the foundation for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a> apps such as <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>.</p><p>The drive to develop Verifiable Credentials has been fueled by various needs, from decentralising proof of identity, to enable the issuing of trusted documents such as passports and degrees at scale. There are also those who looking to Verifiable Credentials to finally deliver on the dream of <a href="https://badges.community">Open Recognition</a>.</p><p>Diversity within communities developing standards is vital. Without a range of perspectives, there is the risk that the resulting technologies serve only a fraction of its potential users. When we’re talking about proof of identity and achievement, this is an important consideration.</p> The Importance of&nbsp;Ideology <p>Ideologies shape the vision and goals of a community, and encompass systems of beliefs and values. In the context of Verifiable Credentials, ‘Open’ (or openness) is a key ideology. This is not just in the sense of Open Source code but in terms of broader principles around transparency, inclusivity, adapability, collaboration, and the importance of community.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Going back to the tree analogy at the top of this post, a microcredential issued using the Verifiable Credentials standard is deeply rooted in community consensus and open standards. This contrasts with other credentialing methods which may use proprietary technologies, lack adherence to standards, and ignore the broader ethos of openness.</p><p>So, to embrace the full potential of technologies built on Verifiable Credentials, we need to dig beneath the surface. We must understand and appreciate that complex supporting structure of community, standards, and ideology. This understanding helps guide us towards contributing to a more just, inclusive, secure, and adaptable digital ecosystem.</p> Conclusion <p>In examining the foundations of Verifiable Credentials, we uncover a complex blend of ideology, standards, and community collaboration. These core elements go beyond mere technical specifications, and help define the technology’s purpose and potential.</p><p>As we explore the underlying principles of technologies such as microcredentials, it’s evident that our interaction with these technologies should extend deeper than their surface-level function. Embracing values of openness, inclusivity, and collective effort, we can contribute to a digital landscape that safeguards individual rights while promoting innovation and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>We all need to dig deeper, explore the ideological foundations, understand the importance of standards, and actively participate in the communities that build our world. <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact">Reach out to us</a> and let’s work together to help steer towards a future where digital credentials support and empower everyone.</p><p><a href="https://dajbelshaw.medium.com/">Doug Belshaw</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@LauraHilliger">Laura Hilliger</a> collaborated closely, as they tend to do, on this&nbsp;post.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">Examining the Roots</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Using a design workshop to jump start your&nbsp;CoP <p>At the end of the month, we’ll be gathering a number of community-based organisations, interns and faculty in an online design workshop to jump start a Community of Practice together with Cal State University and <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a>. This community, supported through the <a href="https://www.internetforall.gov/funding-recipients/california-state-university-dominguez-hills">Internet for All</a> programme, will provide an online space for those promoting access and training in digital technologies in the CSUDH community.</p><p>We know that building a thriving and supportive online community requires some deliberate efforts. In this blog post, we explore the idea of a “minimum viable community of practice” (MVCoP). Once again, we dive into our Architecture of Participation (AoP) framework, and discuss running design workshops to empower individuals to co-design their community.</p>header in the budding CoP on <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a> What is a&nbsp;MVCoP? cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Let’s start with the value of a Community of Practice. Communities of Practice (CoPs) are important for people to network, share knowledge, and learn from each other. They play a vital role in supporting lifelong learning and helping people level up throughout their careers. By connecting with like-minded peers who share similar interests and expertise, people can tap into a vast pool of collective wisdom and experience. Through active participation in discussions, collaborative projects, and sharing of best practices, community members continuously learn from each other, gaining new insights, perspectives, and opportunities.</p><p>Communities of practice not only foster professional growth but also create opportunities for personal development, encouraging individuals to stay curious, adapt to change, and embrace a lifelong learning mindset. We develop real relationships in these communities, and we learn about belonging and acceptance.</p><p>But before all of that, we have to design spaces that are supportive, interesting, engaging and inclusive. This takes intention. A MVCoP is a community set up to encourage organic and collaborative growth and belonging.</p> The Bare Minimum&nbsp;AoP AoP from&nbsp;WAO<p>We’ve written extensively about one of the tools, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop">the Architecture of Participation (AoP)</a>, that we use to help us build thoughtful, inclusive and empowering communities. Briefly, because we really have written about this all over the internet, the AoP is 8 steps to help people cover all their bases when thinking about volunteering, contributing and facilitating communities.</p><p>But what are the key steps for building a Minimum Viable Community of Practice? Well, we think that the most important to start with&nbsp;are:</p>  Ways of working openly — Even at the very beginning, people need to see what’s happening within the community and how they can get involved. The open principles of transparency, inclusivity, collaboration and adaptability underpin community. Does the project have secret areas, or is everything out in the&nbsp;open?  Backchannels and watercoolers — We need places to share memes, make jokes and chat about the weather. These evolve organically, but including them in your MVCoP design suggests understanding of the social dynamics within groups of people. Are there ‘social’ spaces for members of the project to interact over and above those focused on project&nbsp;aims?  Celebration of milestones — Building a space where people belong means thinking of them as, you know, people. We need motivation and recognition. Does the MVCoP recognise the efforts and input of the community members?   Empowering Co-Design cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Running a design workshop is a great way to empower co-design within a community. By bringing together individuals with diverse perspectives, skills, and experiences, a design workshop creates a collaborative space where participants can actively contribute to shaping the emerging community.</p><p>We facilitate such workshops to encourage open dialogue, brainstorming, and hands-on activities. We aim to help people feel a sense of ownership and engagement because, after all, this is a community. This inclusive approach means that we can work together on the community’s mission, invitations and onboarding. Our intentions and goals are co-created and reflect the collective aspirations and needs of the&nbsp;group.</p><p>By actively involving community members in the design process, a design workshop not only strengthens the sense of belonging but also ensures that the resulting community is truly representative of its members’ interests, resulting in a more vibrant and sustainable community of practice.</p> Conclusion <p>Building a minimum viable community of practice (MVCoP) is a dynamic and iterative process that requires active involvement from community members. Empowering people to co-design their community will help that community evolve. The journey to a thriving community starts with small steps, but with dedication and collective effort, it can lead to a flourishing network of professionals supporting each other’s growth and&nbsp;success.</p><p>Need some community help?

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">Trust Registry Task Force</a> (TRTF) at the Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation has released a new version of its ToIP <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-trust-registry-protocol/">Trust Registry Protocol Specification</a> as an Implementers Draft. This draft aims to elicit open public feedback from implementers of any type of online registry service or client software. Instructions for providing feedback are at the end of this post.</p>



 Background 



<p>The TRTF was established in the summer of 2021 in response to the sudden demand for cross-jurisdiction verification of digital health credentials during the COVID crisis. In the fall of 2021, the TRTF produced a preliminary version of the ToIP Trust Registry Protocol Specification to begin public experimentation with the protocol.</p>



<p>As the adoption of digital wallets and verifiable digital credentials has grown, so has the challenge for relying parties to verify the authorized issuers of those credentials. The same applies to credential holders, who need to judge which relying parties they can safely trust with their credential data.</p>



<p>These digital trust decisions are complicated—in both directions. To make them more accessible, participants need trusted sources of information. That’s the job of trust registries. A trust registry is a system of record that contains answers to questions that help drive trust decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of these systems of record already exist. For example, almost any legal jurisdiction has a method of registering and licensing all types of businesses and professionals (CPAs, lawyers, doctors, professional engineers, etc.) And there are hundreds of registries of accredited institutions—universities, hospitals, insurance companies, nursing homes, etc.</p>



<p>New trust registries are also emerging for new online communities, including social networks, blockchains, and peer-to-peer networks. The challenge is that the methods of accessing the information across all these different registries are wildly inconsistent—if such information is available online.</p>



 The Trust Registry Protocol V2.0 



<p>The ToIP Trust Registry Protocol (TRP) V2.0 aims to solve this problem by providing a simple and consistent way to discover who is authorized to do what within a specific digital trust ecosystem. In short, it enables parties to ask programmatically:</p>



<p>Does entity X hold authorization Y under ecosystem governance framework Z?</p>



<p>In addition to that core query type, the TRP V2 also supports queries to:</p>



 
 Assist integrators in retrieving information critical to interacting with the trust registry (e.g. get a list of supported authorizations, namespaces, or resources). 



 Assert the relationships of the queried trust registry with other trust registries, allowing the development of a registry-of-registries capability. 
 



<p>Currently, in this Implementers Draft stage, this question can be asked via a RESTful (OpenAPI Specification 3.1.0) protocol query. Future versions of the TRP may support other underlying protocol specifications (e.g. DIDComm co-protocols, ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is important to note that in V2, the TRP does not manage information inside the trust registry (i.e., the system-of-record). It is a read-only query protocol. Create, update, or delete operations may be specified in future protocol versions if demand exists.</p>



<p>To be clear, a trust registry does not create trust in itself. Your decision to trust the outputs from a trust registry is entirely yours. However, the information provided by trust registries is often required to build trust—especially between parties with no previous relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A trust registry does not create authority. The authority of a trust registry is an outcome of governance.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;– <a href="mailto:Jacques.Latour@cira.ca">Jacques Latour</a>, CTO, CIRA.ca (.ca top-level domain registry)</p>



 How to Provide Feedback 



<p>We invite feedback from implementers: systems integrators, developers, and product leaders who either need to share or access the information necessary to facilitate digital trust decisions within their ecosystem.</p>

<p>ToIP invites the public to comment on their newly released document, Issuers Requirements Guide for Governance Framework of Verifiable Credentials.</p>



<p>The mission of the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation is to define a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust that combines cryptographic assurance at the machine layer with human accountability at the business, legal, and social layers.&nbsp; Part of that mission is to define generally accepted requirements for standard roles that play a critical part in accountability for digital trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Governance Stack Working Group has completed a new deliverable, the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Issuer-Requirements-Guide-V0.01-2024-01-30.pdf">Issuer Requirements Guide for Governance Frameworks of Verifiable Credentials (PDF)</a> and is soliciting public comment using our <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/public-review-process/">public review process</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/PDF-Deliverable-Review/issues/new/choose">this GitHub link</a>. While many schemes in the US, UK and Canada have focused on elements of identity credential issuance and verification, this is the first effort to define standard requirements for issuers of verifiable credential to ensure that their processes are transparent and consistent and meet the needs of relying parties and ecosystem governing bodies.</p>



<p>Verifiable credential ecosystems require both technical trust and human trust where the core requirements for the corresponding issuance processes are captured in this newly released document being circulated for public review and comment. Verifiable credentials are a type of digital representation of claims or attributes about a subject, which can be an individual, organization, or thing. These credentials are tamper-evident, cryptographically secure, and can be verified by relying parties without the need for a central authority.</p>



<p>The Governance requirements of an issuer in a verifiable credential ecosystem can be summarized as follows:</p>



 
 Issuance of Credentials: The issuer is responsible for creating and issuing verifiable credentials to subjects based on certain claims or attributes. These credentials are digitally signed by the issuer using their private key, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the information. 



 Trust and Reputation: The issuer’s reputation and trustworthiness are crucial in the verifiable credential ecosystem. Relying parties (such as service providers or verifiers) rely on the credentials being issued by reputable and trusted issuers. The credibility of the issuer is established through various mechanisms, such as being a well-known organization, being part of a recognized authority, or holding themselves accountable to the requirements of a governing authority. 



 Validation of Claims: Before issuing credentials, the issuer does its due diligence to validate the claims made in the credential. This validation process ensures that the information presented in the credential is accurate and can be trusted by relying parties. 



 Verification of Issuer and Holder: Issued credentials that contain links to the issuer and/or holder should be engineered so they can be cryptographically verified. 



 Privacy Considerations: Issuers need to handle personal data responsibly and in compliance with privacy regulations. They should only collect and use the minimum necessary data required to issue the credentials and should obtain explicit consent from the subjects. 



 Revocation and Expiry: For credentials that require expiration or revocation, issuers must have mechanisms in place to revoke or expire credentials if the claims become invalid or if the credentials are compromised. This is essential to maintain the trustworthiness of the digital trust ecosystem. 



 Interoperability: Issuers need to follow standardized formats and protocols to ensure that the issued credentials are interoperable and can be easily understood and verified by different relying parties. 



 Auditability and Accountability: Issuers should keep records of issued credentials for audit purposes, &nbsp;lifecycle maintenance, including updates to claims, or re-issuance for any reason and revocation. This enables traceability and accountability in case of disputes or issues with the credentials. 



 Transparency: The issuer should publicly disclose all the policies it follows in the process of claim and credential issuance and revocation. This disclosure should be included in a publicly available governance framework.

<p>On a scale of one to ten, how do you rate the&nbsp; <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=customer+experience+management">Customer Experience Management</a> (CEM) business?</p>
<p>I give it a zero.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that every service comes with a bonus survey—one you answer on a phone or fill out on a Web page? And that every one of those surveys is about rating the poor soul you spoke to or chatted with, rather than the company’s own crappy CEM system?</p>
<p>I always say yes to the question “Was your problem resolved?” because I know the human I spoke to will be punished if I say no.&nbsp; Saying yes to that question complies with <a href="https://twitter.com/dmarti/status/1702719520790479099">Don Marti</a>‘s tweeted advice: “5 stars for everyone always—never betray a human to the machines.”</p>
<p>The main problem with CEM is that it’s all about getting service to scale across populations by faking interest in human contact. You can see it all through McKinsey’s <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/the-ceo-guide-to-customer-experience">The CEO Guide to Customer Experience</a>. The customer is always on a “journey” through which a company has “touchpoints.”</p>
<p>Oh please.</p>
<p><a href="https://iuhealth.org/">IU Health</a>, my primary provider of health services, does a good job on the whole, but one downside is the phone survey that follows up seemingly every interaction I have with a doctor or an assistant of some kind. The survey is always from a robot that says it “will only take a few minutes.” I haven’t counted, but I am sure some of those surveys last longer than the interaction I had with the human who provided the service: an annoyingly looooong touchpoint.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2007/06/13/why-surveys-suck/">Why Surveys Suck</a> here, way back in 2007. In it, I wrote,&nbsp; “One way we can gauge the success of VRM is by watching the number of surveys decline.”</p>
<p>Makes me cringe a bit, but I think it’s still true.</p>

<p>By: FIDO staff</p>



<p>Passkeys hold the promise of enabling simpler, strong authentication. But first organizations, governments and individuals will have to adopt the technology – and some of them have questions.</p>



<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit: Demystifying Passkey Implementation on March 13, speakers from the FIDO Alliance, Intercede, IDEMIA, Yubico, Dashlane and 1Password as well as implementers including Amazon and Target, presented on their experiences implementing and working with passkeys. The virtual summit covered the technical perspective on passkeys from the FIDO Alliance, as well as use cases for passkeys in the enterprise, consumer authentication, and the U.S. government. Along the way, attendees asked lots of questions and got lots of insightful answers.</p>







<p>Fundamentally a key theme that resonated throughout the virtual summit was that passkeys are a password replacement – and it’s a replacement that can’t come soon enough.</p>



<p>“Passwords are still the primary way for logging on and they are still easily phished through social engineering and they tend to be very difficult to use and to maintain,” David Turner, senior director of standards development at the FIDO Alliance said. “The consequences are real and the impact is real to the world at large.”</p>



 Passkeys 101 



<p>During his session, Turner provided a high-level overview on what passkeys are and how they work.</p>







<p>Passkeys build upon existing FIDO authentication protocols and simplify the user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys can now be synchronized across devices through the use of passkey providers, removing the need for separate credentials on each device. Passkeys also enable new capabilities like cross-device authentication. Turner demonstrated how a QR code scanned on one device can securely connect to credentials stored on another nearby device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to synced passkeys there are also device-bound passkeys, that rely on technologies like a security key to provide the required credentials.</p>



 The State of Passkeys 



<p>The current and future state of passkey adoption was the topic tackled by</p>



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance.</p>



<p>There are now hundreds of services, including the major platform vendors Microsoft, Apple and Google, representing billions of users, that support passkeys at this point in 2024.</p>







<p>“If you are a service provider and you wish to deploy passkeys, you can do so with high confidence that your consumers will be able to leverage them,” he said.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance aims to drive passkey support over the coming years, in part by sharing best practices and success stories, which is a core part of what the virtual summit was all about.</p>



<p>Usability was emphasized as a key factor for widespread adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Usability is paramount. It must be front and center in what you do,” said Shikiar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance has released user experience guidelines and a design system to help companies implement passkeys in a user-friendly way. Future guidelines will address additional use cases. </p>







<p></p>



<p>Shikiar emphasized that passkeys are not about being a new addition to improve the security of passwords. His expectation is that passkeys will be seen as a true password replacement rather than just an attempt at bolstering existing authentication methods. He emphasized that the fundamental problem is passwords, and the goal should be replacing them, not just adding extra security layers on top of passwords. Shikiar wants people to stop thinking about multi-factor authentication factors and instead think about enabling phishing resistant identities.&nbsp;</p>



 Passkeys are on Target at Target 



<p>Passkeys are already in use at retail giant Target, helping to improve security and optimize authentication for its employees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tom Sheffield, senior director cybersecurity at Target, said that the company has been leveraging FIDO for workforce authentication since 2018 and adopted it as a primary authenticator in 2021.</p>







<p>One of the ways that Target has been able to more easily enable passkey support across its platforms is via Single Sign On (SSO).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have a very robust SSO environment across our web application suite,” Sheffield said. “So for us, that made it very easy to integrate FIDO into the SSO platform, and then therefore every application behind SSO automatically got the benefit of it.”</p>



<p>In terms of how Target was able to get its users to adopt passkeys quickly, Sheffield said that the option was communicated to users in the login flow, rather than trying to explain to users what they should do in an email.</p>



<p>Overall, Sheffield emphasized that if an organization is using OTP (one time passwords) today for multi-factor authentication (MFA), any form of FIDO will provide significantly better user experience and security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There have not been many security programs that I’ve been part of in my 25-year career in this space that offer you security and user experience simultaneously,” he said. “So if you’re using anything other than FIDO you’ve got a great opportunity to up your game and provide a great experience for users which should make you a hero.”</p>



 Authenticating a Billion Customers with Passkeys at Amazon 



<p>Among the biggest consumer-facing websites that supports passkeys today is online giant Amazon.</p>







<p>Yash Patodia, senior manager of product management at Amazon, detailed how passkeys were rolled out to hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide. Patodia explained Amazon’s motivation noting that passwords are relatively easy for a bad actor to crack. He noted that passkeys help customers to authenticate more easily than other methods with a better user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amazon implemented passkeys using different APIs for web, iOS, and Android platforms. Now available across devices, Amazon’s goal is to drive awareness and increase passkey adoption among its customer base over the next year. In his view, passkeys are well suited for mass adoption and early indications from Amazon’s user base are very encouraging.</p>



<p>“If you’re a consumer facing company who has a big customer base, definitely explore this option,” he said.</p>



 Considerations for FIDO and Passkeys in the US Government&nbsp; 



<p>The U.S. Government is no stranger to the world of strong authentication, with many staffers already using PIV (Personal Identity Verification) smart card credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teresa Wu from IDEMIA and Joe Scalone from Yubico, who both serve on the FIDO Alliance’s Government Deployment Working Group (GDWG), provided an overview of how passkeys can complement PIV credentials and support a zero trust security model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As government agencies work to implement phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication, passkeys are an option that could provide a more seamless user experience than one-time passwords or hardware tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are not here to replace PIV, we are here to supplement and use FIDO where PIV is not covered,” said Wu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One area they see opportunities for FIDO is for federal contractors and employees who are not eligible for a PIV card due to their job functions. Currently these individuals rely on passwords for system access.</p>







<p></p>



 State of Passkey Portability Set to Improve 



<p>A critical aspect of user experience is the ability to change passkey providers and move from one provider to another, if that’s what the user wants to do.</p>



<p>With existing password managers and legacy passwords, the process of moving credentials isn’t particularly efficient or secure, according to Rew Islam from Dashlane and Nick Steele from 1Password. It’s a situation that the Credential Provider Special Interest Group within the FIDO Alliance is looking to solve with a new standard for securely porting passwords between different password/passkey management applications.</p>



<p>The group is developing a new Credential Exchange Protocol that will use hybrid public key encryption to securely transfer credentials; the effort also includes the development of a standardized data format for credential information.</p>



<p>“By having the standard credential format, it will allow for interoperability of sharing credentials between two different providers in different organizations,” Steele said.</p>



<p>A proof of concept demo for the credential exchange is currently set for May, during the FIDO Member Plenary in Osaka, Japan. Islam noted that the effort represents a real triumph for the power of FIDO to bring different competitive vendors together for common purpose.</p>



 Common Questions about Passkeys&nbsp; 



<p>The virtual summit was concluded with an ‘Ask Me Anything’ (AMA) session where attendees asked their most pressing questions on passkeys.</p>



<p>Among the big questions asked:</p>



<p>How should organizations consider choosing synced passkeys or device-bound passkeys from a security and usability perspective?</p>



<p>Turner answered that the first thing to make really clear is that synced passkeys are probably the right answer for the majority of use cases. That said, he noted that FIDO recognizes that there are some areas where people have a much higher risk profile, and in those cases the device- bound passkeys can provide an extra level of trust.</p>



<p>Can passkeys play a role in transaction signing?</p>



<p>Pedro Martinez from Thales responded that yes, passkeys can be used to sign transactions. He explained that the beauty of the FIDO protocol is that it is based on the signature of a challenge. As such, it’s possible to adjust the challenge in order to contain data related to a transaction that needs to be digitally signed.</p>



<p>When will passkeys be the default mode of authentication?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar said that he doesn’t think that all passwords will go away, but he is hopeful for a passwordless future.</p>



<p>“Sophisticated risk engines and anomaly detectors don’t really think twice about accepting a password,” he said. “But as passkeys become more prevalent and become the default all of a sudden using a password will be anomalous in and of itself.and I think that’s when we’ll be in the fabulous future when using a password is rightfully seen as a high risk and anomalous action.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON,&nbsp;March 22, 2024&nbsp;/PRNewswire/ — World Identity Network (WIN), the leading nonprofit organization advocating for universal identity rights, has released its groundbreaking documentary, Shadows in the Dark: Our Global Identity Crisis, exclusively on Amazon.</p>



<p>“Releasing this film to the public is a moment of great triumph for our organization,”&nbsp;says WIN Founder and CEO,&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Mariana Dahan. “We spent years interviewing undocumented persons and refugees. Telling their stories with the utmost care, precision, and nuance was a tremendous responsibility, and we could not be happier with the final result.”</p>



<p>Shadows in the Dark&nbsp;is a sprawling saga following the stories of undocumented individuals across&nbsp;the United States, the&nbsp;Middle East, and refugee camps in&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;and beyond. The documentary shines a light on those born in the shadows of the formal economy, at the margins of society, lacking common identity documents, such as birth certificates and passports.</p>



<p>The movie highlights the work that Dr.&nbsp;Mariana Dahan&nbsp;has conducted at The World Bank, as the initiator and first global coordinator of the Identification for Development (ID4D) agenda, which celebrates its 10-years anniversary this year.&nbsp;Shadows in the Dark&nbsp;offers a compelling analysis of the successes and the risks associated with this multi-billion dollars program.</p>



<p>The Emmy Award – winning film crew has interviewed decision-makers, technologists and human rights activists, advocating for universal identification and responsible use of digital technologies, such as biometrics, facial recognition and AI.</p>



<p>“Identity is at the heart of many of today’s global challenges,” says&nbsp;Shadows in the Dark Co-director,&nbsp;Brad Kremer. “It is the common thread in immigration and many of the conflict zones existing throughout the world. When Dr.&nbsp;Mariana Dahan&nbsp;approached me to do this film together, I knew it would be a journey of immense meaning. But directing this narration, and telling the stories of everyone this issue impacts, has exceeded all our expectations.”</p>



<p>Produced in partnership with the&nbsp;United Nations, the&nbsp;Human Rights Foundation&nbsp;and&nbsp;Singularity University,&nbsp;Shadows in the Dark&nbsp;features extensive interviews with displaced Ukrainian and Syrian refugees recounting their experiences with the asylum process, along with leading officials at the World Bank and the United Nations, and the founders building new digital identity solutions. The film likewise explores nuances surrounding surveillance, authoritarian regimes, and biometric systems, as well as a dialogue with a group of far-right border advocates in the United States.</p>



<p>“In many ways, this film is a culmination of my life’s work,”&nbsp;continues Dr. Dahan. “Having been born without a birth certificate in Soviet-era&nbsp;Moldova, at the border with&nbsp;Ukraine, I know firsthand how crucial identity is to the preservation of human rights. I encourage everyone to watch the film and learn more about this global issue impacting millions. Identity is the cornerstone of human civilization”.</p>

<p>With over 83% of organisations currently using MFA, the shift away from password-dependency is clear. However, the report indicates a slower but growing implementation of Zero Trust architectures, currently in place in up to 16% of larger organisations. The development of standards like FIDO heralds a move toward more secure authentication options.</p>

     <p>To enhance the Swiss e-ID framework with selective disclosure while ensuring unlinkability, it’s imperative to incorporate advanced digital signature technologies such as BBS+ signatures. These technologies not only fortify the security of digital credentials but also significantly enhance user privacy. Such capabilities are crucial in minimizing the risk of personal data exposure and ensuring that users retain control over their information. It’s essential to continuously align our Trust Infrastructure with international cryptographic standards while remaining adaptable to emerging norms. This approach will facilitate interoperability across borders and sectors, ensuring that e-ID systems are both secure and universally recognized.</p>
<p>The parallel signatures model involves attaching multiple digital signatures to a single document or payload, with each signature providing different security or privacy features. This approach allows for a flexible and robust security framework, accommodating various cryptographic standards and privacy needs without compromising the integrity of the original document. It’s particularly useful in environments requiring adherence to diverse regulatory standards or in scenarios where resilience and both, high security and privacy are paramount. Cryptographic layering supports adaptiveness by incorporating multiple layers of cryptographic techniques within a system. This approach allows for the seamless integration and removal of cryptographic methods as needed by the Trust Ecosystem governance, enabling the system to adapt to evolving security threats and advancements in cryptographic research. It ensures long-term resilience and flexibility, allowing systems to maintain security without complete overhauls. Applying cryptographic schemes always mandates careful handling of private keys. Preventing their exposure is vital, even more so when using advanced schemes supporting derivative keys, as possible with BBS+. This underscores the need for strict security measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the system’s integrity.</p>
<p>Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) represent a proven strategic model to operationalize digital trust and -identity solutions, combining public oversight with private sector efficiency and innovation. Such partnerships should be structured to encourage shared investment and risk, with a clear focus on public interest, global standards and local governance, protection of digital sovereignty and value-based adoption. These initiatives should be complemented by ongoing research into cryptographic innovations, preparing the ground for future advancements in e-ID security and privacy.</p>
<p>To address the challenges comprehensively and to build a continuously improving framework that is not only secure and compliant but also resilient and forward-looking, we must evaluate to invest in an independent body that accompanies the further progress in technology, governance and supports public and private sector adoption – to benefit from the opportunities of a trusted digital economy in the long term.</p>
<p>Thank you DIDAS Technology Working Group and Manu Sporny of <a href="https://www.digitalbazaar.com">Digital Bazaar</a> for the dialogue!</p>

<p>DIACC women in identity spotlights showcase outstanding DIACC member women in identity. If you are a DIACC member woman in identity and would like us to feature you in the spotlight,&nbsp;<a href="https://diacc.ca/contact-us/">contact</a>&nbsp;us!</p>



<p>Marli Lichtman is Managing Director and Head, Digital Strategy and Controls at BMO Financial Group, <a href="https://www.bmo.com/">BMO</a>.</p>



<p>Follow Marli on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marli-lichtman/">LinkedIn</a></p>


 
 


<p>What has your career journey looked like?</p>



<p>Let me work backwards, starting with my current role as Head of Digital Strategy and Controls at BMO. In this role, I lead two teams accountable for: (1) Strategy: defining and executing BMO’s “Digital First” agenda and (2) Controls: working in partnership with the Financial Crimes Unit to build and enhance digital controls to protect our customers against fraud. </p>



<p>I initially joined BMO’s Corporate Strategy Team in 2013 and since then have worked in progressively senior roles across Finance, Risk, Transformation and Business Operations. </p>



<p>Before joining BMO, I was a consultant in Oliver Wyman’s Finance and Risk Practice and prior to that, I worked in wealth management and earned my CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) designation. My first job out of school was at a boutique investment advisory firm. I graduated from Ivey at Western University with an Honours Business Administration (HBA) degree.</p>



<p>When you were 20 years old, did you visualize a dream job and if so, why?</p>



<p>I didn’t really know what I wanted to do when I was 20! I focused the early days of my career on finding opportunities where I could be challenged, learn as much as possible, maintain optionality to transition to other industries or career paths, and work with great people who would champion my career.</p>



<p>Have you encountered significant barriers in your career as a woman in leadership, and if so, what were they?</p>



<p>I have experienced many of the usual challenges you hear about concerning women in the workplace. However, my biggest barrier has been getting into my own head and thinking that I don’t deserve the positions I’ve been given (I mean, earned 😊). Through executive coaching, mentors, sponsors, and simply the experience of failing and rebounding, I’ve been able to overcome this (although I would be lying if I said I don’t experience imposter syndrome from time to time!).</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>It’s a constant juggling act, but I try to focus on 5 things: </p>



 
 Regular calendar reviews to “optimize” my time (e.g., which calls can I take from the car on my way to / from the office?)  



 Learning to say “no” and setting clear boundaries (applies to both work and personal life). 



 Finding time for self-care. 



 Working as a team with my partner who is also balancing a demanding schedule.  



 Living my values and knowing what’s important in life. 
 



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue digital trust and identity careers?</p>



<p>We need to start with education – What is Digital ID? What skillsets do you need to enter the space? Why is diversity so important? Who are female trailblazers in the space, and what has their career path looked like? Early exposure, encouragement, and mentorship are key to increasing female representation in this space.</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Build meaningful relationships. Earn the trust of your colleagues. Network within and outside of your industry. Ensure you have a mentor and a sponsor at your organization. Most importantly, stay true to yourself.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?</p>



<p>While women have made considerable progress over the past decade, there is still more work to do. The next generation will continue to face the same challenges (e.g., gender bias, pay inequality, balancing personal life) but will benefit from increased female representation and sponsorship at Senior levels.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Be confident – you are in the field for a reason! Trust your instincts, and don’t be too hard on yourself.</p>

<p>We're thrilled to announce that <a href="https://oamo.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">Oamo</a> is partnering with <a href="https://ceramic.network/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">Ceramic</a> as a data provider on the platform. Oamo will issue tens of millions of publicly available credentials based on wallets’ on-chain activity and holdings. This is the first step in a broader initiative to develop and standardize the first decentralized point system, powered by Ceramic and Oamo’s credential models.</p><p>Oamo has been a big supporter of the Ceramic ecosystem from day one. By harnessing Ceramic's innovative DID (Decentralized Identifier) infrastructure and <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">ComposeDB</a> for zero-party data storage, they’re setting the foundation for a future where user data is private by design, perishable at will, and accessible only with explicit permission. Oamo and Ceramic are crafting a path toward a consensual and rewarding digital ecosystem.</p> The partnership so far <p>Since launching on Ceramic in Q3 2023, Oamo has witnessed remarkable results – over 65,000 Oamo Profiles have been created, with more than 200,000 Ceramic documents generated. Additionally, Oamo has distributed over 400,000 credentials spanning Web2 and on-chain behaviors, enriching the digital identity and access privileges of Oamo Profile users across various platforms.</p><p>Oamo credentials cover:</p>  On-chain activity across DeFi, NFTs, staking and gaming;  Wallet holdings including major ERC-20s and NFT collections; and  Social activity across Web2 platforms like Discord, Youtube and X.   Supercharging the Ceramic ecosystem <p>With this partnership and announcement, Oamo aims to enhance digital identity and engagement through:</p>  Credential Distribution <br>Oamo has indexed millions of EVM wallets’ behaviors and holdings, and will be distributing tens of millions of publicly available credentials to enrich user identities across platforms, ensuring the security and verification of online activities. These credentials can then be used to:Credentials issued will be maintained and updated monthly to include time decay and ensure they always represent the latest behaviors of the indexed wallets. Feedback from the community is welcome to develop new credentials that track the most relevant on-chain behaviors for builders in the ecosystem.  Compile specific wallet lists for airdrops.  Establish reputation frameworks based on behavioral data points.  Launch strategic user acquisition campaigns by identifying wallets in a specific target audience and contacting them via XMTP for example.    Decentralized Point System <br>Oamo will leverage its credential models to develop the first standardized decentralized point system on Ceramic, with each indexed wallet receiving its own scorecard based on its on-chain activity and holdings. Builders in the ecosystem will be able to leverage these scorecards and customize their own points system with their own credentials and Oamo’s.  Credential &amp; Points Management SDK<br>Oamo will release an SDK to allow any builder to search and leverage Oamo’s credentials and points system easily. This middleware will also allow builders to issue their own credentials and points based on their own models and app activity.   What’s in it for users <p>Anyone creating their Decentralized Identifier (DID) on the Ceramic Network (by creating an Oamo Profile, for instance) will be able to claim their credentials and scorecards seamlessly. This open and inclusive approach democratizes access to digital credentials, ensuring users from all backgrounds and levels of onchain experience can benefit from Ceramic’s ecosystem of builders.</p> What’s in it for developers <p>Oamo's vision includes diverse use cases, transforming how developers interact with consumers. The Oamo platform offers endless opportunities for various types of protocols and apps:</p>  DeFi Protocols<br>Easily find wallets matching their target audience, such as active liquidity providers on leading AMMs or active traders on DEXes across major EVM chains.  NFT Projects<br>Identify potential collectors based on their NFT holdings and distribute collections to the right user base.  Wallet Providers<br>Identify and reach whales holding specific token amounts across multiple chains.  Liquid Staking Projects<br>Identify wallets holding significant ETH amounts and generating yield via lending protocols as high-value acquisition targets.  Game Developers<br>Find gamers in Web3 that hold specific NFTs or have engaged with similar on-chain games.  <p>While the Oamo app provides a hub for user acquisition and relationship development, this publicly available tooling and data will allow anyone to craft their own strategies.</p><p>Builders on the Ceramic Network will have the capability to query, consume, and customize issued credentials and points to power new data-rich use cases, such as targeted airdrops, credential-gated experiences, loyalty programs, and more. To streamline integrations, Oamo will be launching an SDK, making it easier for developers to incorporate these capabilities into their own projects.</p><p>Join the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/+cFzcrY5DZuRhNGNh?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Oamo’s Telegram channel for builders</a> to contribute or be notified about updates and releases.</p> <p>About <a href="https://ceramic.network/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">Ceramic</a></p><p>Ceramic is a decentralized data network for managing verifiable data at scale, combining the trust and composability of a blockchain with the flexibility of an event-driven architecture to help organizations get more value from their data.

<p>The Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC) Task Force at the Trust Over IP Foundation is pleased to request public review of the following deliverables:</p>



 
 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) specification</a>&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/">Authentic Chained Data Containers specification</a>&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">Composable Event Streaming Representation specification</a>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Together, this suite of specifications provides a blueprint for creating truly decentralized, authentic, and verifiable ecosystems of identifiers, “credentials” [see footnote], and attestations.</p>



<p>The specifications describe a series of unique, innovative features:</p>



 
 Pre-rotation of keys, enabling truly unbounded term identifiers; 



 Cryptographic root-of-trust; 



 Chained “credentials” [see footnote] with fully verifiable proof of ownership and proof of authorship; 



 A serialization format that is optimized for both text and binary representations equally with unique properties that support lookahead streaming for uncompromised scalability. 
 



<p>This suite of specifications contains additional sub-specifications including Out-Of-Band Introductions, Self-Addressing Identifiers and a revolutionary “path signature’ approach for signed containers required to provide a comprehensive solution for <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-1-identifiers-ffb9091fd47a">Organizational Identity</a>.</p>



<p>With the launch of the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">vLEI Root of Official Trust</a> this suite of specifications saw its first production deployment through the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy">Python reference implementation</a> in 2022.</p>



<p>The Task Force expects feedback to be provided by April 20, 2024 via GitHub issues on the following repositories using the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/public-review-process/">ToIP Public Review Process</a>:</p>

  Most AI news is about what the giants (OpenAI/Microsoft, Meta, Google/Apple, Amazon, Adobe, Nvidia) are doing (seven $trillion, anyone?), or what AI is doing for business (all of Forbes’ AI 50). Against all that, personal AI appears to be about where personal computing was in 1974: no longer an oxymoron but discussed more than delivered. […]

 <p>Prompt: A woman uses personal AI to know, get control of, and put to better use all available data about her property, health, finances, contacts, calendar, subscriptions, shopping, travel, and work. Via Microsoft Copilot Designer, with spelling corrections by the author.</p> 
<p>Most AI news is about what the giants (<a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/">OpenAI/Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://ai.meta.com/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/technology/apple-google-ai-iphone.html">Google/Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-launches-ai-tools-to-rival-chatgpt-microsoft-and-google/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/firefly.html">Adobe</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/">Nvidia</a>) are doing (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/09/openai-ceo-sam-altman-reportedly-seeking-trillions-of-dollars-for-ai-chip-project.html">seven $trillion</a>, anyone?), or what AI is doing for business (all of Forbes’ <a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/?sh=68b7d3fa290f">AI 50</a>). Against all that, personal AI appears to be about where personal computing was in 1974: no longer an oxymoron but discussed more than delivered.</p>
<p>For evidence, look up “personal AI.” All the results will be about business (see <a href="http://Personal%20AI:%20The%20Technology%20Has%20Hit%20Its%20‘High-Tech%20High-Touch’%20Stage">here</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/public-ai-vs-private-ai-vs-personal-ai-whats-the-difference/">here</a>) or “assistants” that are just suction cups on the tentacles of giants (Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, Bixby), or wannabes that do the same kind of thing (Lindy, Hound, DataBot).</p>
<p>There may be others, but three exceptions I know are <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a>, <a href="https://www.personal.ai/">Personal AI</a> and <a href="https://pi.ai/talk">Pi</a>.</p>
<p>Personal AI is finding its most promoted early uses on the side of business more than the side of customers. <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/personal-ai/">Zapier</a>, for example, explains that Personal AI “can be used as a productivity or business tool.”</p>
<p>Kin and Pi are personal assistants that help you with your life by surveilling your activities for your own benefit. I’ve signed up for both, but have only experienced Pit,” or “just vent,” when I ask it to help me with the stuff outlined in (and under) the AI-generated image above, it wants to hook me up with a bunch of siloed platforms that cost money, or to do geeky things (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Python on my own computer. Provisional conclusion: Pi means well, but the tools aren’t there yet. [Later… <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2024/03/19/inflection-abandons-chatgpt-challenger-ceo-suleyman-joins-microsoft/">Looks like it’s going to morph into some kind of B2B thing</a>, or be abandoned outright, now that Inflection AI’s CEO, Mustafa Suleyman is gone to Microsoft. Hmm… will Microsoft do what we’d like in this space?]</p>
<p>Open source approaches are out there: <a href="https://www.opendan.ai/">OpenDAN</a>, <a href="https://khoj.dev/">Khoj</a>, <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/">Kwaai</a> , and <a href="https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/build-your-own-ai/">Llama</a> are four, and I know at least one will be at VRM Day and IIW.</p>
<p>So, since personal AI may finally be what pushes VRM into becoming a Real Thing, we’ll make it the focus of our next VRM Day.</p>
<p>As always, VRM Day will precede <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a> in the same location: the Boole Room of the <a href="https://computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a> in Mountain View, just off Highway 101 in the heart of Silicon Valley. It’ll be on Monday, 15 April, and start at 9am. There’s a Starbucks across the street and ample parking because the museum is officially closed on Mondays, but the door is open. We lunch outdoors (it’s always clear) at the sports bar on the other corner.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>If the first two months of 2024 for Digital Identity NZ are anything to go by, this year is certainly turning out to be every bit as busy as 2023. It is a different kind of busy, with more collaboration and partnership engagement needed to ‘get things done’ in the digital identity domain, against a backdrop of regulation and economic headwinds.</p>



<p>A couple of weeks ago, the year’s first Coffee Chat saw good attendance as did last month’s Air New Zealand and Authsignal sponsored webinar on passkeys. This exclusive member-only event shared how DINZ members, Authsignal and Air New Zealand worked together to deliver a world class implementation of passkeys to secure Air New Zealand’s customers accounts. Speaking of Authsignal, founder and DINZ Executive Council Member Justin Soong wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/08/generative-ai-and-the-risk-around-digital-trust/?sh=69e6817c6dcf">this exceptional thought piece on AI published in Forbes last month</a>.&nbsp;And DINZ member SSS – IT Security Specialists&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reseller.co.nz/article/1355990/att-crowns-sss-it-security-specialists-as-its-apac-partner-of-the-year.html">received this accolade</a>!</p>



<p>Next week, members will receive a personal email from me seeking expressions of interest, particularly from digital ID service and attribute providers, to participate in an investigative sprint early next month from DINZ member PaymentsNZ’s. The aim is to surface the digital identity-related issues that people encounter in the payments industry, and develop best practice requirements to overcome them as part of PaymentsNZ’s Next Generation Payments programme. Stay tuned.</p>



<p>We kick off April with a lunchtime fireside chat; Digital Health Identity: History, current state and the future with two Te Whatu Ora specialists. There’s so much happening in this space. You can find out more and register&nbsp;<a href="https://events.humanitix.com/fireside-chat-digital-health-identity-history-current-state-and-the-future">here</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re getting the impression that April is the month for digital identity, you’re correct! Tuesday 9 April is World&nbsp;<a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/identity-management-day/">Identity Management Day</a>! While co-founded by the Identity Defined Security Alliance and the National Cybersecurity Alliance in the US in 2021, the day is recognised in many countries globally. In its fourth year, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/event/identity-management-day-2024/">2024 Virtual Conference</a>&nbsp;brings together identity and security leaders and practitioners from all over the world to learn and engage.</p>



<p>April is also a favourite time of year to publish research that helps to level-set our own strategies and plans, as DINZ did last year. This&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/70-of-australians-dont-feel-in-control-of-their-data-as-companies-hide-behind-meaningless-privacy-terms-224072">Australian research</a>&nbsp;forwarded by a public sector member, would probably show similar results in NZ, as reflected in DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://internetnz.nz/news-and-articles/internet-insights/">InternetNZ’s insights research</a>. And the<a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/.github/blob/main/profile/reference-implementation.md">&nbsp;EU digital wallet is taking shape</a>&nbsp;as it aims to showcase a robust and interoperable platform for digital identification, authentication and electronic signatures based on common standards across the European Union. We hope to continue our research and additional initiatives for 2024, and we’re continually looking for support in the way of sponsorship from our members. <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/01/18/sponsorship-opportunities-for-a-thriving-future/">Click here to find out how you can support DINZ’s research, and future ambitions</a>.</p>

Any hope of losing fewer lives during the next pandemic rests on reflection: what did we do, what can we learn from it, and what can we do better next time? Here, we offer five key lessons-learned from research on COVID-19 apps in the US and Europe that can help us prepare for the next pandemic.</p><p>Privacy is important, but accuracy also&nbsp;matters</p><p>Privacy was the primary focus in early exposure notification apps, and rightfully so. The apps all trace their users’ medical information and movements in various ways, and may store some or all of that information in a central database in order to inform other users of potential infection. The misuse of this information could easily result in unintentional, or even intentional, harm.</p><p>However, research into whether (and how) people used exposure notification apps during the pandemic showed that <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/28/quality-issues-stumbling-block-contact-tracing-apps/">privacy might not be</a> the most important factor. People care about <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3488307">accuracy</a>, or an app’s rate of incorrect reports of COVID-19 exposure (both false positives and false negatives), which may have also influenced rates of public app adoption. Yet, <a href="https://europeanaifund.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/European-AI-Fund-Tech-and-Covid-grants-synthesis-1.pdf">we still know little</a> about how effective the deployed exposure notification apps were. Future apps will need to have measurement tools and methods designed into them before they are released to accurately track their usefulness.</p><p>We need to better understand the role of incentives</p><p>Researchers discovered that using direct incentives, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258945">such as monetary compensation</a>, to get people to install exposure notification apps worked at first, but had little effect in the long term. In fact, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3786245">one field study</a> found that people who received money were less likely to still be using the app eight months later than those who didn’t. Paying people to download a contact tracing app is <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/ayalon">even less effective</a> when the app is perceived to be bad quality or inaccurate. However, monetary incentives may be able to “compensate” when the app is perceived to be costly in other ways, such as eating up mobile&nbsp;data.</p><p>Given the ethical problems and lack of success with direct incentives, focusing on indirect incentives, such as functionality, may be key to increasing adoption. Exposure notification apps have the potential to serve a greater purpose during pandemics than merely exposure notification. Our research found that people using exposure notification apps wanted them to <a href="https://medium.com/ubicomp-iswc-2023/how-people-used-covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-and-why-insights-from-belgiums-coronalert-48e57c1a0fe1">serve as a “one-stop-shop”</a> for quick receipt of test results, information on the state of public health in their region, and assistance finding testing&nbsp;centers.</p><p>Future app design needs to examine user wants and expectations to ensure widespread adoption. This is hardly a new concept — every successful “fun” app begins with this user-centered model. Apps that provide these extra benefits to users will not only be better adopted, they will also see more frequent and prolonged use.</p><blockquote>…Over a third of the Coronalert app users we interviewed believed that it tracked their location, despite repeated communications over the course of a year that it used proximity rather than location to detect possible exposures.</blockquote><p>Honesty is the most effective communication strategy</p><p>Exposure notification apps are often framed to the public as having inherent individual benefits: if you use this app, you’ll be able to tell when you’ve been exposed to a disease. In reality, exposure notification apps have a stronger collective benefit of preventing the overall spread of disease in communities. Being honest with potential users about the true benefits is more effective than playing up the less significant individual benefit. When examining <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501869">how to best advertise</a> Louisiana’s exposure notification app, we found that people were most receptive to the app when its collectivistic benefits were centered.</p><p>Honesty and openness in privacy is also essential, especially when it comes to data collection and storage. Despite this transparency, however, people may still make assumptions based on false preconceptions or logic. For example, over a third of the Coronalert app users we interviewed believed that it tracked their location, despite repeated communications over the course of a year that it used proximity rather than location to detect possible exposures.</p><p>Integration with existing health systems is essential</p><p>There was a disconnect between COVID-19 exposure notification apps and public healthcare systems, even in countries with universal healthcare and government-supported apps. <a href="https://medium.com/ubicomp-iswc-2023/how-people-used-covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-and-why-insights-from-belgiums-coronalert-48e57c1a0fe1">Belgium’s Coronalert app</a>, for example, allowed users to receive their test results faster by linking their test to their app using a unique code. But, testing center staff were not trained on the app and failed to prompt users for that code. Not only was receiving test results a primary motivator in getting people to use the app; failing to link positive results to specific app users reduced the app’s efficacy.</p><p>This disconnect may be far greater in countries without universal healthcare or where exposure notification apps are privately created. In order for these apps to be effective, developers must collaborate with public health workers to develop a shared understanding of how testing centers operate, determine the information needed to provide accurate tracking, and decide on the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-fix-covid-contact-tracing/">best way to follow up</a> on potential infections.</p><p>Resourcing technical capacity is&nbsp;critical</p><p>A wide range of exposure notification apps were developed to combat COVID-19, and by many different organizations. In the absence of immediate government action, many of the earliest efforts were led by universities or volunteer efforts. Academics developed the <a href="https://fortune.com/40-under-40/2020/carmela-troncoso/">DP3T proximity tracing protocol, which guided </a>Google and Apple’s development of exposure notification infrastructure for Android and iOS&nbsp;phones.</p><p>However, privatization of exposure notification infrastructure created an enormous potential for private medical and other information to fall into the hands of corporations who are in the business of big data. It also subjected exposure notification technology to private company’s rules (and&nbsp;whims).</p><p>Google and Apple released exposure notification infrastructure in April 2020 but did not release direct-to-user exposure notification functionality <a href="https://www.pathcheck.org/en/blog/pathcheck-launches-solutions-for-en-express-unveiled-by-google-apple">until later in the pandemic</a>. This decision left the development of exposure notification apps to public health agencies that lacked the resources and technical capacity to do so. Volunteers stepped in to fill this void. For example, the PathCheck foundation developed exposure notification apps for <a href="https://www.pathcheck.org/en/impact">7 states and countries</a> on top of the Google-Apple Exposure Notification infrastructure.</p><blockquote>“…We need to eliminate these scattered responses, align incentives, and integrate the strengths and perspectives of public, private, and academic bodies to develop protocols, models, and best practices.”</blockquote><p>While it is natural for universities to support the public good, and encouraging that private citizens volunteered so much of their time and resources to do so, they should not have to in the next pandemic. To respond to future pandemics, we need to eliminate these scattered responses, align incentives, and integrate the strengths and perspectives of public, private, and academic bodies to develop protocols, models, and best practices.</p><p>Applying the lessons&nbsp;learned</p><p>Building tech responsibly means not just considering privacy, but providing <a href="https://dighum.ec.tuwien.ac.at/perspectives-on-digital-humanism/the-need-for-respectful-technologies-going-beyond-privacy/">technology that respects user preferences</a>. When people give up their data, they expect a benefit — be that a collective benefit, such as fighting a pandemic or helping cancer research, or an individual one. They likewise expect utility: apps that are accurate, achieve their goals, and provide an holistic set of features.</p><p>If we continue to build tech based on our assumptions of what users want, we risk low adoption of these technologies. And during times of crisis, such as this still-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the consequences of low adoption are&nbsp;dire.</p><p><a href="https://elissaredmiles.com/">Elissa M.

<p></p>      MOBI Joins eSTART Coalition to Help Modernize Automotive Title and Registration Processes           <p>Coalition Advocates for Improvements to Streamline Auto Transactions</p>
          <p>Los Angeles — 14 March 2024. MOBI, a global nonprofit Web3 consortium, is excited to announce its participation in the Electronic Secure Title and Registration Transformation (eSTART) Coalition as a founding member. eSTART is a group of leading auto industry organizations united in advocating for modern solutions to replace the paper-based processes that currently dominate state and local DMV operations.</p>
<p>The eSTART Coalition focuses on three key areas of vehicle transactions:</p>
 
 Permitting electronic signatures on all title and registration documents; 
 Adopting tools for electronic submission and processing of title and registration; and 
 Enabling electronic vehicle records transfers. 
 
<p>Modernizing these processes will result in significant cost and time savings for consumers, state and local DMV operations, and industry participants.</p>
<p>Across the U.S., countless titling/registration service providers maintain unique databases and processes for vehicle registration and titling. While some of these jurisdictions have begun digitizing certain processes, many rely entirely on paper-based and manual workflows. This fragmented approach presents several pain points for Motor Vehicle Authorities (MVAs), private sector participants, and consumers, including:</p>
 
 Lack of standardized processes leading to inconsistencies in data management and accessibility. 
 Incurrence of substantial costs associated with paper-based systems, including storage, processing, and handling. 
 Prolonged processing times and increased risk of errors due to manual verification processes. 
 Missed opportunities for cost savings, efficiency gains, and enhanced customer experiences. 
 
<p>Addressing these pain points requires a solution that can be easily adopted across all jurisdictions rather than a solution that functions at a state, county or municipal jurisdiction level. MOBI and its members are collaborating on a Web3-enabled standardized solution to enhance efficiency and cross-border regulatory compliance in MVA operations with an interoperability framework rooted in self-sovereign data and identities. This unified framework serves as a common language, enabling organizations with diverse business processes and legacy systems to efficiently coordinate in a standardized manner without having to build and maintain new infrastructure.</p>
<p>The implementation of a standardized Web3 ecosystem offers a promising solution to streamline operations, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and greatly improve data permissioned-only-access. The ability to verify identities and transactions in a decentralized way can reduce odometer and titling fraud, eliminate the need for manual identity verification, improve insurance products, and enable more seamless remote transactions (e.g. online sales and road usage charging).</p>
<p>“We’re excited to be part of a coalition that not only shares our vision for a more streamlined and modern automotive industry but is actively working towards making it a reality,” said Tram Vo, MOBI CEO and Co-Founder. “MOBI and its members are proud to bring a unique Web3 standardized approach to this groundbreaking endeavor. Together, we’re setting the stage for a more efficient, interoperable ecosystem that empowers stakeholders through enhanced trust and data privacy for all.”</p>
<p>Other transportation industry organizations, including government agencies, industry partners, and associations, are encouraged to join the eSTART Coalition to advocate for these important changes.

          <p>About MOBI</p>
<p>MOBI is a global nonprofit Web3 consortium. We are creating standards for trusted self-sovereign data and identities (e.g. vehicles, people, businesses, things), verifiable credentials, and cross-industry interoperability. Our goal is to make the digital economy more efficient, equitable, decentralized, and sustainable while preserving data privacy for users and providers alike.

Together, Citopia and the ITN provide the necessary infrastructure for node operators to build out secure, seamless, globally compliant web services and applications. MOBI membership is required to operate a node on Citopia and/or the ITN. <a href="https://dlt.mobi/participate/">Contact us to learn more about becoming a node operator</a></p>
     <a></a>         Overview of the Pilot and the Problem It Solves           <p>Across the United States, there is a diverse array of jurisdictions (numbering in the thousands across states, counties, and municipalities) and titling/registration service providers, each maintaining unique databases and processes for vehicle registration and titling. Many states (AZ, DE, GA, FL, LA, MA, MD, NC, SC, PA, VA, and WI) <a href="https://www.autoremarketing.com/subprime/mandatory-elt-processing-gaining-momentum/">currently mandate</a> the use of electronic lien and title (ELT) systems. Other states have planned ELT mandates in 2024, or more generally are developing a digital approach to electronic vehicle titling. For example, New York and Idaho have or are developing processes for dealer reassignments electronically.</p>
<p>Each of these jurisdictions will maintain their own systems for these varied processes. The challenge lies in achieving interoperability between those systems through standardized communications and data reporting/exchange across jurisdictional, platform, and organizational lines while enabling each jurisdiction to maintain control over its processes. For example, today, each vehicle manufacturer or lender can have hundreds of unique identifiers assigned to them by different jurisdictions, creating confusion, mismanagement, and inefficiency.</p>
<p>Currently, secure digital authentication and communication rely on identifiers issued by centralized platforms to prove their credentials. However, in addition to being vulnerable to fraud, identity theft, and data leaks, centralized approaches to identity management fail to address the trust problems created by the rise of decentralized services, IOT, and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/05/hong_kong_deepfaked_cfo/">Generative AI</a>. As digitization advances, it will become increasingly challenging — and costly — to verify data authenticity, secure digital perimeters, and ensure cross-border regulation compliance. This is critical for state agencies like MVAs as well as dealers and lenders, who are responsible for executing the bulk of the registration/titling process.</p>
                    Stakeholders:    Vehicle Manufacturers (OEMs); Financial Institutions (FIs)/Lenders; Servicers; Dealerships; Motor Vehicle Authorities (MVAs)/Third-party Registration/Titling Providers (RTPs); State Authorized Inspectors; Third-Party Data Consolidators; Fleet Operators; Trade Associations; Vehicle Auctions; and Consumers.                 Our Innovative Solution       <p>Overcoming these challenges calls for a new solution. The White House’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf">Federal Zero Trust Strategy</a> (2022) mandates that federal agencies and any organization that works with the federal government adopt a Zero Trust framework by the end of FY 2024. Zero Trust requires every entity to authenticate and validate every other entity for every single digital communication at all times. Since this is not possible at scale through Web2/centralized means, Web3 technologies and principles must be leveraged.</p>
<p>MOBI and its members have developed platform-agnostic standardized “universal translators” that work with any existing legacy system or web service to enable cross-industry interoperable communication through <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) decentralized identity and verifiable credential framework, called <a href="https://citopia.global/technology/">Citopia Passports</a> (Web3 Plug-and-Play). Citopia Passports ensure that organizations’ and customers’ data privacy, which is key for complying with comprehensive data privacy laws being passed by many states (e.g., <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CA</a>, <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2022/act/Pa/pdf/2022PA-00015-R00SB-00006-PA.PDF">CT</a>, <a href="https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/senatedemocrats/Documents/230620%20SB%20619.pdf">OR</a>, <a href="https://www.dwt.com/-/media/files/blogs/privacy-and-security-blog/2023/07/hb00004f.pdf?rev=d2ece1e4cc0c4a708453ab079b7f00f4&amp;hash=57F39986BC8C2DA88C7F985640CB495A">TX</a>, <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/static/SB0227.html">UT</a>, <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title59.1/chapter53/">VA</a>).</p>

<p>Infosec &amp; Selective Disclosure: Participants must be able to selectively disclose information for transactions at the edge. Verification must be done at the moment of transaction to eliminate the need for PII storage.</p>
    
<p>Scalability and Extensibility: Cross-industry interoperability requires a shared standards-based framework to enable the creation of globally scalable multiparty applications.</p>
          
<p>Data Privacy Compliance: Cross-industry interoperability requires (1) compliance with existing global data privacy regulations and (2) the flexibility to comply with future directives.</p>
    
<p>Global Standards: Cross-industry interoperability requires a standardized system for frictionless data exchange and collaboration while allowing stakeholders to retain their legacy systems.</p>
    
<p>Decentralization: Cross-industry interoperability requires a community-owned and -operated infrastructure to (1) prevent monopolization and (2) enable consensus-based trust.</p>
                     Web3 Plug-and-Play   <p>Citopia Passports utilize W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) standards. This creates an interoperability framework that provides:</p>

<p>Decentralized, trusted identities</p>
    
<p>Digital credential issuance/verification</p>
    
<p>Interoperable communication between each stakeholder’s centralized databases</p>
    
<p>A bridge between jurisdictions, organizations, and platforms allowing each stakeholder to keep their legacy systems</p>
            <p>The result is the reduction of errors, streamlined operations, increased efficiency, and reduced costs, as well as greatly improved data permissioned-access. More generally, this cross-industry, platform-agnostic, universal interoperability is part of what has motivated government interest worldwide in implementing and adopting standards-based digital identity and credential systems (e.g., the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/preventing-forgery-and-counterfeiting-certificates-and-licenses">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) in the US; <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/digital-identity-leveraging-the-ssi-concept-to-build-trust">European Union Agency for Cybersecurity </a>(ENISA) and<a href="https://essif-lab.eu/"> European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework</a> (ESSIF) in the EU).</p>
   Proposed Stakeholder Meeting   <p>MOBI is proposing a two-part meeting in the first half of 2024: part one being a meeting between the association stakeholders (e.g. AAMVA, NADA, ATAEs, NIADA, AFSA, MOBI) and their representative members, and part two being a meeting including the titling service providers. The goals of the meeting are:</p>
 
 to bring together the key stakeholders to assess the pain points, needs/requirements, and path forward to achieve interoperability between the numerous centralized systems for registration/titling 
 to jointly address the opportunity to develop standardized communication between each stakeholder to achieve interoperability for registration/titling processes 
 to discuss how secure, verifiable digital identifiers and claims (using open-standard Web3 technologies) can address fundamental problems, such as each lender having hundreds of different identifiers assigned to them by different jurisdictions 
 to finalize the scope and scale of the Standardized Web3 Solution for Titling/Registration Pilot 
 
   Pilot Planning   <p>In Phase 1 of the Pilot, the FSSC WG will demonstrate privacy-preserving cross-industry interoperability for Titling/Registration via standardized universal identifiers and communication/claims without the need to build new infrastructure. This will involve working with MVAs, lenders, dealers, OEMs, and service providers to demonstrate interoperability across different legacy systems and jurisdictions. At the end of Phase 1, stakeholders will have successfully created Citopia Passports and be able to use their Citopia Passport to easily authenticate each other’s identifiers and claims (such as lien release, odometer disclosures, insurance validation, etc.). Stakeholders will be able to examine the code and outputs to verify that all transactions/communications are private and only visible to the intended recipient.</p>
<p>In Phase 2 of the Pilot, each stakeholder will have the opportunity to run nodes, conduct research and development for their own applications, and actively participate in the pilot for a duration of 6-12 months. The FSSC WG will determine the final scope of Phase 2 after the conclusion of Phase 1.</p>
