<p>We're excited to share that 3Box Labs, core developers of Ceramic, has raised a $30,000,000 Series A co-led by Multicoin Capital and Union Square Ventures to accelerate development of Ceramic and unlock data composability in the Web3 ecosystem. Ceramic's decentralized data network makes it easy for developers to build powerful applications on top of an open ecosystem of composable data.</p>  3Box Labs is 15 employees today and we're growing quickly. If you want to have a massive impact on the next foundational Web3 infrastructure, join us at <a href="https://careers.3boxlabs.com">careers.3boxlabs.com</a>!&nbsp;  <p></p> The Composable Web3 Data Network <p>At its core, the internet is a bunch of applications running on stateful data. Every time we post, follow, like, share, edit and otherwise use any of our favorite apps like Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, or TikTok, we're generating data – hundreds of millions of data events every second – data that is quickly becoming society's most valuable resource. On today's web, this value is locked away on centralized application database servers like MongoDB, mySQL, and Confluent that weren't designed to be open and collaborative. The architecture of these databases, and the incentives they create, prevent us from collectively realizing the true potential of data and the original vision for the internet.</p><p>Decentralized networks provide alternative incentive structures that allow data to be unbundled from applications. However, not all networks are equal. Ethereum, Solana, and similar blockchains decentralize state for financial use cases like tokens and NFTs. Because they're made for finance, they aren't designed to support the scale and transaction volumes required by non-financial use cases for data. Most Web3 developers building dapps today use a blockchain as their financial backend, but store application data and other user-generated content on a centralized database, drastically limiting the types of applications that can be built on Web3. &nbsp;</p><p>This is why we created Ceramic, a decentralized network for composable Web3 data. The network consists of three core components:</p>  Scalable, decentralized data infrastructure   Open APIs for storing, modifying, and retrieving data   Community-created marketplace of reusable data models  <p>With this design, Ceramic makes it possible for developers to build applications by on a global network of composable data. For example on Ceramic, Twitter-like apps would run on a few shared data models: one for each user’s tweets, one for their social graph, and one for their DMs. By simply adopting the same data models, applications automatically share data and developers no longer need to worry about bootstrapping their database from scratch. </p><p>Ceramic's community-driven approach to creating and sharing data models provides developers with a rich set of standards and tools to use when building their apps. Today there are thousands of developers who’ve already built over 400 applications on Ceramic. As more data models are created by the community, the variety of use cases for Ceramic will continue to expand, creating compounding innovation across applications in Web3.</p> Growing the community <p>This $30M Series A funding round gives us the opportunity to welcome some of the brightest minds in Web3 to the Ceramic community. </p><p>We're thrilled to welcome the following funds and ecosystem partners: Multicoin, USV, Placeholder, Reciprocal Ventures, CoinFund, Jump Crypto, Figment, Hashed, Metacartel Ventures, Edge &amp; Node, Digital Currency Group, Variant Fund, Dapper Labs, Animoca Brands, Protocol Labs, Coinbase Ventures, ConsenSys, The LAO, Dialectic, Zee Prime, StreamingFast, BlockScience, P2P Capital, DaoSquare, Polymorphic Capital, Redbeard Ventures, Collab+Currency, Not Boring Capital, Gaingels, Distributed Global, Bitscale, Northzone, Venrock, Fenbushi, Amplify Partners, Page One, The Fintech Fund, Warburg Serres, 6th Man Ventures, and Underscore.</p><p>And angels: Aditi Sriram, Alan Curtis, Alessio Fanelli, Alex Salnikov, Alisha.eth, Annika Lewis, Billy Luedke, Blake Jennelle, Brian Flynn, Calvin Liu, Chase Chapman, Chris Hamm, Dan Heyman, Dan Romero, David Phelps, DeFi Dad, Derek Yoo, Ele Diakomichalis, Florian Hagenbuch, Illia Polosukhin, Jad Esber, Jeremy Sklaroff, Joe Lallouz, Julia Lipton, Julia Rosenberg, Ken Gunter, Kerman Kohli, Mason Nystrom, Meltem Demirors, Nima Ashgari, Oaksprout, Robert Toews, Roham Gharegozlou, Ryan Selkis, Sari Azout, Sean Li, Stefan George, Suji Yan, Tegan Kline, Vadim Koleoshkin, Yannick Folla, and Zach Frankel.</p><p>Here's what Multicoin and USV had to say:</p>  <a href="https://multicoin.capital/2022/02/16/the-composable-web3-data-network/">The Composable Web3 Data Network</a>, by Kyle Samani @ Multicoin  <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2022/02/ceramic/">Ceramic</a>, by Nick Grossman @ USV   What's next? <p>In the coming weeks, we will be launching Ceramic 2.0, the next major version of the protocol.

<p>In October 2021, The Engine Room launched a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/digital-rights-and-environmental-justice-intersections-and-funder-strategies-for-better-futures/">new research project</a> exploring intersections between digital rights and environmental/climate justice. Responding to a mounting sense of urgency around the intensifying climate crisis, our research, <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/upcoming-research-how-digital-rights-and-climate-justice-intersect/">in partnership with the Ford Foundation, Mozilla and Ariadne</a>, seeks to identify shared concerns and synergies between diverse movements and communities working on these issues, with the goal of strengthening funding and other support for work at their intersection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our report will be published alongside a set of research deep dives exploring different issue areas related to digital rights and climate/environmental justice, forthcoming from the <a href="https://www.openenvironmentaldata.org/">Open Environmental Data Project</a>, <a href="https://www.bsr.org">BSR</a>, and the <a href="https://www.apc.org/">Association for Progressive Communications</a> – so keep an eye out for those, too!</p>



<p>We’ll be publishing our findings within the next few months but in the meantime we’d like to share some of what we have learned so far through our initial desk research, community calls, and interviews with practitioners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those we’ve spoken to come from a diverse set of movements and communities, and work in different regions of the world, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Digital rights activists and technologists looking to pay closer attention to the needs of climate struggles as they’re being articulated by those closest to the problem&nbsp;  Engineers creating more sustainable internet infrastructure and web services&nbsp;  Youth climate organizers pushing for internet access so their communities can participate in international climate debates&nbsp;  Environmental lawyers supporting communities collecting data on environmental harm  Fossil fuel divestment specialists concerned with the digital safety of climate defenders.  



<p>We’ve learned that among this diverse group of people, there are number of important shared concerns, including:&nbsp;</p>



  Sustainable internet and green technologies. Technologists and sustainability experts are working to increase the efficiency of technological infrastructure and transition this infrastructure to renewable energy sources. As more energy-efficient infrastructure is developed in both the corporate and nonprofit sphere, digital rights practitioners are raising concerns around the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jun/24/smart-meters-spying-collecting-private-data-french-british#:~:text=Personal%20details%20like%20your%20name,them%20permission%20to%20do%20so.%E2%80%9D">data-intensive nature of some of these infrastructures</a>, and are looking to ensure that more sustainable tech doesn’t also lead to potential digital rights infringements.  Climate-related disinformation. A long-standing problem <a href="https://influencemap.org/report/Climate-Change-and-Digital-Advertising-86222daed29c6f49ab2da76b0df15f76#4">perpetuated by fossil fuel companies and other corporate actors</a>, digital rights and environmental/climate justice practitioners are now exploring how algorithmic techniques and big tech business models contribute to the spread of this disinformation online. Those we’ve interviewed are asking if it’s possible to disrupt the incentives behind climate disinformation spread on social media platforms like Facebook and twitter.&nbsp;  Environmental data and pollution monitoring. A number of community-led initiatives around the world have been collecting and sharing data in order to defend local communities against extractive companies and to monitor biodiversity loss. This field has grappled with how to ethically steward collected data and best use it to push for accountability. Practitioners focused on this intersection of digital/data and climate/environmental issues are exploring <a href="https://www.openenvironmentaldata.org/research-type/data-governance-models-and-the-environmental-context">alternative data governance models</a> which can respect digital rights and <a href="https://www.gida-global.org/care">indigenous data sovereignty</a> while using this data to build a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eZL_pHlr876xe7PTaMfqePe9WQ3Y3IQI/view">data commons</a><a href="https://www.openenvironmentaldata.org/research-series/issue-brief-cj-knowledge-commons">.</a>  



  Threats to safety. With new laws banning protest and intensified surveillance against climate movements around the world, the climate and environmental justice practitioners we’ve spoken to have expressed deep concern about the ability of their communities and movements to protest and push back against powerful harm-doers.They argue that safety and digital security should be understood as a precondition for being able to continue to fight for climate/environmental justice. While the digital rights field has spent the last decade plus increasing digital security capacity within civil society, those working directly with climate movements identify an enormous need for more support.  Migration justice. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/23/magazine/climate-migration.html">An intensifying climate crisis is already pushing vulnerable populations to militarised international borders</a>, with surveillance-intensive border technologies being used to preempt migration. The climate/environmental and digital rights practitioners we’ve spoken to argue that both digital rights and environmental/climate justice movements have a responsibility to address injustices around migration, and anticipate how these issues may intensify in coming decades.&nbsp;  



<p>Along with such shared concerns, we also see what we call ‘productive frictions’ – differences in worldview, which affect the kinds of collaborations that are possible across movements and communities. We outline a couple here:</p>



  The first is around how sustainability is defined by different groups. While a lot of work is happening in the corporate tech space to move towards sustainability, both the environmental/climate and digital rights practitioners we have spoken to disagree on what meaningful sustainability actually means in the context of a ‘<a href="https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/vol22-1/agua-es-vida-solidarity-science-against-false-climate-change-solutions/">just transition’</a>. As big tech companies promise to transition to renewable energy sources, some are happy to see any progress on this front, while others argue for a more critical lens on climate pledges and net zero promises.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies"> ‘Greenwashing’</a> is one concern. Furthermore, some of those we’ve spoken to argue that ‘net zero’ is not a meaningful sustainability goal on its own. Instead, the environmental impacts of technologies must be considered more broadly in light of the many <a href="https://giswatch.org/node/6245">continued forms of extraction</a> and injustice that come with a transition to ‘renewable’ energy sources.  Relatedly, we observe differing views on the potential of technologies to serve as tools to mitigate the climate crisis. &nbsp;For example, some environmental/climate justice practitioners and technologists are optimistic about the use of AI and machine learning to <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/">advance sustainability goals</a>, while others <a href="https://medium.com/@AINowInstitute/ai-and-climate-change-how-theyre-connected-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-6aa8d0f5b32c">highlight</a> that these technologies can actually increase fossil fuel use and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">exacerbate </a><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-021-00043-6#:~:text=Sustainability%20of%20AI%20is%20focused,of%20AI%20for%20the%20environment.">sustainability issues</a>. The debate around the role of AI in sustainability is part of a broader concern both digital rights and environmental/climate justice practitioners express about <a href="https://giswatch.org/node/6254">‘techno-solutionist’ thinking</a> around how to ‘solve’ the climate crisis. They argue that tech-centric discourse about solutions diverts energy and resources away from already well-established and community-led interventions.&nbsp;  Finally, we see that practitioners working on both environmental/climate justice and digital rights have differing perspectives on the role of corporations and governments in coming up with solutions. Some push for a focus on government responsibility and corporate accountability, while others argue that movements shouldn’t wait for institutional change and should instead focus on autonomous and local efforts. These differences inform where energy is placed in pushing for progress.  



<p>The points we’ve shared here offer just a glimpse of the issues we’ve encountered so far, and we’re excited to learn more as we continue our research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As mentioned, we’ll be publishing a report with our full findings in the next few months, which will also include a set of recommendations for funders for how to support work at these intersections forward.</p>



<p>For now, we invite you to reach out to us if you have any thoughts on these issues you’d like to share! Please feel free to email us at becky[at]theengineroom.org.</p>

<p>The Trust Over IP Foundation was established to bring trust into the virtual, online world where, all too often, there is low or no trust in data exchanges. To overcome this challenge, the 100s of public and private sector members of ToIP promote open standards-based, interoperable solutions where the individual is in possession and control of their cryptographically verifiable identity attributes. In this context, a news item caught the attention of the ToIP Foundation in the past week where there was a lot of controversy over an exclusive contract between the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and identity provider ID.Me. We base this post on publicly available information and begin with a quote from a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/27/irs-face-scans/">Washington Post article</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>Millions of Americans could soon have to scan their faces to access their Internal Revenue Service tax accounts, one of the government’s biggest expansions yet of facial recognition software into people’s everyday lives. For now, taxpayers can still file their returns the old-fashioned way; the IRS began accepting returns for 2021 earnings on Monday, encouraging electronic filing. But by this summer, anyone wanting to access their records — including details about child tax credits, payment plans or tax transcripts — on <a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments/your-online-account#alternatives">the IRS website</a> could be required to record a video of their face with their computer or smartphone, and send it to the private contractor <a href="https://www.id.me/">ID.me</a> to confirm their identity.</p></blockquote>



<p>Background</p>



<p>On November 17, 2021 the IRS announced the launch of an improved <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-unveils-new-online-identity-verification-process-for-accessing-self-help-tools">identity verification and sign-in process</a> that enables more people to securely access and use IRS online tools and applications. And we agree with IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig that, “Identity verification is critical to protect taxpayers and their information.”</p>



<p>To access certain IRS online tools and applications, the IRS decided to mandate that citizens provide extremely sensitive personal information, both biometric and biographic, to a single, private-sector entity. This entity would centrally store it, perform probabilistic analysis (biometric matching) with little or no transparency of how the solution was certified, how often it will be recertified, by whom, and what accuracy, security, or privacy criteria will be utilized.</p>



<p>While it is not clear why the IRS would relinquish this extremely sensitive capability in its entirety to a single, private-sector entity using a proprietary solution, there are clues. In the associated <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pia/id-me-pia.pdf">Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)</a> under PRIVACY TESTING, for example, the response to “Does the system require a System Test Plan?” is NO and the follow-on response to “Please explain why:” is “This [is] a[n] ID.me owned and operated system and not subject to IRS System Test Plan at this time.”&nbsp; The fact that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/07/us/politics/irs-idme-facial-recognition.html">IRS removed the mandate</a> for the Facial Recognition component of the proprietary ID.me solution several days after the story was broadly publized does not resolve the underlying challenges of this approach to achieve trusted, remote authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Challenge 1 – Ethical Use of Biometrics</p>



<p>Strong authentication can benefit from the use of biometric technologies but there are no policies in place for their ethical use which should include measures to ensure that accuracy, security, and privacy criteria commensurate with the specific use case(s) are certified and monitored.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To this end, the Office of Science and Technology Policy recently published a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/08/2021-21975/notice-of-request-for-information-rfi-on-public-and-private-sector-uses-of-biometric-technologies">Notice of Request For Information (RFI) on Public and Private Sector Uses of Biometric Technologies</a>. To meet the Ethical Use of Biometrics challenge, our policy makers must provide guard rails for the use of biometrics technologies in both the public- and private-sectors which are use-case specific. That is, similar to the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/82381/download">FDA’s 12-step approval process for drugs</a> to be considered safe and effective, before any drug can be released to the market for a specific, on-label use, it must go through a process that includes rigorous testing, with independent review, to demonstrate safety and efficacy, as well as post-approval monitoring.</p>



<p>Challenge 2 – Trusted, Remote Authentication</p>



<p>The Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation was established to simplify and standardize <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">how trust is established over a digital network [PDF]</a> or using digital tools (whether online or disconnected) by expanding the opportunities of digital trust by bringing a unified stack of standards for technical interoperability—the same approach that has been successful with the Internet and the Web— together with a unified model for expressing the rules and policies (“governance”) by which people and organizations can cooperate to achieve trust.</p>



<p>ToIP provides guidance, frameworks, and other assets to obviate the need for entities such as the IRS to rely on a single, private-industry contractor’s centralized solution to enable U.S. citizens to strongly prove their digital identities—any more than they would need to rely on a single company to provide them access to the Internet. Instead, like the Internet, the open standards-based ToIP stack (depicted below from the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/">interactive model</a>) would enable citizens to use any digital wallet, any verifiable credentials, and any privacy-respecting biometric verification technologies that meet the requirements of the IRS (as published in their governance framework) to prove a citizen’s identity and give them safe access to their tax records.</p>







<p>There are experts within the US Government that are familiar with, supporting, and promoting the standards associated with decentralized digital identity.&nbsp; They, along with many others internationally, support related ecosystems that enable entities to establish verifiable trust to issue cryptographically verifiable identity attributes that remain in the possession and control of the individual who may then selectively disclose cryptographically verifiable proofs (with or without the underlying identity attributes) through secure channels to verifiers that have established trust.</p>



<p>Where a citizen has a Foundational Identity through a government sanctioned identity proofing process – where the sanctioned entity, as per this <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">NIST Special Publication</a>, was able to “Resolve a claimed identity to a single, unique identity within the context of the population…”, e.g., passport, REALID driver’s license, that Foundational Identity should be used to authenticate an identity claim for each Functional Identity activity like paying taxes, voting, opening a bank account, receiving COVID-19 vaccination, or receiving a COVID-19 vaccination credential.</p>



<p>The ToIP trust ecosystem enables individuals to authenticate themselves using their trusted, cryptographically verifiable Foundational Identity and share cryptographically verifiable Functional Identity proofs without intermediation.</p>



<p>Conclusion&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of pushing proprietary, privacy-diminishing, honey-pot creating solutions, the IRS should strive for open standards-based, interoperable solutions where the individual is in possession and control of their cryptographically verifiable identity attributes (versus a single, private-sector vendor) as are the members of the ToIP Foundation.</p>

   Public users of LEI data are reminded that from March 1, 2022, all GLEIF services will accept and display data in updated Common Data File (CDF) formats, requiring users to implement these new file formats ahead of that deadline for uninterrupted access to LEI data. The updated file formats will increase the level of open, standardized, and high-quality legal entity reference data available within

  <p>Public users of LEI data are reminded that from March 1, 2022, all GLEIF services will accept and display data in updated Common Data File (CDF) formats, requiring users to implement these new file formats ahead of that deadline for uninterrupted access to LEI data. The updated file formats will increase the level of open, standardized, and high-quality legal entity reference data available within the Global LEI Index. </p>
<p>The CDF formats define how LEI issuing organizations report their LEI and reference data. GLEIF published updates to the formats in 2021 to align with the following new ROC policies: </p>
 
 <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20181030-1.pdf">Legal Entity Events (formerly referred to as ‘Corporate Actions’) and Data History in the Global LEI System Policy.</a> CDF revision: Specifies events that alter the entity, the relationship data of a legal entity, or result in the retirement and/or creation of LEIs. 
 <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20190520-1.pdf">Policy on Fund Relationships and Guidelines for the registration of Investment Funds in the Global LEI System.</a> CDF revision: Introduces three new distinct relationship types that can be collected for funds. 
 <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20201229.pdf">LEI Eligibility for General Government Entities Guidance Document</a>. CDF revision: Allows certain legal entities to be classified as Government Entities or International Organizations. 
 
<p>Throughout the month of March, all LEI issuing organizations will migrate to the new formats and undergo testing to ensure a smooth transition. Users of the Global LEI System should therefore be prepared to support content following the existing and new business rules throughout March when performing LEI data analysis. This applies to users of the following LEI data: </p>
 
 GLEIF Concatenated files 
 Golden Copy and Delta files 
 Golden Copy files accessed via the GLEIF API 
 
<p>Data consumers can make their updates to the new format versions in advance of March 1, 2022 as files in the older formats are compatible with the new ones. To support data consumers who are unable to update their data processing by March 1, 2022, GLEIF provides ‘Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations’ (XSLT) which allow these data consumers to transform the newer versions, from a technical format perspective, into the previous versions.</p>
<p>GLEIF has made many supporting resources available on its website, including technical details, example files and a guiding document for the transition period from March 1 to 31, 2022. </p>
<p>After March 31, 2022, GLEIF anticipates a period of up to one year before the Global LEI System will be fully populated with information on Legal Entity Events, Fund Relationships and Government Entities. Data is generally collected at the time of new LEI issuance or existing LEI renewal.</p>
<p>Continuous Access to GLEIF Data in RDF on data.world </p>
<p>In advance of the impending deadline, GLEIF can confirm that a successful collaboration with data.world has ensured that all GLEIF data in RDF (Resource Description Framework) hosted by data.world – which includes the entire Golden Copy XML dataset – has been updated to the new file formats. This will ensure seamless access to LEI linked open data for the global LEI community by data.world, the world’s largest open data community. data.world hosts an Saas-based enterprise data catalog comprising nearly 500,000 open datasets. </p>
<p>Additional support</p>
<p>If you have questions or need additional support ahead of the March 1 deadline, please email GLEIF: <a href="mailto:info@gleif.org">info@gleif.org</a>.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland — 10 February 2022 — Blockdaemon is proud to announce a partnership with <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web</a>, a global nonprofit organization building operating systems for energy grids using open-source decentralized technologies. We at Blockdaemon are no strangers to <a href="https://blockdaemon.com/blog/how-you-can-help-blockchain-go-green/">adopting clean, green-energy blockchain infrastructure</a>. Our partnership with Energy Web furthers our commitment to helping make the world more sustainable.</p><p>Blockdaemon is a certified Energy Web validator node operator, working to support the success of the Energy Web Foundation and ecosystem.</p><p>Energy Web’s digital operating systems for energy are a promising application of blockchain. It makes it easy for clean energy assets to support the grid of the future. This mission is guided by the founding principle of decarbonizing the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The realization of Energy Web’s vision will help result in a secure transition to sustainable energy, by making it seamless and easy for clean energy assets like batteries and electric vehicles to connect to energy markets around the world. It represents one of the largest and most ambitious uses of a decentralized, open-access, consumer-facing blockchain that the world has seen to&nbsp;date.</p><p>Quote Blockdaemon<br>“We are excited to help with the energy transition of the world by supporting the Energy Web Chain and its ecosystem participants. Anyblock has been a validator and active participant from day 1. Now, as part of the Blockdaemon team, we happily continue this collaboration and are looking forward to helping expand to the Polkadot universe and offering staking opportunities.” says Freddy Zwanzger, Ethereum Ecosystem Lead at Blockdaemon.</p><p>“Companies like Blockdaemon are essential to bringing enterprise-grade versions of the Energy Web stack to life,” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web. “Infrastructure services for decentralized applications are common outside the energy sector in the world of Web3. Blockdaemon is helping to bridge the gap by providing Web3 services to the Energy Web community of grid operators and energy&nbsp;majors.”</p> Blockdaemon: Supporting Blockchain Sustainability <p>At Blockdaemon, we support a <a href="https://blockdaemon.com/marketplace/">suite of blockchain</a> networks, each serving a unique role in the industry. The future global landscape will consist of a constellation of interoperable protocols all working together to serve different purposes, interfaced with billions on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p><p>Each protocol will bring its own unique values and benefits. This web of technology will include permissionless networks (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum) and permissioned networks. Energy Web’s network has onboarded major institutions, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/shell-subsidiary-builds-dlt-based-virtual-power-plant-in-germany">such as Shell</a>, to accelerate sustainability.</p><p>As robust transaction ledgers, all of these different types of systems can satisfy the criteria of being a blockchain, yet the DNA of each will be fundamentally different. Bitcoin was the first truly permissionless payment network, with a dynamic and decentralized set of actors all working to keep the network alive. In simple terms, anyone who met the requirements could and still can operate a node, as well as transact on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Today, ledgers such as Energy Web Chain are alternatives to permissionless ledgers such as Bitcoin. These chains often comprise a static and federated set of trusted actors to maintain the integrity of the system while still allowing any developers or users to access the network. Blockdaemon runs a validator node on the Energy Web Chain. Networks like Energy Web’s bring their own unique set of features and functionality.</p><p>Because the Energy Web Chain is managed by known entities in the energy sector, upgrades to the network can be rolled out seamlessly. This avoids contentious hard forks, which split many blockchains in governance disputes over the future of the protocol.</p><p>Another advantage is custody and maintenance. The Energy Web Foundation is building sophisticated tooling on top of the blockchain to help its many partners and its users. This gives a great deal of material support to the Energy Web ecosystem and paves the way for future success. It differs from other Web 3 communities systems, which are often open-source and rely purely on volunteers.</p><p>By having a system focused on enterprise adoption of decentralized technologies, Energy Web Chain is best placed to achieve its vision of a sustainable network, reaching entities who want to use Energy Web’s dApps, SDKs, and utility packages.</p> Energy Web Token’s&nbsp;Staking <p>Energy Web Token (EWT) will soon expand its <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-token-staking-roadmap-54d6fd227eff">staking</a> mechanism. Staking will be key to operating the new energy grid. This energy grid comprises green energy assets, such as solar panels and wind turbines. By staking, enterprises and even clean energy asset owners can commit to delivering the load (or battery for storage) or supply of electricity. The protocol can slash companies or users who do not deliver on commitments. Those who successfully deliver can earn extra&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Staking is open to verified individuals only. All staking operators must create a Decentralized Identifier (DID) that is authorized to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>As the world’s leading staking-as-a-service provider, Blockdaemon delivers industry-leading staking solutions across all major proof-of-stake chains. We commend Energy Web for their embracing of this new staking&nbsp;model.</p> Energy Web &amp; Parity Technologies <p>Energy Web has partnered with Parity Technologies to launch <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/parity-technologies-and-energy-web-partner-to-launch-new-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-205e66529441">Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain</a>. Parity Technologies are a leading Web3 software development company. They have built the core technology that supports Polkadot and Kusama, underpinned by Substrate. Energy Web will leverage Substrate to allow energy sector institutions to deploy their own sovereign, customizable blockchains of their own or in partnership with other energy market participants. This grants enterprises the unrivaled ability to customize their own bespoke chain, with governance and economics built-in.</p><p>Currently, Energy Web runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The launch of the Consortia Relay Chain represents an integration into one of the largest and fastest-growing Web3 ecosystems.</p> Tackling Climate Change with Blockchain <p>In the broad landscape of blockchain technology, Energy Web shows the strongest potential to help achieve a zero-carbon economy.</p><p>Perhaps the most notable of Energy Web’s advantages is its well-established <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/workwithus/our-ecosystem/">institutional partners</a>. These partners include companies such as E.ON, Siemens, Vodafone, and Volkswagen, among many&nbsp;others.</p><p>Energy Web’s commitment to energy sustainability and accessibility to green tech is one with which we at Blockdaemon are strongly aligned. By using blockchain technology, Energy Web is positioned to radically advance one of the major problems facing the world today. This is why we are proud to support Energy Web, as a certified node operator.</p><p>We look forward to continuing our support of Energy Web into the&nbsp;future.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

 memoresa testet Login ohne Passwort mit&nbsp;Lissi memoresa bietet einen einfachen Login ohne Passwort mit dem Lissi Wallet&nbsp;an.<p><a href="https://memoresa.de/de/">memoresa </a>ist der digitale Wegbegleiter für das ganze Leben. Im memoresa-Portal können Nutzerinnen und Nutzer digital vorsorgen, ihren Nachlass planen und Ordnung schaffen — und das alles unter der Prämisse von höchstem Datenschutz und höchster Datensicherheit. Über den Desktop oder das Smartphone können Angelegenheiten aus verschiedensten Lebensbereichen geregelt, geordnet und aktualisiert werden, angefangen bei Versicherungsunterlagen und Immobilien über Online-Zugänge und Mietverträge bis hin zu Patientenverfügungen, Testamenten und Impfnachweisen.</p><p>Zum Authentifizieren bzw. Einloggen in Online-Portale und Apps wird üblicherweise eine Kombination aus E-Mail-Adresse und selbst gewähltem Passwort oder ein von großen Technologieanbietern bereitgestellter Login-Dienst genutzt. Der Login mit Facebook, Google und Co. ist dabei zwar sehr einfach und nutzerzentriert, macht Nutzende jedoch gleichzeitig noch abhängiger von großen Konzernen, die Daten über das Nutzerverhalten häufig an Werbetreibende verkaufen.</p> Login mit dem Lissi Wallet: nutzerzentriert und selbstbestimmt <p>Beim Thema digitale Identität sind sich die europäischen Mitgliedstaaten insofern einig, dass diese in Zukunft mit einem digitalen Wallet verwaltet werden soll. Dies ist eine Anwendung (App) auf dem Endgerät der Nutzenden, welche die Verwaltung von Kontakten und Nachweisen erleichtert. Zwar ist ein sogenannter Social Login über große Technologieanbieter (auch Single Sign-On genannt) genauso nutzerfreundlich wie der Login mit dem Lissi Wallet, zweiterer basiert jedoch auf einer selbstbestimmten Identitätsverwaltung. Damit gehen folgende Vorteile&nbsp;einher:</p><p>Privatsphäre: Daten zum Nutzerverhalten können durch den Login-Anbieter, in diesem Fall Lissi, nicht ausgelesen werden.</p><p>Datenportabilität: Nutzende sind nicht von einem Anbieter abhängig und können den Wallet durch ein kompatibles Wallet ersetzen.</p><p>Einfachheit: Die Login-Nachweise können zusammen mit anderen Identitätsnachweisen in einem Wallet aufbewahrt werden.</p> Der Login-Prozess: 3 Schritte zum selbstbestimmten Login <p>1) Registrierung: Nutzende registrieren sich per E-Mail auf der Seite des Anbieters (in diesem Fall memoresa).</p><p>2) Ausstellung: Im zweiten Schritt wird ein digitaler Nachweis, welcher für den Login genutzt wird, über die <a href="https://portal.memoresa.de/mem/user/account">Einstellungen</a> in memoresa in das <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi Wallet</a> ausgestellt.</p><p>3) Login: Für den Login können Nutzende dann das Lissi-Logo anklicken, um die Authentifizierung mit dem Wallet durchzuführen. Dies funktioniert sowohl auf einem Computer als auch auf dem Smartphone.</p> Zusammenarbeit: Mit memoresa und Lissi zum selbstbestimmten Login <p>Für memoresa stehen Datenschutz und Selbstbestimmtheit der Nutzerinnen und Nutzer an erster Stelle. Die Sicherheit der Daten, die im memoresa-Portal eingetragen und hochgeladen werden, wird durch verschiedenste Maßnahmen gewährleistet, und soll auch beim Login ins Portal gegeben sein. Aus diesem Grund möchte memoresa eine Login-Möglichkeit anbieten, die die Nutzenden nicht abhängig von großen Technologiekonzern wie Apple, Google und Facebook macht. Für das Lissi-Team ging es bei der Zusammenarbeit primär darum, den Prozess und die Software außerhalb der eigenen Domäne zu testen und Nutzerinnen und Nutzern einen digitalen Dienst mit gesellschaftlichem Mehrwert anzubieten.</p> Integration mit Lissi&nbsp;Connect: <p>Die Option, sich ohne Passwort bei Plattformen einzuloggen, wird heutzutage von Nutzenden erwartet. Serviceanbieter suchen nach Integrationen, welche von Nutzenden angenommen werden und einfach zu integrieren sind. Zusätzlich zur Authentifizierung der Nutzer bietet Lissi Connect als Software-as-a-Service-Lösung (SaaS) die Möglichkeit, digitale Nachweise auszustellen und abzufragen.</p> Ausblick: <p>Bei der Integration handelt es sich um einen Test, welcher allen Beteiligten mehr Erfahrung in der Praxis liefert. Wir sind mit der Funktionsweise und der bisherigen Integration sehr zufrieden, wissen aber auch, dass noch weitere Aspekte notwendig sind. Dazu zählt, dass die Registrierung direkt mit dem Wallet möglich ist, und nicht erst ein klassischer Account mit Passwort angelegt werden muss. Auch die Exportfunktion des Lissi Wallet soll künftig verfügbar gemacht&nbsp;werden.</p><p>Das Thema digitale Vorsorge ist ein wichtiger Aspekt unserer zunehmend digitalen Gesellschaft, welches aktuell noch zu wenig Aufmerksamkeit erhält. Wir freuen uns, zusammen einfache Lösungen zu schaffen und dabei die Werte und Prinzipien unserer Gesellschaft zu&nbsp;leben.</p><p>Das Lissi Team<br>Main Incubator GmbH</p><p>memoresa GmbH</p>

<p>If you're a developer building decentralized applications, you have been faced with uncomfortable tradeoffs in choosing how to manage data. The two available options available have held back Web3 apps:</p><p>Option 1 has been to use a smart contract (blockchain-based) backend and a static frontend. The downside of this option is that these apps are not very feature-rich, since putting a bunch of data on a smart contract blockchain is expensive. As a result, these applications are often minimalist and have limited customization and optionality for users. Even putting content on IPFS and managing mutations through a smart contract is prohibitively slow and expensive. This path is for the decentralization idealists.</p><p>Option 2 has been to sacrifice sovereignty and spin up a traditional backend for any data that doesn't strictly need to be in a smart contract. For example, token balances and yields are on-chain while chats and settings are on a centralized server.</p> <p>What if there was a way to give users full sovereign control over their data while getting access to not just the data from your application but many other compatible ones? What if you could promise users that their information would live in a decentralized network where no individual application developer or company could choose to take it down or tamper with, that they own their data in the truest sense? What if you could build your application with rich data features, and without a backend or expensive smart contracts?</p><p>Now you can.</p> A sovereign datastore <p>With <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/did-datastore/">DID Datastore</a> on top of Ceramic, you can create a datastore for each of your users’ blockchain accounts. Or even let them link multiple accounts (like various wallets from different blockchains) to the same datastore. And with that datastore, you can structure, store, and update any kind of information required in your application — without a backend or smart contract. This is enabled by 3 concepts: DIDs, Data Models, and the DID Datastore itself.</p><p>DIDs are <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/authentication/3id-did/method/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>, an emerging technical standard that enables verifiable, decentralized, interoperable digital identities. A DID can refer to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.). By using DIDs to manage datastores, data can traverse platforms and blockchains and be associated with any entity, including NFTs.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels">DataModels</a> describe the data linked to the DID that will be stored in the datastore. The DataModel defines the shape (or schema) of your data, which can then be referenced by every datastore for every user that interacts with that data model. Developers can define the DataModel for their app, then give users full sovereign control over all their data records.</p><p>The DID Datastore itself is the table of datastores that a DID controls, each of which points to the relevant data model. This creates a way to structure and associate data to any Web3 identity, all without a backend or smart contract. Since the data lives on a decentralized network (Ceramic) controlled by each user (DID), data from app A is not locked into app A. App B can also read and modify the same data if granted permission to do so.</p> The Internet’s User Table <p>With each user managing their own DID Datastore, and apps free to discover and create the Data Models they require, something new and powerful emerges: a shared, distributed user table for Web3.</p><p>In this table, each row represents a user (DID) and each column is a DataModel (created by an app). Both can be discovered by any user or application and expanded infinitely.</p><p>Each user has full sovereign control over their row(s) and can bring that data with them to each app they visit. If an app wants to know what data is available and how to use it, they can reference the data model which will contain a name, description, and other metadata. The data in your columns may be public or encrypted depending on the application and use case.</p> What next? <p>Want to start building with DID Datastore?

<p>by Stephan Wolf, CEO, Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF)</p>



<p>In May 2020 the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), the not-for-profit body established by the G20 and the Financial Stability Board to oversee the Global LEI System, became a founding contributing member of the Trust over IP Foundation. Its vision? That every legal entity should have one global identity, and this should include a digital identity.</p>



<p>Since 2014, under GLEIF’s stewardship, the Global LEI System has been providing open and reliable data enabling the unambiguous identification of organizations (‘legal entities’) around the world. With almost two million unique identifiers (LEIs) now in use, the system has already delivered much needed transparency to financial markets, for both regulators and participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GLEIF is now broadening its horizons to drive LEI adoption across all sectors and industries, with the goal of establishing the LEI as the de-facto choice for organizational identity globally.</p>



<p>Enabling digitized trust is central to GLEIF’s proposition. Particularly so considering the huge and sustained surge in legal entities engaging in digital transactions. The pace of digital transformation shows no sign of abating, and the business of manually performing background checks on legal entities already inflates costs and causes huge unnecessary delays.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GLEIF and ToIP agree that there is an urgent, unmet need&nbsp;for greater security, convenience, and ease-of-use in digital identity for organizations and the persons that represent them in either official or functional roles. To address this need, in late 2020,&nbsp;GLEIF launched a global cross-industry development program designed to create&nbsp;a fully digitized, cryptographically verifiable LEI (vLEI) service. Since then, GLEIF together with stakeholders across a wide range of sectors has been working in full accordance with the standards of the Trust over IP Foundation to develop the vLEI’s technical underpinnings and its Ecosystem Governance Framework, which was published for ToIP Foundation member review.</p>



<p>To date, the Framework is the most comprehensive ever developed based on the ToIP Governance Metamodel and is a great, early-stage example of how the potential of the ToIP Stack can be realized to digitally enhance an already established global system. It shows how a secure, interoperable, and massively scalable decentralized trust layer can enable existing services to get ahead of the critical issues relating to authentication and verification that otherwise threaten a smooth transition to the digital realm and all the benefits that delivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once established, vLEI system will be capable of establishing digital trust between all legal entities, everywhere.&nbsp;It will give government organizations, companies, and other legal entities worldwide the capacity to use non-repudiable identification data pertaining to their legal status, ownership structure and authorized representatives in a growing multitude of digital business activities,&nbsp;such as approving business transactions and contracts, onboarding customers, transacting within import/export and supply chain business networks, and submitting regulatory filings and reports.</p>



<p>The vLEI has a bright future. It has the potential to become one of the most valuable digital credentials in the world because it is the hallmark of authenticity for a legal entity of any kind. The family of digital credentials in the GLEIF vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework can serve as a chain of trust for anyone needing to verify the legal identity of an organization or of a person legally acting on that organization’s behalf. The demand this will create for LEIs — and the impact it will have on adoption of self-sovereign identity — cannot be overestimated. It will be a sea change for digital trust infrastructure that will benefit every country, company, and citizen in the world.</p>

  <p>For businesses the world over, confidence in digital authenticity is in short supply. Can you be sure that your bank’s website is not an elaborate phishing recreation? Did that e-invoice really come from your business partner? How can you tell?</p>
<p>As businesses increasingly cooperate and transact remotely and across borders, the systems they use to establish trust also need to evolve. </p>
<p>GLEIF has been working to address this requirement directly, by extending the Global LEI System to incorporate a ‘verifiable LEI’ (vLEI) a standardized, digitized version of the LEI capable of enabling instant, automated trust between legal entities and their authorized representatives, and the counterparty legal entities and representatives with which they interact. </p>
<p>Keen for more detail on the vLEI? Read our free <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei/gleif-ebook-the-vlei-introducing-digital-i-d-for-legal-entities-everywhere">eBook: ‘The vLEI: Introducing Digital I.D. for Legal Entities Everywhere’</a></p>
<a href="https://www.gleif.org/thumbs/newsroom/blog/the-birth-of-the-vlei-a-new-dawn-in-digital-id-for-legal-entities-everywhere/gleif_vlei-ebook-750x530.jpg"></a>
<p>To trust in the future, the business world needs the LEI</p>
<p>Under GLEIF’s stewardship, the Global LEI System has, for years, been providing open and reliable data enabling the unambiguous identification of legal entities around the world. With over two million LEIs now in use, GLEIF is now taking steps to build on its success by driving voluntary LEI adoption among legal entities across all industries globally, to establish the LEI as the world’s de-facto system of organizational identity.</p>
<p>Helping legal entities to participate efficiently in the world’s digital economy is central to this goal. But it’s a dangerous world out there, and things are moving fast. In 2021 alone, cybercrime cost the global economy an estimated $6 trillion.  New business models and newly automated processes are springing up all the time, fueled by myriad advances in technology, from APIs, to blockchain, to IoT. </p>
<p>Against this backdrop it’s easy to see why digital trust between legal entities is scarce. Yet this is precisely what is needed: when legal entities digitally engage with their customers, partners, and suppliers, they must be able to trust that these organizations are, indeed, who they claim to be. </p>
<p>The creation of digitized trust, therefore, is central to GLEIF’s ongoing work. We believe that each legal entity worldwide should have just one global identity, capable of supporting its participation in the digital economy. Only then can everyone work together in ways that will unlock the true potential of digitalization: enabling innovation and collaboration to thrive unlimited by geography, and money, goods, and services to flow securely around the world faster, more efficiently, and at a lower cost than ever before. </p>
<p>A new digital trust ecosystem for legal entities everywhere</p>
<p>GLEIF has been working to extend the Global LEI System to address this requirement directly. Our work began by engaging with existing systems that enable digital trust by, for example, standardizing the way in which a legal entity’s LEI code could be <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/blog/the-lei-the-missing-ingredient-in-digital-certificate-management">embedded in digital certificates</a>. </p>
<p>In parallel, we also sought out next-gen technologies that could be developed to create a new system. </p>
<p>In early 2020, the idea to create a digitally verifiable version of the LEI - the vLEI - was born. Its concept was simple: to enable a legal entity to leverage its LEI to establish instant, digitized trust with counterparty organizations and their representatives. </p>
<p>Move fast and create things</p>
<p>By December 2020, a series of research initiatives had confirmed demand from the pharmaceutical, healthcare, telecom, financial services and automotive sectors, and prompted GLEIF to <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-advances-digital-trust-and-identity-for-legal-entities-globally">launch an international, cross-industry development program</a>. The program’s objective was to create an ecosystem and credential governance framework, together with a technical supporting infrastructure, for the vLEI. </p>
<p>Three months later, in February 2021, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-unveils-issuance-and-infrastructure-models-for-verifiable-lei">GLEIF unveiled its models for the vLEI’s technical infrastructure and issuance process</a>, outlining how a legal entity’s LEI code would be wrapped in Verifiable Credentials and issued by GLEIF, via a network of qualified vLEI issuers, to legal entities. The infrastructure establishes GLEIF as the digital ‘root of trust’ that safeguards the integrity of the vLEI trust chain. This means all vLEIs are traceable, through a cryptographically protected chain of credentials, back to their source LEI record in the Global LEI Index.</p>
<p>GLEIF also recognized that universal adoption by legal entities required the vLEI system to interoperate seamlessly and securely with all technology models, including blockchains, cloud services and APIs. To accomplish this, GLEIF adopted a ‘network of networks’ approach enabled by the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) protocol. </p>
<p>Using KERI, vLEIs can be created and utilized independently of any specific organization, with the highest levels of security, privacy, and ease of use. KERI also enables GLEIF and the vLEI trust ecosystem to operate under GLEIF’s governance framework, unencumbered by the governance of external systems, including those of blockchains and distributed ledger consortia. </p>
<p>Curious about KERI? Check out our explainer video below. </p>

<p>A busy year ahead: Software, governance, standardization, and field trials</p>
<p>2022 is already alive with vLEI activity. </p>
<p>In February, GLEIF has <a href="https://content5.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-and-trust-over-ip-foundation-publish-ecosystem-governance-framework-for-digitally-verifiable-lei">published the vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework</a>, in full accordance with the standards and recommendations of the Trust Over IP Foundation (hosted by the Linux Foundation). The Framework, which has been designed from the ground up to complement GLEIF’s existing LEI governance, defines the vLEI operational model and describes how the new ecosystem’s range of vLEI issuing stakeholders will qualify for and perform their roles in the Global LEI System. It provides essential detail on the governance structures and processes that will shape the development of the vLEI ecosystem together with the services that GLEIF will provide.</p>
<p>Also in in 2022, after a year in development and sandbox testing, the open-source vLEI beta software will enter field trials in a variety of vertical industry applications. The software will deliver functionality supporting the issuance, presentation, and revocation of the vLEI’s Verifiable Credentials, and provides secure key management using the KERI protocol. </p>
<p>Lastly, GLEIF’s standardization work with the ISO/TC 68/SC 8 Committee is also approaching completion, with an international standard (ISO 5009) for defining official organizational roles in financial services reference data currently ‘under publication’.  Once launched, the ISO 5009 standard will permit global uniformity of the listing of official organizational roles in a structured way, so they may be specified by a legal entity and incorporated into its vLEI official organizational role credentials. Similarly, the standard will also enable organizational roles to be referenced uniformly and embedded in other digital assets leveraging the LEI, such as digital certificates, now and in the future.</p>
<p>A bright future</p>
<p>The vLEI has the potential to become one of the most valuable digital credentials in the world; it is designed to become the hallmark of authenticity for any legal entity, anywhere. This new family of digital credentials can serve as a chain of trust for anyone needing to verify the legal identity of an organization or of a person legally acting on that organization’s behalf. It changes the game in digital organizational identity and will represent a sea change in digital trust that will benefit every country, company, and, ultimately, citizen in the world.</p>

 <p><a href="https://daohaus.club">DAOhaus</a>’ mission is to unlock the next tier of community coordination by facilitating the transition from traditional organizations to DAOs.</p><p>DAOs are the most powerful way for communities to achieve their shared purpose and live their shared values, and DAOhaus strives to be the best platform for communities to do just that. DAOhaus is home to an ecosystem of hundreds of purpose-driven community DAOs. From giving grants, to building products, bringing together guilds of professionals, and even investing, DAOs using the DAOhaus platform are all focused on one core thing: empowering the humans in their community to achieve their shared purpose and values.</p><p>Do you belong to a community with those goals? <a href="http://daohaus.club/summon">Summon a DAO today on DAOhaus</a>! Or, if you're looking to find a community that resonates with you, explore <a href="http://daohaus.club/explore">the hundreds of DAOs already using DAOhaus</a>. </p> What is DAOhaus? <p>The DAOhaus platform is the easiest way for anyone to start a DAO. DAOs are a framework to help communities coordinate and achieve their shared goals.</p>No clue what a DAO is? Check out this 2 min explainer.<p>At its core, DAOhaus is a human-friendly way for DAO members to engage in the activities that allow them to collectively manage common resources in service of a shared purpose, without relying on trusted executives. With DAOhaus, you can:</p>  Form (“summon”) a new DAO  Issue members "Shares" representing voting power and economic exit rights &nbsp;(aka “<a href="https://daohaus.substack.com/p/rage-quit-exit-rights-and-real-skin">ragequit</a>”)  Set up a shared Treasury that is controlled collectively by all members  Make and vote on proposals with Shares   Extending the functionality of DAO tooling <p>DAOhaus also empowers DAOs beyond these foundational activities. For example, using a feature called Minions, DAOs can interact with any external smart contract, for example to make a deposit into another DeFi protocol, buy an NFT, or disperse tokens to multiple recipients. Minions can also have more narrowly-scoped functionality, such as with our <a href="https://www.superfluid.finance/home">Superfluid</a> Minion that allows a DAO to send and receive token streams (think sending contributors a continuous stream of payment rather than a lump sump after all work has been delivered).</p><p>These Minions are one kind of DAOhaus Boost, which are add-ons that DAOs can optionally install to expand their capabilities. Some Boosts are built by the DAOhaus core contributors, though many are built by community developers. All Boosts are discoverable, installable and configurable through the DAOhaus Boost Marketplace. Some examples of Boosts include Rarible Boost (which helps you buy &amp; sell NFTs on <a href="https://daohaus.club/market">Rarible</a>) and Disperse Boost (which allows you to transfer tokens to other addresses).</p><p>DAOhaus aims to support purpose-driven community DAOs wherever they may be, and as such the platform is available on Ethereum Mainnet, xDai Polygon, Arbitrum, and Celo, with support for more EVM-compatible networks on the way!</p> The need for context around DAO member identity <p>DAOs are human-centric communities. With DAOhaus, DAO members make decisions and take collective action by coordinating explicitly with each other. It is imperative that DAO members are able to identify one another (whether with real names or pseudonymously) and have a shared understanding of who is involved in their community - whether that be leading a working group or submitting, sponsoring or voting on a given proposal. Without easy access to that context, members have difficulty navigating the social landscape of their DAO, which magnifies coordination overhead and stunts the community’s cultural evolution.</p>Account-based DAO member identities create friction in coordination<p>Identity in web3, as is the case in most DAOs today, is typically address based. Users represent themselves as their wallet or account address, but long hex strings are not sufficient. While ENS names are great for Ethereum mainnet, they don’t currently work across all the networks DAOhaus supports. Users need a human-readable identity solution that works across networks and the many tools DAOs commonly use.</p><p>Additionally, today DAOhaus relies on several centralized storage and API endpoints for things like DAO metadata (e.g., names, tags, descriptions, social media links, etc.) and Boost settings. As the team moves towards a more modular and open architecture to allow developers to further extend the platform and more easily build Boosts, they've begun migrating towards more decentralized storage and data solutions.</p><blockquote>"We needed a performant, decentralized storage solution to store user data, and Ceramic was the obvious choice," - Keating, DAOhaus core contributor</blockquote> Embedding identity as a coordination mechanism <p>To help DAOs better understand who is participating in thier communities, DAOhaus is using Ceramic to create rich and robust member profiles. Using Ceramic’s <a>Self.ID</a> to collect and display member names, avatars and emojis, members can now add clarity and a touch of personalization to their DAOhaus identity.</p><p>DAOhaus users can edit their Self.Id identity in the Profile section of any DAO they are involved in.</p>Create once, replicate many Interoperability across web3 <p>Since Self.ID is built on Ceramic's permissionless data network, all user data stored in their profiles are:</p>  User-controlled: users own their own data and decide how and when applications can access it  Composable &amp; portable: application developers can access data from this shared data layer (if users already have a Self.Id created, the data will be displayed automatically within the DAOhaus app, and displayed in every other web3 app that uses Ceramic for profiles)  Decentralized: data is stored in a decentralized manner, so no single application can censor, shut down or delete your data  Multi-chain: with Ceramic, users can connect multiple accounts and wallets to a single DID to create a unified identity   Unified, human-readable identities create more robust communities &amp; reputation systems<p>Member profiles are available today on DAOhaus. Looking ahead, the team is exploring using Ceramic to power decentralized data for DAO organizational profiles, as well as metadata, Boost configuration, rich marketplace metadata, and more.</p><p>Having an identity controlled by a DAO framework enables a DAO to represent itself within web3 protocols and applications. The DAO identity would be represented as a decentralized identifier (DID) created on Ceramic, which could be linked to a multi-signature account (such as a Gnosis Safe) or Moloch DAO, ensuring multiple participants would need to sign off before any changes are made to any data. In this way, DAOs would be able to write and store data directly to the Ceramic network. </p> What's next for DAOhaus? <p>Core contributors of DAOhaus have released a new version of Minion that uses the Gnosis Zodiac protocol to allow a DAO to control a Gnosis Safe, adding new capabilities such as expedited execution of proposals and the ability to pull funds from the DAO Treasury in Minion proposals.</p><p>The DAOhaus community has been busy too, adding, among other things, two new Boosts in the Boost Marketplace: the <a href="https://daohaus.club/docs/users/boosts/rarible-boost">Rarible Boost</a>, which enables DAOs to to buy and sell NFTs, and the <a href="https://daohaus.club/docs/users/boosts/disperse-boost">Disperse Boost</a>, which enables DAOs to distribute tokens to multiple recipients in a single proposal.</p><p>Beyond these product releases, the team has been busy launching other community initiatives and onboarding more DAOs! If you want to see what else the team has accomplished in 2021, check out their <a href="http://daohaus.club/review">Year in Review</a>. </p><p>Looking forward, the team is preparing to support the new <a href="https://github.com/Moloch-Mystics/Baal/">MolochV3 (Baal) DAO framework</a>, which will add even more flexibility for DAOs. The new framework would give DAOs more support throughout the entire lifecycle, from additional options for summoning a new DAO, to vote delegation, embedded Minion functionality, and the ability to make Shares transferable. The team is also working on expanding support for additional L2 networks and sidechains, such as Optimism and potentially Fantom.</p><p>If you’re a member of an existing community looking to level up its coordination powers, or interested in starting a new community yourself, you can <a href="http://app.daohaus.club/summon">summon a DAO today</a> with DAOhaus!</p><p>If you’re a developer or builder looking to contribute, hop into the <a href="https://discord.gg/daohaus">DAOhaus Discord</a> &amp; let the community know! The community is actively looking for contributors to help build more Boosts to give DAOs even better tooling to pursue their purpose. </p><p>If you just want to learn more about DAOs, follow the team on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/nowdaoit">@nowdaoit</a>) and <a href="https://daohaus.substack.com/">Substack</a>, or head to <a href="https://daohaus.club">daohaus.club</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://ceramic.network">Website</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a> | <a href="http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic">GitHub</a> | <a href="http://developers.ceramic.network">Documentation</a> |<a href="https://forum.avax.network/"> </a><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX Identity</a></p>

 Count Calories Better, Diet Healthier — Guide Of All What You Need To&nbsp;Know  The Dos and Don’ts of Counting&nbsp;Calories  Do: <p>When it comes to counting calories, there are a few dos that will help you stay on track and achieve your weight loss&nbsp;goals.</p>  Use a <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/diet-calories-calculator/">diet calories calculator</a> app or website to track your intake. This will ensure accuracy and make it easier to stay on&nbsp;track.  Read the nutrition labels of all foods you eat. This will help you know how many calories are in each&nbsp;serving.  Create a calorie budget for yourself, and try to stick to it. This will help you lose weight gradually and&nbsp;safely.  Do make sure to include all foods and beverages in your calorie count. This includes those pesky little extras like condiments and sugar-free beverages.  Do be honest with yourself about how many calories you need to lose weight. If you want to lose 1–2 pounds per week, then aim to consume 500–1000 fewer calories than you burn each&nbsp;day.  Do adjust your calorie intake as needed. If you hit a plateau or if you start gaining weight, then adjust your calorie intake accordingly. A good rule of thumb is to reduce your intake by 100–200 calories per day until you start seeing results&nbsp;again.  Do focus on healthy foods that are low in calories but high in nutrients. This will help ensure that you are getting the most out of your diet while still losing weight. Some great options include vegetables, fruits, lean protein, and whole&nbsp;grains.”  <p>Check also: <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/benefits-of-red-beans/">Red bean&nbsp;benefits</a></p> Don’t: <p>If you’re trying to lose weight, counting calories is a great way to do it. But there are a few things you should avoid if you want to see results. Here are four don’ts of counting calories:</p>  Count calories without also considering other factors such as protein, carbohydrates, and fat. All of these nutrients play important roles in your health and should be taken into account when counting calories.  Skip meals or go too long between meals. This can cause you to become ravenous and overeat later&nbsp;on.  Obsess over every little calorie that you consume. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and obsessing over every calorie will only lead to stress and unhealthy eating&nbsp;habits.  Don’t forget about fiber. Fiber is another important nutrient, and it’s especially important when dieting. Make sure you’re getting enough fiber each day to help keep you full and support your weight loss&nbsp;goals  Don’t forget about carbs. Carbs are also an important part of a healthy diet, and they’re especially important when dieting. Make sure you’re getting enough carbs each day to help burn fat and fuel your workouts.  Don’t forget about protein. Protein is an important part of a healthy diet, and it’s especially important when dieting. Make sure you’re getting enough protein each day to help burn fat and build&nbsp;muscle.  Don’t overdo it. It’s important not to eat too few calories, as this can actually slow down your metabolism and make it more difficult to lose weight. Try to find the right balance for you, and don’t cut more than 500–750 calories per&nbsp;day.   The Pros and Cons of Calorie&nbsp;Counting <p>Calorie counting is a popular way to keep track of the number of calories you eat each&nbsp;day.</p><p>This can be an effective way to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. However, there are some pros and cons to calorie counting. The Pros of Calorie&nbsp;Counting</p>  You are in control of your food choices. When you are calorie counting, you are able to choose the foods that fit within your daily calorie budget. This can help you make healthier food choices and avoid unhealthy foods.  <p>2. It is an easy way to track progress. By keeping track of the number of calories you consume each day, you can see how your diet changes over time. This can be helpful in monitoring your progress and seeing if your current diet is working for&nbsp;you.</p><p>3. It helps you become more aware of portion sizes. Often when we don’t count calories, we tend to underestimate how much we are actually eating. Calorie counting can help teach you about proper portion sizes and how much food constitutes a serving&nbsp;size.</p><p>4. It may increase your metabolism&nbsp;. Some research has shown that people who calorie count may have a higher metabolic rate than those who do not count calories&nbsp;. This could lead to more successful weight loss in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>The Cons of Calorie&nbsp;Counting</p><p>1&nbsp;. It can be time consuming&nbsp;. Keeping track of every calorie that goes into your mouth can be a tedious process&nbsp;.</p><p>2&nbsp;. You may become obsessed with numbers&nbsp;. Focusing too much on numbers can lead to eating disorders and unhealthy relationships with food&nbsp;.</p><p>3&nbsp;. You might develop restrictive eating habits&nbsp;. Restricting yourself from certain foods can cause negative thoughts about food and body image&nbsp;issues</p> How to make Calorie counting effective   Make sure you’re accurately counting your calories. A lot of people make mistakes when counting, either by underestimating or overestimating the number of calories in their food. Use a calorie tracking app or website to get an accurate estimate of the calories in your&nbsp;meals.  <p>2. Don’t obsess over every little thing. If you eat a cookie or have a slice of pizza, don’t worry — just adjust your calorie intake for the rest of the day to make up for it. Trying to be perfect can be counterproductive and lead to feelings of guilt and frustration.</p><p>3. Find a method that works for you. Some people prefer to track their calories manually, while others find it more helpful to use an app or online calculator. Figure out what works best for you and stick with&nbsp;it.</p><p>4. Be patient. Losing weight takes time, so don’t expect results overnight. Stick with it for several weeks before deciding if calorie counting is right for&nbsp;you.</p><p>5. Make a list of foods that you enjoy and that are healthy. This will help you stay on track with your diet and make it more enjoyable.</p><p>6. Try to stick to healthy, nutrient-rich foods as much as possible. This will help you meet your nutritional needs while keeping your calorie intake in&nbsp;check.</p><p>7. Avoid processed foods whenever possible. These tend to be high in unhealthy fats, sugars and sodium, which can sabotage your weight loss&nbsp;efforts.</p><p>8. Drink plenty of water and avoid sugary drinks. Water is essential for good health and helps keep you feeling full throughout the day. Sugary drinks are packed with empty calories and can quickly derail your diet&nbsp;plans.</p> conclusion <p>We do Counting Calories for three purposes:</p><p>If you’re trying to lose&nbsp;weight:</p><p>Counting calories is a great way to help achieve your goals. There are many online tools and apps that can help with&nbsp;this.</p><p>Second, make sure you’re burning more calories than you’re eating. This can be done through exercise and physical activity.</p><p>Finally, give yourself time. It may take a while for your body to adjust to your new calorie intake, so be patient and keep up with your healthy&nbsp;habits.</p><p>Check also: <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/best-parsley-tea-brands/">Best parsley tea&nbsp;bags</a></p><p>If you are looking to gain&nbsp;weight:</p><p>You need to consume more calories than you burn. The average person needs around 2,000–2,500 calories per day to maintain their weight, so if you want to gain weight, you’ll need to eat more than&nbsp;that.</p><p>It’s best to spread your extra calories throughout the day, with three main meals and a couple of snacks in between. You can use a calorie calculator to help you determine how many calories you should be eating each&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you are looking to maintain&nbsp;weight:</p><p>By simply eat as much as you&nbsp;burn.</p>

<p>The Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation today announced the release of its first two official specifications for ToIP-compliant <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/gswg/glossary#governance-framework">governance frameworks</a> (aka trust frameworks):</p>



  The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Architecture Specification V1.0</a> (PDF).  The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Metamodel Specification V1.0</a> (PDF).  



<p>Produced by the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group">ToIP Governance Stack Working Group</a> (GSWG), these two specifications together with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-Companion-Guide-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Metamodel Specification Companion Guide V1.0</a> are tools that CIOs, CISOs, Chief Privacy Officers, trust architects, and other policymakers can begin using immediately to construct a governance framework for any of <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/">the four ToIP layers</a> of decentralized digital trust infrastructure.</p>



<p>“In our first 18 months the GSWG has produced 11 deliverables,” said GSWG co-chair <a href="https://www.schellman.com/scott-perry">Scott Perry</a>, Principal of the <a href="https://www.schellman.com/crypto-digital-trust-services">Crypto and Digital Trust Services practice at Schellman</a>, a leading global provider of attestation, compliance, and certification services. “These are the first two official ToIP specifications that define what a governance framework must include to comply with the <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/">ToIP model</a>.”</p>



<p>These specifications and the Companion Guide have already been used to craft the first governance frameworks for ToIP-based digital trust ecosystems. “When the <a href="https://www.yoma.foundation/">Yoma&nbsp; (Youth Agency Marketplace) project</a> needed decentralized governance, starting with the ToIP governance model saved us months of time,” said Lohan Spies, CTO of Yoma. “It also helped us produce a governance framework in which all the major stakeholders—Yoma, Generation Unlimited, GIZ, youth, service providers, donors, developers—had confidence.”</p>



<p>These three deliverables are also the first from ToIP to incorporate terms from the ToIP Foundation’s cross-industry glossary development project. “The subjects of digital identity and trust are extremely challenging to discuss with great clarity,” said Drummond Reed, who co-chairs both the GSWG and the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65700">ToIP Concepts and Terminology Working Group</a> (CTWG). “These deliverables use the CTWG <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Terms+Wikis">terms wiki</a> and glossary development tools to link together terms curated by experts in each relevant domain.”</p>



 About the Governance Half of the ToIP Stack 



<p>The mission of the ToIP Foundation is to define a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust that combines cryptographic assurance at the machine layer with human accountability at the business, legal, and social layers. This four-layer architecture is referred to as the ToIP stack, summarized in this diagram (and in <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/">this interactive model</a>):</p>







<p>This diagram highlights that the ToIP stack is fundamentally composed of two halves:</p>



  The technology stack defines the technical standards and protocols needed to establish interoperable technical trust (aka cryptographic trust) at each of the four layers.  The governance stack defines the requirements for governance frameworks (aka trust frameworks) to specify the policies and rules the members of a community need to follow to achieve institutional trust (aka human trust) at each of the four layers.  



<p>The central premise of the ToIP model is that neither half alone is sufficient to achieve interoperable decentralized digital trust infrastructure. You must have both halves working together.</p>



 About the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Architecture Specification V1.0</a> 



<p>A specific governance framework is designed for a specific layer of the ToIP stack (public utility, agent/wallet, credential, or ecosystem). However, certain interoperability requirements apply to all ToIP-compliant governance frameworks regardless of layer. The purpose of this relatively short (10 page) specification is to specify those overall requirements. It consists of five sections:</p>



  Identification—the requirements for ToIP governance framework documents—and the parties they govern—to be identified by persistent, verifiable, globally unique <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifiers (DIDs)</a>.  Verification—the requirements for ToIP governance framework documents to be digitally signed by their <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary#governing-authority">governing authorities</a>—and for all <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary#governed-party">governed parties</a> to have a means of cryptographically verifying the GF role in which they are serving using either a <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary#verifiable-credential">verifiable credential</a>, a <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary#trust-registry">trust registry</a>, or both.  Transparency—the requirements for any publicly-available ToIP governance framework document to be published on the Web and discoverable via its DID. It also covers localization and accessibility.  Technical Interoperability—the requirements for a ToIP governance framework to specify technical interop using the ToIP Technology Stack.  ToIP Governance Metamodel—the requirement to comply with the ToIP Governance Metamodel Specification (below).  



 About the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Metamodel Specification V1.0</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-Companion-Guide-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">Companion Guide</a> 



<p>The standard structure of a ToIP-compliant governance framework—the documents it should include, and the content required or recommended in each document—were extensive enough that these were broken into a separate 13-page specification that is divided into two parts:</p>



  Primary Document. This is the “master document” or “home page” of a ToIP governance framework. The specification covers the following 13 sections of this document:  Introduction  Terminology and Notation  Localization  Governing Authority  Administering Authority  Purpose  Scope  Objectives  Principles  General Requirements  Revisions  Extensions  Schedule of Controlled Documents    Controlled Documents. These are subdocuments that form component “modules” of a ToIP-compliant governance framework. This modular architecture is recommended to simplify revisions and delegate policymaking to the most appropriate parties.  Glossary  Risk Assessment  Trust Assurance and Certification  Governance Requirements  Business Requirements  Technical Requirements  Information Trust Requirements (security, privacy, confidentiality, etc.)  Inclusion, Equitability, and Accessibility Requirements  Legal Agreements    



<p>The GSWG also produced the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-Companion-Guide-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Metamodel Specification Companion Guide V1.0</a> to serve as 28-page “users manual” intended to give governance framework authors the background, context, and guidelines they need in the drafting process. It also suggests the policy areas for which the authors may want to consult subject matter experts (SMEs) within their own community and/or external professionals.</p>



 Future Specifications Coming from the GSWG 



<p>With this milestone accomplished, the next goal of the GSWG is to produce layer-specific templates for ToIP-compliant governance frameworks. These templates will specify the roles and processes, and governance best practices recommended for each of the four layers of the ToIP stack. Look for future announcements coming from the ToIP Foundation about these templates.If you have a particular interest in decentralized digital trust governance, we invite you to join the work of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group">ToIP Governance Stack Working Group</a>.

<p>New XACML system component is ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the approval and publication of a new Committee Specification by the members of the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) TC [1]:</p>



<p>XACML v3.0 Dynamic Attribute Authority Version 1.0<br>Committee Specification 01<br>25 January 2022</p>



 Overview 



<p>This specification defines a new XACML system component, the Dynamic Attribute Authority, which augments the request context of an XACML authorization request with additional attributes and attribute values that are generated on demand according to a set of rules. The rules are expressed as XACML policies, use obligations to specify the additional attributes and values, and are processed in the normal manner of a Policy Decision Point. This means that a Dynamic Attribute Authority can be readily constructed from existing XACML system components.</p>



<p>A primary use case for the Dynamic Attribute Authority is role enablement, where the dynamic attribute in question is the subject role.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>

<p>Finally, back together again. The 3Box Labs team will be arriving at the Sports Castle in full force this year, elated to see the community reconvening after the 2021 hiatus. We’re thrilled to announce that we’ll be joining this developer-first event as a Sponsor again this year. We exist to empower web3 builders and are excited to support more developers than ever during both the live and virtual hackathons. If you’re heading to Denver, make sure to stop by our booth to chat sovereign data, composable apps, and all things Web3 -- and to grab a limited edition Ceramic beanie!</p><p>If you’re interested in getting involved, it’s not too late to join! <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/">Submit your application here.</a></p> What’s Ceramic? <p>For those not yet familiar, Ceramic’s decentralized data protocol and identity system gives developers a complete solution for managing user and application data on the open web. With Ceramic, Developers can build decentralized applications that easily store, update and retrieve data from a shared network. Think IPFS, but mutable. </p><p>Additionally, this data is written and managed by users themselves, as compared to application developers. On Ceramic, data is controlled by decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that allow users to create a unified digital self by linking data and accounts from various wallets, chains and platforms. Developers can leverage Ceramic’s shared infrastructure to easily reuse data across applications. With Ceramic, users can create a single profile that multiple apps can read and present uniquely on their respective front-ends, instead of tirelessly replicating their data for the application’s benefit. </p><p>If you want to dig deeper, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX49K3BL-U8">this short workshop</a> for an overview of Ceramic.</p> Updates from the 3Box Labs team <p>We've been blown away by the amount of progress made across the Ceramic ecosystem over the last 12 months. Ceramic mainnet was launched in a private preview for Early Launch Partners, dozens of projects have onboarded and are running their own nodes on the network, and 3Box Labs has launched our new Glaze tooling which offers improvements on the former IDX protocol, now referred to as <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/did-datastore/#definitions">DID Datastore</a>. We’ve also launched v1 of <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/datamodel/">Datamodels</a>, which is a key step towards the long-term vision of Ceramic. As we start enabling developers to publish, share and eventually curate Datamodels on Ceramic, we move closer towards the vision of an interoperable, highly composable data ecosystem that enables a sovereign web. </p><p>We’ll be announcing a major milestone for the 3Box Labs team at EthDenver, that will allow us to continue executing on our roadmap, including improving network performance and reliability, building out new capability systems for more advanced permissioning, and launching new streamtypes and features for social use cases. We’re thrilled to be working alongside so many amazing web3 developers interested in building a more open and inclusive web, together. </p> How we’re showing up at EthDenver <p>Ceramic’s core protocol and surrounding tooling are more advanced than ever before. The sovereign web is just within reach, and it will require a motivated and coordinated community to build the applications, datamodels and tooling needed to make it a reality. The core primitives of Ceramic itself were developed right here at EthDenver, so we believe in the caliber of ideas and projects that can originate out of the Sports Castle. We can’t wait to experiment together this year, with our three co-founders offering live support to hackers and awarding over $15,000 to the best hacks at the end of the weekend. Full bounty details will be released soon, so stay tuned!</p> Come find us <p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> for the latest team updates, or for real-time updates during the event follow:</p>  Co-Founder &amp; CEO Michael Sena (@somemikesena)  Co-Foundeer &amp; COO Danny Zuckerman (@dazuck)  Co-Founder &amp; CTO Joel Thorstensson (​​@joelthorst)  Head of Business Development Lauren Feld (@web3lauren)  Partner Engineer Rohan Dasika (@rohandasika)  <p>Whether you’re a returning EthDenver hacker, transitioning web2 engineer, NFT artist, or just simply crypto curious - we’d love to chat with you IRL. We’ll be announcing our BUIDL Week workshops, conference panels and side events soon!</p> Resources <p>Looking to get a jump on the competition?

 What Is Really Matters to Make Diet Calories Calculators Work <p>To use a <a href="https://bit.ly/3HgH1uz">calories calculator</a>, you need to know how many calories you need per day and how many calories are in the food you’re&nbsp;eating.</p><p>While it’s important to know how many calories are in the food you’re eating, it’s even more important to make healthy choices when it comes to what you’re eating. A calories calculator can be a helpful tool, but it’s not everything. Here we will cover what really&nbsp;matters.</p> How many calories do I need each&nbsp;day? <p>This is a difficult question to answer without knowing more about your lifestyle and activity&nbsp;level.</p><p>The recommended calorie intake for the average, sedentary person is about 1200–2000 per day. If you are moderately active, you may need closer to 2000–2500 per&nbsp;day.</p><p>And if you are very active, you may need upwards of 2500–3000 or more. To calculate your specific calorie needs, use an online calculator or speak with a registered dietitian. Also we are going to cover the topic in&nbsp;depth.</p><p>In general, your daily caloric intake should include: 45–65% carbohydrates, 20–35% protein, and 10–30%&nbsp;fat.</p> What are macros and why do they&nbsp;matter? <p>Macronutrients are the three main nutrients that our body needs in order to function: carbohydrates, protein, and&nbsp;fat.</p><p>Each of these nutrients play different roles in our health and metabolism, so it’s important to make sure we are getting enough of all of them. Tracking your macros can be a helpful way to make sure you’re hitting your nutrient goals for the&nbsp;day.</p><p>There are many online calculators and apps that can help you track your macros. A good starting point is calculating what percentage of each nutrient you should aim for each day (see question #1). From there, you can adjust as needed depending on your specific goals and preferences.</p> (USDA) guidelines: <p>Calorie and macronutrient guidelines can be helpful in determining how many of each nutrient to eat each day. However, it is important to remember that everyone’s body is different and what works for one person may not work for another. It is also important to listen to your own body and make adjustments as needed. A good place to start when calculating calorie and macronutrient intake is to use the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines. The USDA recommends that adult women consume 2,000 calories per day, adult men consume 2,500 calories per day, and children between the ages of 4 and 8 years consume 1,400–1,600 calories per day. Regarding macronutrients, the USDA recommends that 45–65% of daily caloric intake come from carbohydrates, 20–35% from protein, and 10–35% from&nbsp;fat.</p> Formulas diet calories calculator uses (exposing the back end&nbsp;algos) <p>The Harris Benedict&nbsp;formula:</p><p>The Harris Benedict Formula is a mathematical equation that calculates someone’s basal metabolic rate&nbsp;(BMR).</p><p>This is the number of calories a person needs to consume each day to maintain their current weight. It takes into account a person’s sex, height, weight, and&nbsp;age.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>There are a number of ways to calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), but the Harris Benedict Formula is one of the most&nbsp;common.</p><p>To use the Harris Benedict Formula, you’ll need to know your weight in pounds and your height in&nbsp;inches.</p>  multiply your weight by&nbsp;703  divide that number by your height in&nbsp;inches  add 655 4. if you’re a woman, subtract 456 5. if you’re a man, add 68&nbsp;Your  BMR is then the result of this calculation.  <p>Mifflin-St Jeor&nbsp;formula:</p><p>The Mifflin-St Jeor equation is a formula used to calculate the basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the number of calories your body needs to maintain its current weight. The equation takes into account your sex, age, and&nbsp;weight.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>To calculate BMR, you use the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, which takes into account your sex, age, weight and&nbsp;height.</p><p>To use the equation, you first need to determine your basal metabolic rate factor (BMRF), which is a number that reflects how many calories your body burns at&nbsp;rest.</p><p>You can find BMRF by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters&nbsp;squared.</p><p>Once you have your BMRF, you can use the following equation to calculate BMR:</p><p>BMR = 10 x BMRF +&nbsp;665</p><p>For example, if you weigh 60 kg and are 1.7 meters tall (68 inches), your BMR would be: 10 x 0.924 + 665 =&nbsp;1,608</p><p>Owen formula:</p><p>The Owen equation is a mathematical formula used to calculate the cardiac output, or the amount of blood pumped by the heart each&nbsp;minute.</p><p>The equation is named for Dr. John H. Owen, who developed it in the early 1900s. The equation takes into account a number of factors, including the heart rate, the stroke volume (the amount of blood ejected from the heart with each beat), and the resistance to blood flow throughout the&nbsp;body.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>Owen equation to calculate your&nbsp;BRM:</p><p>BRM = 370 + (9.8 x weight in kg) + (6.8 x height in cm) — (4.7 x age in&nbsp;years)</p><p>For example, a 30-year-old woman who weighs 70 kg and is 170 cm tall would have a basal metabolic rate of 1,537 calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>Katch-McArdle formula:</p><p>You can use the Katch-McArdle formulas to calculate your BMR if you know your lean body&nbsp;mass.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>The Katch-McArdle formulas are: BMR = 370 + (21.6 x lean body mass) or BMR = (9.8 x weight in kilograms) + (4.7 x height in centimeters) — (4.7 x age in&nbsp;years)</p><p>Now what?!</p><p>After you find your BMR use one of these multipliers to find the amount of calories you need to stay at the same&nbsp;weight</p><p>The American Council on Exercise (ACE) has developed the following activity factor multipliers:</p><p>sedentary lifestyle =&nbsp;1.2</p><p>light activity =&nbsp;1.375</p><p>moderate activity =&nbsp;1.55</p><p>heavy activity =&nbsp;1.725</p><p>A sedentary lifestyle means you lead a relatively inactive lifestyle, with light physical activity only a few times a&nbsp;week.</p><p>If you have a light activity level, that means you engage in some exercise or physical activity on most days of the week but it’s not very&nbsp;intense.</p><p>Moderate activity means you are regularly active and heavy activity means you are very active — you probably have a physically demanding job or workout intensely several times a&nbsp;week.</p> The Key To Make It&nbsp;Work: <p>Now a note, all Calorie Counts Are Wrong as scientific american explained <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/science-reveals-why-calorie-counts-are-all-wrong/">Why</a>. But its not wrong to relay on them in the condition of you now they are just guessing efforts by great scientists. The wise decision is to use numbers generated by <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/diet-calories-calculator">diet calories calculator</a>s as a starting point. If you do so you can make them&nbsp;work.</p>

<p>There are a few problems with online calorie calculators. First, they can be inaccurate. Second, they can be difficult to use. And third, they can be expensive.</p><p>If you don’t get enough calories, your body will start breaking down muscle tissue to use as&nbsp;energy.</p><p>This can lead to a loss of muscle mass, which can make it harder to stay active and healthy. Additionally, if you don’t eat enough calories, you may not have enough energy to do the things you enjoy or to work hard at your&nbsp;job.</p> Where did the humble calorie come&nbsp;from: <p>The calorie is a unit of energy that was first defined by the French scientist Nicolas Leonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. A calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree&nbsp;Celsius.</p><p>The calorie calculator can help you determine how many calories you should eat each day to reach your weight loss goals. It takes into account your basal metabolic rate (the number of calories your body burns at rest), as well as the number of calories you burn through physical activity. If you use application doing so then be sure that you are getting right information about your calorie&nbsp;needs.</p> How do you figure out how much calorie you need per&nbsp;day <p>To figure out <a href="https://bit.ly/3AKhFmi">how many calories you need per day</a>, you’ll need to first calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR). This is the number of calories your body needs to maintain its current weight at&nbsp;rest.</p><p>You can use an online BMR calculator to estimate this number. Once you have your BMR, you’ll need to multiply it by an activity&nbsp;factor.</p><p>This number accounts for the amount of activity you do on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p><p>If you’re sedentary, use a multiplier of 1.2; if you’re moderately active, use 1.3–1.4; if you’re very active, use 1.5–1.7; and if you’re extremely active, use 1.8 or&nbsp;higher.</p><p>Now add in any extra calories you burn from exercise or other activities throughout the day. The resulting number is your approximate calorie intake for the&nbsp;day.</p><p>Basal metabolic rate:</p><p>Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the number of calories your body needs to maintain its basic functions while you are at rest. This includes functions like breathing, circulating blood and keeping your heart&nbsp;beating.</p><p>How to Calculate Your Basal Metabolic Rate:</p><p>To calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR), you’ll need to know your weight, height, and&nbsp;age.</p><p>You can use this online <a href="https://www.calculator.net/bmr-calculator.html">BMR calculator</a> to do the math for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Once you have your BMR, you can use that number to help you determine how many calories you need each day to maintain your current&nbsp;weight.</p><p>To lose weight, you’ll need to eat fewer calories than your BMR; to gain weight, you’ll need to eat&nbsp;more.</p><p>Remember that these are general guidelines, and everyone’s needs vary. If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, for example, you’ll likely need more than 2,000 calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you’re very active, you may need even more. Talk with a healthcare professional if you’re unsure about how many calories you should be&nbsp;eating.</p> How to Use the Diet Calories Calculator <p>The <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/diet-calories-calculator">diet calories calculator</a> is a handy tool for figuring out how many calories you need to eat each day in order to lose weight or maintain your current&nbsp;weight.</p><p>To use the calculator, simply enter your sex, weight, height, and age into the corresponding fields.</p><p>The calculator will then provide you with your basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the number of calories you need to maintain your current&nbsp;weight.</p><p>To lose weight, you’ll need to consume fewer than this number of calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>To maintain your current weight, you’ll need to consume the same number of calories as your&nbsp;BMR.</p> General Tips: <p>The number of calories in food is determined by the amount of energy that the food provides.</p><p>When you eat, your body breaks down the food into tiny pieces that it can use for energy. This process is called digestion.</p><p>The number of calories in a particular type of food is determined by how many nutrients it contains and how easily your body can digest it. Some foods are high in calories because they contain a lot of nutrients, such as protein, fat, or carbohydrates.</p><p>Other foods are high in calories because they are not very nutritious and are easy to digest, such as candy or processed snacks. If you eat something and then poop it out, the number of calories in that food would not be counted. However, if you ate something and it was absorbed into your body and used for energy, then the number of calories in that food would be&nbsp;counted.</p><p>If you throw up do you still count the calories?</p><p>Yes, you still count the calories! Throwing up does not get rid of the calories you consumed.</p><p>In fact, it can actually make you gain weight because you might eat more later to try to make up for what you threw&nbsp;up.</p><p>How many calories you need to eat to gain&nbsp;weight</p><p>How many calories you need to eat to gain weight depends on your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and how much you want to&nbsp;weigh.</p><p>To find out your BMR, use this calculator: <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/.">www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/.</a></p><p>Once you know your BMR, multiply it by the amount of activity you do in a day. If you are sedentary, multiply by 1.2. If you are lightly active, multiply by 1.375. If you are moderately active, multiply by 1.55. If you are very active, multiply by 1.725. And if you are extremely active, multiply by 1.9. This will give you the number of calories you need to eat each day to maintain your current weight (not including exercise).</p><p>To gain weight, add 500–1000 calories per day to this number (again not including exercise).</p><p>So if your BMR is 2000 and you are moderately active, you would need to eat 2500–3000 calories per day to gain&nbsp;weight.</p><p>How many calories should i eat for breakfast</p><p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the number of calories you need for breakfast will vary depending on your age, sex, activity level, and&nbsp;weight.</p><p>However, a good rule of thumb is to aim for around 400–600 calories for breakfast. This should provide enough energy to start your day without leaving you feeling too full or sluggish.</p><p>Some healthy breakfast options that are within this calorie range include: oatmeal with honey and banana; eggs with whole grain toast; yogurt with fruit and granola; a smoothie made with protein powder, almond milk, and frozen&nbsp;fruit.</p><p>How many calories do i need to maintain my&nbsp;weight</p><p>Maintaining weight is all about balancing the number of calories you consume with the number of calories you&nbsp;burn.</p><p>To maintain your weight, you need to eat the same number of calories that your body burns each day. This means that if you eat more than your body burns, you will gain weight; and if you eat less than your body burns, you will lose weight. There is no single magic number for how many calories everyone needs to maintain their&nbsp;weight.</p><p>It depends on factors such as age, sex, activity level, and muscle mass. However, general guidelines suggest that women need around 1,500–2,000 calories per day to maintain their weight, while men need around 2,000–2,500 calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you are trying to maintain your current weight, aim to consume the same number of calories each day. To do this, keep track of the foods you eat and make sure that your calorie intake stays within your recommended range. You can use a calorie calculator or app to help monitor your intake, or simply keep a food journal to track what you ate throughout the&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you are looking to gain or lose weight, it’s important to adjust your caloric intake accordingly. For example, if you want to lose 1–2 pounds per week, aim to consume 500–1,000 fewer calories than your body needs each day. Conversely, if you want to gain 1–2 pounds per week, aim to consume 500–1,000 more calories than your body needs each&nbsp;day.</p> Conclusion <p>One of the most important aspects of maintaining a healthy lifestyle is controlling your calorie intake. It can be tricky, because you want to make sure you’re eating enough to fuel your body, but not so much that you’re packing on the&nbsp;pounds.</p><p>Luckily, there are plenty of ways to do this. One key is to make sure you’re eating nutrient-rich foods. These are foods that provide your body with the vitamins and minerals it needs to function properly. They’ll also help keep you feeling full longer, so you won’t be as tempted to snack between meals. Some good options include fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources like chicken or&nbsp;fish.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is portion size. When dining out, for example, order an appetizer instead of an entree, or split a main course with a friend. At home, use smaller plates and measuring spoons to help control your portions. Finally, it’s important to get regular exercise.</p><p>This doesn’t mean hours at the gym every day; even moderate activity like walking or biking can help burn calories and keep your metabolism going strong. Just be sure to stick to a routine that works for you and fits into your schedule.</p>

 Elia Successfully Demonstrates TSO-visible EV Charging in Collaboration With Energy Web and BMW&nbsp;Group <p>Berlin, Germany, and Zug, Switzerland, 27 January 2022 — Elia Group, the Belgian and German Transmission Service Operator (TSO), in collaboration with Energy Web, the non-profit building operating systems for energy grids, and BMW Group, has successfully demonstrated a TSO-visible EV charging session, laying the groundwork for improved EV charging, including renewable energy-only charging and fast supplier switching. In a demonstration at a public, fast-charging charge point from <a href="https://www.lama.zone/">LamA</a> in Berlin, Felix Kohlbrenner, research project manager at BMW Group, charged a BMW EV using this new solution, where the vehicle’s digital identity was securely shared with Elia. He also spoke with Helen Burgess from Elia about the solution and what it means for the future of EV charging. You can watch the full demonstration here:</p><p>The successful demonstration builds on Elia’s ongoing work with Energy Web on the E-Mobility Dashboard, an open platform designed to simplify the identification of EVs and charge points which enables all parties to receive trustworthy, secure data through Energy Web e-roaming hub, the Open Charging Network. This dramatically simplifies the process of data exchange between EV owners and participants of the energy sector, such as TSOs, energy suppliers, and flexible service providers. Typically, when an EV is charged, the local grid operator receives aggregated data on charging without receiving specifics on the individual vehicle. The same identities can be used to facilitate seamless payments with other market players, eliminating inefficiencies and oversharing of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Energy Web’s operating system enables digital identities to be assigned to EVs and stored on the vehicles’ digital wallets. This enables the vehicle to securely share its identity with the TSO without having to share the driver’s identity. The demonstration showcases how more comprehensive and secure visibility can be achieved between participants in the charging process, as increasing the visibility of different assets in the system is fundamental to improving EV charging and enables future solutions including charging using 100% renewable energy.</p><blockquote>“By assigning digital identities to EVs using Energy Web’s blockchain-based operating system, TSOs can finally benefit from visibility at the device level which they have never had before”, said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web. “EV users benefit too — in the future, drivers will have their vehicle recognized automatically wherever they are charging and whichever operator they charge with, and will be able to receive a guarantee that they charged using energy generated exclusively from renewable sources.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Thanks to BMW Group for being involved with this exciting demonstration, a world-first for TSO-visible electric vehicle charging”, said Kai Schmied from Elia. “We’re looking forward to furthering our work with Energy Web on these cutting-edge charging solutions. Today, EV charging processes are not individually captured which prevents an active management of charging processes. Only with visibility on individual charging processes as well as a secure identification of involved participants, grid operators can enable flexibility use cases or offer new services such as supplier switching at the charging station’’.</blockquote><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. Our Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) enables any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market.

  <p>ESG data and reporting offers companies a useful tool for increasing transparency around issues of resource dependency, operational efficiency, and social and environmental sustainability and consequently many stakeholders globally use ESG data output as the foundation for critical strategic business decisions. Investors, for example, seek to assess the sustainability track record of companies in which they invest; and financial institutions may need to check eligibility for sustainability-linked finance initiatives. ESG data use cases are many and varied. </p>
<p>Standardized entity identification: A critical need in ESG reporting </p>
<p>Yet a key challenge in ESG reporting, data collection and data exchanges today is the lack of standardization for entity identification. This makes it difficult to find, compare and consume ESG data globally – leading to a lack of transparency and inefficiencies. Without machine readable, interoperable, and globally relevant data, ESG reports lose value as a means of evaluating performance indicators and promoting sustainable investment, since without a clear and standardized entity identification system, it is impossible to understand a company’s overall activities. There are innumerable national and regional standards for entity identification across the world and while different identifiers serve national needs, they can create significant conflicts and inefficiencies when reconciling data across geographical borders. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/regulatory-use-of-the-lei/gleif-and-data-foundation-comprehensive-entity-id-for-u-s-federal-government">Research</a> conducted by GLEIF and the Data Foundation, indicates that the U.S. federal government alone uses 50 distinct and incompatible entity identification systems. When this fragmentation is amplified, taking into account the volume of different identifiers globally, it is easy to understand the challenges. Users of ESG data will need to engage in name matching and dealing in differences in standards for translation, transliteration and abbreviation – and all of that that can be costly, time consuming and prone to error. Let’s consider how easy it would be for an investor to obtain a clear view of a corporation’s ownership structure or governance framework in the case, for example, of a multinational company with subsidiaries across the globe, each completing regulatory filings in different formats. I would say, not very easy at all.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, the lack of globally mandated standards in entity identification and reporting can create opportunity for greenwashing and other misleading practices such as the misallocation of assets. It can also render reported information useless. So for example, a large multi-national corporate could be requested to provide information on its supplier network. Without an consistent, global identification scheme for the supplier network, authorities abilities to do even the most basic analysis would be limited.</p>
<p>How the LEI can help </p>
<p>The LEI on the other hand avoids the negative impact of a siloed approach by responding to the critical need for a universal system of identifying entities across markets, products and regions. Machine readable and relevant across borders – thanks to its utilization in over 200 jurisdictions - it is a powerful tool for those conducting research on an entity’s global strategies, assets, corporate structure and values. Entities are unable to conceal greenwashing activities via subsidiaries, thanks to the 360-degree view afforded by an LEI.  </p>
<p>As an international standard and a code which connects entities to key reference information including ownership structure – which is easily accessed via the online Global LEI Index – the LEI tackles data reconciliation problems across borders and promotes an interoperable identity standard. It is also a data connector that allows analysis of corporate information across multiple data sources describing a legal entity and other mapped identifiers such as the Business Identification Number Code (BIC) and International Securities Identification Number (ISIN). The LEI as a connector permits stakeholders, such as investors and financial institutions, to access richer data regarding the entity. </p>
<p>All of these qualities position the LEI perfectly to deliver some critical yet missing components of a robust, efficient and effective global ESG discovery and reporting framework – transparency, consistency and compatibility. </p>
<p>And the LEI can further instill trust in ESG reporting if it is embedded within the digital certificate signing a report and / or the digital signatures of its signing officers. This capability has been demonstrated by GLEIF on multiple occasions in recent years and in the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/as-organizations-prepare-to-comply-with-european-single-electronic-format-esef-requirements-gleif-urges-them-to-go-beyond-include-leis-in-financial-report-digital-signatures-as-best-practice">publication of GLEIF’s 2020 annual report</a>. </p>
<p>Growing support for the LEI in non-financial reporting: A significant step forward </p>
<p>In an encouraging development in Q3 2021, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) released its Standards XBRL Taxonomy for companies which have reporting obligations under the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) reporting guidelines. This included the recommendation to use the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) in its XBRL Taxonomy – despite the Taxonomy remaining identifier agnostic overall. While not binding, the recommendation to use the LEI in XBRL reporting is a vitally important step toward bringing standardization and compatibility to global ESG reporting. Use of the LEI in XBRL reports will enhance machine readability as well as the comparability and useability of the collected data. It also provides a digital solution for tagging company information at a global level to help build a smooth and efficient ESG taxonomy value chain.  </p>
<p>Other supervisors have also already recognized the LEI's value in non-financial reporting. For example, the Eurosystem highlighted the importance of the LEI for linking financial and non-financial information and other data sources in its response to the European Commission public consultations on the Renewed Sustainable Finance Strategy and the Non-Financial Reporting Directive review. Eurosystem also emphasized that the LEI would enable digital-age innovation and thus foster potential growth in new markets and reduce costs and operational risks of the reporting entities. </p>
<p>Considering existing support for the LEI, GLEIF suggests that the LEI can also help to streamline data collection, aggregation and analysis of ESG risks for private unlisted companies, where there is less systematic coverage compared to publicly listed companies. Inclusion of the LEI in the due diligence checklist by ESG ratings and data products providers can help to assess the information and screen inconsistencies during the pre-validation phase and contribute to investors, informing their investment decisions. </p>
<p>In conclusion, GLEIF suggests that current challenges in accessing reliable, comparable and relevant data that inform on sustainable risks, opportunities and impacts can be greatly reduced by ensuring that ESG data collection and submission starts with the mandatory unique and unambiguous identification of legal entities by the LEI. This is the first foundational step for a consistent, comparable, and transparent ESG reporting and data exchange system that is globally interoperable.</p>

 About this research 



<p>During the course of our research, we hosted five community calls with participants from Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, western Europe and the United States, and held 58 interviews with social justice and digital rights advocates from a variety of movements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We saw that despite strong evidence that stronger collaboration between social justice groups and digital rights groups was urgently needed, inequitable funding and power imbalances between different regions and sectors have produced an uneven landscape where <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/social-justice-digital-rights-during-covid-19-barriers-to-collaboration/">this kind of collaboration has been lacking.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our research surfaced a number of grounds for working towards stronger collaboration between the two communities:&nbsp;</p>



  Digital inequities have deepened during the pandemic and the digital divide has only widened. This is especially true in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, where digital literacy and access was already a concern prior to the pandemic.  Activists are facing a digital emergency. Forced to rapidly recalibrate their work and services in online spaces, many organisations are balancing existing work with the new DDR issues created by the pandemic.  Intersectional collaboration is critical, given how Covid-19 has unevenly impacted communities, often replicating existing patterns of oppression. An intersectional approach could more effectively address compounding inequities, as compared to a single-issue approach.&nbsp;  Cross-sector collaboration can yield benefits, such as rooting DDR issues in the realities of social justice communities, strengthening the message of DDR work and making it easier for organisations to achieve their objectives. In particular, we found that making DDR knowledge more accessible to a wider, more diverse group of civil society organisations makes it more actionable for a broader set of groups.

<p>The intersection of identity and authentication is set to be very busy in 2022.</p>



<p>Over the course of two days from Jan. 24 – 25, the <a href="https://www.betteridentity.org/">Better Identity Coalition</a>, the FIDO Alliance, and the<a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/"> ID Theft Resource Center</a> (ITRC) co-hosted the Identity, Authentication, and the Road Ahead Cybersecurity Policy Forum with representatives from government and industry providing insight into the policies, challenges and opportunities for identity and authentication in 2022 and beyond.</p>



  



<p>Identity has always been important, and during the pandemic the gaps in identity verification capabilities were dramatically exposed in a number of ways. The challenges of identity in the pandemic were detailed in a keynote fireside chat with Susan Gibson, chair of the U.S. Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) Identity Fraud Reduction &amp; Redress Working Group, and Jeremy Grant, coordinator of the Better Identity Coalition. Gibson explained that the PRAC was formed by the U.S. Government with the goal of promoting transparency and facilitating coordinated oversight of the federal government’s pandemic response, which totaled some $5 trillion in aid.</p>



<p>Gibson noted that there have been many instances of pandemic aid fraud, due in no small part to weaknesses in identity verification and coordination. For example, she noted that a single social security number was used to claim unemployment insurance in 29 different states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While identity fraud, with social security numbers and other means is common, Gibson emphasized that trying to stop identity thieves isn’t the only answer to the problem as the volume of personally identifiable information that is already out in the public domain is large.</p>



<p>“Really, we need to focus less on trying to fix the problem by stopping identity theft and focus more on: how do you get to the strong authentication, with a realization that the identity theft has already happened,” Gibson said.</p>



<p>Data breaches continue to happen</p>



<p>Identities are often at the root of data breaches, both as a root cause, as well as a consequence.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>In a morning session, James Lee, Chief Operating Officer of the ID Theft Resource Center (ITRC), outlined some of the key data points from his organization’s <a href="https://notified.idtheftcenter.org/s/resource#annualReportSection">2021 End-of-Year Data Breach Report</a>. Among the highlights is the fact that 2021 was the worst year ever for data breaches, with 1,862 incidents impacting 294 million victims.</p>



<p>Lee said that the top data attribute that is stolen in data breaches are names of users, followed by social security numbers. That said he noted that in fraud forums, stolen social security numbers are sold for $2 each. In contrast, logins and passwords associated with email accounts and in particular Gmail accounts are worth $80 each.</p>



  



<p>The first day of the event concluded with a pair of panels on different aspects of identities and authentication. In a panel on things the government is doing to co-ordinate and improve identity, <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/jason_lim.23fvgdjh">Jason Lim</a>, Branch Manager for Screening Technology Integration Program (STIP), TSA, <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/phil_lam.23fvgifl">Phil Lam</a> Executive Director for Identity, U.S. General Services Administration, <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/tim_weiler.23fvgkym">Tim Weiler</a> Economic Policy Advisor &amp; Legislative Counsel, U.S. Rep. Bill Foster, and <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/kate_weschler.23gko5us">Kate Wechsler</a>, Executive Director, Consumer First Coalition, each detailed their views on what different agencies are doing.</p>



  



<p>Identity is also about access, which isn’t the same for all members of society. That was a key theme in the final panel of the day hosted by <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/moderator/eva_velasquez.23gkw81l">Eva Velasquez</a> President and CEO, Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), alongside panelists <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/birdell_lewis.23gkoj76">Birdell Lewis</a>, Senior Vice President, Centralized Shared Services, Synchrony; <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/pastor_ben_roberts.23fvhbsl">Pastor Ben Roberts</a>, Foundry United Methodist Church; and <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/chris_peterson.23fvhdn6">Chris Peterson</a>, Penny Forward and Community Member.</p>



 Day Two: The Future of Strong Authentication 



<p>In an opening keynote on the second day of the event, <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/eric_mill.23gkp02z">Eric Mill</a> Senior Advisor, White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delivered a keynote that outlined the direction of strong authentication in the government.</p>



  



<p>Mill noted that in the fall of 2021, the OMB published a draft of its <a href="https://zerotrust.cyber.gov/federal-zero-trust-strategy/">federal zero trust strategy</a>, which defines having a defense against phishing as a key priority. Mills said that phishing is one of the most common ways that adversaries gain a foothold in an enterprise and the government wants to focus on having an order of magnitude better defense against that kind of attack.</p>



<p>“We are trying to create a clear baseline for civilian federal agencies around not using multifactor authentication methods that don’t resist phishing,” Mills said.</p>



<p>Mills noted that PIV, or Personal Identity Verification cards are commonly used in the government and they can be an effective phishing deterrent. He added that there is a need to have a broader approach with FIDO WebAuthn platform authenticators as well.</p>



<p>“We really expect to see PIV, FIDO and web based authenticators in commingled use throughout the federal government and other weaker methods in the context&nbsp; of phishing,&nbsp; discontinued,” Mills said.</p>



<p>The zero trust strategy was officially published the day following the conference and requires the use of phishing-resistant MFA, like FIDO Authentication.</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance’s efforts for strong authentication and identity</p>



<p>In a keynote, Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director of the FIDO Alliance, outlined the progress and initiatives that his organization has underway to help improve the state of strong authentication.</p>



  



<p>Shikiar emphasized that the imperative that FIDO is seeking to address is not just to be a checkbox item for multi-factor authentication (MFA), but rather to truly be a foundation to secure connected services that are critical to today’s networked society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar predicted that 2022 will be the year that MFA attacks become mainstream. Having a phishing-resistant approach, which is what FIDO provides, is critical. The need for phishing-resistant MFA and strong authentication has been cited by multiple governments as a best practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Passwords are part of our lives because they’re ubiquitous and they’re part of the web’s DNA,” Shikiar said. “Simply put, we need to supplant them, keep them out of that role and take their place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Barriers to MFA and the need for improved identity proofing</p>



<p>In a panel on how the government and industry are rethinking authentication, panelists provided insight into what holds adoption back and what needs to happen next.</p>



  



<p><a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/pam_dingle.23fvirob">Pam DIngle</a>, Director of Identity Standards at Microsoft, commented that while there is awareness about the need for strong authentication and MFA there are several reasons why it isn’t always implemented. One type of organization that doesn’t deploy is where there are some sort of organization barriers to MFA.</p>



<p>“So customers come to us and say they know they need to do it right, but they have legacy technology or they have other reasons why they can’t adopt,” Dingle said. “For everyone else, I believe it’s on people’s lists.”</p>



<p><a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/christine_owen.23fvj2lj">Christine Owen</a> Director, Advanced Solutions, Cybersecurity at Guidehouse, commented that a challenge she sees with MFA deployment is on service accounts. Owen noted that adding MFA to those types of accounts is not always as easy as it should be. <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/grant_dasher.23fviyti">Grant Dasher</a> from CISA noted in his organization’s view, identity is clearly the foundation of a zero trust architecture. Dasher added that the President’s Executive Order has committed the government on both civilian and national security sides to go in that direction.In fact CISA has referred to FIDO as the gold standard for authentication in its recent <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/mfa">guidance</a>.</p>



  



<p>Helping to ensure that a given identity is in fact authentic is the domain of identity proofing, that also helps with the initial verification of identity documentations and attributes. In an afternoon panel, <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/rae_rivera.7jl5jmh">Rae Rivera</a>, Director of Certification Programs at the FIDO Alliance, outlined the ongoing efforts to create certification programs for identity proofing.</p>



<p>Brighton Haslett, Counsel in the U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Financial Services, noted that it’s important that any new regulations in the identity proofing space need to be based on real information.</p>



<p>“I think the biggest threat in this space is any kind of legislation or regulation born out of misunderstanding and fear,” Haslett said. “I think when we see a rush to regulate a new technology, it’s usually an attempt to mitigate bad outcomes whether those are real or not.”</p>



<p>Strong Authentication, Identity and the Banking System</p>



<p>The need for strong authentication to help secure identity is of critical importance to the financial sector and its government regulators.</p>



<p>“If you look at so many of the things that bring risk to the financial sector in the United States they are all anchored on identity, ” commented <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/sultan_meghji.23fvjmzk">Sultan Meghji</a>, Chief Innovation Officer, FDIC.</p>



  



<p>Meghji’s views were echoed by <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/kay_turner.23fvjpga">Kay Turner</a>, Senior Counselor to the Director, FinCEN Digital Identity, Inclusion, and Digital Payment Infrastructure. She noted that FinCEN’s role in the financial sector as the primary administrator of the Bank Secrecy Act and the U.S. financial intelligence unit, is to help prevent illicit finance, money laundering and related crimes like countering the financing of terrorism.</p>



<p>“Identity is at the heart of all financial services, and it’s core to trust,” Turner said. “So we recognize that the ability to assess risk is only as good as your ability to figure out with whom you’re engaging.”</p>



<p>Much of Turner’s sentiment were echoed in a keynote by <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/elizabeth_rosenberg.23gkpgye">Elizabeth Rosenberg</a> Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, at U.S. Treasury.</p>



  



<p>Rosenberg said that many of the critical problems plaguing the financial system stem from an inability to readily and reliably know who is dealing with whom.</p>



<p>“As a policy matter, digital ID has the potential to immediately and dramatically improve how we protect our national security and financial security,” Rosenberg said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking beyond just being aware of the importance of strong authentication for identity, Rosenberg said that the U.S. Treasury is approaching 2022 as a year of action for digital ID.</p>



<p>“I don’t want us to be addressing the same problems when next year’s identity forum convenes,” Rosenberg said. “At least I don’t want to see the same problems happening as frequently to the same degree as they are right now and the Treasury is committed to making that happen.”</p>



  



<p>In the closing keynote, <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/carole_house.23heudke">Carole House</a> Director for Cybersecurity and Secure Digital Innovation, White House National Security Council (NSC), also noted that she sees identity as being critical to national security.</p>



<p>“Many cyber incidents that we’ve seen involve vectors of compromise that could have been thwarted through stronger identity and access management solutions, including implementation of multifactor authentication solutions,” House said.</p>



<p>Recordings of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x6Wzc_VGCU">Day 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-fVpSUUvGs">Day 2</a> are now available.</p>

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, January 26, 2022 – To continue to meet the ever-changing needs of the education community and provide member institutions with the tools they need for powerful teaching and learning experiences, Edge has expanded their Digital Learning and Collaboration solution, EdgeLearn.</p>
<p>Driven by a rapid growth in digital learning in 2020, Edge looked for new ways to help institutions accelerate their online learning capabilities that integrated instructional design best practices and addressed the unique needs of their students, faculty, and staff. “At the beginning of the pandemic, many institutions were seeking assistance with faculty and student development in digital learning and needed to move online quickly at a very unexpected time,” explains Josh Gaul, Edge’s Associate Vice President and Chief Digital Learning Officer. “To help ease this transition, we expanded our suite of technology solutions, and now have integrated these professional services into our EdgeLearn solution. Institutions can partner with our seasoned experts to gain guidance on instructional design, course evaluation, learning space design, or creating a plan to achieve their digital transformation goals.”</p>
<p>Edge’s team of highly skilled instructional designers are based throughout the U.S., and bring a unique perspective to the online learning experience. “Often by building programs remotely, you gain important insight into how to create an optimal student experience,” says Gaul. “Additionally, our experts can augment an organization’s existing team in a valuable and cost-effective way, eliminating the need to hire a full-time staff member. With diverse skills and experience, our team can expand the reach of an institution and help bring their digital learning initiatives to life.”</p>
<p>Edge can also provide organizations with a Virtual Chief Digital Learning Officer (vCDLO) who can help unite the educational mission across online and traditional programs. “An Edge vCDLO acts as a bridge between technology infrastructure and academics,” shares Gaul. “By partnering with leadership, a vCDLO helps create a digital learning strategy that supports your institutional mission, drives student success, and creates a roadmap for future growth. We provide intelligent ways to use financial and human resources to advance online learning, while maintaining the quality of face-to-face education.”</p>
<p>As the world of online, hyflex, and hybrid learning evolves, Edge will continue to shape EdgeLearn to help member institutions successfully meet the needs of their faculty and students. With partnerships also continuing to expand beyond New Jersey, Edge looks to further build a collaborative community of experts whose unique experiences and skill sets can benefit member institutions on their digital learning journeys.</p>

<p>We have come to the conclusion of our first Fairdrop. We would like to thank all the partners, community, contributors and everyone for their participation.</p><p>Here we drill down into the details and the&nbsp;ending:</p><p>The Fairdrop was a portion of the quarter of 100 Million $BRIGHT that made up the initial minted supply (25 million). High level composition of the Initial minted supply consists of allocations for Bright DAO, Past actions, and Initial Incentives.</p><p>The Fairdrop consisted particularly of the Past actions allocation (6.85 million).</p><p>Starting on September 16, 2021, Fairdrop took place in 8 rounds. Claims could be made on either of the two networks — Main-net or Gnosis Chain (formerly xDAI).</p><p>89.4% was successfully claimed. Of the remaining 10.6%, most were allocations to Gitcoin projects(non-individuals) that benefited in trust bonus matching due to BrightID enabled donors. Some of the remaining were those who missed linking their BrightID with the fairdrop DApp in&nbsp;time.</p><p>These missed claims will be swept to BrightDAO common pool and will be spent on funding future tasks and projects proposed and passed by the community.</p><p>Considering the size of successful claims, the fairdrop was a great success. This is just the beginning and we hope to achieve similar or better success in the&nbsp;future.</p> Fairdrop DApp <p>The Fairdrop DApp used in the fairdrop is one of the many strong use cases of BrightID. It had been in development on the side for some time prior to the fairdrop as a generic product for any individual, project, or community to use for their&nbsp;airdrop.</p><p>The term fairdrop simply means that an airdrop is per individual rather than per&nbsp;address.</p><p>We learnt a lot about improving it through the BrightDAO fairdrop experience and it has been very encouraging to see how well it performed as intended in its earliest&nbsp;form.</p><p>Further development of the product will now be in the hands of the BrightDAO community. We heartily welcome any individuals, projects and communities that wish to further develop and utilize&nbsp;it.</p><p>Among the possibilities, it would be wonderful if we could make it the portal for perpetual airdrops, and it would be a game changer especially in terms of fair and wide distribution for onboarding new users to&nbsp;web3.</p><p>The project is open source on&nbsp;Github:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/BrightID/fairdrop">https://github.com/BrightID/fairdrop</a>  <a href="https://github.com/BrightID/fairdrop-backend">https://github.com/BrightID/fairdrop-backend</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/brightid/brightdao-fairdrop-1-retrospective-d31576fe2a2c">BrightDAO Fairdrop 1 Retrospective</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/brightid">BrightID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Any visit to a website, app download, purchase of a digital service, or use of new software involves legal policies. People typically encounter both a privacy policy and Terms of Use or Terms of Service (TOS/TOU) policy. But do they understand what functions these two types of policies serve?&nbsp;It seems they don't.

<p>Any visit to a website, app download, purchase of a digital service, or use of new software involves legal policies. People typically encounter both a privacy policy and Terms of Use or Terms of Service (TOS/TOU) policy. But do they understand what functions these two types of policies serve?&nbsp;It seems they don’t.</p>
<p>In a recent study, we found that consumers, “Me-s” in our parlance, have wrong ideas about the purpose of the two different types of policies. Alarmingly, the majority of Me-s surveyed do not understand that a TOS/TOU document is a contract—i.e., a legal agreement.</p>
<p>Our research, led by Noreen Whysel, our Director of Validation Research, consisted of ethnographic interviews, focus groups, and an online survey of 566 individuals. We were initially tipped off by the surprisingly strong reactions of a few participants in our early-stage interviews and focus groups who vehemently denied that Terms of Use were contracts. Wanting to explore how pervasive this sentiment was, we surveyed 566 individuals through an online survey.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
 
 Consumers are aware that legal policies exist on connected technologies and that they should read them, but they continue to choose to largely ignore them. 
 55% of survey participants did not understand that a TOS/TOU agreement is a legal contract. This has significant implications because a key requirement for legally binding contracts is mutual assent, which means that both parties have a “meeting of the minds” and must understand they’re entering into a contract. 
 None of the interview participants were aware of tools that explain or rate privacy policies and TOS/TOU documents, and&nbsp;half said that a score would not change their behavior. 
 66% of survey respondents believe that privacy policies protect the business, while 50% say they protect the consumer. It’s questionable that privacy policies protect either the individual or the business, as they are primarily legal notices, disclosures of how data is used by the technology and the companies behind it. Moreover, 39% of respondents erroneously thought that the privacy policy was a contract [between them and the company].

<div class='wrap'>

<p>When it was launched in May 2020, the ToIP Foundation summarized its mission in a single 20-page white paper called “Introduction to Trust Over IP”. This paper was based on an article called <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9031548">The Trust Over IP Stack</a> published in the December 2019 special issue of IEEE Communications Standards Magazine called <a href="https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-communications-standards-magazine/cfp/dawn-internet-identity-layer-and">The Dawn of the Internet Identity Layer and the Role of Decentralized Identity</a>.</p>



<p>Two years later, with ten times more members and double the original number of working groups, the Foundation is a much more mature organization. Despite this growth, we are very pleased that the original vision of <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/">the ToIP stack</a> has stood the test of time.</p>



<p>In summer of 2021, we put out a call to all ToIP members to participate in a series of “community writing workshops” to collaboratively produce two new Foundation-wide deliverables:</p>



  <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">Introduction to ToIP V2.0</a> (PDF)<br>This is the second-generation version of our original introductory white paper that would go more deeply into the origin and purpose of the ToIP stack and how it addresses the key challenges of decentralized digital trust infrastructure.  <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack V1.0</a> (PDF)<br>This is an articulation of the key <a href="https://principles.design/">design principles</a> we must follow in the design and development of all aspects of the ToIP stack.  



<p>We were thrilled that over two dozen members took us up on this challenge to participate over four months to produce these two documents, both of which have just been approved by the ToIP Steering Committee.</p>



 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">Introduction to ToIP V2.0</a> 



<p>Our primary goal with this second-generation white paper was to make the vision and mission of ToIP accessible to a general audience—literally anyone who cares about the future of the Internet and how we can deal with the myriad security, privacy, data protection, and data sovereignty issues that have emerged as “the world’s greatest information utility” passes its first half-century of growth.</p>



<p>Our second goal was a “plain English” explanation of the overall structure of the four-layer, two-half sided ToIP stack using new graphics based on <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/">the wonderful interactive version</a> developed by Peter Stoyko of <a href="http://www.elanica.com/">Elanica</a>. Here is the new static version of the diagram:</p>







<p>Our third goal was to provide a more complete introduction to the ToIP Foundation as a collaborative organization devoted to the design, development, adoption, and promotion of the ToIP stack—a guide to helping prospective members understand how and why to engage.</p>



<p>The resulting document is divided into the following sections:</p>



  ToIP in a Nutshell  Why Has Digital Trust Become Such a Major Problem?  The ToIP Model for Digital Trust  Applying This Model to the Digital World  The ToIP Stack  The ToIP Foundation  How to Engage with the ToIP Foundation  The Road Ahead  



<p>It is available as a PDF document <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">here</a> and on <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">the homepage of the ToIP Foundation website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack V1.0</a> 



<p>To establish a truly interoperable decentralized digital trust layer for the Internet as a whole, meticulous attention must be paid to the design of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/">ToIP stack</a>. Given the tremendous growth of the ToIP Foundation—from 27 original founding member organizations to over ten times as many&nbsp;today—it was critical to form a strong consensus among the new members about the principles governing this design.</p>



<p>Another key reason to establish design principles for the development of a system is summarized in this quote from the start of the document:</p>



<p>The goal of any design principle is to provide guidance to the designers of a product, service, or system so they can take advantage of lessons learned from the success or failure of previous designs. Design principles represent accumulated wisdom that falls in between the generality of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law"> scientific laws</a> and the specialization of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice"> best practices</a>.</p>



<p>When it comes to a layered architecture for both technology and governance of decentralized digital trust infrastructure, the “lessons learned from the success or failure of previous designs” is prodigious. Thus the writing workshops for this document continued for four months in order to bring all the relevant design principles together.</p>



<p>To organize the final set of 17 principles into a logical progression, we followed a rubric suggested by co-editor Victor Syntez based on a <a href="http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html">2006 blog post by cryptography pioneer Nick Szabo</a>. Szabo distinguished between two types of “code”:</p>



  Code written in a computer language expected to be executed by a machine (“dry code”), and  Code written in a human language, i.e., laws, regulations, rules, policies and other forms of governance expected to be followed by humans (“wet code”).  



<p>Accordingly, we divided the principles into three categories:</p>



  Principles of computer network architecture—these “dry code” principles represent fundamental lessons learned about the design of large-scale computer networked systems, especially the Internet:  



<p>#1: The End-to-End Principle</p>



<p>#2: Connectivity Is Its Own Reward</p>



<p>#3: The Hourglass Model</p>



<p>#4: Decentralization by Design and Default</p>



<p>#5: Cryptographic Verifiability</p>



<p>#6: Confidentiality by Design and Default</p>



<p>#7: Keys at the Edge</p>



  Principles of human network architecture—these “wet code” principles represent fundamental truths about how trust relationships operate between humans—either individually or in groups:  



<p>#8: Trust is Human</p>



<p>#9: Trust is Relational</p>



<p>#10: Trust is Directional</p>



<p>#11: Trust is Contextual</p>



<p>#12: Trust has Limits</p>



<p>#13: Trust can be Transitive</p>



<p>#14: Trust and Technology have a Reciprocal Relationship</p>



  Overall design principles—these three remaining principles apply to the overall design of the ToIP stack, “wet or dry”:  



<p>#15: Design for Ethical Values</p>



<p>#16: Design for Simplicity</p>



<p>#17: Design for Constant Change</p>



<p>Care was taken to not only explain each principle in plain English, but to analyze how it applies to the design of the ToIP stack at each layer. We summarized those recommendations using this table format:</p>



LayerRelevanceExplanation&nbsp;The ecosystem symbol represents the purpose of Layer 4 to support the applications needed to develop and sustain entire digital trust ecosystems.&nbsp;The triangle symbol represents the Layer 3 verifiable credential “trust triangle” of issuer, holder, and verifier that enables parties using the ToIP stack to establish transitive trust.&nbsp;The symbol of two connected mobile phones represents the purpose of Layer 2 as a universal peer-to-peer secure privacy-routing DID-to-DID communications protocol.&nbsp;The anchor symbol represents the purpose of Layer 1 public key utilities to provide strong anchors for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and their associated public keys.



<p>For each principle, in the “Relevance” column we assigned star ratings for each layer as follows:</p>



★★★★★Highly relevant to the design of this layer★★★★Very relevant to the design of this layer★★★Moderately relevant to the design of this layer★★Somewhat relevant to the design of this layer★Only slightly relevant to the design of this layer



<p>Once all 17 principles had been compiled into a document with this format, the contributors felt that we had identified the “center of gravity” of the design of the ToIP stack that could now guide our work in completing it.</p>



<p>We strongly recommend this document for anyone who wants to deeply understand the rationale for our work at the ToIP Foundation. It is available as a PDF document <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">here</a> and on <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">the homepage of the ToIP Foundation website</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Serviceanbieter suchen nach Integrationen, welche von Nutzenden angenommen werden und einfach zu integrieren sind. Dabei haben sich vor allem große Technologiekonzerne als Anbieter von Single-sign on Lösungen etabliert. Diese Login Optionen sind zwar einfach für Nutzer, bringen diese jedoch in große Abhängigkeit von zentralen Dienstleistern, welche häufig das Nutzerverhalten analysieren und an Werbetreibende verkaufen.</p><p>Der Login ist nur der Start der gemeinsamen Kundenbeziehung</p><p>Nutzende möchten nicht dutzende von Kommunikationsschnittstellen überwachen und pflegen, sondern bevorzugen eine Lösung, welche diese Aspekte zusammenführt. Dies beinhaltet nicht nur Login Dienste, sondern auch Newsletter, Informationsschreiben von der Bank, digitale Nachweise jeglicher Art und sonstige relevante persönliche Informationen. Der Medienbruch und die Zersplitterung der aktuellen Systeme stellt Nutzende sowie Organisationen vor eine große Herausforderung. Einmal in dem Wallet der Nutzenden abgelegt, können diese Informationen jedoch einfach verwaltet, sortiert und nach Bedarf präsentiert werden. Dies verbessert die Datenhaltung für Nutzende und bietet komplett neue Möglichkeiten der Kommunikation zwischen Organisationen und Endanwender.</p><p>Die direkte Verbindung — mit Lissi&nbsp;Connect</p><p>Lissi Connect ermöglicht die Authentifizierung von Nutzenden ohne Passwort. Zusätzlich zur Authentifizierung der Nutzer bietet Lissi Connect die Möglichkeit, digitale Nachweise auszustellen und abzufragen.

  <p>The Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF) is proud of its ongoing transparency initiatives. Namely its open approach to providing unrestricted access to the latest LEI data from around the world with the Quarterly LEI System Business Reports, which are made publicly available free of charge. Through this ‘LEI in Numbers’ blog series, GLEIF aims to highlight key data from the latest report, explaining trends and profiling successes from the global LEI rollout. </p>
<p>2021 demonstrated continued positive momentum for LEI issuance, concluding with a total LEI population of 1.95 million. With over 261,000 LEIs issued throughout the year, representing an annual growth rate of 15.3%, the LEI system is growing at an impressive rate. </p>
<p>The latest report, covering Q4 2021, shows that more than 80,000 new LEIs were issued globally during this time period – a strong increase from the 60,000 issued in Q3. This represents a quarterly growth rate of 4.3%, up from 3.3% noted in the previous quarter. </p>
<p>For a summary of the past quarter’s data, the below infographic contains the key statistics from Q4 2021, in addition to data summarizing the progress made in 2021 overall. </p>
<a href="https://www.gleif.org/thumbs/newsroom/blog/the-lei-in-numbers-reviewing-2021-and-the-q4-adoption-boom/gleif_q4-infographic-750x2187.jpg"></a>
<p>So called ‘competitive markets’ refer to those with over 1,000 LEIs, based on the number of LEI issuers providing services in the jurisdiction. The most competitive markets are those with the most LEI issuers per jurisdiction, with similar market share, and vice versa for the least competitive markets.</p>
<p>In Q4, China overtook Iceland as the jurisdiction with the highest LEI growth rate of the quarter, with an impressive 36.5% increase – the largest seen this year. It was followed by Estonia (22.9%), Iceland (19.3%), India (14.6%) and Turkey (10.1%). The rise of LEIs in China and India can be directly linked to the increase of regulatory requirements, whereas the growth seen in Estonia and Iceland has been driven by strong competition among LEI issuers.</p>
<p>In this same quarter, the overall renewal rate settled at 62.5%. While slightly lower than the previous quarter (64.6%), this decrease can be attributed to a lower number of renewals in December – a trend typical for this time of year. </p>
<p>Japan demonstrated the highest renewal rate (91.8%) in the quarter and has consistently ranked in the top two jurisdictions for renewals throughout 2021. Other jurisdictions in the Q4 top five are China (89.3%), Finland (87.6%), Liechtenstein (83.1%) and Germany (82.6%). </p>
<p>Proactive LEI renewal on an annual basis ensures that the Global LEI Index continues to provide the most accurate and up-to-date data as possible. The high figures for LEI issuance and renewals seen across a range of regions once again this quarter provides further evidence of the maturity and value of the Global LEI System. This brings tremendous benefits to both the ecosystem and all users of LEI data who rely on its accuracy to make informed business decisions with confidence.</p>
<p>For the full report which includes further detail on the status of LEI issuance and growth potential, the level of competition between LEI issuing organizations in the Global LEI System and Level 1 and 2 reference data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Reports page. </p>
<p>If you are interested in reviewing the latest daily LEI data, our Global LEI System Statistics Dashboard contains daily statistics on the total and active number of LEIs issued. This feature now enables any user to review historical data by geography, increasing transparency on the overall progress of the LEI.</p>
<p>For further detail or to access historical data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Report Archive. We look forward to sharing our progress each quarter as we continue to drive LEI adoption in 2022.</p>

<p>Martin Chapman, Frederick Hirsch, and Duncan Sparrell Named OASIS Distinguished Contributors</p> 


<p>19 January 2022 — OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, announced the winners of the 2021 Open Cup, which recognizes exceptional advancements within the OASIS technical community. The Cup for Outstanding New Initiative was awarded to <a href="https://originbx-oasis.org/">OriginBX</a>, an international alliance of organizations that are defining global standards for digital trade. The Open Cup for Outstanding Approved Standard was awarded to <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti">STIX v2.1 &amp; TAXII v2.1</a>, two widely used cybersecurity standards that enable the automated exchange of cyber threat intelligence. In addition, the consortium named Martin Chapman, Frederick Hirsch, and Duncan Sparrell as <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/member-roster/distinguished-contributors/">OASIS Distinguished Contributors</a>.</p>



<p>Open Cup Recipients</p>



<p>The 2021 Outstanding New Initiative, the OriginBX OASIS Open Project, is a global alliance to advance open source product and trade data standards for facilitating digital tax and trade attestations. By reducing complexity and the cost of complying with preferential and non-preferential country of origin determinations, OriginBX OASIS seeks to increase the utilization of free trade agreements to achieve desired public policy outcomes.</p>



<p>“Launched in June, OriginBX has attracted organizations representing diverse stakeholders in the technology, ecommerce, and customs brokerage sectors. The OriginBX community’s vision is to help build common standards to allow for greater automation in identifying countries of origin for manufactured goods and their components,” said OASIS Executive Director Guy Martin. “We’re proud to support this innovative new project as it aims to streamline global trade.”</p>



<p>OriginBX was chosen as the winner in the New Initiative category that includes finalist <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=esat">Electronic Secure Authentication (ESAT) Technical Committee</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Named the Outstanding Approved Standard was STIX v2.1 &amp; TAXII v2.1. STIX defines a JSON-based language for sharing structured threat intelligence in a consistent, machine-readable manner, allowing organizations to better protect against, detect, and respond to cyber threats. STIX v2.1 adds new objects and capabilities, enabling it to better describe the cyber threats we confront today, as well as future-proofing STIX via STIX Extensions. As a result, STIX v2.1 creates a solid and stable foundation for vendors and consumers alike to exchange actionable CTI.</p>



<p>TAXII defines a transport protocol which supports the exchange of STIX data over Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). TAXII enables machine-to-machine sharing of CTI by defining an API that supports common sharing models used by industry and Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs).</p>



<p>“The revamped version 2.1 of STIX and TAXII are fast becoming the foundation for automating information sharing to provide cybersecurity professionals with situational awareness, sophisticated threat analysis, and real-time network defense,” said Chet Ensign, OASIS Chief Technical Community Steward.</p>



<p>STIX v2.1 &amp; TAXII v2.1 were chosen from a group of finalists that included:</p>



  <a href="https://open-services.net/">OSLC</a> (Core v3.0, Change Mgmt v3.0, Requirements Mgmt v2.1, &amp; Query v3.0)  <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=legalruleml">LegalRuleML</a> Core Specification v1.0  <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=bdxr">BDXR</a> (Service Metadata Publishing (SMP) v2.0 &amp; Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) v1.0  



<p>Distinguished Contributors</p>



<p>Each year, the Distinguished Contributor designation is awarded to a select group of OASIS members who have made significant contributions to the advancement of open standards and/or open source projects.</p>

The two-fold rights this gives them includes primarily an economic right to derive financial reward for reproduction of their work, along with an ancillary moral right to prevent distorted reproductions of their work. Of late, however, there has been a shift in the use of copyright laws by copyright holders. Instead of fulfilment of economic objectives with the interest to protect original work, copyright holders weaponize copyright law as a tool to fulfil of non-economic objectives to vindicate non-copyright interests. This is often done to censor legitimate content, capitalizing on the fact that the copyright holders intellectual property was a part of the content itself, even though it may be insignificant to the final essence of the subject matter, or it may even qualify for fair use due to the purpose for which it was used. This article will discuss the motivation for individuals and business entities to shoehorn non-copyright claims within copyright law as opposed to any other speech regulation laws, share some examples of such copyright abuse for reputation management, and conclude by highlighting takedown transparency as a potentially useful next step in finding a way to rectify such complexities.</p><p>As early as in 2003, in the case of <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/342/191/515519/">Video Pipeline v Buena Vista Home Entertainment</a>, the United States Court of Appeals had acknowledged and predicted that the <a href="https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2011/11/18/patent-misuse-exploring-the-basics/id=20460/">patent misuse doctrine</a> (whereby patent holders abuse the exclusive right granted to them for purposes other than those provided lawfully through patent ownership) can also be extended to copyright and that this may subvert copyright’s goal to encourage creation and dissemination to the public of creative activity. ‘Reputation management’ of individuals and business entities by silencing criticism and other forms of legitimate speech has grown to become a significant motivation for misuse of copyright. This may be done to erase facts, skew the public narrative, and make information disappear that may be, as the Court of Appeal noted in the Video Pipeline case mentioned above, “critical of the copyright holder, their copyrighted good, or the industry in which they operate.”</p><p>There are <a href="https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/primers/libellaw/">defamation laws</a> in place in most countries that serve to protect unwarranted reputation damage of individuals or corporations, where the damage is based on the publication of false claims as facts. Despite this, abuse of copyright law for reputation management is more prominent than the abuse of other speech regulation laws such as those regulating the press, privacy or defamation. This may primarily be for three reasons: first, that copyright law bypasses the defense of first amendment, because this defense is already accounted for within copyright law. As the US Supreme Court had noted in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-545.pdf">Golan v Holder</a> in 2012, this is because copyright protects expression of facts and ideas but not the facts and ideas themselves. In this manner, protection of first amendment was already accounted for in drafting copyright law. Meanwhile for other speech regulation laws, such as defamation or privacy laws, first amendment is a defense and a balance of interests between both rights is carried out before a determination of legality is made. The lack of this in determination of copyright infringement makes copyright law an easier mode of enabling unlawful restriction of&nbsp;speech.</p><p>For example, Ares Rights, a reputation management company based out of Spain, has a history of sending false copyright claims to Google on behalf of Ecuadorian politicians, state owned televisions and even an ex-president. Between 2014 and 2016, various stories reported how anything remotely critical of the Ecuadorian government was faced with a copyright claim. For instance, a documentary critical of ex-president Rafael Correa was also met with a copyright notice sent by Ares Rights to Google on behalf of SECOM &amp; ECTV, Ecuador’s state owner television network, which can be viewed in the lumen database <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/10363404?access_token=Iheuc9TWyrBuUYZsUwZqFw">here</a>. The Lumen Database also revealed an interesting <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/1923877?access_token=wLR07e4jLEcbm0Ztq-cJQA">counter-notice</a> filed by an Ecuadorian citizen from 2014 disputing the then-ruling political party’s allegation of copyright infringement for a critical tweet along with an image of an open letter that the party itself had made public. The original takedown notice sent by Ares Rights on behalf of the political party, available in the lumen database <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/1902150?access_token=742QPGYvkXjZyzxa7rC3Cw">here</a>, claimed that the reproduction infringed their copyright since it held the political party’s logo. This form of political commentary would almost certainly not withstand a defamation or other forms of speech regulation complaints by political and public figures, and thus reputation management companies tend to fall back on exploitation of copyright law to facilitate such takedowns, that cause chilling&nbsp;effect.</p><p>The second reason that copyright law is used as a tool for censorship more than any other speech regulation laws is that, copyright law does not have an actual malice standard, unlike most other speech regulation laws, <a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1247&amp;context=hlr">including defamation</a>. This makes it easier to use copyrighted work that is irrelevant or ancillary to the final output as a basis for a content removal request. In US defamation law, for example, the plaintiff must prove actual malice, i.e., that the defendant published false statement knowing that it was false or with reckless disregard to the truth, a standard first laid out in the Supreme Court’s landmark 1964 case of <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/supreme-court-landmarks/new-york-times-v-sullivan-podcast">New York Times v Sullivan</a>. The burden of proof for actual malice is on the plaintiff, hence making the defamation claim harder to bear to fruition. In the case of copyright law however, there is no such standard. In fact, the burden of proof for fair use is on the defense, and therefore perfectly legitimate content that uses copyrightable content for purposes that would likely qualify for fair use may be taken down upon the receipt of a copyright claim, without prior-consideration of whether the subject matter would qualify for the&nbsp;same.</p><p>For example, in early 2020, Dr. Drew, a celebrity doctor made various claims publicly about the apparent lack of severity of COVID-2019 such as it being a ‘press induced panic’ or that one was ‘more likely to die by hit by an asteroid than by COVID-19’. As seriousness of the virus grew, a YouTube channel by the name of Dr Droops made a video ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsVRA485Go0">Compilation</a> of all the inaccurate contradictory things that Dr. Drew said about coronavirus’. Shortly after this, Dr Drew sent a copyright claim to YouTube, and the video was taken down. Along with this, Dr Drew commented on some of the tweets linking to the video that, ‘infringing copyright laws is a crime, hang on to your retweets or erase to be safe’. The aftermath of the legal action and takedown saw the Streisand effect in play, with the takedown leading to increased attention to Dr. Drew’s past comments. This led to YouTube reinstating the video and Dr. Drew’s&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/dr-drew-coronavirus-supercut-restored-to-youtube-after-copyright-takedown/">apology</a>.</p><p>It is likely that a video compilation of his comments made in public would qualify for fair use, but it was easier for him to weaponize copyright as a tool for removing the video, that was harming his public image and reputation, than to institute a legal defamation complaint, which would be much harder to establish. Even though the video in question was reinstated after publicity of the takedown, as per <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/access-all-balanced-ecosystem-and-powerful-tools/">YouTube’s copyright transparency report</a> published in December 2021, only 1% of all copyright-based removal requests (on ContentID) were disputed, and 60% of the disputed content was reinstated, and so it is likely that some legitimate content which did not violate copyright or likely qualifies for fair use, remains taken down. YouTube does not share content removal requests with third party research databases such as Lumen yet, and so unlike in the other takedown mentioned in this post sent to Google and Twitter, which could be verified through the takedown notices present the Lumen database, the same exercise could unfortunately not be carried out for&nbsp;YouTube.</p><p>Finally, the creation of safe harbor under section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which certainly holds significant benefits for copyright holders and free speech online, also makes abuse of copyright claims easier. The safe harbor provision in the DMCA grants immunity to online platforms for third party content so long as the platform removes any copyright infringing content expeditiously upon receiving notice of its illegality. This standard, known as ‘notice and takedown’ is used by most online platforms, to remain immune from liability for third party content. Abusers of copyright law take advantage of these provisions by sending unfounded DMCA takedown requests to platforms, that platforms (especially the ones that receive more notices than it is possible to manually review and verify) comply with so that they may retain their safe harbor immunity. Moreover, as Eric Goldman and Jessica Sibley mentioned in their paper on <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3229&amp;context=lawreview">Copyright’s Memory Hole</a>, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides carte blanche immunity to online service providers for third party content, also creates an exception for intellectual property claims, including copyright infringement claims. This makes copyright law a softer target for vindicating non-copyright claims.</p><p>For example, in 2016, Annabelle Narey, the head of a programme at an international children’s charity, posted a negative review of a building firm’s construction work on Mumsnet, a popular website for parents in the United Kingdom. Shortly after, an individual by the name of ‘Douglas Bush’ sent a DMCA notice to Google for delisting this review on Mumsnet since it was allegedly ‘copied’ from Bush’s original review on a different website. The DMCA by Bush is available in the lumen database here. However, Narey countered this claim and stated that hers was the original review. Since Bush’s review is no longer available online, it is probable that the review was backdated and the following DMCA notice was likely a tactic to remove legitimate content from Google since it was a negative review. Her counternotice is also available in the lumen database <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/12159803?access_token=5fT1i7lk50kes83DkW9OlQ">here</a>. While Narey countered the infringement claim, very few DMCA takedown notices are met with counterclaims, even though seminal work by scholars Jennifer Urban, Joe Karaganis and Brianna Schofield in their paper on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2755628">Notice and Takedown in Everyday Practice</a> notes that at least 4% of DMCA notices, in their study of a sample size of DMCA takedown notices sent to Google Images, were completely unfounded and 28.4% raised some questions of validity. Thus, the relative simplicity with which DCMA can be abused for takedown of legitimate content, including bad reviews, is a major factor why it is weaponized as a tool for censorship.</p><p>From the examples stated above, it seems to be clear that the intended effect of abusive copyright takedown is unlawful censorship and this leads to over-blocking of content, which in turn results in a considerable chilling effect in the society. Goldman and Silbey argue in their paper on Copyright Memory holes mentioned above, that censorship through copyright or copyright abuse causes memory holes in the collective memory of people, like the one in George Orwell’s 1984, by “relegating the facts and ideas those works contain to persisting only in people’s memories” and making them “fade out of circulation” at first, and then eventually “fading away altogether”. Jeanne Fromer, in her paper titled, ‘<a href="https://houstonlawreview.org/article/3946-should-the-law-care-why-intellectual-property-rights-have-been-asserted">Should the Law Care Why Intellectual Property Rights Have Been Asserted</a>’ notes that the use of copyright to protect non-economic and non-market interests can “distort the intellectual property system and cause harm to the society”.</p><p>While copyright is being used as a tool to manage business and personal reputation on one hand, and this may frustrate the original intent of copyright law, on the other hand it has also <a href="https://jipel.law.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/NYU_JIPEL_Vol-3-No-2_6_Levendowski_RevengePorn.pdf">been used</a> by victims of non-consensual sharing of intimate images because of the promptness of takedown, and this is intuitively a more satisfactory outcome of copyright abuse. Even so, at the root of this phenomenon is an important question about whether the copyright framework being shoehorned to protect the reputation and dignity of the copyright owner in unlawful ways is causing chilling effect and if there is a way in which this abuse can be minimized, if not resolved.</p><p>An important and useful next step to minimize copyright abuse and to build data-informed policy on this issue may be to encourage online takedown transparency and increased disclosure mandates of takedown notices. While several major tech companies such as Google, Twitter, Wikipedia do share copies of the copyright-based removal requests that they receive with third party research platforms like the Lumen Project, YouTube, Facebook and TikTok are examples of some online platforms that do not yet share takedown notices. Availability of copyright removal requests for research, scholarship and journalism by services such as the Lumen Project has <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/Perfect10_v_Google/2010-12-21p10vgoogle_amicus.pdf">enabled critical research</a> on notice and takedown in the past, and has shed light on the unlawful motivations for the abuse of DMCA. More useful data on takedown will certainly make way for better analysis, and is likely to be useful in creating better policies to regulate copyright infringement, prevent <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3697578">copyright silencing</a>, and minimize abusive takedown.</p><p>Note: We are taking part in <a href="https://www.eff.org/copyrightweek">Copyright Week</a>, a series of actions and discussions supporting key principles that should govern copyright law.</p><p>About the author: <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/shreya-tewari">Shreya</a> is a Research Fellow at the Lumen&nbsp;Project.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/copyright-laws-ab-use-as-the-tool-of-choice-for-censorship-and-reputation-management-e78c9129f6f1">(Ab)use of Copyright law as the tool of choice for censorship and reputation management</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  This is a story of a politician who cried “hacker” after a reporter informed a state agency that sensitive information was embedded in their website’s HTML source code. While we wish this was a joke or fictional story it, unfortunately, is not.

<p>This is a story of a politician who cried “hacker” after a reporter informed a state agency that sensitive information was embedded in their website’s HTML source code1. While we wish this was a joke or fictional story it, unfortunately, is not. If the state of Missouri does move forward with the prosecution this state action would sound the alarm for researchers and reporters resulting in a chilling effect on the practice of responsible reporting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Josh Renaud, a reporter from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch was researching the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s website for an upcoming story when he realized that <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-teachers-social-security-numbers-at-risk-on-state-agencys-website/article_f3339700-ece0-54a1-9a45-f300321b7c82.html">“Teachers’ Social Security numbers were embedded in the websites HTML source code”</a> (meaning anyone could have easily viewed the page source code and obtained the SSNs). The concerned reporter communicated his findings to the state agency and delayed his report to allow enough time for the state to remove the affected portions of the website.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-officials-planned-to-thank-post-dispatch-before-threatening-newspaper-emails-show/article_0f6c5288-cd11-569c-804e-9b280e9c1e68.html">instead of thanking the reporter</a> for discovering a security vulnerability, the Governor of Missouri held a news conference labeling the reporter as a “hacker” and threatened prosecution, even though the State’s Department of Public Safety Director had received confirmation from the FBI that “this incident is not an actual network intrusion.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We couldn’t agree more with the following statements made by House Representatives Crystal Wade and Tony Lovasco.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rep. Tony Lovasco <a href="https://twitter.com/tonylovasco/status/1448672694065668105">tweeted</a> on October 14, 2021:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;“It’s clear the Governor’s office has a fundamental misunderstanding of both web technology and industry-standard procedures for reporting security vulnerabilities. Journalists responsibly sounding an alarm on data privacy is not criminal hacking.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rep. Crystal Wade <a href="https://twitter.com/crystal_quade/status/1448689099498532867?s=20">asserted</a> in a public statement made on October 14, 2021 that:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The governor should direct his anger towards the failure of state government to keep its technology secure and up to date and work to fix the problem, not threaten journalists with prosecution for uncovering those failures.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This recent example underscores the notion that there is a real need for Policymakers to understand how technology works and behaves. Earlier this year, past congressional hearings also showed us that many Policymakers do not understand basic internet functions. We urge Policymakers to do their homework so that they can make educated and informed decisions on technology issues. Me2BA offers itself as a resource for Policymakers to navigate opaque and complex technology issues, so that researchers and journalists can continue to safely perform responsible reporting, which is a crucial function to keep everyone safe online.</p>

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, January 19, 2022 – Edge is pleased to be the recipient of the Verizon New Jersey Public, Educational or Government (PEG) Training and Equipment Program funds for 2022. The PEG program provides resources and education for developing creative media literacy in the community. Through this program fund, video production, editing equipment, and training programs are available for use in the development of local programming content that can be shown on local public, educational and governmental (PEG) access channels.</p>
<p>Through the PEG Program, any municipal-authorized representative or resident can take a free Basic Video Production training course at a participating County or Community College and then be eligible to borrow a complete location video production system to record a community event or program. Once the video shoot is complete, the authorized representative or resident can edit the footage at the participating County or Community College in order to produce a complete video program, ready for broadcast on the local PEG channels. An Advanced Video Production training course is also available, once the Basic Training has been successfully completed.</p>
<p>As the program implementation coordinator, Edge helps to manage the program and act as an interface for participating County and Community colleges. In addition to program management, the Verizon PEG Program provides equipment, technical support, application development, training resources, and maintenance.</p>
<p>Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Edge’s Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, explains, “Edge has developed software for tracking course enrollment information, inventory, and equipment loans, as well as an inventory management program to track usage of the PEG equipment and its necessary maintenance.” Further elaborates Dr. Ghahramani, “The inventory management service provides a secure web program interface with locally segregated data entry so institutions can provide periodic information on the website including dates when PEG equipment is borrowed and returned, a description of the PEG equipment that is borrowed, and the attendance of students in PEG training courses.” The number of people who participate in PEG training and use the program to develop local programming content can be easily tracked through the use of a registration application.</p>
<p>Participating institutions also have access to customized editing software and licensing of off-the-shelf programming pieces to be used to enhance local programming and its content by individuals and municipalities. To bring the various colleges together and create a forum for information sharing and collaboration, Edge is leveraging the <a href="https://edgexchange.njedge.net/home">EdgeXchange</a> platform to create a “Creative Media” community where institutions can share their experiences and best practices.</p>
<p>Municipalities are encouraged to take advantage of this free program in order to increase the amount of locally produced programs on the PEG channels. For additional information, please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:PEG@NJEdge.net">PEG@NJEdge.net</a>&nbsp;or refer to&nbsp;<a href="http://peg.njedge.net/">peg.njedge.net</a>&nbsp;for contacts at participating community colleges.</p>

   More clearly than before, we are seeing the recent pandemic as a catalyst and accelerator for Digital Transformation, or Dx as the term is now designated. As many higher education institutions have been on a Dx trajectory, there is now no denying that higher education’s future is digital.

<p>As they navigated the turbulence of the past few years, colleges and universities were forced to make fundamental changes in how they operate—and many are still trying to recover. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aacu.org/campus-challenges-and-strategic-priorities-time-change">2021 survey from the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&amp;U)</a>&nbsp;found that 74% are facing financial difficulties, while another 37% are struggling to build the capacity for long-term institutional change and transformation. In the face of unprecedented challenges, administrators are looking for a path forward. Darren Catalano, CEO of HelioCampus, believes that the answer might lie in a new approach to institutional effectiveness, one that helps ensure the path to financial sustainability and fulfillment of their mission.</p>
<p>Institutional effectiveness (IE) is not new to higher education.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/hooked-on-accreditation-a-historical-perspective/">Historically</a>, colleges and universities established IE offices to oversee matters related to the institution’s regional accreditation process and to provide a broad array of research and reporting services to internal and external stakeholders. According to Catalano, however, we’re seeing early indicators of a major institutional effectiveness evolution. We sat down with him to chat about how IE is changing, the challenges that colleges and universities face as they implement new methodologies, and how&nbsp;<a href="https://www.heliocampus.com/heliocampus-and-aefis">HelioCampus and AEFIS together</a>&nbsp;are helping institutions bridge the gap between academic outcomes and financial sustainability.</p>
<p>Q: You’ve talked before about how higher education is experiencing an “Institutional Effectiveness evolution.” How have you experienced that change over the past decade?</p>
<p>A: In 2011, I was hired at the University of Maryland Global Campus (UMGC) as their Assistant Vice President in Institutional Effectiveness. Our department was focused primarily on assessment, institutional research, business intelligence, and analytics.</p>
<p>A decade later, after working with a multitude of institutions, I’ve seen the role of institutional effectiveness expand. It’s no longer relegated to a point-in-time perspective for accreditation—it’s now become a methodology shaping how we run colleges and universities. We’re in what I like to call the early innings of “Institutional Effectiveness 2.0.”</p>
<p>Q: How do you define “Institutional Effectiveness 2.0?”</p>
<p>A: Our entire definition of IE is shifting. It’s becoming more strategic, and institutions are starting to see how critical it is for long-term decision-making. But many colleges and universities still don’t have a clear definition of what IE means and what they’re hoping to achieve with it. To help them, we at HelioCampus have identified four key pillars of IE:</p>
<p>1. Growth: Driving student success and net tuition revenue.<br>
2. Sustainability: Understanding academic program performance and market opportunities.<br>
3. Efficiency &amp; Effectiveness: Managing costs and streamlining operations.<br>
4. Outcomes: Assessing student learning outcomes and measuring how they translate to skills and employment opportunities.</p>
<p>These pillars are foundational to IE 2.0. But IE 2.0 also marks a change in how schools think about institutional effectiveness. Colleges and universities are shedding their narrow focus on assessment and accreditation and thinking about IE as a methodology, with sustainability as the end goal. It’s not just a compliance exercise any more—it’s a key capacity for success. IE 2.0 also broadens the scope of what kinds of data institutions should measure. Colleges and universities embracing IE 2.0 are taking a holistic view of the student when gathering data. This view likely includes academic performance and co-curricular activities for the purposes of authentic assessment and skills articulation.</p>
<p>Q: What are some of the challenges colleges and universities are facing as they adopt IE 2.0?</p>
<p>A: Most colleges and universities are working toward the four pillars we outlined above, but few can dive in and find the answers to these questions on their own. Many schools are working with siloed legacy systems that make collecting and using data in real-time almost impossible. These questions have complex answers—even if analysts have the data they need at their disposal, it’s a time-consuming process to collect and report on it, particularly in decentralized systems that weren’t designed for IE 2.0.</p>
<p>Essentially, there are two main challenges here: gathering the data and understanding what to do with it. HelioCampus helps institutions overcome these challenges by dismantling data silos and creating platforms that streamline visibility and access to institutional data for analysis, reporting and decision making. For IE 2.0 to be truly effective, colleges and universities need visibility into both academic and administrative data in near real-time. AEFIS joining HelioCampus will accelerate the ability for colleges and universities to implement IE 2.0.</p>
<p>Q: You mentioned AEFIS recently joined HelioCampus; what inspired this partnership, and how does this fit into HelioCampus’ overall strategy to support colleges and universities?</p>
<p>A: We started HelioCampus in 2015 because we saw the need for an analytics platform that focused on the unique requirements of colleges and universities. Since then, we’ve steadily expanded our capabilities to meet the needs of the institutions we serve. In the aftermath of Covid-19, for example, we saw that colleges and universities had to fast-track their ability to make informed budget decisions, which prompted our acquisition of ABC Insights in 2020, adding the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.heliocampus.com/higher-education-benchmarking">Benchmarking Consortium to our portfolio of offerings</a>.</p>
<p>Now the push for financial data has evolved into a focus on institutional effectiveness—administrators want to be able to join financial data with academic outcomes to get a comprehensive view of how their institution is performing. They need the ability to measure operational efficiency, academic performance, and student success in one place. Individually, HelioCampus and AEFIS were helping institutions tackle some, but not all, of those goals. We realized that by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.heliocampus.com/heliocampus-and-aefis">joining forces</a>, we could combine student learning outcomes assessment data with other institutional data to provide an unprecedented level of visibility. Simply put: we’re stronger together than we could be apart.</p>
<p>Q: How do you envision helping colleges and universities embrace IE 2.0?</p>
<p>A: HelioCampus aims to connect assessment data with other institutional data to enable a more comprehensive approach to institutional effectiveness and decision making. This approach will directly support accreditation, financial sustainability, and student success initiatives.</p>
<p>Q: What message do you have for colleges and universities thinking about the future of institutional effectiveness?</p>
<p>A: We know that for many institutions, the future feels uncertain. By embracing the evolution, they are setting themselves up with the infrastructure, visibility, and processes for data-informed decision making they’ll need to navigate their path to long-term sustainability and student success.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that there is a third phase of the evolution that will require embracing digital transformation of the college transcript. Stay tuned for more on this in a future post.</p>
<p>Together, HelioCampus and AEFIS will usher in a new era of institutional effectiveness—a comprehensive, data-informed approach towards continuous improvement and learner success as a methodology to run an institution.</p>

	 <a></a>1 Abstract 
<p>Our relationship with technology involves legal agreements that we either review or enter into when using a technology, namely privacy policies and terms of service or terms of use (“TOS/TOU”). We initiated this research to understand if providing a formal rating of the legal policies (privacy policies and TOS/TOUs) would be valuable to consumers (or “Me-s” in our parlance). From our early qualitative discussions, we noticed that people were unclear on whether these policies were legally binding contracts or not. Thus, a secondary objective emerged to quantitatively explore whether people knew who these policies protected (if anyone), and if the policies were perceived to be contracts with the provider of the digital technology (or “B”).</p>
<p>The purpose of a privacy policy is notification and disclosure, not protection.&nbsp; Privacy policies are not designed to protect anyone, they’re designed to inform. The TOS/TOU, on the other hand, is an agreement relating to the use of the technology or service and is typically designed to protect the business. Do Me-s understand this?</p>
<p>We conducted ethnographic interviews with six participants living in the United States, during a two-week period from February to March 2021. We followed these interviews with a focus group session of five participants in July 2021 and an online survey of 566 individuals in August 2021. In these studies, we asked participants and survey respondents who they think the privacy policy and TOS/TOU protect and whether they perceived these policies to be enforceable contracts.</p>
<p>The following are the key findings from this research:</p>
 
 People don’t understand that the Terms of Service is a contract. 55% of survey participants did not understand that a TOS/TOU is a contract (based on only 45% saying it is one). This has significant legal implications. In particular, a key requirement for legally binding contracts is mutual assent, which means that both parties have a “meeting of the minds”<a>1</a> and understand they’re entering into a contract. Our research makes clear that is not the case in Terms of Service agreements.<a>2</a> 
 
 
 Consumers are aware of the existence of legal policies on connected technologies. Focus group participants said that they know that legal policies exist for connected technologies and that they should read them, but that they largely ignore them in favor of getting to use the app or website as quickly as possible. The majority recognize cookie consent requests on websites and have some understanding that it relates to data privacy, but doesn’t necessarily connect them to a privacy policy. They are aware of TOS/TOU agreements when signing up for a service but often will accept the terms without reading them thoroughly. 
 
 
 People have a weak understanding of what the legal policies of digital technologies are or whom they protect. 66% of survey respondents say that privacy policies protect the business, while only 50% say they protect the consumer. The difference was starker for TOS/TOU, where 68% say they protect the business and only 35% say they protect the consumer. All interview participants say both documents are there largely to protect the digital technology company (the “B”) and to enforce “rules” around what a consumer can and cannot do with the technology. 
 
 
 None of the interview participants were aware of the existence of tools they can use to evaluate legal policies. They were aware of review sites that evaluate digital products from a consumer perspective, and some of the participants understood what a browser plugin was, and said they use them to block cookies, for example. They were not aware, specifically, of tools that help them understand privacy policies or TOU/TOS documents. 
 
 
 Half of the interview participants said that a score wouldn’t change their behavior. Even after we demonstrated rating tools such as TOS;DR and Privacy Badger, participants told us they did not expect to change their behavior, particularly if they were already using a particular digital service. Some said that seeing these ratings would potentially give them pause before using a new (to them) service. 
 
<p>As a result of this collection of research, the Me2B Alliance has decided not to pursue a formal legal policy audit service. Instead, we expect to evaluate and perhaps recommend existing services like Privacy Badger, TOS;DR, Mozilla’s “Privacy Not Included” program and others.</p>
<p>We hope, however, that the findings in this research can help illuminate and eventually eliminate the pervasive asymmetry in Me2B relationships and be a concrete resource to lawyers supporting Me-s in legal cases relating to digital agreements.

 <a></a>2 Introduction 
<p>The Me2B Alliance, a nonprofit organization, conducted a qualitative study of consumers’ awareness and understanding of the legal policies of online businesses, services and products, namely the Privacy policy and Terms of Service/Terms of Use (“TOS/TOU”) agreements. The study explored participants’ understanding what these legal documents are, whose interests they protect and whether knowing if these policies are respectful or not would change their online behaviors. The objective was to understand if a legal policy rating would be of use to consumers when deciding whether to enter into a commitment with a technology provider—or even use technology.</p>
 <a></a>2.1 Background 
<p>The Me2B Alliance (“Me2BA”) is a nonprofit creating a safe and just digital world through standards development and independent technology testing. At the core of our work is our Respectful Technology Specification<a>3</a> currently in development, which provides an objective standard for measuring safe and ethical technology behavior. The Specification consists of a series of tests that evaluate how a connected product or service is behaving towards the people that use it. This helps individuals understand how technology is treating them, and helps businesses build technology that is safe for and respectful to the people that use it.</p>
<p>In particular, the Respectful Tech Specification tests each Me2B Commitment,<a>4</a> including whether the notice of the agreement to each commitment is easy for technology users to find and access. Among other things, the set of tests for the each Commitment addresses whether or not the individual has the opportunity to provide permission prior to the sharing, or derivation, of personal and tracking data with a website or mobile app. Viable permission is a core attribute of respectful commitments.<a>5</a> Websites typically notify users by asking for permission (often through the browser); mobile apps often reference an individual’s existing permission settings, activating a device pop up if permission is needed.</p>
<p>Who are these policies designed to protect?</p>
<p>Most legal policies are written by corporate lawyers, and are therefore designed to protect the corporations who paid for them. We as individual Me-s usually don’t have lawyers who specialize in this area, and we aren’t writing these kinds of policies for ourselves. And even if we did, we don’t have the technological capability to send them to the business at the time of using a service or creating an account. Note, however, that IEEE P7012 “Machine Readable Personal Privacy Terms”<a>6</a> is developing a technical interoperability standard that will allow people to have software agents that can send legally binding privacy agreements to the provider (or B)—kind of like a reverse terms of service from the user, asserting specifically what permissions are granted to the business.</p>
<p>Privacy policies are notices provided to users of technology. The practice of privacy policies can be linked to Fair Information Practices Principles (FIPPS) such as these from the FTC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTC_fair_information_practice">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTC_fair_information_practice</a>) which expressly includes the practice of notice/notification. The purpose of a privacy policy is notification and disclosure, not protection.&nbsp; Privacy policies are not designed to protect anyone, they’re designed to inform.</p>
<p>The TOS/TOU, on the other hand, is an agreement relating to the use of the technology or service and is typically designed to protect the business.</p>
 <a></a>2.2 Literature Review 
<p>For a person to have agency in entering into an agreement with a technology product or service, they must be able to find, access and understand these agreements and the policies that explain them. We did a literature review of consumer perceptions of legal policies and evaluated tools like the Privacy Badger<a>7</a> and ToS;DR<a>8</a> browser extensions to understand if scoring these policies would make any difference in consumer behavior.</p>
<p>In a review of existing research, we found no studies that directly answer whether or not people will change their web activity knowing that legal terms are unfavorable to them. Most studies investigate what extent people will attempt to access a website’s legal terms or that people don’t read these policies to begin with.<a>9</a> Some studies evaluate whether people understand what they have consented to by agreeing to a website’s legal terms. However, some reasonable inferences can be drawn based on certain surveys and reports.</p>
<p>The closest study that might shed light on this question is a study conducted by Lior Strahilevitz and Matthew B. Kugler in which they look into the relevancy of reading privacy policies and what people take away from reading such privacy policies.<a>10</a> This study concluded that when people are exposed to varying degrees of specificity and clarity of a website’s privacy policy, there was no significant effect on consumers’ judgment about what they authorized the website to do. Similarly, exposure to a website’s privacy policy did not lead to any significant effects on the individual’s perception of the website’s intrusiveness. Strahilevitz and Kugler point to the rational thinking of people doing a cost-benefit analysis where privacy sacrifices inherent in their use of certain websites outweigh the costs. One inference that can be made is even if people read a website’s privacy policy, they might not have the appropriate knowledge to determine whether the website’s data practices are reasonable. Taking this inference one step further, unless a website explicitly says it engages in poor data practices that do not even remotely take into consideration the privacy of the user, people will unlikely know the difference between privacy friendly terms and non-privacy friendly terms.</p>
<p>A Cisco report from 2019 sheds light on people increasingly becoming more aware of their privacy.<a>11</a> According to Cisco’s report, 32% of all survey respondents across several different countries care about data privacy, are willing to act, and have already taken action to protect their privacy. The most telling result is 87% of responding businesses experienced sales delays to existing or prospective customers caused by their customers’ privacy concerns. The report attributes this privacy mindset likely to customers making sure their vendors and business partners have adequate answers to their privacy concerns before doing business together. However, these appear to be business-to-business transactions where customers have stronger negotiating power to encourage their vendors to adopt better data practices, which is quite different from the dynamics involved between an average Internet user and a website/business.</p>
<p>We can conclude from this review that, although privacy is becoming an increasing concern for people, there is little visibility into how or if people are modifying their behaviors when faced with knowledge of a website’s poor data practices.</p>
 <a></a>3 Research Design 
 <a></a>3.1 Study Objectives 
<p>The objective of this study was to conduct qualitative research to understand whether people change their behavior when they understand the legal policies governing their interactions with digital technologies. This was a mixed method (qualitative and quantitative) study, utilizing one-on-one interviews and an online survey. Open-ended interviews were conducted with six adult participants to examine their awareness, understanding and use of the legal policies that govern their interaction with Internet-enabled businesses they interact with on a regular basis, namely privacy policies and TOS/TOU. The online survey was a simple, 3-question survey clarifying online technology consumers’ understanding of the impact of these policies on them and the business.</p>
 <a></a>3.2 Research Questions 
<p>Three primary research questions guided the development of the research methods:</p>
<p>Part One – Qualitative Study:</p>
 
 Do people change how they interact with a website when they are familiar with the legal terms (Privacy policy and/or TOS/TOU) of the website. 
 Does a score grading the Privacy policy and TOS/TOU have value to Me-s (consumers). 
 
<p>Part Two — Quantitative Study:</p>
 
 Do people know whether these documents are contracts, whether they are enforceable and who these policies protect? 
 
 <a></a>3.3 Participants 
<p>For the survey, We created a survey on Surveymonkey and ran it on August 5, 2021. 566 people responded, all in the United States. While we did not select for gender balance, 297 female (52.5%) and 269 male (47.5%) respondents completed the survey.</p>
<p>Age ranges included 21.9% aged 18-29, 24.6% aged 30-44, 37.3% aged 45-60 and 16.3% over age 60.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Income Brackets of Survey Participants</p>
<p>Six interview participants from various areas of the United States were selected for interviews, five women and one man ranging in age from late twenties to mid-fifties. Two of the participants interviewed were African American, one was Latinx and three, including the male participant, were White.</p>
<p>The Participant Snapshots in <a>Appendix A</a> give a sense of each participant’s technology use in terms of quantity of products used, the way the products were used, how the participants felt about their technology use, as well as their general comfort level with technology.</p>
<p>Participant recruitment was conducted using&nbsp;an&nbsp;online platform, UserInterviews.com, for the interviews and Surveymonkey.com for the online survey. The UserInterviews platform&nbsp;allows for the creation of a screening survey to find eligible participants. Participants were sought who had a home broadband connection, who regularly used at least two Internet-enabled devices, who did not work in the technology or legal sectors, and who did not live in a large urban center. See&nbsp;<a>Appendix B</a>&nbsp;for the complete screening survey.</p>
<p>Interview participants who qualified after completing the screening survey were then hand-selected by the researcher for participation. The researcher invited participants to maximize diversity&nbsp;of the&nbsp;interviewees&nbsp;along the dimensions of age, ethnic/racial background, and geographical location.&nbsp;Unfortunately, few males responded to the call in the short time that recruiting took place, so there is a gender imbalance, skewing female, with this study.</p>
 <a></a>3.4 Informed Consent 
<p>Each participant (interviewee) gave verbal consent to participate in this study. Prior to the start of the interview, Noreen Whysel, the interviewer, emailed a copy of the Me2B Alliance consent form. Then at the time of the interview, via&nbsp;videoconferencing, she showed the participant a written consent form (see&nbsp;<a>Appendix C</a>).</p>
<p>Participant indicated verbally that they had read the entire consent form, then the interviewer asked if they had any questions and if they agreed to participate in the study. If the interviewee consented, the audio-recording was initiated, and the interviewee was asked to state his or her name and to state, “I agree to participate in this study.”</p>
<p>These audio recordings of participants’ verbal consent were saved as separate audio files and are retained by study personnel.&nbsp;We offered to email a PDF of the conenst form following the survey to all participants.</p>
 <a></a>4 Methods 
 <a></a>4.1 Qualitative Research – Interviews and Sentiment Analysis 
<p>We conducted the interviews via videoconferencing using Zoom software. Noreen Whysel conducted the interviews. Two additional Me2B volunteers, Lisa LeVasseur and Jeff Orgel, observed an interview on two separate occasions and asked questions of participants at the end of the formal series of questions.&nbsp;Interviews were audio-recorded using Zoom.&nbsp;Each interview lasted approximately&nbsp;60 minutes.</p>
<p>The purpose of open-ended interviewing was to understand participants’ awareness, understanding and use of legal policies such as privacy policies and TOS/TOU. The Interview Guide (see <a>Appendix D</a>) was used to direct the conversation, though open-ended questions were not necessarily asked verbatim or in the order they appear in the guide. The interviewer(s) also improvised questions as necessary in order to follow up with topics introduced by the participants.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>4.2 Quantitative Research – Online Survey 
<p>The survey had two questions, each listing five statements about these online technologies with checkboxes and one open-ended comment box asking participants to explain why they chose the options they did. The respondents selected the statements they agreed with and filled in the open ended comment field to expand on their selections. We also performed a cluster analysis on the open ended responses.</p>
 <a></a>5 Data Analysis 
<p>Audio recordings of the interviews were transcribed verbatim. In addition, the interviewer took extensive notes during each interview. The interview responses and recorded conversations are unstructured data comprised of factual statements, as well as opinions and other statements of sentiment or comparison. Indications of positive, neutral and negative sentiment orientation were noted as well as the degree of confidence of the answers by analyzing response time (subjectively), statements such as “I think”, “I’m not sure”, “I don’t know”, etc. and incidents of wavering assertion.</p>
<p>Survey data from the SurveyMonkey projects were downloaded to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analyzed to determine if there were any significant patterns around legal policy awareness and understanding. We further analyzed this data by gender, age, income bracket and U.S. region.</p>
<p>In addition, we used Carrot2 Clustering Workbench (<a href="https://search.carrot2.org/">https://search.carrot2.org/#/workbench</a>) using the LINGO algorithm to examine open-ended comments from the survey responses. The Lingo algorithm creates well-described flat clusters and is available as part of the open source Carrot2 framework. Clustering Workbench processed text content from local files that was uploaded In Excel format.</p>
 <a></a>6 Findings 
 <a></a>6.1 Interview Findings 
<p>As noted in Section 4 Method, we invited six participants to discuss their awareness and understanding of legal documents including privacy policies and TOS/TOU agreements, We then asked survey participants to select statements from a randomized list to describe the privacy policies and TOS/TOU documents for websites and mobile apps and related evaluation tools.</p>
<p>Participants differed only very slightly in their concern for online privacy or other online treatment. Most were generally accepting of most policy clauses or had one or two they would look for before accepting them. When it came to financial or personal identity information, two described taking extra steps to secure their credit card or other information online, one going as far as to say they might delete their account and open a new one if they were concerned it may have been compromised. Participant 3, who seemed to be the most comfortable with technology among the study particpants, was also the most cynical about how technologies treat consumers and whether legal policies make a difference.</p>
<p>Below are our detailed findings.</p>
 6.1.1 General Questions About Technology Use 
<p>General questions were introduced to assess the types of digital technologies each participant used on a regular basis and their level of comfort in discussing their online activity.</p>
 6.1.1.1 Interviewer: “How many digital technologies do you use on a regular basis?” 
<p>We asked participants to guess how many online accounts they had. Most could not guess a specific number. One said ten to fifteen accounts, but the rest either couldn’t guess, said, ”a lot”, “too many” or thought it could be at least 50 or even a hundred or more.</p>
<p>We introduced a few categories of accounts including email accounts, retail and banking sites, insurance, social media and other publishers, cloud storage, and streaming services and asked participants to list out products and companies in each category. We provided categories both to elicit categories of technologies they had not thought of but also to elicit specific websites and apps to discuss later in the interview. Most discussed online accounts that are primarily for personal use, but some also mentioned software accounts and email they use for work.</p>
<p>Email (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo!, AOL,&nbsp;etc): Participants have at least one personal email account and one work account. Only one specifically mentioned one personal and one work account, but through later discussions we confirmed that most of the participants also have work accounts.</p>
<p>Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest,&nbsp;TikTok,&nbsp;etc): Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were the most noted social media accounts. One said they only used Instagram. One said that they use Twitter occasionally but was on Reddit the most. Two have Pinterest accounts. One manages social media for their employer.</p>
<p>Financial Services (bank, investment account, etc.): Four indicated that they have online accounts at a bank or credit card company. Two did not report a financial services account. Insurance Company (medical, dental, auto, home,&nbsp;etc) Four indicated that they have online insurance accounts. Two did not report having an online insurance account.</p>
<p>Cloud storage (iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive,&nbsp;etc): Five reported that they have cloud storage accounts such as Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud or that they had files on their carrier account (Verizon) or associated with their device (Samsung Cloud). The Dropbox user noted that they use it for work.</p>
<p>Conferencing (Zoom,&nbsp;Webex,&nbsp;GotoMeeting, MS Teams,&nbsp;etc): Three discussed conferencing system accounts, mentioning Zoom, Google Meet, Adobe Connect, Group.Me, Slack and Rodeo. While all were accessing Zoom for the interview, one participant does not have a Zoom account and one indicated that they use “whatever everyone is using” and said they don’t really notice anymore.</p>
<p>Retail Store (Amazon, Walmart, Target, Walgreens, Nike,&nbsp;etc): All mentioned Amazon, which is not surprising since the testing service, UserInterviews.com pays participants in Amazon credits.&nbsp; Retail sites mentioned include Amazon, Target, Instacart (for grocery delivery from Aldi and Shoprite), Walmart, CVS, Etsy, Lululemon, Poshmark, eBay, Stitchfix, Nine West, Rockbox, Wayfair, Nordstrom, Hay Needle and Michaels. Amazon Prime and Amazon Fresh were also mentioned. “It’s surprising how few times I’ve walked into a store [since 2020]”</p>
<p>Streaming Service (Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, Pandora,&nbsp;etc): Four participants noted they hold accounts with online streaming services, three of whom noted specific video services, including Netflix, Hulu, HBOMax, Disney, and Kanopy, which streams video content to users with a public library card. One participant uses Sirius and Pandora music streaming services did not mention any video services or subscriptions. Two participants did not mention streaming services.</p>
<p>Publications (newspaper, magazine,&nbsp;etc.): Three participants said that they had an account with news or magazine publishers. Services noted include the Pittsburgh Post Gazette’s online newspaper, Associated Press and Amazon News and comic book accounts. One said they did not subscribe to online news, and generally does not pay for news. This participant used to get news related magazines and books if they had a promotional code (e.g., frequent flier miles). The comic book subscriber does not have a paid news account.</p>
<p>“[N]ormally, I don’t don’t sign up for anything news related if I have to pay for it.“</p>
<p>Online Work Accounts: Five participants indicated that they had email or other online and software accounts for work.</p>
<p>Other Accounts: No responses for “Other”</p>
<p>After discussing account categories, we asked again to estimate how many online accounts they had. Three said they had 51-100 accounts, one said 101-500 and one said they had less than 20. One did not answer. People seem to know that they have a lot of accounts and listing accounts by category allowed them to think about their online accounts in more concrete numbers. Participant 1, an apparel business owner from Washington, DC, identfied less than 15 accounts. We asked this participant to list the accounts and they were able to name thirteen, including two work emails. They said that they normally don’t create accounts and will use “guest checkout” on most retail sites. Five of the six participants perceive that they hold a lot of accounts that are saved on company websites or apps.</p>
 6.1.1.2 Interviewer: “If you had to guess, about how many digital accounts do you have in total, including the ones you use regularly and those you use infrequently?” 
<p>Most of the participants say that they have more than 50 online accounts. One thought it was likley more than 100. One only has about 10-15 accounts and named 13, confident that that is all they had.</p>
 6.1.2 Understanding of Legal Policies 
<p>None of the participants were in the habit of reading legal policies on websites or apps, considering them to be too long, legalese or a chore sitting in the way of using the app. One participant, Participant 2, a graphic designer from Kansas City, reads the policies when the technology is for work, but not always when it is for personal use. Generally, the participants consider these policies to be “rules” governing how a company can use their data and how they may use the product.</p>
<p>There was some confusion among one of the participants, Participant 1, about exactly how Privacy policy and a Terms of Use or Service document differ, but this participant ultimately agreed with the others that the Privacy policy governs the technology’s use and sharing of personal data and that the TOS/TOU governed the users’ behavior. They were in fact very curious about how the privacy policy covers third-party sharing. Participant 2 and Participant 6 were most interested in information about pricing and fees, while Participant 3 was most interested in Android permission settings. One participant said, cynically that the Privacy policy is there so the company can’t be sued for not having a privacy policy, alluding to privacy laws like California and GDPR.</p>
<p>Participants were unlikely to cancel an account if there was bad news in the press about a technology they use. In the case of a data breach, they felt the damage was already done (a concept that came up frequently in the interivews). They said they might be safer afterwards given a new focus on security. One participant said they might close their account if the news was particularly bad, but then possibly open a new one with a different email if the product or service was unique or hard to duplicate elsewhere. On the other hand, good news about a company or product was not necessarily a draw, as one said, it could be a PR ploy.</p>
 6.1.2.1 Interviewer: “Do you read the privacy policies or terms of service for online, digital products or services?” 
<p>Four of the six participants said they don’t read legal policies. One didn’t answer. Participant 2 occasionally reviews legal policies for work accounts. When reviewing these policies, this participant said, “When I sign up, I definitely want to know what the company had access to.”</p>
<p>“They are long and legalese and…set up where you have to say you agree, because you can’t go to the next step to get your grilled cheese sandwich.”</p>
<p>“Do I feel safe?… I do reviews of a company that I’m signing up for…outside of the website to make sure it’s not a scam.”<br>
</p>
 6.1.2.2 Interviewer: “Can you explain the difference is between these documents?” 
<p>Privacy policy: Five of the participants defined a Privacy policy as the document stating what user data the technology will save or share. One participant said that a privacy policy is the company’s “actual policy for using their site,” conflating it with the Terms of Use. This participant continued to assume the privacy policy governed the consumer’s use of the product or service rather than how the company will use their data.</p>
<p>TOS/TOU: All but one participant noted that the TOS/TOU (and in one case the EULA) relates to the rules for using the product or service. In all these responses, the participants were clear that an asymmetry between the Me and the B exists: the company makes the rules, and the user must follow them. One described it as a contract saying that the company has the right to drop you as a user at any time. One participant said that a TOS is associated with payment and includes terms such as 12/months of use “for the term of the account,” as well as policies covering free trials and cancelation. Participant 3 was particularly negative, saying that EULA’s are “documents you have to stroll to the end to use the product”</p>
<p>On TOS/TOU: “If you violate the terms..incite violent revolution…we can ban you.”</p>
<p>On EULAs: “…companies have just thrown random clauses … to see if anybody challenges them.”</p>
 6.1.2.3 Interviewer: “Off the top of your head, what are some things you think you might find in a … “ 
<p>Privacy policy: Two participants said they would expect to find information about what you can and cannot do on the site and what the site does or does not do. One participant mentioned cookies and said that the privacy policy would indicate if they use third-parties cookies or share data with third parties.</p>
<p>TOS/TOU: Only two participants answered specifically for TOS/TOU. Participant 1 expected to find return/exchange policies and other information about how the vendor conducts business. Participant 4, a university coordinator from Philadelphia, expected to find contact information in the TOS/TOU. In addition to contact information, Participant 2 would expect to find a way to report something that violates the agreement. Participant 5 described entering a radio contest, and noticing that they had a number of “consent to share” checkboxes that were already checked. This participant had to manually uncheck the boxes, but appreciated that it was an option. In a previous contest, this participant ended up having to unsubscribe from a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>“I’d rather not have my info shared if not required, if I had a choice.”</p>
<p>“[I] just entered a local radio station contest…. It has all&nbsp; {of the] ‘consent to share’ [buttons] checked and I had to uncheck all of them. I’m glad they gave me that option. [Another company did that] with another contest and I ended up having to unsubscribe from a lot of stuff.”</p>
 6.1.2.4 Interviewer: “Are there any specific paragraphs in a privacy policy or terms of service that you tend to look for or read?” 
<p>We asked if there are any specific paragraphs that the participant tends to look for and read in a privacy policy or TOU/TOS. Participant 1 is curious about third party sites and whether data is stored by third parties. Participant 2 and Participant 6 look for pricing information. Participant 6 called it the “money aspect.” Participant 2 also looks for copyright information since it is a concern at their work. Participant 5 doesn’t really read the legal documents, noting that they are more confusing to read than the paper contract you get for car insurance, saying “It’s easier to read [the paper document]. It’s like bullet points.”</p>
<p>Privacy policy: Participant 4 looks for information about protecting credit card information and that they aren’t sharing or selling their email. Participant 3 relies on the app level permissions breakdown that Android provides, because it is less difficult to process than the legal forms. This suggests that this participant might be inclined to seek out trusted sources to provide guidance on privacy protections.</p>
<p>“No one has time to read that much drivel, legalese.”</p>
<p>TOS/TOU: No Comments</p>
 6.1.2.5 Interviewer: “Have you ever tried researching information about a company’s terms of use and privacy policy? Did you find what you need?” 
<p>Participant 6 and Participant 1 discussed their experiences with retail websites. Participant 6 had an unfortunate incident with a company that offered to send a free blender but reneged on the offer. They looked up the company information after they had been “wronged.”&nbsp; Participant 1 had an account at AliBaba but “does read policies on Chinese websites” and will create an account if the merchandise is good. This participant said some sites will allow guest checkout and will use that if&nbsp; they won’t be making future purchases there.</p>
 6.1.2.6 Interviewer: “Let’s say one of your services was featured in the news. Would reading news about a company that shows they care about privacy make you feel more secure using them?” 
<p>Participants were mixed on this question. While two said it would make a positive impression if the news were good, two said a definitive no, and one hesitant no. Participant 2 said it depends on where the report appeared, citing news media bias. This participant would look at other sources, before changing their behavior. Participant 6, who was hesitant admitted that this kind of news “goes in one ear and out the other.” Participant 5 discussed the hacking of Target as an example of bad news about a company. Participant 3 was the most cynical, stating that companies have PR agencies to manipulate the news, and mentioned confirmation bias and zero day exploits. They concluded that “you have to accept that nothing is perfect.”</p>
<p>“Not to be a conspiracy theory, crazy-hat [person], but…paid advertising can say anything.”</p>
 6.1.2.7 Interviewer: “Would reading negative news make you want to stop using it?” 
<p>The general feeling was that if there was negative news it would really depend on the source and whether it was a serious breach of data security. Then, they would consider closing their account. While Participant 4 might remove credit card info and keep using the site, Participant 5 was fatalistic. In that case, “the damage was already done” and “[the business] would probably be more secure afterward.” Participant 3 said if it were “hysterical headlines in your news feed” they would ignore it, but if there was a technical document describing the issue, they might cancel the account.</p>
<p>Only Participant 5 would probably cancel their account and could describe situations where they did act on it. Participant 2 said that if it was a breach, they might cancel an existing account and open a new one.</p>
<p>“There are some things you can only get on Etsy.”</p>
<p>Three participants expressed negative sentiment about privacy policies terms. Participant 5 and Participant 6 suggested that the terms can be misleading. Participant 6 said the terms for canceling their daughter’s Kindle Fire were vague and that the fine print put around the free trial was misleading. Participant 5 said that Geico asks for seemingly irrelevant information on its insurance quote form. Participant 5 went as far as to say that you have no choice if you want to use the service, which was a common response. Participant 3 complained that a music app wanted 24/7 access to the camera and microphone, even though they do not use voice activation. They thought it was “weird” that larger, well-known apps would do that. Participant 1 answered this question, not about legal policies, but about FAQs on a site that they described as “sketchy.”</p>
<p>“I googled something, I think for some type of DSLR. I went on one of these sketchy [Google links]. Clicked on it and read the FAQ, researched reviews on the company. In the reviews I found not only is it a third-party site, it’s not a real company.”</p>
<p>“When you install a music app and it wanted access to camera or 24/7 microphone and I don’t plan to use voice activation. It would be weird on larger well-known apps.”</p>
<p>Two participants said no, reading news about a company would not necessarily make them stop using it, or that they could not think of any services that whose privacy policy made them decide not to use it.</p>
 6.1.2.8 Interviewer: “Have you ever received a notification about an update to a privacy policy (or TOS) that made you consider changing the service? Did you delete your account?“ 
<p>Four participants said they have received policy update notices.</p>
 6.1.3 Awareness of Legal Policy Protections 
<p>Participants were asked to describe in their own words what a privacy policy and TOS/TOU are for. Five responded. There was general agreement that both documents protect the B more than the user. Most said that these policies are primarily to inform the Me and protect the B. The general sense is that they are rules the user must abide by.</p>
 6.1.3.1 Interviewer: “What do you think the privacy policy is for?” 
<p>Two participants were negative about both documents. Participant 3 called a privacy policy “legal cover” for the company. These responses may indicate a sense of a power imbalance.</p>
<p>“I have no choice but to agree.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t protect me. I can’t select the parts I agree with.”</p>
 6.1.3.2 Interviewer: “What do you think the TOS/TOU is for?” 
<p>Participant 2 said the TOS/TOU were “for” the user in the sense that agreeing to the terms gets you access. What rights do you have? Are they protecting your rights/giving you rights/protecting you? Two participants suggested that they are protected by privacy policies if it allows them to change their settings.</p>
<p>“I feel protected if I can change/edit settings.”</p>
<p>“You agree to these policies or you have the right to not use the platform.”</p>
 6.1.3.3 Interviewer: “Do legal policies protect you as the consumer? How?” 
<p>Four participants gave a qualified Yes to this answer. Participant 1 said they do protect the consumer but “it’s on me to read them and absorb them and figure it out.” Participant 5 said they protect consumers “maybe a little bit.” This participant also had doubts, saying, “They all do share your information.” Participant 3 was the most negative and did not think people really had a chance against companies like Google, even if their policies are clear.</p>
<p>Participant 2 was much more willing to accept that the companies are collecting data to make the experience better for users, saying that the act of accepting these policies is “kind of an intimate experience.” They appreciate when their personal and financial information are protected.</p>
<p>Participant 3 on whether privacy policies protect them (as a Me):</p>
<p>“Ostensibly, yes. In reality, good luck.”</p>
<p>“Do you have the time and money and army of lawyers to go against Google?”</p>
<p>Privacy policy: Participant 1’s answer to this question clarifies some earlier confusion about what these policies cover. This participant explained, erroneously, that a privacy policy outlines what you can and cannot do on the site and TOS/TOU was how to use the site. After hearing how the Me2B Alliance defines these documents in the next section, Participant 1 said it was clearer.</p>
<p>TOS/TOU: None of the comments to this question were specifically about the TOS/TOU.</p>
 6.1.3.4 Interviewer: “Do legal policies protect&nbsp;the organization? How?” 
<p>Privacy policy: All participants answered this question in the affirmative. Companies are protected by the privacy policy. Participant 2 mentioned GDPR (though didn’t recall the name of the regulation) as the reason we are seeing cookie notices. This participant said that their understanding is a company can get sued if they don’t have a privacy policy. Participant 3 called it “legal cover for what they track and sell,” saying that while it does allow a better experience it “allows them to sell and monetize whatever they want.” Participant 1 continued to suggest that a privacy policy allows a company to sue a user who uses the content without permission.</p>
<p>TOS/TOU: Three participants said that the organization is protected by the TOS/TOU because they can ban or delete an account of a user who isn’t following the rules. This protects the integrity of the service and builds the trust of the user population. Participant 1 was unclear if the TOS/TOU protects the company, since their understanding was that the terms document was more “how to” than rules. They made more sense later when we defined the documents.</p>
<p>Participant 3 felt that the TOS/TOU protects the company in extreme cases where a bad actor can be banned. They described services where users are banned for promoting violence or hate speech. They said that sometimes these companies may be accused of censorship but that terms may be written so that they can remove a user for any reason, which further protects the company from lawsuits.</p>
<p>Participant 6 was also negative, mentioning a situation where a company may force you into paying for a service and make it difficult to get out of the agreement, including terms that are written such that, “you have to keep paying them” and cannot tell your bank to stop payment. This is described as <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/forced-continuity">Forced Continuity</a> in Harry Brignull’s website <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/">DarkPatterns.org</a>. “If someone is using the platform for malicious activities and making the org or platform look bad, they should have the right to delete their account if that person is doing bad things.”</p>
 6.1.3.5 Interviewer: “Have you seen cookie notices?” 
<p>Five participants answered this question. They all have seen cookie notices.</p>
<p>“I do see them. When they pop up, it says ‘Accept all cookies.’”</p>
 6.1.3.6 Interviewer: “Do you know what they are?” 
<p>Participant 2 found them particularly irritating, saying that, “It would be better if all of them were by default. I wouldn’t have to do more work.”</p>
 6.1.3.7 Interviewer: “Are these [cookie notices] legally binding?” 
<p>Responses to whether these policies are legally binding were mixed. Four participants were unsure and of the two participants who answered confidently, one said yes, and the other said No. Participant 1 says that if you click OK to consent to a policy it is now binding.</p>
<p>Participant 3 did not think they could be prosecuted.</p>
<p>“I haven’t read a court case…where a cookie was used as evidence.”</p>
 6.1.3.8 Interviewer: “Are they related to the privacy policy?” 
<p>Five participants said that cookies are related to the privacy policy and were confident in their response. The sixth, Participant 5, said that they are probably not related to the privacy policy “because they are stored on my computer, not at Amazon.” Participant 6 seemed to abstract the privacy policy and the cookies from each other saying that the policy is related to “something I signed up for” while cookies are a “generalization”.</p>
 6.1.4 Understandability of Me2BA Definitions&nbsp;for Privacy policy and Terms of Service/Use 
<p>The interviewer read the following working definitions of Privacy policy and Terms of Service/Tems of Use to get the participants reactions.</p>
<p>Privacy policy: Public promise of how the technology and the company will treat you and your data. <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security">Enforceable by the FTC</a> in the US.<a>12</a></p>
<p>Terms of Service/Terms of Use: The two-party contract that you are signing that both parties will abide by. Enforceable by the court of law.</p>
 6.1.4.1 Interviewer: Does this change your understanding of either of these documents at all? 
<p>Privacy policy: Four participants reacted positively to the Privacy policy definition. They found it simple, understandable, but Participant 3, who was favorable of the definition and Participant 5 who was unfavorable both wondered if it would be enforceable. Participant 5 said that “If I start getting emails from a company I never did business with, I won’t know who they got [my data] from” and wouldn’t know if it is possible to sue. Participant 2 and Participant 6 found the definition protective of the consumer. Participant 2 called it a “promise”.</p>
<p>TOS/TOU: Four participants reacted to the Me2BA definition for TOS/TOU, three negatively. The concern was that the Me2BA definition was idealistic on one hand and scary on the other. Participant 3 and Participant 6 found the idea of a binding agreement frightening. Participant 3 called it a “hostage situation” and thought it would be difficult for a new service to open their customer relationship with such an agreement. They also said that TOSs and EULAs have been challenged in court and “have been found to be unenforceable in Europe”. At best, they said they are “idealistic.”</p>
<p>On enforceability, Participant 5 didn’t think the company would ever enforce the TOS/TOU and that it would be difficult to prove it was violated.</p>
 6.1.4.2 Interviewer: Does any of this change your understanding of these policies? 
<p>Five participants responded. Two said that it did not change their understanding. Participant 1 was not aware of the limited enforceability of the policies and assumed that both were enforceable agreements. Participant 2 said that the Me2BA definition of the TOS/TOU made it seem two-sided, but felt it was one-sided from the consumer’s point of view, ie. covering actions by the consumer that could affect their ability to use a product. Participant 3 objected to the Me2BA definition stating that there are “no two parties”.</p>
 6.1.5 Importance&nbsp;of Reading Legal Policies 
 6.1.5.1 Interviewer: “Do you think it is important to read legal policies before signing up for an account?” 
<p>Five participants think it is important to read legal policies before signing up for an account. Participant 1 said it is important “but not mandatory” and Participant 2 said it is important but “I know a lot of people don’t look through it because it is very lengthy.” Participant 5 called them “legalese” and “vague” and felt it would be better if it were written in a “common language”.</p>
<p>Participant 3 bluntly stated that you don’t have to read the policy, “If you have to use the platform, if it’s mandatory,” or “if you want to do modern banking.” Their nearest Bank of America ATM is 15 miles away, so they would have to use the website or app to manage their account.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to live in a food desert. I live in a Bank of America desert.”</p>
 6.1.5.2 Interviewer: “Why? Or Why not? Could they be important to you?” 
<p>Participant 6 noted that popular culture provides examples of why it is important to read legal policies. They described an episode of South Park where one of the kids “…didn’t read it and ended up in a kind of hell.” Some examples of why it is important to read legal policies are,</p>
<p>“If you abuse how you use Amazon and vice versa, you can go to court.”</p>
<p>“If something goes wrong, you want to be protected.”</p>
<p>“So that I know what I’m getting into, what I’m going to be charged, and if they are going to sell my data.”</p>
<p>Participant 6 offered examples of why people don’t read legal policies: instant gratification, living in a consumer society, and being in a hurry.</p>
 6.1.6 Awareness of Privacy/TOU Management Tools 
 6.1.6.1 Interviewer: “Did you know there are plugins that read privacy policies?&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, do you use them? Which ones?” 
<p>Five participants have heard of browser plugins, generally as tools that improve your internet experience or as Participant 1 said “make it better to do anything in regard to the internet or a specific [site or task], but none had heard of plugins that specifically address the content of legal policies.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t you just block cookies on your browser?”</p>
 6.1.6.2 Interviewer: “If you are aware of plugins and don’t use them, why don’t you use them?” 
<p>We offered to do a walkthrough&nbsp;for each participant of <a href="https://tosdr.org">ToS;DR&nbsp;</a>(“Terms of Service; Didn’t Read” is a play on “TL;DR: Too Long Didn’t Read” in internet parlance) to see if it would be possible to filter for people who use privacy browser extensions and plugins. All participants agreed to view these services. We were hoping to create a control group of people who don’t use legal policy extensions, but while Participant 3 uses script blockers and other chrome extensions, neither they nor any other participants had heard of browser-based privacy or other legal policy tools. It could be interesting to do a larger survey of people who use these extensions and those who do not.</p>
<p>All participants were curious about browser extensions that address legal policies and agreed to do walkthroughs of TOS;DR and Privacy Badger. Participant 1’s reaction was the strongest: “That is amazing!” Yet, they weren’t sure it would stop them from shopping on a site. Participant 4 wouldn’t necessarily stop using the service (mentioning YouTube) but that “it might make me more careful.”</p>
<p>Participant 2 would want to look at other rating sites. Their concern is who is doing the reports since some can be biased. “Knowledge is power,” and knowing what you are getting into yourself into is important but was doubtful to this participant that it would make a difference overall.</p>
<p>“I would wonder if the trackers it is blocking disrupts my experience on the website. If it doesn’t, I would definitely use the plug-in. I’d disable it one time and then renew it later. “</p>
<p>Of the six participants, Participant 2, the graphic designer, was the most curious about the interface on TOS;DR and Privacy Badger. The color coding made sense for TOS;DR, but the Privacy Badger stop icon and cookie icon were hard to distinguish.</p>
<p>“Red means bad. Green means ‘I want.’ If I have these [cookies] blocked, I only see red: It looks bad.”</p>
 6.1.6.3 Interviewer: “Are you comfortable using a site that uses trackers?” 
<p>Participant 1 doesn’t like trackers. They see ads following them around various sites and called it disturbing. “It can freak you out a little bit. I don’t like it, but I don’t stop using them.”</p>
 6.1.7 Scoring Legal Policies 
<p>In lieu of asking about independent scoring, such as the ratings provided by the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Privacy Badger or Consumer Reports, we asked participants if knowing that a policy is good or bad would change behavior and if so whose opinion would you trust to make that decision. The interviewer allowed questions and responses to arise organically and where relevant suggested discussing concepts such as independent agency, rating service, friends, certification, etc.</p>
<p>From prior responses it seems like it would be very unlikely if users would change their behavior if presented with these scores. Some already have a personal policy of not signing onto a service at first and mentioned behavior like blocking trackers on unfamiliar sites and unblocking trackers as they gained comfort. The scores are seen as “nice to know” and useful in combination with other rating services like consumer ratings or other reviews.</p>
<p>Participant 5 answered this question directly and would trust a rating service, but wouldn’t stop using the service even if the score was bad. They noted that “Amazon got an E [TOS;DR’s lowest rating] and I’m still going to use it.” They said they would only change their behavior if the government enforced a minimum score.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it [a score] would influence my behavior. It would be nice to know.”</p>
 6.1.7.1 Interviewer: “Do you ever talk to people about these policies?” 
<p>Five participants said that they don’t talk to people about legal policies. Participant 1 said it is not a natural conversation. Participant 6 said they probably should have that conversation with their spouse. Participant 2 would talk about it at work because it was something they had to include on their own website, and said they might talk to people about the plugins we demonstrated. Participant 3 is usually the person that people go to to ask about these kind of things, but their former supervisor was “more into this than I am.”</p>
 6.1.7.2 Interviewer: “If you knew that a policy was good or bad, would it affect your decision to use the digital technology?” 
<p>Three participants said that knowing there was a legal rating would change their behavior and three said it would not. Participant 4 said it would make them more aware when using a site and already uses service without logging in if login isn’t necesary. Participant 1 said it would probably be more useful to have a rating for a site they never used before. While Participant 6 said that there are certain things [sites] they wouldn’t give up and that having something like a rating would be “super beneficial.” Participant 4 and Participant 2 mentioned practical changes like not having a credit card saved to the account or changing privacy settings. Participant 5 was the most negative. They’ve already bought things from Amazon for years, which means the damage and privacy violations are already done.</p>
<p>“Having a list like this would be helpful. I can think of scenarios where it would stop me from using the site or give me the the go ahead and go.”</p>
 6.1.7.3 Interviewer: “Whose opinion about whether a&nbsp;policy is good or bad would you trust?” 
<p>Participants indicated that they would trust an independent rating, particularly if it was objective and had no ulterior motive, such as a not-for-profit organization. Participant 4 mentioned Better Business Bureau and Consumer Reports, followed by their own family. Participant 6 trusts restaurant scores, indicating that they would be open to government involvement. Participant 5 from previous questions seemed to want to look to government regulation to solve the problem rather than trust a score.</p>
<p>“I would trust TOS;DR or Privacy Badger more than a friend. That’s their job, what they are actually built to do.”</p>
 <a></a>6.2 Survey Findings 
 6.2.1 June 2021 Study 
<p>We conducted an online survey in June 2021 asking the following questions:</p>
 
 Which of the following are true about a privacy policy on a website or mobile app? 
 Which of the following are true about the terms of service or terms of use on a website or mobile app? 
 
<p>Each question had eight options including both positively and negatively stated phrases, as well as two options that offered combinations:</p>
 
 “It protects me” 
 “It protects the business” 
 “It does not protect me” 
 “It does not protect the business” 
 “It is a contract” 
 “It is not a contract” 
 “It is enforceable” 
 “It is not enforceable” 
 “It protects me and the business” 
 “It does not protect me or the business” 
 “None of these” 
 
<p>This study was found to be flawed with just over 6.1% of responses including contradicting phrases, for example, where a participant selected both “It protects me and the business” and “It does not protect me.” Also, because we included a “None of These“ option on both questions, there was a risk that it could be selected along with a positive phrase. In drafting the survey, we felt this was acceptable as long as an answer was required. If we did not require an answer, it would be difficult to know if a question with no options selected was inadvertantly skipped or if the participant felt that none of the answers were true. However, on reviewing the results, we decided to run a new survey that eliminated potentially contradictory selections.</p>
 6.2.2 August 2021 Study 
<p>In our August study, we dropped the negatively stated options. Instead, we asked participants to indicate whether the policy protects them, protects the business, whether it is a contract and whether it is enforceable. A fifth answer “None of these” was provided in case the respondent believed none of these to be true. (<a>Appendix E</a>)</p>
<p>1. Which of the following are true about a privacy policy on a website or mobile app?</p>
 
 It is legally binding 
 It protects me 
 It protects the business 
 It is a contract 
 None of these 
 
<p>Please describe why you answered this question the way you did.</p>
<p>2. Which of the following are true about a terms of service or terms of use on a website or mobile app?</p>
 
 It is legally binding 
 It protects me 
 It protects the business 
 It is a contract 
 None of these 
 
<p>Please describe why you answered this question the way you did.</p>
<p>This shorter survey offered clearer insights. The following table shows response rates for each option.</p>
<p>Table 3: Response rate for each option in the survey</p>

<p>Just under 40% understood the privacy policy to be a contract (39%), and just under a half said that a TOS/TOU is a contract (45%). This is a huge finding considering that the TOS/TOU is indeed a contract. Fewer indicated that these documents are enforceable with 29% for Privacy policies and 34% for TOS/TOU selecting “It is enforceable.”</p>
<p>On privacy policies:</p>
<p>“I can leave it any time. It is not a contract.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if it is a contract because I’m not sure if it’s signed by both parties.”</p>
<p>“It is a contract part of the EULA that guarantees certain actions that the business may do with one’s content, which may release them from certain responsibilities, but does not necessarily assure protection for end users.”</p>
<p>On TOS/TOUs:</p>
<p>“[Not a contract] Because it doesn’t have my signature.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it is a contract and I don’t really think it is legally binding and it’s just something businesses put in place.”</p>
<p>“Good lawyers can get around the excessive verbiage, so I don’t know if it’s really legally binding.”</p>
<p>More than two thirds of the respondents selected “It protects the business” for both the privacy policy and the TOS/TOU, while less than half selected “It protects me” for either policy. More people selected “It protects me” (about 50%) in regard to privacy policy than TOS/TOUs (35%). This data indicates that the Privacy policies and TOS/TOUs are thought to favor business interests with more perceived protection to the consumer by privacy policies.</p>
<p>“It provides limited protection for both sides.”</p>
<p>“I just don’t believe they would have our best interest in mind.”</p>
<p>“[T]he only thing I know for sure is that I’m not protected.”</p>
<p>Female respondents were more likely than males to indicate that a Privacy policy “Protects me” (56% of females and 43% of males), and that “It is a contract” (41% of females and 36% of males) and that “It is enforceable” (31% females and 28% of males). Other responses were similar across genders</p>
<p>8% selected “None of these” for Privacy policies and 10% selected “None of These” for TOS/TOU, indicating they do not believe it protects them or the business and that it is neither a contract nor enforceable.</p>
<p>We also looked at combinations to see if there are any patterns.</p>

<p>We looked at combinations of examples to see if there is a correlation between any of the statements. For example, if respondents believed that a document is a contract, do they also believe it provides protection to both parties? Below are some of the more interesting combinations; however, none showed a particularly strong correlation.</p>
<p>38.5% selected “It is a Contract” only 20.7% selected both “It is a Contract” and “It is enforceable.” Overall, only 29.3% selected “It is Enforceable”, which is 9.2% fewer than those who selected “It is a contract.”</p>
<p>Less than one third (29.7%) selected both “It protects me” and “It protects the business.” Only a fifth or responses (20.0%) selected “it protects me” but did not select “It protects the business.” 36.0% selected “It protects the business” but did not select “It protects me.”</p>

<p>More people (45.2%) selected “It is a Contract” for TOS/TOU than for Privacy policies. Slightly fewer (33.7%) said “It is Enforceable”.</p>
<p>Those who felt it protected the business were divided over whether it also protects them (29.7% for privacy policies and 22.3% for TOS/TOU) and whether it was a contract (29.2% for privacy policies and 32.9% for TOS/TOU) or enforceable (24.6% for privacy policies and 27.2% for TOS/TOU).</p>
<p>Fewer participants (38.4%) selected “it protects me” for the TOU/TOS than for a privacy policy. Roughly the same number selected “It protects the business” (65.7% for privacy policies and 67.7% for TOU/TOS). For TOS/TOU, 12.5% selected “it protects me” but did not select “It protects the business”, nearly half the number for privacy policies (45.3% selected “It protects the business” but did not select “It protects me” for TOS/TOU.</p>
<p>For a deeper look, we used the Carrot2&nbsp; Clustering Workbench program to identify word clusters for each question.&nbsp; And highlighted common themes in the responses.</p>
<p>The following image&nbsp;indicates the prevalence of various terms and phrases for privacy policies:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The top clusters were Policies (37), Company (28), Privacy Policies (23) and Protects the Business (22), which is logical since the question was to describe why the participant answered the way they did about privacy policies. Using the term “privacy” or references to protecting the business/company or the individual would be expected. It is interesting that the phrase&nbsp; Protects the Business (22) appears more frequently than Protects Consumers (13).</p>
<p>Several clusters indicate uncertainty: While 14 of the comments that contained the term “Understand” or “understanding” were positive, as in “This is what I understand,” and clusters containing “feel” (9), “guess” (8), “supposed” (6), and variations on “not sure” or “unsure” (11).</p>
<p>For TOS/TOU, we found the following clusters:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The top clusters were Protects (40), Business (36) and Legally (21), Company (15), Protects the Business (13) and Legally Binding (10) which is again logical since the question was to describe why the participant answered the way they did about TOS/TOUs and whom they protect and whether they were enforcable. Again Protects the Business (13) appears more frequently than phrases indicating protection of the individual consumer. In fact “protects consumers” did not appear in the responses, while “protects me” appeared only once. There were six instances indicating that both parties were protected by TOS/TOU, but “Both” was not one of the clusters.</p>
<p>Like with the privacy policy cluster analysis, many responses for the TOS/TOU indicate uncertainty: Eleven of 17 instances of “know” contained variations of the phrase “don’t know,” such as “don’t really know.”</p>
 7 Conclusions and Recommendations 
 7.1 Key Findings 
<p>Are consumers aware of legal documents on connected technologies?</p>
<p>Consumers are aware of the legal policies on connected technologies but see them as things they should read and understand but that are ignored in favor of getting to the app or website as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Do consumers understand accurately what these documents are for and whom they protect?</p>
<p>Not all participants that we interviewed had a good understanding of what privacy policies and TOS/TOU agreements are or whom they protect. Some attributed policies of use, which they called “rules” to the privacy policy as well as the terms of use. Both those with a good and poor understandings of these policies say that the policies are there largely to protect the digital technology company and to enforce rules around what they can and can’t do with the technology. Our cluster analysis uncovered some uncertainty in the responses.</p>
<p>Are consumers aware that these documents are contracts?</p>
<p>In the survey 39% erroneously believed that a privacy policy is a contract and only 45% believed that a TOS/TOU is a contract. None of the interview participants indicated an awareness that the privacy policy or TOS/TOU outlined a contractual obligation. They understood the Privacy policy as a promise not to share data, but they were skeptical. As for the TOS/TOU, they understood these as “rules” that they have to abide by. It was understood more as potentially punitive than as mutually agreed terms.</p>
<p>Do consumers use or are they aware of tools to evaluate legal documents? </p>
<p>None of the participants were aware of the existence of tools they can use to evaluate legal policies. They were aware of review sites that evaluate digital products from a consumer perspective, and some understand what a browser plugin is, but tend to use them to block cookies or extend the functionality of an existing program. The interviewer demonstrated two browser plugins, including TOS;DR (tosdr.org), an independent user rights initiative that evaluates Terms of Service, and Privacy Badger (privacybadger.org), an open-source browser extension that blocks cookies, created by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>
<p>Would consumers alter their behavior knowing what these documents mean?</p>
<p>Results from TOS;DR and Privacy Badger on various websites suggested by the participant were of great interest to the participants. Some said that it would potentially give them pause before using a new website, though most are cautious with new technologies anyway. However, half of the participants said that it is unlikely that knowing a site’s score would change their behavior, especially if they are a current customer of that site. They were not surprised that sites like Amazon or Facebook received low scores and suggested of these sites that “the damage is already done.”</p>
 <a></a>7.2 Recommendations 
<p>Should the Me2B Alliance create a scoring system for legal policies?</p>
<p>Given that consumers are not likely to change their behavior even if they know a site has a poor score for its legal policies it is difficult to justify creating a legal policy rating service. Alternatively, Me2B Alliance may wish to consider partnering with organizations like TOS;DR that do this type of rating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>8. Appendix A: Participant Snapshots 
<p>Below are brief snapshots of the Me-s who participanted in interviews and/or focus groups for this research. We have excluded names (even psuedonyms) and demographic information to protect the privacy of these individuals and prevent a biased reading of their responses to questions. Since we are aware that profile building technology can potentially reverse-engineer personally-identifiable information about an individual from the collection of online accounts they hold, we are careful to not only exclude names and demographic information, but also to exclude the names of specific companies and technologies. Instead, we list&nbsp; the number and category of accounts and services held by each participant.</p>



Participant 1<br>

Snapshot: Cautious Consumer<p></p>
<p>Estimated that they have 10-15 total accounts and was able to name 13. This participant was the most cautious of this group. They seemed at first to be unclear on the difference between privacy policies and TOS/TOUs but as the interview went on it became clear that they are aware of them and are curious about third party cookies and sites. Participant 1 skims legal policies when “forced to read them” before signing up, and researches unfamiliar sites. This was the only participant who expressed confidence that deleting their account was a likely response, if something bad, like theft, abuse or racism was reported in connection to the business.</p>


Quotes: Aware of and favorable of plugins because “They make it better to do anything in regard to the Internet….”<p></p>
<p>Devices regularly used: Computer, webcam, mobile device, four different web browsers.<br>
</p>


Key connected products and services discussed: Several email account providers including two provided by the employer, one cloud-based file storage service, one social media account, and one mobile wallet account that they said they had subsequently deleted.






Participant 2<br>

Snapshot: The Skimmer<p></p>
<p>Estimated having somewhere in the range of 51 to 100 accounts. Skims privacy policies and terms of service for items specific to the use of their financial information. This participant mentioned two cases that would make them rethink using a particular digital technology: security breach and sharing of credit card information. Used the term “virtual footprint” when describing what the privacy policy allows companies to track.</p>


Quotes: “I do think it’s on me to read them [privacy policies and terms of use] and absorb them and figure them out.”<p></p>
<p>Devices regularly used: Computer with webcam, mobile phone, tablet device, and two web browsers.</p>


Key connected products and services discussed: One personal and one work email account, an online chat tool, one streaming media service and several online retails sites for household items and clothing.






Participant 3<br>

Snapshot: Too Many Accounts<p></p>
<p>Selected the option for between 51 and 100. This participant stood out for the sheer number of products and services they could name at once that they use. Understands clearly that they all track users but is carefree about most of it. Answered questions gleefully and with wry cynicism at times.</p>


Quotes: On EULAs: “documents you have to scroll to the end to use the product. Random clauses thrown in that no one ever challenges it.” On TOS/TOU: “If you violate the terms, incite violent revolution, we can ban you.”<p></p>
<p>Devices regularly used: One home computer with webcam, one mobile phone, one tablet computer, and two web browsers</p>


Key connected products and services discussed: Two personal email accounts and one work email account. a personal online database, online auto service, two online social media accounts (one disengaged a while ago), three online banking or trading accounts, multiple credit cards, medical, dental, auto, insurance accounts. For work, three cloud-based file storage accounts and three conferencing accounts. Three media streaming accounts, three video game accounts and other entertainment/media accounts.






Participant 4<br>

Snapshot: Secret Shopper<p></p>
<p>Savvy about privacy and tracking cookies, even though they don’t feel very informed about or understand well the subtleties and legalese of the digital agreements. Frequently interrupted to apologize for not answering the questions but tended to have more interesting responses. While enumerating accounts, this participant remarked that it “feels way more than expected.” Does not use cloud-based file storage accounts except for phone backup. Rarely creates accounts at online stores, other than one major retailer, which they use a lot.</p>


Quotes: “I always forget my password…so I just do the option where you enter as a guest… I do it over and over.”<p></p>
<p>Legal documents “are very long and legalese.” “It’s set up most of the time where you have to say you agree, because if you don’t, you can’t go to the next step to buy your grilled cheese sandwich or whatever, so you just click accept.”</p>
<p>Devices regularly used: Two personal computers with webcam, one mobile phone, two tablet computers, three web browsers.</p>


Key connected products and services discussed:&nbsp; Two personal and one work email accounts, several work software accounts, three social media, several financial accounts including credit cards, checking account, investment, and insurance accounts, one cloud-based file storage service, two online conferencing accounts and one that they use without an account. several online retail accounts (“If I buy anything I create an account.”); Two media streaming accounts. Several mobile apps, one local newspaper account and one restaurant loyalty program.






Participant 5<br>

Snapshot: Tech Savvy<p></p>
<p>Estimated having over 101-500 online accounts, many of which use a federated ID to access rather than creating separate accounts. “[There are] too many to count.” Skims online legal policies. Handles a lot of visual assets at work so is most interested in copyright. Very interested in pricing and fees. Skeptical of bias in news media and does not pay for news.</p>


Quotes: “When I sign up, I definitely want to know what the company had access to.”<p></p>
<p>Devices regularly used: Two personal computers, one mobile phone; one web browser, “Several” email accounts including a personal account, a work account and a student email account.</p>


Key connected products and services discussed: Four social media accounts, one airline, one credit union, four credit cards including two affiliated with retail loyalty programs. Health insurance, HSA and IRA investment accounts. Three cloud-based file storage accounts, two of which are unused. Four online retail accounts.






Participant 6<br>

Snapshot: Avid Online Shopper<p></p>
<p>Has hundreds of online accounts and five different emails. Noted that their list of passwords is huge. Read about 2%. Ambivalent about privacy policies and TOS/TOU, but not naïve. Has had an experience where a company offered a free blender on signup but never sent the blender. But won’t necessarily delete an account when something bad happens. Referring to a favorite site, they said sometimes there is only one place where you can get something you need.</p>


Quotes: “There are certain things that I won’t give up.”<p></p>
<p>Devices regularly used: Two personal computers with webcams, two browsers, one mobile phone, three tablet computers.</p>


Key connected products and services discussed: One personal and one work email accounts, two social media accounts, two cloud-based file storage accounts, several online retail accounts, two music streaming accounts, one news account, two online money transferring services, a dog walking service.

<p>Understanding of Legal Policies</p>
<p>First I am going to ask you some questions about your interaction with the legal policies of your online accounts.&nbsp;Please answer to the best of your understanding and feel free to ask me to clarify any questions that you don’t understand.</p>
 
 Do you read the privacy policies or terms of service for online, digital products or services? 
 Do you know what the difference is between these documents? 
 Off the top of your head, what are some things you might find in one of these documents? 
 Are there any specific paragraphs in a privacy policy or terms of service that you tend to look for or read? 
 Another way to ask: Have you been ever tried researching information about a company’s terms of use and privacy policy? Did you find what you need? 
 Would reading news about a company that shows they care about privacy make you feel more secure using them? 
 Have you ever read a privacy policy (or TOS) that made you decide that you didn’t want to use the website after reading it? 
 Do you recall receiving a notification in email or paper post about an update to a privacy policy (or TOS) that made you consider changing the service? 
 
<p>Awareness of Legal Policy Protections</p>
<p>Next, I’d like to understand why you companies have these policies. Again, there is no judgement. All answers are good answers.</p>
 
 
 
 What do you think the privacy policy is for? 
 What rights do you have? Are they protecting your rights/giving you rights/protecting you? 
 (Who are legal policies for?) 
 Do legal policies protect you as the consumer? How? 
 Do legal policies protect the organization? How? 
 Privacy policy 
 Terms of Service/Terms of Use 
 Have you seen cookie notices? 
 Are these legally binding? 
 Are they related to the privacy policy? 
 
 
 
<p>Introduce the definitions</p>
<p>Privacy policy: Public promise of how the technology and the company will treat you and your data. Enforceable by the FTC in the US.</p>
<p>Terms of Service/Terms of Use (“TOS/TOU”): The two-party contract that you are signing that both parties will abide by. Enforceable by the court of law.</p>
<p>Does any of this change your understanding of these policies?</p>
<p>Importance of these policies</p>
 
 
 
 Do you think it is important to read them before signing up for an account? 
 Why? 
 Why not? 
 Could they be important to you? 
 
 
 
<p>Awareness of Tools</p>
 
 
 
 Did you know there are plugins that read privacy policies? 
 If so, do you use them? 
 If you are aware of plugins and don’t use them, why don’t you use them? 
 Would you like to see a couple of these tools?
 
 If so, walk through ToS;DR (tosdr.org) and Privacy Badger (privacybadger.org) 
 Filter for people who do use them 
 Control group of people who don’t 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Trusted Opinions</p>
 
 
 
 Do you talk about legal policies with anyone? 
 Whose opinion would you trust to make a decision about whether to use a digital technology? (The following could be allowed to arise organically and then suggested: independent agency, rating service, friends, certification, etc.)

<p>Updated 26 Jan with links to our published research findings  </p>



<p>READ OUR NEW RESEARCH REPORT<br><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Engine-Room-Digital-ID-2022.pdf">Digital IDs rooted in justice: lived experiences and civil society advocacy towards better systems [English pdf]</a>  (Bahasa and Urdu versions will be available in the coming weeks). </p>



<p>Digital ID systems can act as gatekeepers <a href="https://digitalid.theengineroom.org/">for marginalised communities’ ability to access and realise their rights</a> – and most of the time, such systems are developed and implemented without any participation or input from civil society or the communities most significantly affected by such schemes. This severely compromises the systems’ ability to serve these populations properly.</p>



<p>As more countries look towards implementing digital ID systems (such as <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-dystopian-danger-of-a-mandatory-biometric-database-in-mexico/" title="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-dystopian-danger-of-a-mandatory-biometric-database-in-mexico/">Mexico</a> and <a href="https://www.themorning.lk/digital-ids-to-finally-kick-off-in-2022/">Sri Lanka</a>, among many others), they risk replicating the same mistakes.</p>



<p>Last year, we saw how biometric-based digital ID schemes can bring potentially devastating consequences for entire populations. In Afghanistan, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/30/1033941/afghanistan-biometric-databases-us-military-40-data-points/">the Taliban took charge of biometric databases left behind by the US forces</a>, possibly endangering thousands of people who worked with the US during the 20-year occupation. In Bangladesh, biometric data collected by UNHCR from Rohingya refugees <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2021/6/21/rohingya-data-protection-and-UN-betrayal">was shared with the Myanmar government</a> – that is, those responsible for their genocide and displacement in the first place. In Pakistan, <a href="https://www.codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/pakistan-biometrics-stateless/">stories of thousands of people rendered effectively stateless after their digital ID card was arbitrarily cancelled</a> emerged, showing how these systems can be weaponised by state power.</p>



<p>With all this in mind, in 2021 The Engine Room coordinated a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reimagining-digital-id-systems-rooted-in-justice/">research project investigating civil society advocacy on and around digital ID systems across the globe</a>, supported by Open Society Foundations and in partnership with <a href="https://elsam.or.id/id/">ELSAM</a> in Indonesia and <a href="https://pollicy.org/">Pollicy</a> in Uganda. The research looked at how organised civil society actors are seeking to shape the design, implementation, and oversight of digital ID systems so as to eliminate harms to vulnerable populations. With the goal of understanding how justice-based systems might be achieved, we analysed existing digital ID advocacy strategies in four countries – Indonesia, Jamaica, Pakistan, and Uganda.</p>



<p>Many learnings emerged from this research, and it is worth highlighting the following:</p>



  Many digital ID systems are shrouded in secrecy and in need of myth-busting. Digital ID systems are complex and often lack transparency, and inaccurate claims are often made regarding what digital ID systems can and can’t do – sometimes perpetuated by governments themselves. If civil society organisations are to advocate successfully for changes to systems, they must first understand the existing systems.<br>  Civil society is currently driven to act reactively, rather than proactively. Groups find themselves pushing for change within problematic proposals and systems, rather than being able to proactively advocate for a system that could meet the needs their communities actually face.<br>  Large international organisations are playing a key role in instigating and shaping advocacy. While they can provide valuable assistance to local civil society organisations in helping them to articulate concerns and organise activities, it can be tricky to navigate contexts where the international and local organisations have different ideas. If the international organisations lack members with knowledge of the local context, or fail to include such individuals in their processes, they risk orienting their advocacy work towards targets that do not fit with local organisations’ actual priorities.<br>  Litigation has been a valuable resource across all contexts researched, whether focused on specific aspects of a system or seeking to impede the overall implementation of a system.<br>  Engaging with digital ID systems’ technical specifications is often considered by grassroots organisations as being out of the scope of digital ID advocacy. We observe relatively little advocacy by grassroots social justice organisations that focuses on the technical elements of digital ID; this fact is probably attributable to the prevailing lack of transparency, along with the relatively high degree of technical sophistication needed to understand the options available and the likely ramifications of such details.

		<p>Georgian Court University (GCU) was among the countless institutions across the country that were tasked with bringing education online as the pandemic forced in-person classes to come to a halt. During this rapid shift, Dr. Kathleen Marino, the Director of Instructional Technology &amp; Design at GCU, spent long hours assisting faculty as they moved their courses fully online and ensured students had access to all necessary resources. “Technology and connectivity have become important as we were pushed farther apart to teach, learn, work, and socialize at a distance,” says Marino. “The Instructional Technology and Design (IT&amp;D) unit is responsible for training and supporting faculty and students. While the importance of having technology available for teaching and learning is essential, we must also take the time to step back, assess how we are doing, and consistently strive to provide the best well-rounded education. Technology development for faculty is on-going, not just to increase their technology skillset, but to also develop and design high-quality courses using specific industry standards that help promote student success.”</p>
<p>Course Evaluation and Quality Control<br>
Prior to the pandemic, Marino was conducting course reviews to evaluate the design and quality of several classes and ensure objectives and standards were being met. “As we began navigating in a new environment during the pandemic, an online program was being developed in the School of Business &amp; Digital Media for a master’s degree in Communications and Digital Marketing,” explains Marino. “The dean and her team developed specific requirements for every course in the degree program and requested that after the courses were developed according to the standards, the courses would go through a complete review for design and quality. However once COVID hit, the IT&amp;D unit—which is a team of two—was just too busy to continue these course reviews in a sufficient manner. Just in time, I received an email from Edge promoting exactly what we needed: assistance with course evaluation and quality control.”</p>
<p>Edge’s Online Learning and Instructional Technology Acceleration (OLITA) program is designed to deliver instructional design services and provide online learning experts who assist with course development, transformation, and evaluation, and faculty development and training. “The objective was to have Edge review the courses that were planned to begin first using our requirements and a rubric for design and quality,” says Marino. “The Edge team is highly qualified and has been attentive to our needs, allowing a smooth and timely transition to using outside reviewers. An important aspect of the engagement was having Edge reviewers provide valuable feedback to the faculty members developing the courses, so the developers could make any adjustments to meet the review’s requirements and optimize the course content and design. Using the Edge team is wonderfully cost effective, because from a budgeting aspect, we did not need to hire a full-time staff member with a salary and benefits to conduct these assessments. Most importantly, Edge’s assistance allowed the IT&amp;D unit to focus on assisting with audio-visual technology in the classroom in hyflex sessions for virtual learners, introduce new engaging technologies, and to continue providing much-needed training and support to faculty and students as they navigated a new world of distance learning.”</p>
<p>The Edge OLITA program can provide interim staffing to complement an institution’s existing team, where experienced practitioners help build new courses to meet student demand or redesign courses that optimize them for online learning. With a deep understanding of rubrics like Quality Matters, Edge conducts thorough course evaluations and can make recommendations for improvement. “The Edge team’s rubric was very similar to our quality standards, and if any area didn’t match, they modified the section to sync with ours. Edge did exactly what we asked, and everything ran perfectly. We were able to keep moving an important initiative forward and certify the quality of our courses.”</p>

		<p>Assessing Institutional Effectiveness<br>
The Office of Institutional Assessment and Accreditation at GCU oversees the University’s accreditation processes and procedures, collaborates with the provost for the development of student learning, and conducts surveys of faculty, staff, and students to gather important feedback. “Recent data related to remote learning (pandemic response) was shared with the office of IT&amp;D to improve access to technology among students and faculty and help us assess the appropriate software and training that is needed to provide quality virtual teaching and learning,” says Marino. “GCU students rank their learning experiences as very good and excellent, and these ratings did not fluctuate, even with the change in modality of learning during the recent pandemic restrictions.”</p>
<p>GCU looks to continue to design and deliver innovative academic programs, enhance the student experience inside and outside the classroom, and expand the University’s footprint through various delivery formats at multiple locations. “Going forward, GCU will further refine their courses and offer additional training opportunities for faculty and students,” shares Marino. “Units are consistenly being evaluated, where we review previous goals and set goals for the next few years. We make necessary adjustments, consider our next steps, and determine ways the outcomes will be measured. We will also look to the office of Institutional Assessment and Accreditation for ways to capture and analyze data and other statistical information that can provide valuable insight. IT&amp;D’s overarching goal is to continue to provide training, support, evaluations for quality, and insight for using technology in teaching and learning.”</p>
<p>“Technology is an integral aspect of the learning experience at GCU and our core objective for quality is everlasting,” Marino continues. “As technology continues to change, we will likely include additional goals and explore more interactive and engaging products. Web conferencing products like Zoom have become important to assisting in the creation of an instructional environment that is not isolated, but instead provides opportunities to learn in a virtual social context. With emerging technologies, training and support is imminent for the campus community and the IT&amp;D team will continue to adapt as our ‘normal’ evolves. My focus is to consistently learn something new every day in all aspects of technology and collaboratively work with our faculty, staff, and students to ensure our digital assets for teaching and learning at GCU is of superior quality and creates positive, impactful student experiences.”</p>

		<p>Research and Education Networks (RENs) play an important role in helping to expand the horizons of science and research and create an essential collaboration network that fosters a strong sense of community among their members. Providing a valuable resource to institutions both large and small, RENs have the quality and flexibility to adapt to demanding projects, advanced experiments, and new technology without tying up other networks. Most importantly, a REN can help simplify multi-campus collaborations and partnerships that can help propel research initiatives forward. One such example is the partnership between Edge and Rutgers University to provide a high performance optical fiber network segmented specifically for research that supports a variety of drivers in both scientific and applied research.</p>
<p>Positioned to Support Research<br>
The Office of Advanced Research Computing (OARC) at Rutgers University is the institution’s centralized research computing and data support group. Along with researchers gaining access to essential computing, storage, networking, and data-handling capabilities, students are exposed to valuable training and educational opportunities. With high-performance computing being central to Rutgers’ research mission, the OARC has continued to build a centralized advanced cyberinfrastructure and act as a university-wide resource for research computing and data needs, effective research computing training, and essential workforce development. In 2016, Dr. James Barr von Oehsen became the Associate Vice President for Advanced Research Computing and his strategic leadership helps to further advance the University’s research and scholarly achievements through next-generation computing, networking, and data science.</p>
<p>After starting his new role at Rutgers, Dr. von Oehsen began meeting with Edge and the telecommunications group at the University to determine the future vision of networking that would be needed to support research. During these early conversations, the group found that there was much about research that they needed to learn and the enterprise networking at Rutgers was not set up to run experiments related to network&nbsp; research and to support data transfers coming from large-scale research instruments. At the time, Edge had been serving more of the enterprise side of networking, so the beginning of the journey was a bit of a struggle. Specifically, while doing a data transfers both on campus and off-site, the entire Rutgers enterprise network was slowed down.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Rutgers applied for grants with the National Science Foundation (NSF) that were focused on upgrading networks. This step began to change the conversations between the internal Rutgers networking group and Edge. The focus became more network centric and through this learning process, Edge is now doing things that would not have been possible back in 2016. “With Edge wanting to transition from supporting only education over to also include research and the founding of OARC, everything aligned. We’ve all evolved and grown over the years and are in a much better position to support network research and research in general,” shares Dr. von Oehsen. The current 100G network is in the process of upping to 400G, with Edge giving Rutgers access to their racks. Rutgers is putting their own equipment into Edge racks, sharing resources, splitting costs, and accomplishing things that would not have been possible even a few years ago. Now positioned to better support research, Edge is gaining a national reputation within the research and education community.&nbsp;</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“We’ve built a very good working relationship with the Rutgers team over the years and have trust in one another. Because of this partnership, we are able to tackle problems and find solutions more successfully. Most importantly, we have defined roles and transparency, where Edge is open about what we’re doing on the network side—perhaps adding connectivity or where we would like to expand—because this allows Rutgers to plan on their side more effectively.”</p>

		<p>Building a Strong Partnership<br>
Enabling two-thirds of Rutgers’ research transport connectivity, Edge built 100G connectivity from the University’s New Brunswick campus to Camden, New Jersey; 100G service from Camden to Newark using an alternate path in Edge’s backbone; and also built 100G service from the Newark location to 32 Avenue, the Americas location. “The connectivity all rides Edge’s optical Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) transport network; offering a completely independent infrastructure than how Rutgers operates its existing network today,” says Jim Stankiewicz, Associate Vice President and Principal Network Architect, Edge.</p>
<p>As the principal architect, Stankiewicz works with both the research and telecom groups at Rutgers, providing support for advanced connectivity and network-related needs. “Edge wouldn’t be where it is today if it weren’t for Rutgers and their partnership. Edge has monthly meetings with both research and telecom teams where we discuss connectivity issues, brainstorm new ideas, and determine how we can help them facilitate connectivity to other research networks that their research teams think could be beneficial. I also have ad hoc conversations with team members about connectivity to certain areas within the footprint of Edge services. We’ve built a very good working relationship with the Rutgers team over the years and have trust in one another. Because of this partnership, we are able to tackle problems and find solutions more successfully. Most importantly, we have defined roles and transparency, where Edge is open about what we’re doing on the network side—perhaps adding connectivity or where we would like to expand—because this allows Rutgers to plan on their side more effectively.”</p>
<p>With Rutgers’ diverse needs, Edge aims to utilize their team’s skills to help them through any connectivity issues, while also taking note of ways to improve the network. “Our collaboration with Rutgers is very rewarding and allows us to tackle some complex problems,” says Stankiewicz. “We may have to make some modifications to our network to accommodate needs in certain areas or deliver specific services to their guest wireless services, like for their new esports initiative. All of these projects are unique in their requirements. We not only deliver optical transport services, but we also deliver packet network services to them. Having the capabilities to deliver services to Rutgers over our two distinct network infrastructures is a really good feeling.”</p>
<p>Becoming a Recognized Research Network<br>
When von Oehsen began further building OARC and expanding advanced research computing at the University, he had to determine how to widen the scope to include multiple disciplines. Often when people think about research computing, they think of traditional science, like physics, chemistry, and engineering, that use high performance computing to run their models and simulations. OARC set out to support research across the entire University and find a way to support research areas like computer engineering and computer science. To accomplish this, Rutgers created a testbed where computer scientists and computer engineers could experiment with new edge devices, networks, switches, and gear; building out something that was separate from the production level environment where researchers from computer science and engineering communities could come in and run experiments.</p>
<p>With a $1 million NSF grant, Rutgers built the Rutgers University Next-Generation Edge Testbed (RU-NET); a testbed for computer scientists to experiment with advanced networking and edge devices. The University purchased servers and experimental switches that allowed researchers to work with artificial intelligence or in whichever area they were interested in exploring. Researchers could build testbeds, experiment, collect data, and not worry about breaking production level systems. “Now, through our work with Edge, we have a full-blown research network that is connecting with many different national testbeds and international services—turning our research network into a major player both nationally and across the globe,” says Dr. von Oehsen.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“Rutgers decided to put all research computing in one basket, with compute clusters in a central location, allowing researchers to connect remotely to share resources. This initiative allows for seamless collaboration across departments and throughout the research community. Any good project starts with a great idea, and I was able to tap into my existing working relationship with Jim, who I worked with in my previous role. This project became the paradigm for ‘if you build it, they will come.’ We built the network and now we have multiple departments within Rutgers looking to take advantage of connectivity to our compute cluster and collaboration opportunities in this country and beyond.”</p>

		<p>Bridging Research and Technology<br>
Wanting to have a more direct effect on what is happening in the research world and explore innovative technology, Jeremy Schafer, Senior Automation Engineer at Rutgers University, joined the OARC team, expanding the scope of the work he was doing within the Telecommunications Division at Rutgers. “Jeremy owns the entire experimental networking piece that we’re working on and between him and Jim Stankiewicz, we have a very impressive research network,” says Dr. von Oehsen. “Jeremy is such an asset to the team and is always open to exploring new ideas. He works directly with the researchers, and they respond to him because he has the technical know-how to understand their needs and what they’re trying to say.”</p>
<p>Upon moving into his new role around two and a half years ago, Schafer was tasked with expanding the network and adding more locations, which has quickly expanded in a short timeframe. “Rutgers decided to put all research computing in one basket, with compute clusters in a central location, allowing researchers to connect remotely to share resources,” says Schafer. “This initiative allows for seamless collaboration across departments and throughout the research community. Any good project starts with a great idea, and I was able to tap into my existing working relationship with Jim, who I worked with in my previous role. This project became the paradigm for ‘if you build it, they will come.’ We built the network and now we have multiple departments within Rutgers looking to take advantage of connectivity to our compute cluster and collaboration opportunities in this country and beyond.”</p>
<p>Schafer says working together is essential to accomplishing anything in the research space and he depends on the ongoing conversations he has with Jim Stankiewicz and Dr. von Oehsen. “Collaboration is key to getting things done in today’s world, especially with growing industry trends like AI and machine learning. If Dr. von Oehsen brings up an idea, I’m able to discuss possible solutions with Jim and we can get an idea flushed and implemented.”</p>
<p>In working with both the research and technical sides of the house, Schafer believes any role within IT, whether the person is networking based or computer based, should be a translator, helping to bridge the two areas. “My role is to act as a liaison between each team and ask, what is your business process, what is your research process, and what do you wish to accomplish? Then I translate those needs into a tangible task that we can do via computer network resources. Technology changes every six months, and you must keep pace with the trends. Being closer to the bleeding edges of this rapidly changing, fluid industry is very fun and rewarding, and forces you to learn and grow quickly.”</p>
<p>Advocates for Research and Innovation<br>
To develop a relationship with a REN and have a strong partnership that can accomplish the research goals at an institution, including a member on the team who understands research is essential. “Having a person like Edge’s Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation and Sponsored Programs, who has a finger on the pulse of the research going on within the community is crucial,” says Dr. von Oehsen. “Knowing what smaller schools are doing and making connections with other institutions allows us to be much more productive in pursuing grants together.” Additionally, Forough is having conversations with other RENs and is the facilitator for helping other RENs work more closely together. At the university level, having a central office similar to OARC that is interested in being an advocate for all research can also be hugely helpful. This allows institutions to better understand the needs of their researchers and be more successful at obtaining grant funding.</p>
<p>The group also encourages institutions to step outside the bounds of how things are normally done and not be afraid to break things. In the long run, the mistakes are what lead to solutions. In terms of structure, OARC reports to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Vice President of Research, acting as a&nbsp; bridge between the technical services that the University is putting in place and the research side of the institution. OARC translates the conversations between these two sides and explains in such a way that each stakeholder group understands the importance of each mission. “Forough does that within Edge and my group accomplishes that at Rutgers,” explains Dr. von Oehsen. “Having these two groups aligned allows us to seize important opportunities and accomplish what we set out to do.” Further adds Dr. Ghahramani, “The strength of EdgeDiscovery comes from our partnerships and the increased combined value we can bring to the research community. Trust and transparency are critical to building and sustaining the relationships that power the discovery efforts. Results of the strategic partnership between Edge and Rutgers are not only mutually beneficial to our respective organizations, but also bring significant value by enabling access to resources for the broader research and education community. Leveraging this successful partnership model between a REN and an academic institution, we are working on developing similar partnerships with other member institutions.“</p>
<p>Going forward, OARC is looking to further leverage the relationships Edge is building with smaller institutions and align those partnerships to work in tandem toward common goals. In the group’s discussions of how to democratize resources in the future, Forough loops in people from smaller colleges and universities into the conversation. “We’re learning from Edge, just as much as they are learning from us,” says Dr. von Oehsen. “By forming these collaborations, we understand how to better develop solutions that not only support research on our campuses, but also allow access to education communities that do not have access to these resources. The RENs become the bridge that can bring these communities together.”</p>

 Introduction 



<p>Europe’s Data Governance Act (DGA) reached a milestone. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/11/30/promoting-data-sharing-presidency-reaches-deal-with-parliament-on-data-governance-act/">European Parliament announced</a>&nbsp;it “…reached a provisional agreement on a new law to promote the availability of data and build a trustworthy environment to facilitate its use for research and the creation of innovative new services and products.”</p>



<p>What does the Data Governance Act mean to the ToIP framework and the SSI community?</p>



 Background 



<p>The DGA defines an “intermediary” that facilitates processing and sharing of data for individuals and organizations to “…increase trust in data intermediation services and foster data altruism across the EU”. In the&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/declaration/">MyData</a>&nbsp;framework for user-controlled data sharing, intermediaries are called&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/mydata-operators/">MyData Operators</a>&nbsp;and there is a certification program in place. (See references at the end of this blog post.)</p>



<p>The DGA intermediary has a trusting relationship with the individual. There cannot be any conflict of interest in sharing the data from the individual. In the eyes of the Act, the sharing of the data shall foster “<a href="https://eudatasharing.eu/news/digital-governance-act-proposes-sharing-data-public-good-and-selflessness-concept-data">data altruism</a>” across the EU.</p>



<p>To achieve this goal, DGA provisions a certification program and rules for some public-sector data.</p>



 SSI Data Sharing Models 



<p>The Data Governance Act introduces new roles into data sharing and will set up the necessary governance for a more transparent and accountable data economy. Two main actors are introduced called Data Sharing Service or Intermediaries [refer to chapter III, Requirements Applicable to Data Sharing Service in&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0767">Data Governance Act</a>] and Data Altruistic Organizations [refer to chapter IV, Data Altruistic in same reference].</p>



<p>Neither of these actors shall have a financial incentive that conflicts with representing a Data Subject when personal data is made available to Third-parties or Data Using Service. The following diagram has three SSI data sharing models.</p>



<p>A business or organization collects personal data and shares it with a third-party often in proprietary and closed interfaces. A non-proprietary health care data exchange interface is&nbsp;<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/">FHIR</a>&nbsp;from HL7 which created an open interoperable standard.</p>



<p>A cooperative or intermediary represents the individual when sharing personal data. The sharing shall be standardized and interoperable between different suppliers.</p>



<p>A non-profit organization, acting altruistically, facilitates sharing of data that are in the public institution’s domain. The public institutions may, for example, be health care systems.</p>



Figure 1: Data Governance Act Architecture Overview



<p>Some similarities can be drawn with the Verifiable Credential model where the Data Subject is a Holder, an organization is the Issuer and a third-party is a Verifier.</p>



 The DGA adds intermediaries to the ToIP framework 



<p>The key difference is addition of the Intermediary. The Intermediary represents an agent for the Holder (Data Subject) which has direct control of processing of personal data through a policy engine. Figure 1 shows the ToIP framework with the actors introduced in the Data Governance Act.</p>



Figure 2: ToIP control and data planes overview



<p>Two layers or paths when performing data exchange are described in the diagram.</p>



  A data path (yellow arrows) composed of Verified Credentials (VCs) and interfaces to a data repository.  A control path (green arrows) that sets the conditions for personal data usage, given through a data subject consenting to collecting, processing or sharing of personal data.  



<p>Each actor in the diagram has three different role types: a data role, a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) role, and a privacy role.</p>



  The data role represents Data Subject who the collected data relates to, the Data Source that collects the data, the Data Sharing Service that processes the data prior to sharing the data, and Data Using Service which provides services based on the shared data.  In addition to the standard DLT roles an additional role called Intermediary is introduced. As described before, the Intermediary facilitates the processing of data on behalf of the Data Subject prior to sharing with a third party.  The privacy roles are the standard Data Controller/Processor, Data Subject, and Third-party. To better understand the Data Subject, it is split into two, a client and an agent. The Data Subject has direct control via the Client. The Agent allows the Data Subject to delegate control to the Agent (as a proxy).  



<p>The final aspect to understand are the key functions to enable the Intermediary to act on behalf of the Data Subject. The Intermediary requires a privacy function that applies the transformation and the privacy control selected by the Data Subject. For example the Data Subject may give consent to processing anonymized personal data that would be controlled by the privacy engine. The storage function may be in a wallet or a pseudonymized database with restricted access.</p>



 Summary 



<p>While it may look like most of the work in ToIP relate to VC’s, there is also the work from Inputs and Semantics work group that look at standardizing the storage, portability of the personal data, and creating a layered schema that helps with setting the policy engine when preparing and sharing of the data.</p>



<p>The Data Governance Act can be supported based on the technology being promoted in ToIP Working Groups. The work underway in ToIP Working Groups are aligned with the specific requirements of the Data Governance Act. Both ToIP and the DGA are avoiding a pervasive data ecosystem that promotes the surveillance economy. We both put a data exchange with humans at the center of any data transfer.</p>



<p>A future blog post will look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">Digital Markets Act</a>&nbsp;in relation to ToIP. When an organization exceeds a threshold of users and net income, they are required to adhere to the rules of a Gateway stipulated by the Digital Markets Act. More in the next post.</p>

             <p>Rothex is an Argentinian company that produces, packages and distributes eggs. The company wanted to develop a significantly improved traceability system for its storage and distribution processes. Yet, a major challenge was how to determine the batch size. Since many farms supply Rothex with eggs, they tend to be in heterogeneous quantities that generate a mixed distribution of eggs in differently-sized trays.</p>

<p>To solve this issue and improve its stock handling system, Rothex turned to GS1 standards to help track and trace its egg products. Now, the Rothex traceability system leverages GS1 standards to uniquely identify the eggs by lot/farm and pallet. Each pallet of multiple lots of eggs is identified with a GS1 Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) that in encoded with the lot identifiers in a GS1-128 barcode. By scanning the barcode, the company can easily identify the different lots or farms from which the eggs came.</p>

<p>Rothex has realised multiple benefits from its new traceability system. For example, the company has lowered administration costs due to reduced time associated with searching for information. They can also easily locate egg products with an improved stock management system. With the exchange and integration of knowledge during the traceability project, global teamwork has resulted with a new work culture and ways of working together.</p>

  QUHOMAtrace is a unique combination of IoT and traceability data for upstream visibility in agri-food
guilherme.alme…

             <p>Farms, cooperatives and other agri-food businesses want to create a competitive advantage by addressing consumers’ needs for easy accessibility to valuable information about their crops and food. Yet, there was no single solution that traced the exact location and climate conditions of crops’ cultivation—while also linking crops to the final products eaten by consumers.</p>

<p>QUHOMAtrace from Future Intelligence, an IoT provider, and GS1 data sharing standards have addressed this need for traceability. The QUHOMAtrace platform is designed as an innovative integrator of entity-based registries (e.g., IoT data) and event-based information (e.g., data produced from traceability applications). GS1 EPC (Electronic Product Code)-enabled standards provide the needed foundation for the identification of farm plots, each crop’s batch/lots, and sensors associated with the farm plots and crops, enabling the traceability of crops from farm to fork. Farming visibility events are captured and stored as interoperable, GS1-standardised EPC Information Services (EPCIS) event data.</p>

<p>For the harvested product, information on events prior to a crop’s harvest is now available, such as when it was planted, how it was treated and information from sensors. Farmers can now communicate with their procurers, buyers and/or consumers every detail that happens in the field. They can receive customised advice on the use of a product, how to lower the cost of an external quality inspection, or even how to increase consumer trust and loyalty.</p>

<p>Farmers can also get aggregated data that helps them determine which farm practices can increase a field’s capacity to produce quality crops and food. It can provide the needed justification of a farmer’s environmental decision since this data proves the necessity of certain farm practices, such as irrigation and spraying performance, insecticides applied and more.</p>

             <p>In September 2015, the 37/2014 (IV.30), the Ministry of Human Resources’ (EMMI) regulation, took effect in Hungary that outlines catering, nutrition and health principles for implementation by mass catering companies and mass caterers when providing dietary food.</p>

<p>To comply with regulatory and consumer demands, Hungast Group turned to GS1 Hungary to help build this traceability system based on GS1 global standards. Now, on every reusable dietbox, there is a unique GS1 product identifier encoded in a GS1 DataMatrix barcode that globally identifies the specific food in the box, the institute and the type of consumer it will be delivered to. By scanning the GS1 DataMatrix barcode, Hungast Group has access to real-time information that has helped it increase efficiencies in preparation, cooking and logistics processes.</p>

<p>With improved processes, Hungast Group can now provide individual-specific diets so that all consumer demands are fulfilled, resulting in 100% accuracy in dietetic foods. The company’s new, two-step verification system has helped the commissioning staff, so that the risk of multiple errors and the amount of time spent has decreased. With this, working has become easier for colleagues, improving productivity.</p>

<p>Before the traceability system, one third of dietboxes had to be removed from the catering system and made up every 6 months. Hungast’s new GS1 standards-based solution has eliminated the need to do this and provides full transparency.</p>

  Airfield Estate uses GS1 standards to improve traceability, reduce waste and increase consumer trust

             <p>Airfield Estate, a charitable trust and working farm, is designed to facilitate active learning focused on food, farming and the land. A complete farm-to-consumer experience has been created that educates the public at all stages of the food journey, linking healthy soils to animals and plants and food production. To support its mission, the farm wanted to provide accessible product data to consumers, enabling them to be more informed about its milk product.</p>

<p>To increase the transparency of milk’s journey, Airfield Estate implemented cow-to-consumer traceability and advanced labelling throughout its milk production process. The farm implemented GS1 standards and fTRACE, a cloud-based solution for batch-specific product traceability, on its milk labels.</p>

<p>Intelligent barcodes are used on Airfield’s milk labels that encode production information and fTRACE-provided traceability data in a closed loop production and sales environment. An fTRACE URL is embedded in a QR code, displaying the milk’s traceability data to consumers and linking directly to the fTRACE website and data source. A GS1 two-dimensional (2D) DataMatrix barcode is included for closed-loop proof of concept, which incorporates food waste and product recall.</p>

<p>This data gives Airfield Estate the ability to display and educate stakeholders on the implementation of full supply chain traceability and smart barcode data—all in one location. The traceability solution has also helped Airfield improve stock management and prevent food waste with the use of expiry dates. With the scan of the QR code on the intelligent label, consumers are better informed. And, with data provided with the scan of the DataMatrix barcode, Airfield can execute faster product recalls, if needed, increasing consumer safety.</p>

  IPC/Subway delivers the promise of end-to-end traceability throughout the Subway system

Thu, 01/13/2022 - 10:00



 
             <p>Independent Purchasing Cooperative (IPC), a Subway® Franchisee-owned company, is responsible for the supply chain processes for the more than 43,000 Subway restaurants globally. IPC needed a system to enable full supply chain visibility to optimise its operations. The Cooperative was focused on ensuring food safety for Subway guests and finding business efficiencies that end-to-end traceability would bring.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To achieve this challenging initiative, IPC developed a strategy for getting all of its suppliers and distributors on board. The company collaborated with its supply chain partners to implement GS1 standards for quality data to meet the information transparency needs of its restaurants and consumers alike. Today, suppliers and distributors use GS1 standards to uniquely identify their products and locations as well as exchange product information through the Global Data Synchronisation Network™ (GDSN®). Subway Franchise Owners use a specialised app to capture and use product data at restaurants for the benefit of their operations and customers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>IPC has been able to quantify US $1.3 million in annual cost avoidance by maximising truckload capacity based on accurate product data enabled by GS1 standards. In addition, standardised product data drives operational efficiencies, reduces supply chain costs, and saves time and labour. By using quality product data, Subway restaurants can improve their inventory management and ensure enhanced food safety practices with faster and more precise responses to product recalls and withdrawals. IPC and its independently owned Subway restaurants are looking to further differentiate and enhance consumers’ experiences with customised offers and other innovative approaches to supply chain management.</p>

<p>This collaboration is a wonderful example of how ASDI can help complement the work of other key players in the climate space. The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) data is critical to helping businesses assess the climate change-related risks of their investments. Having this type of information next to other foundational datasets in the cloud, together with access to computational capabilities, can help us streamline the risk assessment process. </p>
<p>In this collaboration, GLEIF retains complete control and ownership of the data in the AWS cloud, but all costs related to data storage and egress are covered by the ASDI program. GLEIF commits to managing the data and also making it openly available to anyone. Groups like OS-Climate, Allianz and BNP Paribas are then able to access the LEI dataset on the AWS cloud and use it more effectively to get better insights into the transitional and physical climate risks of their financial investments. </p>
<p>What is the benefit of having LEI datasets publicly available in the cloud via ASDI’s data catalog?</p>
<p>By storing climate-related datasets in the cloud, we are accelerating innovation by minimizing the cost and time required to acquire and analyze these datasets, some of which are in the terabyte and petabyte scale and otherwise not accessible to most. The LEI data is collocated with petabytes of these foundational data assets and can more easily be integrated in the analysis process. Other datasets available to users include climate projections, historical weather records, satellite observations and more.</p>
<p>ASDI continues to expand its <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/collab/asdi/">data catalog</a> in response to the needs of the sustainability community. By hosting the LEI data on AWS and creating a direct connection between GLEIF’s servers and the AWS S3 bucket, we are able to provide LEI updates every eight hours, making this piece of information available to anyone around the world in a timely manner. </p>
<p>How can verifiable identities enhance global sustainability data and improve the evaluation of climate finance risk and opportunities?</p>
<p>LEIs connect to key reference information that enables clear and unique identification of legal entities participating in transactions. Each LEI contains information about an entity’s ownership structure and thus answers the questions of <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-data/access-and-use-lei-data/level-1-data-who-is-who">'who is who’</a> and <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-data/access-and-use-lei-data/level-2-data-who-owns-whom">‘who owns whom’</a>. This enhances transparency in the global marketplace and allows investors to more easily assess how responsible, from a sustainability perspective, different assets in a given portfolio are. By expanding access to this dataset, businesses and entities around the world can more easily make better-informed decisions about their investments. </p>
<p>How will the partnership accelerate research and innovation for sustainability and climate-aligned finance?</p>
<p>Removing barriers to access and use of foundational datasets will minimize the time and effort associated with its analysis, and accelerate data-to-knowledge pathways. For example, financial services company Allianz is specifically using LEI data to help predict the impact climate change may have on the insurance business, and to help expand the company’s asset management portfolio to include more environmentally friendly and sustainable projects and causes. BNP Paribas, as another example, is using the data to build an open-source entity-matching service which will greatly democratize the creation of climate-aligned analysis.</p>

<p>Since the pandemic began, many social justice organisations and activists have increased their reliance on digital technologies, which has brought many challenges. Organisations have had to develop new ways of working, reshape programmes, support staff and communities and protect themselves against digital attacks. With support from <a href="https://www.sigrid-rausing-trust.org/">Sigrid Rausing Trust</a>, we are deepening our support to organisations who are going through digital transformation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of this, we invite activists, collectives and movements – particularly those who serve marginalised communities – that are facing challenges incorporating technologies in their work to reach out to us for pro bono light touch support!</p>



 Covid-19: the digital divides have deepened and social justice organisations are still facing a digital emergency 



<p>Our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/strengthening-intersectional-approaches-to-covid-19-data-and-digital-rights-advocacy/">research on intersections of social justice and data and digital rights</a> found that going through a digital transformation during a global pandemic has affected the workflow of civil society organisations and influenced their ability — or inability — to reach the communities they serve. During our interviews, we found that for many organisations:</p>



  it has been harder to engage with the communities they serve, especially migrants, refugees and the elderly from marginalised communities;  there have been difficulties working remotely during lockdowns, due to inequalities in access to connectivity, to digital technology and general infrastructure needed to transition to remote work;&nbsp;  the quick transition to remote work in a resource-constrained environment acted as an obstacle to the selection of context-relevant, justice-based tech tools.&nbsp;  



<p>Practitioners highlighted a lack of resources for moving their work to a remote setting or implementing responsible data practices or digital security protocols, not to mention addressing staff burnout. Across all four regions of our research, but especially in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, many examples were shared about how the lack of resources for transitioning to remote work or adopting safer digital practices negatively affected social justice organisations and their ability to respond to crises. These crises included both geopolitical ones (e.g. military occupation and government repression) and increasing digital and physical attacks on activists.</p>



 Get support from us! 



<p>In light of this digital transition, we are providing pro-bono, hands-on tech &amp; data support to social justice groups going through digital transformations, as part of our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">Light Touch Support programme</a>. If you’ve been dealing with the challenges related to digital technologies in your social justice work, we can support you. <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">Reach out to us and schedule a call</a>!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our support may include:</p>



  Redesigning or tweaking your existing workflows to better address your needs and the needs of the communities you’re working with using tech and data in effective, responsible and strategic ways, helping to adapt offline services to the online sphere or hybrid formats.  Responsible data: Adapting responsible data considerations to existing and new projects, and more, developing and implementing an organisational <a href="https://responsibledata.io/">Responsible Data</a> Policy and/or a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/">RAD</a> (data retention, archiving and disposal) Policy.&nbsp;  Tool selection: Choosing tools that are aligned with your political values, learning how to adopt a justice-focused approach in selecting tools and systems for your work (such as an email server, internal communications tools, video conferencing tool, and more), making connections to open source infrastructure providers to transform operations, and developing technical intuition to better navigate the tech tools landscape.  Organisational security: Providing recommendations for secure digital communication and data storage considering your specific context, identifying tools that are accessible and that don’t pose privacy threats, getting guidance on digital care for activists and general capacity building around organisational security practices.  



 More to come! 



<p>As part of this project, we plan on sharing what we learn about navigating the challenges of digital transformation. Keep an eye on this blog if you’re interested or reach out to hello[at]theengineroom.org.</p>

<p>From the beginning, the vision for the Energy Web ecosystem has been decentralized. Every time a new high-quality project or initiative joins our party, we’re all one step closer to achieving our vision. Recently, we welcomed <a href="https://alliancebridge.io/">the decentralized token bridge</a> developed by our partners at <a href="https://twitter.com/allianceblock">AllianceBlock</a>. This solution, launched in early summer and by now supports the Energy Web Chain alongside other top blockchain ecosystems, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism. On top of this, the AllianceBlock team <a href="https://twitter.com/allianceblock/status/1470421970118455309">recently announced</a> that their Bridge now accepts bridging fee payments in Energy Web Token ($EWT). With a secure and high-performance infrastructure supported by the Hedera Consensus Service and plans to implement a <a href="https://blog.allianceblock.io/expanding-the-interoperability-potential-of-allianceblock-bridge-with-the-cross-messaging-protocol-9fb662e7e33">Cross-Messaging Protocol</a>, the Bridge is designed to help the blockchains it supports improve interoperability and invite new sources of liquidity.</p><p>As we’re no longer able to receive technical support for our <a href="https://bridge.energyweb.org/">old bridge</a>, we have to gradually phase it out. This will happen in three&nbsp;stages:</p>  The old bridge will be fully operational until the end of this month (31st Jan&nbsp;2022).  After that, using the old bridge to move EWT from our Energy Web Chain (EWC) to the Ethereum blockchain will be disabled. EWT holders who want to move their tokens to Ethereum will have to use other bridges. The <a href="https://alliancebridge.io/">AllianceBlock Bridge</a> is a preferred example of a high-quality, fast and secure third-party solution that our community can use instead. Bridging tokens back to EWC will be fully supported, so every Energy Web Token Bridged (EWTB) that currently lives on the Ethereum blockchain can be transferred back to the native Energy Web Token (EWT) on the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain.  From February 2022 the old bridge will no longer be supported by the team of Energy Web, so we advise everybody to bridge their EWTB before the end of January just to be&nbsp;safe.  <p>It should be noted that during phases 1 and 2 there will be at least two different ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain that represent $EWT. There will be EWTB, minted by our old bridge, and there will be tokens minted by the <a href="https://alliancebridge.io/">AllianceBlock Bridge</a> and others. When users bridge using AllianceBlock Bridge native EWT from EWC to other chains, including Ethereum, they will receive Wrapped AllianceBlock Bridge Energy Web Tokens (WABEWT). When they bridge back to EWC, they will see AllianceBlock Bridge Energy Web Tokens (ABEWT) for claiming. Upon claiming, ABEWT is automatically converted to native EWT again and users receive the native EWT. From the technical point of view, EWTB and WABEWT are 2 different ERC20 tokens, and they are not compatible. So EWTB will not work with WABEWT bridge or liquidity pools, and vice-versa.</p><p>We encourage our community to bridge back their EWTB to the Energy Web chain as quickly as possible and to use decentralized, reliable and community-supported bridges like <a href="https://alliancebridge.io/">AllianceBlock Bridge</a> in the future to move EWT to other blockchain networks.</p><p>For clarity, we need to reiterate that Energy Web is not responsible for maintaining or operating AllianceBlock Bridge or any other bridge or crypto exchange, centralized or decentralized. As our ecosystem matures and decentralizes further, these services are operated by independent parties.

<p>For several years, Democrats and Republicans have worked to <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-hawley-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-update-childrens-online-privacy-rules">reform COPPA</a>, both in Congress and at the state level.</p>
<p>Recently, Me2BA alongside a coalition of advocacy groups <a href="https://fairplayforkids.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/RepCastorLetter.pdf">endorsed</a> Representative Castor’s <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4801/text#H0F0567F4AC5847D3931CA37661F6CD44">Kids PRIVCY ACT,</a> which is the ongoing effort in the House to reform COPPA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re proud to support a bill that will:&nbsp;</p>
 
  Strengthen the legal protections afforded to children under COPPA, and extend COPPA protections to adolescents ages 13 to 17, who have long gone without privacy protections online, while creating new rights for families.&nbsp; 
  Prohibit surveillance advertising and other harmful uses of data on all digital services likely to be accessed by children, rather than limiting protection to ineffectual notice and consent on “child-directed sites.”&nbsp; 
 
<p><a href="https://me2ba.org/spotlight-report-4-me2b-alliance-product-testing-report-deeper-look-at-k-12-school-utility-apps-uncovers-global-advertising-company-from-cbs-viacom-unexpected-security-risks/">Note our recent research on behavioral advertising in K12 school utility apps</a>, which raises deep questions about corporate data mining of kids for profit.&nbsp;</p>
 
  Incorporate key elements of the UK’s groundbreaking Age-Appropriate Design Code, requiring companies to consider the best interests of young people when designing their platforms, and to conduct risk assessments to determine potential harms to children and teens. 
 
<p>However, Me2BA does not support the long-standing non-profit carve outs in data privacy laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We urge members of congress to follow GDPR’s lead and draft legislation that does not include data broker loopholes for non-profit organizations. Note that the Kids PRIVCY Act was not attempting to establish a new carve out, but it fails to close existing non-profit carve outs by adopting a prior definition of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4801/text#H0F0567F4AC5847D3931CA37661F6CD44">covered entity</a> that essentially exempts most non-profits under the broad exemptions under Sections 4 and 5 of the FTC Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Policymakers should acknowledge that if they continue to allow non-profit carve outs, they are not solving the actual issue at hand. Would it be just to allow non-profit data brokers to get a free pass? Many political non-profit data brokers are known to purposefully attempt to create nationwide voter files– are they exempt under the current carve outs?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that reforming COPPA and the FTC Act to ensure that non-profit data brokers operate under the same rules as for-profit data brokers will not be an easy feat, yet we remain hopeful that policymakers will address non-profit carve outs in data privacy laws. We will continue to advocate for the safe and respectful treatment of people by technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Me2BA grows, we anticipate that we will be asked to participate in more advocacy campaigns and letters. We take this seriously and value transparency. Accordingly, our Policy and Legal Working Group is creating a checklist to standardize our approval process for sign-on letters. What do you think should be on our advocacy endorsement checklist?

				 <p>The concept of SSI was designed with the citizen and privacy in mind. However, existing implementations lack user-friendliness (e.g. showing hash codes to users), creating potential barriers in users’ adoption. OnboardSSI focuses on providing a secure and user-friendly wallet solution creating an easier way for citizens to manage their identity. OnboardSSI will leverage AI to remotely verify users’ identity, without human validator intervention, and creating verifiable credentials. </p>
<p>End-users will perform a 3-step identity verification including scanning of proof-of-identity (e.g. passport), person cross-check through liveness detection, facial matching, and document validation, reaching High Level of Assurance based on eIDAS regulation. OnboardSSI will provide the appropriate abstraction for citizens to easily manage their credentials. Finally, Quadible’s AI continuous behavioural authentication, will secure the credentials, by combining 14 different behavioural and biometric traits.</p>

				 <p>The SSI mandate service is a generic and holistic approach to provide and request mandates. Mandates are SSI credentials signed by the dependent that can be requested by either the dependent or authorized representative. These credentials can be used to prove to a verifier that the authorized representative is authorized to act for specific actions on behalf of the dependent.</p>
<p>The mandate credentials are stored in the wallet of the authorized representative as opposed to a central database in current systems. The dependent can revoke this credential at any point in time if he/she no longer wants the authorized representative to act on their behalf by updating a revocation hash on the blockchain. The SSI mandate provides mandates completely peer to peer and isn’t limited to individuals only. A SSI wallet can also represent a device or institution, for example a company can use a SSI company wallet to authorize employee’s to access the building or use the company credit card up to a certain amount.</p>

				 <p>One of the things people enjoy the most about the internet, is that it enables them to talk to others remotely almost without limit.<br>Unfortunately, remotely often means that parties are not sure who they are communicating with. Think of the epidemic of robocalls and prank calls the telecoms industry has been battling for years, or you yourself simply trying to videoconference with your bank: the absence of an identity layer can be a huge problem. Adding SSI to internet communications resulting in seamless identified communications is the solution to this problem. It enables people engaging in any form of internet communication to exchange presentation requests and proofs, and communicate at the same time.</p>
<p>Mixing two protocols<br>Dedicated to identified communications, Dutch startup and initiator of the SSIComms project Bloqzone (bloqzone.com) has built several solutions to this problem in the past using more standard local identity solutions such as DIGID and IDIN. Unfortunately, these sofar tended to result in a somewhat awkward customer experience since the enduser has to switch between multiple applications during one session.<br>A more thorough approach is therefore needed where not only one application is able to handle both communications sessions and identity sessions, but also where both communications and SSI protocols are interwoven.</p>
<p>The SSIComms project<br>The project SSIComms adds SSI to internet communications by adding SSI wallets to the renowned SYLK Suite, an award winning ensemble of communications solutions with the SIP protocol at its core. This enables users to respond to presentation requests for credentials entirely voluntarily and according to SSI principles during communications sessions.<br>The solution is designed to function within an SSI ecosystem and conform to all its principles by extending the SIP protocol to accommodate identified communications and by linking governance-as-code to the implementation to ensure the rules (as much as possible) are enforced in the source code.<br>The use cases include identification before and during session, the principle of verify the verifier, and exchange of payment tokens during sessions.<br>The resulting source code will be available open source and offer developers the opportunity to integrate their own wallets with the enhanced Sylk Suite react native client.</p>

<p>Through The Engine Room’s <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/" title="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/">Matchbox programme</a>, we support social justice organisations – especially those in resource-constrained backgrounds – who wish to use data and technology to strengthen their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our support is direct, intensive and context-respecting. We meet you where you are, with focused support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve worked with organisations in Latin America and Africa on a diverse range of issues, including legislative and procurement transparency, service delivery, budget monitoring, documenting and visualising police violence, and more. In our last round of Matchbox, for example, we supported the Legal Advisory Information Center (LAIC) in South Africa to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/responsible-data-and-sustainable-platform-adoption-with-legal-advisory-information-center/">adopt responsible data practices and transition to a sustainable platform</a> to manage their land tenure cases, and assisted Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales (CELS) in Argentina to<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/using-uwazi-to-build-a-database-documenting-institutional-violence/"> reconceptualise their database documenting cases of institutional violence</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, we <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/revamping-our-intensive-tech--data-support/" title="https://www.theengineroom.org/revamping-our-intensive-tech--data-support/">revamped the Matchbox programme</a> to make room for even more flexibility and more organic relationship-building with our partners, and to enhance the quality of our support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously, partners were selected through an open call and selection process. Our new approach is designed to deepen relationships and solidarity with our Matchbox partners by working with potential partners in non-intensive ways first, through our Light-Touch Support programme (LiTS). Ideally, this new approach will give our potential partners more opportunities and agency to identify their own needs, allowing support to develop more organically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our new process for Matchbox partnerships looks like this:&nbsp;</p>



<p>After your organisation has <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">engaged with our Light Touch Support</a> multiple times and it seems like you and your work might be a good potential fit for more intensive, Matchbox-style support, we propose an exploratory call to discuss Matchbox-partnership possibilities:</p>



  During the call, we’ll share more information about our Matchbox support offer and have some discussion around whether this is the right time to deepen our collaboration. If, after the call, both you and our team assess that a Matchbox partnership has the potential to be successful, we’ll send you a survey to get a more detailed understanding of your support needs  The survey will be followed by a clarifying discussion between your team and ours.  We then work together to prioritise support areas and design a work plan to implement over 6-8 months.&nbsp;  



<p>If your organisation** is interested in getting support from The Engine Room, please <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">schedule a Light Touch Support call</a> with us!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bring a current tech- or data-related challenge you’re grappling with, and we’ll tackle it together. Through the LiTS process, you’ll be able to get a better sense of how our support works and what it entails,&nbsp; assess if this type of collaboration works for your organisation, and meet some of our team members.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>**Our LiTS and Matchbox support is primarily offered to groups with limited resources, particularly those based in Africa and Latin America,&nbsp; whose work confronts power imbalances, injustice and rights abuses in a given social context.</p>The post <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-can-your-organisation-get-intensive-support-from-the-engine-room/">How can your organisation get intensive support from The Engine Room?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org">The Engine Room</a>.

   From 2022, we’ll be running our Matchbox programme a little differently. After months of research and reflection, we have decided to make our Light Touch Support programme (LiTS) the primary way through which we select Matchbox partnerships.

<p>The Engine Room’s <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/" title="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/">Matchbox programme</a> provides direct, intensive support to social justice organisations from resource-constrained backgrounds who are interested in using technology and data to strengthen their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since Matchbox was launched in 2014, we’ve been partnering with organisations via an open call and subsequent <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/our-matchbox-learnings-from-partner-selection-to-matchmaking/">selection process</a>, guided by <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uF2fIbFJ4JBNfEwOT0WpftXVeXqqTBuB8TfF6nqHZY4/edit#gid=1192898981">criteria</a> developed to help us find initiatives that would be a good fit. Over the years, we’ve grown <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vzVl-xb1wji_KRFyI6k2gfq4d7RsJyymdNBiv7vr8Hk/edit#gid=0">our matchmaking skills</a> and supported <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/">a number of partners in Latin America and Sub Saharan Africa.</a> Our core Matchbox support team continues to be based in these two regions, and have themselves worked within local social movements and civil society organisations.</p>



<p>From 2022, we’ll be running our Matchbox programme a little differently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inspired by learnings from <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Tipping-the-scales-The-Engine-Room.pdf">our recent research on equity in funding</a>, we are moving towards a new selection process. After months of research and reflection, we have decided to make our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">Light Touch Support programme</a> (LiTS) the primary way through which we select Matchbox partnerships. Our LiTS programme provides lightweight support to organisations and individuals working towards social justice, who have questions about using data or technology in their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From 2022, we will do away with the open call selection process (which can be labour- and resource-intensive for organisations who apply) and instead invite Matchbox applications from organisations who have already engaged with our LiTS programme beforehand. We believe that this will allow us to deepen our connections with organisations more organically, build partnerships in non-extractive and non-exploitative ways, and ensure our partners’ time and resources are well applied.</p>



 What’s changed?&nbsp; 



  Growing our relationships and support offers organically: Instead of committing to long-term partnerships with organisations we meet through a selection process, we are now keen to start small (through LiTS) and develop our collaboration with organisations more organically, taking more time to become familiar with each other and ensure that our way of providing direct targeted advice is something that resonates with our partners.  More time spent supporting organisations: Open calls involve an extensive selection process that demands a lot of work from everyone involved. The process can be a strain on organisations – especially during the pandemic – and also on our own team, since we’re only able to support a handful of partners intensively at a time. By growing our connections with former LiTS partners instead, we spend more time on relationship building, project design and support provision.  Growing more equitable partnerships: As with any relationship, it usually takes a while for us and our partners to&nbsp; get to know each other: our areas of focus and expertise, our workflows and working styles, our commonalities and differences. Letting organisations know that they can now request more intensive support, and mutually engaging in assessing if, how, and when that is appropriate, reinforces a more equitable approach to partnership, grounding the growth of our support in trust, honesty and solidarity.&nbsp;  Increased flexibility: The open call process tied us to a particular application window; we will now instead be able to offer support to organisations along a more organic timeline. Trust helps us to hold space for honest conversations where partners have room to engage with us at the most appropriate and opportune moments for them, allowing us to provide support that is responsive to shifting organisational contexts, capacities, resources and needs.&nbsp;  Shorter timeline: We used to take on a sizable project to work on with our partners for around 12-18 months; Matchbox partnerships will now take place&nbsp; over 6-8 months. The more contained timeline requires us to really prioritise what’s needed most, and to embark on it incrementally.  



 New processes = new challenges&nbsp; 



<p>This is a new format, and we’ll need to learn and refine the programme accordingly as we go. We’ll need to figure out things like how to best navigate shifting numbers of partnerships, and&nbsp; how to best manage a more demand-driven level of support (in terms of our matching our internal resources to changing levels of demand).&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ll also need to keep an eye on who might not know about us, in order to ensure that we continue to have a diverse pool of partners. This means actively promoting our LiTS support in spaces more accessible to those who tend to be excluded from tech and data spaces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On that note, if you are working in a social justice context and have questions or ideas related to using tech and data in your work, we’d like to invite you to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">schedule a LiTS call with us (</a>or to please share our LiTS programme with partners you think might be a good fit!).</p>



<p><br>We are also eager to hear your thoughts, concerns, advice, experiences, questions, and ideas around our new approach – feel free to reach out to us at joshua[at]theengineroom.org.</p>The post <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/revamping-our-intensive-tech-data-support/">Revamping our intensive tech &amp; data support</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org">The Engine Room</a>.

<p>Being a support organisation, our work is focused on strengthening civil society organisations through their use of data and technology. We support organisations in the process of considering the privacy, security and ethical implications of organisational practices around technology both in everyday and strategic decisions. We are thrilled to be partnering with the <a href="https://www.hrfn.org/">Human Rights Funders Network (HRFN)</a> on their journey to strengthen their organisational security.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hrfn.org/">HRFN</a> is a network of funders from the Global South, East, and North dedicated to resourcing human rights action around the world. Their unique context has led to the desire to focus on strengthening internal practices around digital security. We are excited to support them in exploring new topics, best practices and “unknown unknowns” in the way they collaborate, select platforms, and implement safety protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are working with HRFN to assess their current organisational and digital security processes and build a way forward to more secure, resilient and justice-focused practices. For the next 10 months, we will be assessing HRFN’s infrastructure and conducting interviews with staff to better understand their organisational security needs. With this input we will detect opportunities, build a roadmap together and accompany HRFN in the implementation of the plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your organisation is also navigating the organisational security journey we’d love to chat with you about it. We’d like to invite you to join our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/projects/organizational-security/">Organizational Security Community</a>, use the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-toolkit-orgsec-practitioners/">organizational security toolkit</a> we put together and to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/contact/">get in touch</a> with us if you need support.</p>

 Information about the candidate OASIS Standard and the OSLC OP 



<p>The OSLC initiative applies Linked Data principles, such as those defined in the W3C Linked Data Platform (LDP), to create a cohesive set of specifications that can enable products, services, and other distributed network resources to interoperate successfully.</p>



<p>Quality Management V2.1 defines the OSLC quality management domain, a RESTful web services interface for the management of product, service or software quality artifacts, activities, tasks and relationships between those and related resources such as requirements, defects, change requests or architectural resources. To support these scenarios, this specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.</p>

<p>The 3Box Labs team recently published <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/74">a new standard for creating capability containers</a> for accessing decentralized data to the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CASA">Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance</a>. Capability containers are an approach for managing advanced data security and permissions, commonly referred to as “Object Capabilities” or “OCAPs.” </p><p>This new standard is currently in development for use on Ceramic. Once deployed in a future version of the protocol, it will allow Ceramic to be fully compatible with the new <a href="https://login.xyz/">Sign-in with Ethereum (SIWE)</a> specification as well as provide advanced data flow control features for resources stored on the Ceramic network. This post explains how it all works.</p> The need for more advanced access controls <p>For Ceramic, a decentralized data network, identity and access control are first-class considerations. A key question when managing user-centric data is, "As a user, how can I safely permit a third-party to act on my behalf?" Use cases could be as basic as allowing an application to read private information in my profile, or as complex as allowing an application to update my data sharing and permission settings. To make all of this work, Ceramic needs more advanced access control functionality to support all applications that involve data sharing, collaboration, teamwork, or other multi-user, data-driven features.</p><p>Most access control implementations follow one of two distinct approaches: Access-Control Lists (ACL) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">Object Capability model</a> (OCAP). ACL includes role-based access control, mandatory access control, and discretionary access control. This solution includes maintaining a list of known accounts along with their permissions.</p><p>On the other hand, OCAPs use capabilities as a means of managing access control rights without being locked-in to a specific account model or canonical ACL list. Ceramic, like other Web3 protocols, works in a decentralized and highly adversarial environment. This introduces risks and complexities beyond those found in centralized systems relating to DoS, the Ceramic code supply chain, the supply chain of the applications built on top of Ceramic, private key stealing/loss, a UI that misleads users, government actions, and finally protocol design flaws. As a permissionless and decentralized network, there’s also no centralized registry of roles and permissions that an ACL would require. Therefore, we believe object capabilities are the natural correct choice for designing an access control protocol that operates in a distributed environment.</p> Introduction to Capabilities <p>A capability is an unforgeable piece of data, that represents a right to operate on an object. It contains a list of allowed actions and restrictions on each object, together known as a caveat. When an entity that owns a capability issues another one, these capabilities form a chain. Every following capability in a chain contains a caveat that permits less or equal to the previous one.</p><p>You could think of a capability as a "power of attorney" document, but more powerful: the capability may include the right to delegate some of the permissions to yet another actor. In the figure above, we have three entities A, B, and C.</p>  "A" issues a capability to "B" with the set alpha=[1,2,3], representing permitted actions on some resource.  "B" gives another capability to "C", based on its first capability.  Now, "B" attenuates (reduces) the permissions of "C" to beta=[1,2].  "C" then invokes an operation on a resource presenting both the capabilities.  "Resource" is able to check the entire capability chain to either allow or reject the invocation.  <p>Our initial research on capabilities found two existing approaches for how to represent capabilities: <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">zCAP-LD</a>, based on the LD-Proof specification, and <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/auth-without-backend/">UCAN</a> by Fission, which has no formal specification. Both share the same general structure; they describe who can perform what action with a cryptographic proof. In examining these options for Ceramic, we found that while both zCAP-LD and UCAN could be serialized as IPLD objects, they use signature schemes that are not easily compatible with the blockchain wallets primarily used for authentication amongst Ceramic community developers and throughout the broader Web3 ecosystem. Therefore, we decided to pull elements from each and create a new format, <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/74">CACAO (Chain Agnostic CApability Object)</a>.</p> Capabilities on Ceramic <p>Today when a user opens an application that uses Ceramic to store and manage data, she is likely authenticated via <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/authentication/3id-did/3id-connect/">3ID-Connect</a>. 3ID-Connect protects a user's private key and all the signing requests which go through it. For each Ceramic stream update, the following process occurs:</p><p>Whenever the app needs to update a stream it goes to an identity wallet—3ID-Connect—to request a signature for the update before applying it to the stream. The process repeats for all subsequent updates.</p><p>Instead, we would like an application to request a capability once for writing to a stream (or any other access-controlled resource) and proceed to do many updates. This is a critical UX improvement and needs to be done while maintaining security.</p><p>The corresponding key scheme looks as follows:</p><p>From a UX perspective, the flow resembles permissioning on a modern operating system. Before an iPhone application can access a protected resource, it has to ask for the user's permission.</p><p>Compared to an OS permissioning system, CACAO provides two critical advantages.</p><p>First, re-delegation and attenuation of permissions. This enables more sophisticated and powerful permissioning systems to be created. For example, users could grant rights to a data collective, privacy watchdog, or bank that they trust to manage permissions well. Or they could grant permission to a social application to further grant certain permissions (say, to read their private social graph) to other users on the app, thus trusting the application to create shared social experiences without compromising UX.</p><p>Second, CACAO gives users and other entities direct cryptographic control over their granted permissions, rather than relying on 3rd party enforcement (e.g., Apple’s code). &nbsp;Among other benefits, this means permissions can always be revoked. It also creates auditable and cryptographic guarantees that the correct permissions are being enforced, rather than finding out an application has abused your trust and granted permission to data where they weren’t supposed to (e.g. Facebook and Cambridge Analytica).</p> CACAO Standard &amp; Implementation <p>As described in <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/74">CAIP standard draft</a>, we can represent the signed "<a href="http://login.xyz">Sign-in with Ethereum</a>" (SIWE) payload as an <a href="https://ipld.io/">IPLD</a> object. We named it <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/74">Chain Agnostic CApability Object or CACAO</a>. This allows us to describe desired permissions as URIs (see the SIWE Resources section) in the SIWE payload and use the IPLD object directly as a capability.</p> <code>type Payload struct {
  domain String // =domain
  iss String // = DID pkh
  aud String // =uri
  version String
  nonce String
  iat Int // Unix timestamp =issued-at
  nbf optional Int // Unix timestamp =not-before
  exp optional Int // Unix timestamp = expiration-time
  statement optional String // =statement
  requestId optional String // =request-id
  resources optional [ String ] // =resources as URIs
}</code> <p>In Ceramic, data is stored in IPLD DAGs called streams. An update to a Ceramic stream is a <a href="https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-jose/spec/">DAG-JWS</a> object called a commit, containing a cryptographic signature and the <a href="https://github.com/multiformats/cid">CID</a> of the original payload. To leverage capabilities in this structure, we reference the target capability in the JWS header as a "cap" property. When verifying a new commit, we could see that a signer differs from a stream controller. In this scenario, we check if the controller has permitted the signer to perform the operation by validating the referenced capability in the JWS header.</p> <code>{.p.domain} wants you to sign in with your Ethereum account:
{.p.iss[address]}

{.p.statement}

URI: {.p.aud}
Version: {.p.version}
Chain ID: {.p.iss[chainId]}
Nonce: {.p.nonce}
Issued At: {.p.iat}
Resources:
- {.p.resources[0]}
- {.p.resources[1]}
...
- {.p.resources[n]}
</code> <p>We thus achieve the goal of allowing an application to act on behalf of an account.</p> Next steps <p>This post outlined our approach to capability-based authorization in Ceramic, however there is still much work to be done before it is ready for a general audience. One particular challenge will be formalizing attenuations. Instead of relying on the sophisticated composition of "if" statements —which is a common practice — we may explore a domain-specific language to deal with any caveat uniformly with strict mathematical guarantees. Another challenge will be introducing the right UX patterns that responsibly give users direct control over their data and permissions.</p><p>Finally, we’ll be looking for the right specific use cases to benefit from capability-based access control to fully develop these use cases first.

<p>Though Blockchain Commons initiatives date back to our 2016 foundation of <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a> and our 2017 work on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line</a> (initially funded through support from <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Blockstream</a>), it’s only in 2020 and 2021 that <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/">Blockchain Commons</a> has come into its own as a full member of the blockchain design community. We’re thrilled with the work we’ve been able to produce in the last two years, with many projects seeing great advancement in 2021.</p>

 Our Vision 

<p>One of the core things we did last year was to define our vision and objectives in a concrete form. Our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html">vision</a> is to advocate “for human dignity online by enabling people to control their own digital destiny.”</p>

<p>We feel that this is particularly critical following the increased focus on digital life during the pandemic, and what we hope will be an increase in human prosperity as we emerge from the COVID crisis. At this crossroads, we must choose to either trust governments to have total control over our digital self, or we must fight for our digital freedom. Obviously, we choose the latter path.</p>

<p>We are working toward our vision through the creation of infrastructure that is open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate. Four early objectives are intended to advance our vision in the next few years: the creation of a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community">community of designers</a>; the definition of a self-sovereign design architecture; the creation of demand for this architecture; and the welcoming of peers into our industry.</p>

 Architectural Overview 

<p>To date, our biggest focus has been on our architectural objective. We began with community discussions about the extant flaws in the blockchain ecosystem, particularly related to interoperability between different applications and services. That led us into the creation of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/README.md">specifications</a> as well as the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles">Gordian Principles</a>, which outline our core desires for interoperable infrastructure.</p>

<p>This led to the development of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons">reference libraries</a> that followed our specifications &amp; architecture objectives and then <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian">reference applications</a> that used the libraries. The next step will be for these specifications (and libraries) to be deployed in physical products, which we’re just starting to see as 2021 comes to an end.</p>

<p>We generally see this as the model for Blockchain Commons development: we talk with the community, create a spec, and demonstrate how to use it, then the community creates applications.</p>

<p>So what did 2021 specifically bring for our architectural objective?</p>

 Our Specifications 



<p>Much of our original architectural work on specifications such as <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash.info#readme">LifeHash</a>, <a>SSKR</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md">URs</a> occurred in 2020, but in 2021 we made few major expansions: we produced v2.0 of LifeHash, to make it more compatible with grayscale screens; and we released our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-001-request.md">Request/Response design for URs</a>, which we see as the interoperable end-goal of UR design.</p>

<p>With much of this base work done, we also increased our educational support for our specifications in 2021: our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">technology overview video</a> overviews our work; while we also produced extensive docs for both <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-overview.md">SSKR</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-overview.md">UR</a>.</p>

 Our Reference Apps 

<p>Our next goal with our specifications is to bring them into practical usage by the blockchain ecosystem. Blockchain Commons trailblazes the way with reference apps that demonstrate both their usage and our libraries. Our most notable release in this regard for 2021 was <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS">Gordian Seed Tool</a>, an app now available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">iOS and Mac App stores</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229"></a>
Gordian Seed Tool demonstrates how to create an app based on the Gordian Principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. It also shows best practices and UX for specifications such as LifeHash, UR, SSKR, and PSBTs with animated QRs. The app is a complete reference for the feature set that we’d love to see all airgapped hardware wallets supporting in the coming year.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070"></a>
We also produced <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QR Tool</a>, also for the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Apple app store</a>, which reveals how the Gordian Principles can be applied to the wider world of data storage.</p>

<p>Finally, our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS">Gordian Server platform</a> saw its 1.0 release: this is the linchpin of our Gordian architecture, meant to demonstrate how users can maintain independent control of their digital destiny.</p>

<p>We look forward to more of this work appearing in the deployments of blockchain manufacturers, with some of the first releases of Blockchain Commons specifications already out from
<a href="https://foundationdevices.com/passport/details/">Foundation Devices</a>, <a href="https://keyst.one/">Keystone</a>, and <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow</a>, with more to come. We’ve already begun <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/Docs/Integration.md#using-sparrow-as-a-transaction-coordinator">documentation</a> on how shared use of these specifications creates a new world of interoperability.</p>

<p>Though our architectural work has been our biggest priority, we also did work on our two other major objectives: creating demand for our work and enlarging the blockchain community through education.</p>

 Creating Demand 

<p>Creating demand for open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate infrastucture came mainly through work with legislative bodies. We’ve worked with Wyoming for years, and were thrilled to see their first-in-the-country definition of digital identity go into effect <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">in July 2021</a>. It depends on the delegatable power of a <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">Principal Authority</a>, so we wrote about what that means for the future of digital identity. Because Wyoming is so far ahead of the rest of the country on digital matters, we’ve suggested they create an <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JNmCMVEdMpAHoqVZ7UBakr2PtHgQI4hIgSpRD07nkkU/">eResidency program</a>, to bring these advantages to everyone.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons also testified before other legislatures and lawmakers including ones in Nevada, North Dakota, Buenos Aires, and the Netherlands. We’re thrilled to be able to continue explaining the need for self-sovereign and compassionate digital infrastructure across the world.</p>

 Supporting Education 

<p>The flip side of creating demand is educating the next generation of blockchain developers. One of our prime thrusts in that direction has always been our Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course, which we minorly updated to keep up-to-date with Bitcoin 20.0 as <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin 2.1</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/master/es"></a>
More importantly, we also released complete translation of Learning Bitcoin into <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/master/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/master/es">Spanish</a>. This was our first truly open-development project, initiated and entirely conducted by volunteers. We’re very grateful to these volunteers for managing the translations, as we think they’re critical in the continued design and development of blockchain technology internationally.</p>

<p>Our other long-term educational program at Blockchain Commons is <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody">SmartCustody</a>: helping designers and users alike to increase the resiliency of their digital holdings. We feel that this is critical education because it allows people to take full andresponsible control over their digital assets and it helps them to avoid the most common losses, stemming from lack of knowledge and human error.</p>

<p>Though we’re still seeking funds for a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook/blob/master/TODO.md">v2.0 of our course</a>, we have written a few articles that cover some of the technological methods that can improve the resilience of custody in the future, including <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md">multisigs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md">SSKR shares</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Timelocks.md">timelocks</a>. Some of the material remains preliminary, but that’s because integration of the technology is exploratory as well. We look forward to more completely bringing this material into #SmartCustody in the future, as these technical tools are what we’ve always seen as the end-goal of #SmartCustody work.</p>

<p>Finally, we also repeated our internship program in 2021, and were thrilled to herald another coterie of new blockchain developers (and others interested in the field) into the industry.</p>

 Our Future 

<p>Looking forward, there’s lots to be done.</p>

<p>We’re hoping to see even more third-party projects bringing our specifications to market: not only hardware and software wallets, but also online services that leverage them. We’ll also be continuing to support our specifications with reference applications that can be used by developers to test their interoperability.</p>

<p>
Gordian Recovery is our next planned reference release: it’s intended to demonstrate how to recover funds even if a wallet manufacturer disappears, especially for the more complex situation of multisig recovery.</p>

<p>More new initiatives will include investigations into Ethereum as another blockchain that could benefit from some of our infrastructural work and beginning to leverage Rust as a more fundamentally secure language for writing apps. Finally, we’re expecting to work with the recent Taproot soft-fork, and opportunities offered by its Schnorr signatures, as the biggest new advance in the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>

<p>This coming year, we also hope to see the return of the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a> design workshops, which incubated a lot of the ideas that have gone into Blockchain Commons. A second virtual salon is occurring <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/out-of-the-box-2052-tickets-231958081867">this month</a>, but the resumption of the full design workshops will of course be pandemic-dependent. In the meantime, we’re thrilled to see the continued development of RWOT’s ideas: we celebrated the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/26/self-sovereign-identity-5-years-on/">five-year anniversary of self-sovereign identity</a> with Coindesk and were also thrilled to contribute to the <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity book</a> from Manning.</p>

<p>Our biggest challenge going forward is that we need Blockchain Commons to be more self-sufficient, which has proven a difficult nut to crack given the foundational nature of a lot of the work we’re doing. We’re very grateful to our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">GitHub sponsors</a>; if you’re doing work that will ultimately benefit from some of the specification and interoperability work we’re doing, we encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor as well</a>, to ensure we can keep doing that work. You can also show your support for our ideals with the self-sovereign NFTs that we’re hoping to roll out in 2022.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone for the support and interest in Blockchain Commons to date, especially including the early adoptors of our specifications, our sustaining sponsors: <a href="https://bitmark.com/">Bitmark</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blockchainbird/bird">Blockchainbird</a>, <a href="https://www.crossbar-inc.com/">CrossBar</a>, <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/">Foundation Devices</a>, <a href="https://hrf.org/">HRF</a>, <a href="https://keyst.one/">Keystone</a>, <a href="https://unchained.com/">Unchained Capital</a>, and our many [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons].</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation plays an important role in the interoperability of Internet identity.&nbsp; This is to announce the OpenID Foundation individual community board member 2022 election schedule.&nbsp;Those elected will help determine the role the Foundation plays in facilitating the development and adoption of open identity standards as well as the strategic direction of the organizations.</p>
<p>Per the Foundation’s bylaws, three individual community board members are elected.&nbsp; Nat Sakimura’s and John Bradley’s terms have one year remaining. George Fletcher’s two-year is coming to an end. I want to thank George for his ongoing service to the Foundation and the community at large.&nbsp; George is eligible to nominate himself again for this important role, as are others</p>
<p>The individual community board member election will be conducted on the following schedule:</p>
 
 Nominations open: &nbsp;Friday, December 31, 2021 
 Nominations close: &nbsp;Friday, January 14, 2022 
 Election begins:&nbsp; Monday, January 17, 2022 
 Election ends: Monday, January 31, 2022 
 Results announced by: Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
 New board term starts: Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
 
<p>All members of the OpenID Foundation in good standing are eligible to nominate themselves, second the nominations of others including those who self-nominated, and vote for candidates. If you’re not already a member of the OpenID Foundation, we encourage you to join now at&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/members/registration">https://openid.net/foundation/members/registration</a>.</p>
<p>Voting and nominations are being conducted on the OpenID Foundation web site at <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/members/elections/51">https://openid.net/foundation/members/elections/51</a>. Please log in at&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/members/">https://openid.net/foundation/members/</a>&nbsp;to participate in nominations and voting. If you experience problems participating in the election or joining the foundation, please send an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:help@oidf.org">help@oidf.org</a>&nbsp;right away.</p>
<p>Board participation requires a substantial investment of time and energy. It is a volunteer effort that should not be undertaken lightly. Should you be elected, expect to be called upon to serve both on the board and on its committees. You should have your employer’s agreement to attend two or more in-person board meetings a year, which are typically collocated with important identity conferences around the world. If you’re committed to open identity standards and work well with others, we encourage your candidacy.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to publicly address these questions in your candidate statement:</p>
 
 What are the key opportunities you see for the OpenID Foundation in 2022? 
 How will you demonstrate your commitment to the work of the foundation in terms of resources, focus and leadership? 
 What would you like to see accomplished in 2022? How do you personally plan to make these things happen? 
 What resources will you bring to the foundation to help the foundation attain its goals? 
 What current or past experiences, skills, and interests will inform your contributions and views? 
 
<p>Candidates can address these questions in their election statements on various community mailing lists, including <a href="mailto:openid-general@lists.openid.net">openid-general@lists.openid.net</a>. Please forward questions, comments and suggestions to me at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a>.</p>

<p>Wakefield, Mass., – 22 December 2021 –&nbsp;Today, <a href="http://bit.ly/EEACommunityProjects">EEA Community Projects</a> announced that SAP has become a sponsor of the initiative in support of the Baseline Protocol project. As a sponsor, SAP joins Accenture, Arca, Chainlink, ConsenSys, the EEA, EY, Ethereum Foundation, Mover, Morpheus Network, Nethermind, Provide, Splunk, and Unibright in providing strategic vision, governance, technical guidance, and financial support for the work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We’re excited to have SAP join the Baseline community, alongside a growing list of global leaders that are sponsoring the Baseline Protocol. SAP’s sponsorship is especially important because baselining is all about security in multi-party processes, and SAP technology is the gold standard in secure information management,” said John Wolpert, ConsenSys Group Executive and Baseline Protocol Technical Steering Committee Chair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Launched in March of 2020, the Baseline Protocol uses advances in peer-to-peer messaging, zero-knowledge cryptography, and blockchain technology to coordinate complex, confidential workflows between enterprises without moving company data out of traditional systems of record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to have SAP join as a sponsor of the EEA Community Projects in support of the Baseline initiative. Hundreds of companies and thousands of individuals are already actively participating in the Baseline initiative because it enables private collaboration between companies without sensitive data going on-chain. As more and more organizations and developers realize the simplicity and security that the Baseline approach offers, the tool will deliver more value to consumer-facing industries through peer-to-peer transactions and services,” said Dan Burnett, EEA Executive Director and EEA Community Projects Governing Board Chair. “We look forward to working with SAP to chart the future of secure multi-party workflows.”</p>



<p>To learn more about becoming a Sponsor or joining the Projects Governing Board, visit <a href="https://oasis-open-projects.org/sponsorship/">here</a> or contact the <a href="mailto:project-admin@oasis-open.org">EEA Community Projects</a> administrator. For more information go to Baseline-protocol.org.</p>



<p>About the Baseline Protocol</p>

<p>BrightID tackles the problem of Sybil (duplicate account) attacks. By developing a public graph, BrightID has brought about an infrastructure in which different algorithms can be tried to counteract such attacks. Applications will choose what algorithms suit them best to verify their&nbsp;users.</p><p>Bitu is the first graph-analysis-based verification method that BrightID offers. The nodes inside the main regions of the graph get verified by Bitu. It recognizes nodes outside the borders of those regions as Sybil accounts. This verification method is based on the fact that when a graph is drawn using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing">Force-directed algorithms</a>, Sybil accounts are pushed away from the main, dense regions to the borders. The reason is that Sybil accounts can not make a significant number of connections with honest ones and can only make connections with each other. That is why they get pushed away from the main regions to the surrounding districts.</p><p>In current seed-based algorithms, there is a small number of highly trusted nodes called seeds which have the power of verifying users. Because nodes are verified on the basis of their proximity to the seeds in the graph, such algorithms are very vulnerable to attacks from&nbsp;seeds.</p><p>In Bitu, however, there is no seed. In fact, every node is a seed and can verify others as long as they remain in the main regions of the graph. While seed-based methods rely on a minority of highly trusted seeds, Bitu relies on a low-trusted majority.</p><p>Can BrightID scale while maintaining security against Sybil attacks? We have been frequently asked, as <a href="https://medium.com/u/587a00dbce51">Vitalik Buterin</a> did in “<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/10/18/round7.html">Gitcoin Grants Round 7 Retrospective</a>”:</p><blockquote>BrightID is going to face a tough challenge making it reasonably easy for regular users to join but at the same time resist attacks from fake and duplicate accounts. I look forward to seeing them try to meet the challenge!</blockquote><p>Verification based on the help of a small number of highly trusted seeds gives users a hard time getting verified. On the other hand, increasing the number of seeds decreases the security of the network against&nbsp;attacks.</p><p>Relying on a majority of low trusted nodes instead of a minority of high trusted ones known as seeds enables Bitu to maintain scalability while ensuring security. Bitu enables users to get verified easily through making a single connection with one of the users in the main regions. Thus BrightID can scale its network. And if a user in the main regions tends to create a significant number of fake accounts to verify them by making connections with them, the fake accounts get pushed away from the main regions and even the attacker will get unverified. This prevents large-scale Sybil attacks and guarantees security.</p><p>Moreover, Bitu can tackle small-scale Sybil attacks; it enables apps to verify users based on the number of connections. For instance, Gitcoin may require users to have at least 10 “Already known” connections in Bitu. So the higher the required number of connections is, the more secure the app gets. This makes it too hard for Sybil accounts to make enough connections without getting out of the main&nbsp;regions.</p><p>An example helps clarify how it works. User X wants to create 10 fake accounts in order to use them in the Gitcoin application. If Gitcoin requires only one “Already known” connection for verification, user X with strong connections to the main regions of the graph can drag those ten accounts into the main regions without the risk of getting out of the main regions. However, if Gitcoin requires ten or more “Already known” connections for verification, user X needs to either connect these ten fake accounts to honest users or connect these ten accounts to each other to reach the minimum required number of connections. Note that honest users don’t make connections with unknown accounts as “Already known” and connecting those ten accounts to each other causes all these ten accounts to get pushed away from the main regions of the graph and get unverified.</p><p>Bitu is the first method that tries to tell bots and fake users from real ones through the viewing of the graph. The BrightID graph is available to the public, and everyone can easily distinguish the main regions and the borders by looking at the graph. You can log in to the <a href="https://explorer.brightid.org/">BrightID explorer</a> and see your own and your connections’ location in the graph. Refer to our <a href="https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/getting-verified/bitu-verification">Gitbook</a> for more information on how to get verified in&nbsp;Bitu.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/brightid/what-is-markaz-verification-level-47397372c8eb">What is Bitu Verification?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/brightid">BrightID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Second Committee Note now available</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce publication of “Event Terms List Version 1.0,” a Committee Note from the members of the OASIS Emergency Management TC [1].</p>



<p>The variety of practices employed regarding “event” types in Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) messages makes it difficult to compare messages from different sources. The problem has been presented as an interoperability issue where some consumers of CAP struggle to compare differences in language and meaning of the terms used in the &lt;event&gt; element in CAP.</p>



<p>The &lt;event&gt; element is the focus for this Committee Note, as it is the only required element in CAP directly associated with the subject event for a CAP message. Aligning practices surrounding this element, as opposed to other possible candidate elements, is the choice adopted in this work product for addressing this interoperability concern.</p>



<p>The Committee Note is available here:</p>



<p>Event Terms List Version 1.0<br>Committee Note 02<br>12 October 2021</p>

<p>With the holiday season upon us, gift-giving is on the minds of many. A perennial favorite is LEGO, beloved by generations of children and adults alike. As the world's most popular engineering and educational toy, and the world’s <a href="https://brandfinance.com/press-releases/brand-finance-global-500-2021-lego-named-worlds-7th-strongest-brand">7th strongest brand</a>, LEGO knows a thing or two about learning; to this end, in 1986, they started the LEGO Foundation to study and support child development. Now, the LEGO Foundation have teamed up with a DIF member organization, the Learning Economy Foundation, to build a gamified learning app which showcases all the key components of the decentralized identity stacks, with an emphasis on <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/#what-is-so-decentralized-about-a-did">DIDs</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/#what-is-so-decentralized-about-a-vc">VCs</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/#what-is-a-wallet">wallets</a>. Thus, the <a href="https://medium.com/@ntonani/super-skills-a-mobile-application-use-case-for-dids-and-vcs-d174467ccf46">Super Skills app</a> was born.<br></p><blockquote>The Super Skills app combines a custodial wallet (Torus) and Ceramic VC/storage tooling to give children private, exportable, future-proof achievement records – a self-sovereign educational credentialing system in miniature.</blockquote><p>With their interlocking studs, LEGO has long been a go-to analogy for explaining modular architectures and thin-layered tech stacks, particularly in the emerging tech space of <a href="https://forkast.news/understanding-nfts-digital-assets-think-lego/">NFTs</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@benjosh243/blockchain-the-technology-behind-bitcoin-explained-with-lego-cfd1cd6879c4">Blockchains</a>. The growing field of decentralized digital identity is no exception, where how thinly to slice the layers and which interfaces to standardize are the bread and butter of our <a href="https://identity.foundation/interop/">interoperability working group</a> and technical steering committee. The easy-to-grasp idea of a system of interchangeable pieces clicking effortlessly together makes intuitive the target state of standardized interfaces allowing a great architectural flexibility based on modular components. </p><p><a href="https://www.learningeconomy.io/">The Learning Economy Foundation</a>, a U.S. based non-profit with a global mission to accelerate the world toward next generation education and workplace infrastructures, created <a href="https://medium.com/@ntonani/super-skills-a-mobile-application-use-case-for-dids-and-vcs-d174467ccf46">Super Skills</a>, building on the LEGO Foundation’s core values of finding creative ways to make education sustainable, equitable, accessible and fun. A simple app where children aged 5-12 undertake playful experiences (called ‘quests’) to learn core skills, collect resources and complete seasonal narratives, while also familiarizing the next generation of digital and crypto natives with &nbsp;the vocabulary and paradigms of digital identity, by using digital wallets to store, modify, transport and present digital credentials of their achievements. <br></p>Building a future of decentralized educational credentials, brick by brick - Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@ryanquintal?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Ryan Quintal</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a><blockquote>Lego Foundation: “Together we need to make a leap in playful learning, creating a future that promotes inclusive education, lifelong learning opportunities for all children, and where holistic skills and innovation are central.</blockquote><p>The LEGO Foundation categorizes tasks into five broad skill categories, namely: creative, social, cognitive, physical and emotional. Tasks can develop multiple skills simultaneously, and there are no current plans to introduce competition between users. Successful or even partial completion of tasks is confirmed by an educator, parent or guardian. Taking a fun, interactive approach to learning maintains attention and interest. As the child trains useful skills, they are also equipping themselves with provable credentials for these skills which can then be presented or exchanged digitally at a later time.</p><a href="https://www.legofoundation.com/en/about-us/how-we-work/">Source: How We Work: The LEGO Foundation</a><p>A major priority for the Super Skills project was the protection of children and their data. The team decided on a decentralized identity approach, to ensure that none of the organizations involved would be required to host users’ data; all data ownership stays with the subject, and all data stewardship needs to be credibly portable. To achieve this, three core ‘primitives’ were identified in this approach: VCs (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a>) and DIDs (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C</a>), two standards-track W3C data models that are the foundation of most DIF work, and Digital Wallets, an community draft specification for how to portably house, sign and present credentials. Together, this architecture pioneers portability and modularity for this important data.<br></p><p>Combining these primitives with a UX simple and resilient enough for very young children using shared equipment presented additional architectural requirements. By leveraging the <a href="https://docs.tor.us/">Torus SDK</a> and the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/welcome/">Ceramic Network</a>, they can ensure that no data is saved onto a specific device, which may be a communal classroom iPad or smartphone. In this way, users' self-management of private keys, one of the core challenges of decentralized identity, is simplified with familiar <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC) interfaces and recovery mechanisms.<br></p><p>Decentralized Identifier (DID)— a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DID</a> refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DID</a>. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DIDs</a> have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities. Identity being portable and forward-compatible (i.e. "exportable") is of paramount importance when data subjects are too young to consent to long-term custody or sign their own terms of service contracts!<br></p><p>Verifiable Credential (VC) — a specification that provides a standard way to express <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#dfn-credential">credentials</a> on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable. Much like DIDs, portability is a key superpower of VCs-- and a key requirement in the education space, where data needs to be globally consumable to be of use to its subject.<br></p><p>Digital Wallet — a digital wrapper for utilizing cryptographic key material to sign, send, store, prove VCs, etc. Learning Economy Foundation is co-owner of a W3C-CCG work item to specify a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/">Universal Wallet</a>, i.e. a portable and interoperable interface to make wallets more interchangeable and “exportable.” &nbsp;The Super Skills app doesn’t just comply with the specification, but was designed to function as a working prototype of this kind of portability, pioneering a forward-commitment to portability from the outset of the project. <br></p><p>The interoperability and portability principles of DIDs and VCs mean that in the future, users should be free to choose any compatible digital wallet, and to take their data between platforms as they see fit.<br><br></p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">Source: Affinidi- What Is The Trust Triangle</a><p>Together, these primitives enable users to own and control their own data, and have it confirmed as authentic without either the verifier or the user communicating with the issuer of the credential. This is commonly known as the triangle of trust, a foundational model for decentralized identity.<br></p><p>Under the hood, this project aims to develop a native <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a> experience that leverages all of the advantages of decentralized identity technology, but to use plugins such as Torus to deliver it in a way that’s practically indistinguishable from traditional approaches in UX terms. The technical platform is also open-ended and useful beyond the Super Skills app: It has been built to allow “quest-builders” to construct their own courses, credentials, content, etc and provide ways to issue credentials that can be utilized outside the platform. The VC exchange mechanisms are intended to be an extensible open-source contribution to the credentialing community.<br></p><p>Building a future of decentralized educational credentials, brick by brick</p><p>Nathan Tonani of the Learning Economy Foundation has written a technical review of the implementation used in the Super Skills app, which you can read in detail on Medium <a href="https://medium.com/@ntonani/super-skills-a-mobile-application-use-case-for-dids-and-vcs-d174467ccf46">here</a>.<br></p>

     <p>On time for the end of 2021, as planned, Federal Council has announced on Dec 17th their <a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-86465.html">decision</a> in regards to the future direction of E-ID implementation. This decision is a result of the public consultation that has started with a publication of their discussion <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/dam/bj/en/data/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id.pdf.download.pdf/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id.pdf">paper</a> “on a traget vision for an e-ID” and culminated with a conference on October 14th.</p>
<p>DIDAS community welcomes the decision wholeheartedly and applauds the commitment to orient the implementation of the future E-ID system based on SSI principles with the focus to enable the so called “ambition level 3“, as it was called in the discussion paper.</p>
<p>In the selected implementation variant, based on SSI, a decentralised solution architecture is highlighted, which focuses on maximum protection of privacy.</p>
<p>In “ambition level 3, the aim is enable the usage of various E-ID attributes not just for eGovernment use-cases, but also in the other sectors, as a building block, in order to generate maximum added value for the population of Switzerland. This “level of ambition” clearly goes beyond the creation of the E-ID and aims to build an ecosystem of (business-domain) ecosystems in which, in addition to the E-ID, other verifiable credentials can be exchanged securely and reliably.</p>
<p>In such an implementation scenario, the E-ID plays an important role, but it is only part of the puzzle. In this blog post, we would like to provide a practical guidance, expressing consolidated, expert postion of our members, regarding the regulatory requirements that must be created for an effective and efficient implementation.</p>
<p>First, let us consider the following roles in the SSI model: “Holder“, “Issuer &amp; Verifier“, and “Decentralised Trust network“:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Holder: Central to the success of an SSI-based E-ID ecosystem is low-threshold access to suitable wallets. We assume that a market will develop a suitable solution here. For use as a carrier of the E-ID data or attributes, minimum requirements for the wallets or certification processes should likely be specified by the state.</p>
<p>Issuer &amp; Verifier: In many sectors, operational or technical standards already exist for the exchange of credentials. Some of these are based on regulatory requirements, but in many cases they are sponsored and developed by organisations coming from the relevant sector itself. These already existing structures should be reused and, if deemed necessary, adapted or expanded so that they can leverage a common trust network. This may require amendments to the regulations of individual sectors. Here, the creation of an enabling conditions for harmonisation and compatibility with the overarching LEI framework should be strongly considered, with the goal to support international interoperability. This point explicitly refers not only to the E-ID or the eGovernment sector (“ambition level” 1 or 2), but to the entire ecosystem according to the “ambition level 3”.</p>
<p>Trust network: The trust network is the common basis for the secure exchange of credentials between all the actors. This can be done on the basis of a blockchain, for example, but other possibilities are also conceivable. There is a clear need to clarify governance in terms of state supervision, as well as technical and operational standards. The development of these standards, but also the performance of operational tasks, such as the operation of nodes when implemented with a blockchain, should preferably be carried out in cooperation with organisations from the various sectors.</p>
<p>Since different sectors will contribute to this ecosystem, we would like to take a closer look at the interplay between these sectors:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here we place E-ID as an important part of the ecosystem in the “eGovernment” sector. Among other things, the issuing processes of the E-ID and the division of tasks between the Confederation and the cantons will have to be regulated there. However, aspects of international interoperability must also be adequately taken into account. Following the same logic, the necessary standards for Educational Degrees or Standards for Health Certificates will be established in their respective ecosystems or industrial sectors. The important requirement here is that all these ecosystems place their so called “trust anchors” in common the “trust network”. This will ensure the secure exchange of credentials across sector boundaries.</p>
<p>In summary, we suggest the following three main measures:</p>
 
 In terms of a “sector eGovernment”, the federal government is to define the design of the processes relating to e-ID together with the cantons. This gives residents of Switzerland the opportunity to store and use their personal E-ID as a “Verifiable Credential” in their wallet. International developments must be taken into account. Requirements for wallets, in which E-IDs can be held, must be defined. 
 In the individual sectors, the existing structures are to be leveraged . Where necessary, existing regulations should be adapted so that the use of the E-ID and operation of ecosystems for the electronic exchange of Verifiable Credentials is made possible. This should also include the creation of an enabling conditions for harmonisation and compatibility with the overarching LEI framework, in order to support international interoperability 
 For the trust network, clear framework conditions for governance as well as for the technical and operational standards must be defined. Organisations from the participating sectors are to be involved in the operational implementation of the “trust network”. This approach will strengthen the decentralisation of the “trust network”.

<p>New Consortia Relay Chain will enable parachains-as-a-service <br>via Parity’s Substrate Blockchain Framework</p><p>Zug, Switzerland/ Berlin, Germany, December 20th, 2021 — Today, Parity Technologies, a leading Web3 software development company, and Energy Web, the non-profit building operating systems for decarbonized energy grids, announced their plans to launch an Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain connecting Energy Web to the broader Substrate, Polkadot, and Kusama ecosystem. The new Chain will leverage Substrate to enable energy sector enterprises to run sovereign, customizable blockchains of their own or in partnership with other energy market participants.</p><p>Parity Technologies has long been at the forefront of Web3 technology development, most recently building the core technology that supports the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. Substrate-based blockchains provide enterprises with flexible on-chain governance functionality — a key feature for enterprises building Web3 solutions. Many companies in the Energy Web ecosystem have specific customer data privacy and legal requirements for the operation of enterprise-grade solutions. Blockchains under the new Consortia Relay Chain will allow Energy Web market participants to meet their specific governance requirements and experiment with new crypto-economic solutions. In addition, the Consortia Relay Chain will be positioned as the first multi-chain network connected to Polkadot.</p><p>The Consortia Relay Chain is the next step in a long-term partnership between the two organizations. The current Energy Web chain is based on an Ethereum Virtual Machine and Proof of Authority consensus mechanism originally developed by Parity Technologies. Launching the Consortia Relay Chain with Parity is the outcome of many years of co-development between the two organizations.</p><blockquote>“We continue to onboard major energy companies to our open-source technology stack to accelerate the energy transition,” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web Foundation. “But there is a massive amount of innovation happening in other Web3 ecosystems, such as Polkadot and Kusama, and we want to make sure this innovation comes to the energy sector. By working with Parity to bring the Consortia Relay Chain to life, we can give our members access to new innovations like on-chain governance, native interoperability, robust scalability and other features that Substrate and Polkadot enable. Innovations like these will help our community move even faster in our work to create real-world impact on the global energy transition.”</blockquote><p>Parity’s Substrate blockchain-building framework is already at the core of some of the largest and fastest growing Web3 ecosystems, including Polkadot, Kusama, and over 150 layer-1&nbsp;chains.</p><blockquote>“We see this partnership as a great opportunity to help enterprises in the energy sector get hands-on with some of the most advanced decentralized technologies in production — namely customized runtimes and flexible governance mechanisms for all kinds of blockchains, private, public, hybrid or otherwise,“ said Dr. Gavin Wood, founder of Polkadot and Kusama and co-founder of&nbsp;Ethereum</blockquote><blockquote>The new Chain will initially be governed by existing members of the Energy Web ecosystem, with the aim to further decentralize governance participants. “Substrate’s on-chain governance functionality is going to make it very easy to further decentralize governance of the Consortia Chain, once it’s off the ground. Imagine if companies and individuals actually contributing to the energy transition — by investing in solar, batteries or using electric vehicles — could be incentivized to do so and were given a specific governance role weighted by their relative contribution. Substrate plus Energy Web governance will enable us to achieve this goal,” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web Foundation.</blockquote><blockquote>The Consortia Relay Chain infrastructure will be developed as an opt-in solution with and for the current Energy Web ecosystem and require a new token. “The Energy Web Foundation was founded with the vision to create a more resilient and inclusive backbone for energy markets through decentralized software. The new Chain is a logical next step in the development of the initial vision enabling regulated energy market companies and innovators to develop their own sovereign, customized chains while staying interoperable.” said Ewald Hesse, Co-Founder and Foundation Council member of&nbsp;EWF.</blockquote><blockquote>“When you operate an Energy market in Australia, Europe, or the US, you want local parties to decide on the governance, not a party from the other part of the world. This new architecture will enable just that while leveraging the benefits of a global open-source technology stack”, said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web Foundation.</blockquote><p>To speed integration of the Energy Web stack with Substrate, Parity Technologies also intends to join as a validator of the current Energy Web Chain. A test net version of the Consortia Relay Chain and an initial set of connected blockchains are targeted for launch in Q2&nbsp;2022.</p><p>About Energy&nbsp;Web</p><p>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. Our Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) enables any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors the EW-DOS tech stack. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>About Parity</p><p>Parity Technologies is a core blockchain infrastructure company. It is creating an open-source creative commons that will enable people to create better institutions through technology. This started with work building Ethereum. Today, Parity is focused on Substrate, an industry-standard blockchain framework.

<p>By Jason Keirstead, OASIS Open board member</p> 


<p>Bravo to GitHub! Any member or advocate of global open source communities must applaud the move by GitHub to open source a lightweight community governance structure. GitHub’s <a href="https://github.blog/2021-07-22-minimum-viable-governance-lightweight-community-structure-foss-projects/">Minimum Viable Governance (MVG)</a> model for free and open source software projects (FOSS) is a valuable resource to our community, addressing a very real pain point of open source innovators who are guiding projects with great potential but need an easy-to-implement governance structure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact is, many open source projects get started with no thought to governance issues whatsoever. That can cripple a project down the road when the base of maintainers and contributors grows beyond one or two people. I personally hope MVG takes off and becomes ingrained as “le mode de vie” (i.e., the way of life) for open source projects far and wide, especially as an on-ramp for those who are just getting started.</p>



<p>The ‘Yes, And…’&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my experience, as an open source project grows, its governance landscape gets a little more challenging to maneuver. As great as MVG is, FOSS teams should consider future scenarios that might require a bit more from their governance approach than MVG is intended to deliver:&nbsp;</p>



  Patents and IP Rights. MVG suggests a few options to choose from with regard to licencing and trademarks—ideal for when an open source project is small, because at this stage, let’s be honest, pulling in a legal team can be overwhelming and stifling. Ask most developers and they’ll tell you nothing sucks the wind out of a room of innovation-driven energy faster than a well-meaning team of lawyers!  



<p>Nevertheless, if you have any inkling at all that your project is going to grow and potentially attract involvement from additional people and entities, you need to give IP protection its due. In reality, many open source licenses are based on copyright laws that don’t protect your project contributors from patent claims as strongly as you may expect. To be sure, some open source licenses, such as the Apache license, offer projects explicit patent agreements to protect consumers. But others offer implicit agreements that may turn out to be tough to defend in court, and some offer nothing at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So beware: If your project has the potential to scale, you need to lay the groundwork to protect both your contributors and consumers, especially if corporate entities are or ever will be involved.</p>



  The Path to Standardization. What will your project be when it grows up? As Stephen Covey popularized in the best-selling “7 Habits of Highly Successful People,” it’s best to “begin with the end in mind.” Having a vision of what you plan to achieve is important in framing your decision making; it’s also critical because we don’t have time machines to rectify the “if only we had …” regret. It’s impossible to go back in time and redo your work!&nbsp;  



<p>Do you think your software could one day be commercialized across a vendor ecosystem? Could it be used by organizations that operate within regulatory frameworks? Do you dream of your software project becoming an industry standard? If you have big ambitions for your project, you should strongly consider having a solid path to a de jure standards process.</p>



<p>In the case of open source projects, preparing for a standards-based path means choosing a governance approach from the outset that documents a level playing field approach and backs that up with rules-based mechanisms. Without said documentation, achieving de jure status down the road could be a large challenge. MVG’s consensus-based approach is an ideal and first choice for an open source project when just a few people are participating. However, as soon as commercial entities get involved, decision making can become heated, because organizations will inevitably have conflicting priorities and visions for how to proceed. What no one wants to see in this situation is a cage match where two factions or stakeholders enter and only one leaves. That’s where a second layer of rules-based, vendor-neutral decision making is invaluable.&nbsp;</p>



  The Bus Factor. The bus factor is a real concern with a lot of open source projects; it refers (in perhaps too blunt and morbid terms) to how many individuals involved in your project can be hit by a bus and the project would still survive. Or, what if 90% of your maintainers all work for BigCo, and BigCo decides one day to withdraw from the project or hold the project ransom? And what if some brave champion comes along that has the ability and interest to do something with the neglected project? How do they get access to not only the code, but the project name, trademarks, web domains, and other important IP?  



<p>The key issue here is project continuity. We need to make sure that valuable open source projects have the foundation they need to live beyond any one person or corporate entity. MVG doesn’t really address this issue sufficiently.</p>



<p>The point is, if you are trying to build something that lasts and has the ability to scale, you probably want a larger governance structure around it than MVG provides. That’s the value provided by open source foundations like OASIS Open, on whose board I serve. (Others with which you are likely familiar include Apache Software Foundation, Cloud Native Computing Foundation, the Eclipse Foundation, the Mozilla Foundation, and Open Infrastructure Foundation.)</p>



<p>In the case of OASIS Open, its <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/">Open Projects</a> governance model is like a hardened laptop—built to stand up to battle conditions. Going beyond the basics of MVG, the Open Projects program enables seamless collaboration with commercial interests, striking a smart balance between “the easy button” and the legal hoops required to provide protections to contributors and strong protection to the project itself. The Open Projects program also offers open source projects a governance process that is recognized by de jure international standards bodies, so if you choose to one day take your project down the path to standardization, you’ll be ready—no time machine needed.</p>



<p>If you’re launching an open source project, by all means, consider using GitHub’s MVG approach as your on-ramp. And when your project takes off, reach out to OASIS Open or another open source foundation to build something enduring, impactful and rewarding for all those who contribute.</p>

	<p>We’re pleased to announce that the Me2B Alliance has fully approved our <a href="https://me2ba.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/me2ba-operating-proceduresv1.0-20211210.pdf">Membership Operating Procedures</a>. This significant milestone for the organization defines the governance, organization, and operating rules for the Me2B Alliance Membership activities, projects, and Working Groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was the process?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Operating Procedures were subjected to&nbsp;multiple approval stages which included:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Membership Council reviewed&nbsp;the&nbsp;draft&nbsp;Operating Procedures weekly beginning&nbsp;in&nbsp;September 2021&nbsp;and&nbsp;unanimously&nbsp;voted to approve&nbsp;them&nbsp;at the end of October&nbsp;2021.<br>
 
 The draft Operating Procedures then moved on to a two-week review period by the Full Membership Community.&nbsp; 
 Following the review period,&nbsp;the Full Membership Community&nbsp;voted to approve the draft Operating Procedures.&nbsp;43% of members voted (33%&nbsp;required)&nbsp;and&nbsp;100% voted to approve&nbsp;(51%&nbsp;required).&nbsp; 
 The&nbsp;last step&nbsp;in the process was&nbsp;a review and vote by&nbsp;the Board of Directors. This final&nbsp;approval&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;on December 10, 2021.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;This rigorous process ensured a thorough examination&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Operating Procedures which are a crucial part of our membership operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
What are the Operating Procedures?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Operating Procedures are used by Me2B Alliance Members, Working Group Chairs, and Me2B Alliance Staff to provide governance for membership operations and ensure successful development of respectful tech specifications. They also define voting, our publication approval process, Working Group responsibilities, and much more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We at DIDAS are committed to establishing and promoting a viable and thriving self-sovereign identity ecosystem.</p>
<p>We are convinced that this identity-centric approach will enable a fundamental change in how social, public and business areas interact and work together in the future. This change will underpin the values ​​of our country and lead to greater data sovereignty and better data protection for each individual.</p>
<p>Our goal is to overcome complex, systematic and multifaceted challenges in the design of services and to enable more seamless digital processes &amp; experiences. With this <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SSI-Explainer-Introduction-final.pdf">presentation</a> (in German) we start the journey and want to:</p>
 
 Offer a broader audience access to functionality and developments relating to the topic of self-sovereign identity – comprehensive and interdisciplinary. 
 Give interested parties the opportunity to deal with the topic in a simple, understandable and technology-agnostic manner and to develop an understanding of the effects and potentials of digitisation. 
 Show citizens the advantages compared to other approaches so that they can follow discussions relating to digital identity (e.g. E-ID) and form an opinion. 
 Provide decision-makers with a memorable summary of the most important principles, international opinions and relevant take-aways. 
 
<p>The <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SSI-Explainer-Introduction-final.pdf">Self Sovereign Identity Explainer</a>&nbsp; (in German) is the basis for the future discussions and in-depth learning. It briefly introduces the development history of digital identity and roughly describes the different phases of identity in the Internet age.</p>
<p>In order to gain a better understanding of how a digital identity should be designed and the principles according to which it should be realized, we briefly deal with the characteristics and complexity of an identity. Derived from this understanding, we summarise the most important SSI principles (WEF, <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">Christopher Allen</a>, Sovrin <a href="https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/">principles)</a> in an easy to understand way and thus formulate our DIDAS Good Practices.</p>
<p>These good practices will help us in the future to better classify and evaluate technological developments, legal and regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Building on the preceding explanations, we reflect on the functionality of the peer-to-peer approach and show the importance of a governance framework – it is actually the interplay of “Human Trust” and “Cryptographic Trust” that enables a functioning ecosystem that is accepted by all parties. We conclude the Self Sovereign Identity Explainer with a short presentation of the benefits and show how SSI pays off for the parties involved.</p>
<p>We wish all readers a fruitful examination of the world of Self Sovereign Identity and we would be pleased if we can win you over to this exciting and promising topic.</p>

 Reaching the Next Milestone in Counteracting Sybil Attackers <p>The development of BrightID began three years ago with the goal of providing a decentralized platform for applications to ensure the uniqueness of their users and counteract the attack of bots on their applications. We believe that the only decentralized, scalable, and reliable way to detect humans from bots in the future of cyberspace is to rely on the social relations of&nbsp;humans.</p><p>From the beginning, BrightID was supposed to distinguish real users from bots and verify them by analyzing the graph formed by connections that users make with their friends and family members. However, the graph-analysis-based verification methods can only be used if there is enough data covering them. It is not possible to use such verification methods unless a graph of a significant number of users who have connected with at least a small number of friends exists. That is why BrightID had to make use of another verification method to verify its early users in the initial stage although that method was not reliable and scalable.</p><p>Joining connection parties and making connections with a trusted person who hosts the call was the initial verification method that BrightID used. In this stage, BrightID was like a newborn fed on milk. As milk is the only suitable food for a newborn to grow in the first stages of growth, the only healthy way that BrightID could grow enough was to rely on the Stars in connection parties to verify users. And just as milk is not enough for newborns to grow as they age, BrightID cannot grow by only relying on stars. And just as humans always use milk as nutritious food, using stars can always be a basic verification method in BrightID.</p><p>Today, we are proud to announce that BrightID has grown enough to start using graph-analysis-based verification methods. BrightID has more than 30,000 active users, 10,000 of whom have made 4 connections on average with the people they know in person. That is why BrightID can now start to use other verification methods. Soon BrightID will be making use of various verification methods, the first ones are Aura and&nbsp;<a href="https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/getting-verified/bitu-verification">Bitu</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/brightid/brightid-verification-story-2d0c2ab82f42">BrightID Verification Story</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/brightid">BrightID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The eKYC and Identity Assurance (eKYC &amp; IDA) working group is developing extensions to OpenID Connect that standardize the communication of assured identity information, i.e., verified claims along with trust framework and assurance level as well as information about how and when the verification was done. The core of that work has become OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance (OIDC4IDA).</p>
<p>With its first interoperability event, the working group has taken an important step on the journey towards a final specification. Interoperability of implementations is paramount and with the support of the GAIN proof-of-concept participants, where this specification is an important technical building block, several organizations have been able to test their implementations.</p>
<p>At the core of the event was the beta eKYC &amp; IDA conformance test plan developed by the OpenID Foundation. The test plan will ensure that implementations of the OIDC4IDA specification adhere to the rules described in the current implementers draft, and thereby assure technical interoperability across identity providers and relying parties.</p>
<p>In the last week of November, four early implementers of the OIDC4IDA specification (<a href="http://bankid.com">BankID Sweden</a>, <a href="https://github.com/identityfirst/eKYC-Hub">eKYC Hub Open Source Framework</a>, <a href="https://www.dizme.io/">DIZME</a>, and <a href="https://yes.com">yes.com</a>), all in the role of identity providers, came together to run the tests and to present their results in a special session of the OAuth Security Workshop 2021. All four Identity Providers ran the tests successfully, detecting only minor deviations from the standard.</p>
<p>These existing implementations will be also available in the sandbox being set up by the upcoming GAIN proof-of-concept community group for interested RPs to test with.</p>
<p>The eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance working group plans to organize another interoperability testing event, together with relying parties, in the near future.</p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2021/12/16/ekyc-identity-assurance-interop-event-update/">eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Interop Event Update</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a>.

<p>The Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation announced a <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Meaningful-Gift-Alliance-Governance-Framework.pdf">critical governing framework (PDF)</a> to assist Santa in making his toughest choices during Christmas Eve.</p>



<p>For generations, Santa used many information sources, potentially unreliable, to choose gifts.&nbsp;However, with the advent of verifiable credential standards, systems, and governance, a more trustworthy ecosystem is being built which will issue NAUGHTY and NICE verifiable credentials based upon trustworthy evidence and accountability standards for all participants.</p>



  



<p>ToIP, working closely with the Santa-led Meaningful Gift Alliance (MEGA), applied its ground-breaking Metamodel Specification to define the ecosystem whereby trustworthy NAUGHTY and NICE credentials will be made available to Santa on Christmas Eve. This effort is expected to save Santa and his elves around 3.14159 million elf-hours per Christmas event which translates into a minimum of 742,000 additional toy deliveries for the 2.2 billion children of the world. #logistics #supplychain</p>



<p>Santa is thrilled. “Those NAUGHTY and NICE lists are just too difficult to scroll through when I’m out all-night delivering presents. I get acid reflux worrying that I’ll get my lists mixed up! This new ecosystem delivers all the information I need right to my satellite smartphone with the confidence I need to sail through the night!” #UXdesign</p>



  



<p>The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Meaningful-Gift-Alliance-Governance-Framework.pdf">Governance Framework (PDF)</a> sets nuanced and contextual rules for the privacy protection of BAD and GOOD life events for children, used as input to the quantum-computer generated algorithm that issues NAUGHTY and NICE credentials. It also allows for parents, guardians, and child-advocates to petition on a child’s behalf.&nbsp; The <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/mega/glossary">Glossary of Terms</a> for uses for the MEGA <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Meaningful-Gift-Alliance-Governance-Framework.pdf">Governance Framework (PDF)</a> is supported by a Trust Over IP terms community using the Trust Over IP terms wiki tool.</p>



<p>“While we want to save Santa some stress, the main focus is ensuring every child gets a meaningful gift each gift-giving season.” says Nichola Hickman, Secretariat for the Meaningful Gift Alliance. “We consulted with many meaningful gift-givers, including representatives for Wookie Life Day, Mother Earth, the IFFF (International Federation of Fairy Godmothers &amp; Tooth Fairies) and the Free Magi-Sons. They all had experienced fraud from grown-ups claiming to be children, so we are delighted with this new method of ensuring that every child gets exactly what they deserve.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bids will be announced shortly for vendors for MEGA’s technical infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MEGA also joined the Good Elf Pass Initiative whose “interoperability blueprint” supports its crucial role as issuers of these credentials. The ground-breaking “Hypersleigh” blockchain standard will also support rapid delivery and high security for all Meaningful Gifts. #hypersleigh</p>

<p>In one paragraph, FAPI 1.0 Advanced is secure, stable, and complete Final Specification with a certification test suite while FAPI 2.0 is still in development so new features can be incorporated. FAPI 2.0 Baseline is hoped to be almost as secure as FAPI 1.0 Advanced while significantly simpler to implement. Also, FAPI 2.0 has greater scope than FAPI 1.0. We are hoping FAPI 2.0 Suite to be simpler, more elegant, more feature-rich, and more interoperable than FAPI 1.0. The catch is that FAPI 2.0 still is not formally verified, does not have a certification test suite, and is still changing. The last point can be a blessing as well. If you have a new feature request that FAPI 1.0 cannot fulfill, you should come to the FAPI working group to participate in FAPI 2.0 development.</p>
<p>While FAPI 2.0 is not a final specification, it is built from many current best practices and existing specifications. A FAPI 1.0 Advanced deployment that uses PAR &amp; PKCE is likely to be conformant with FAPI 2.0 baseline.</p>
<p>This table compares the two sets of specifications:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




FAPI 1.0
FAPI 2.0


Status
FINAL
Baseline: Implementer’s draft<p></p>
<p>Advanced: Draft</p>


Development Period
2016 – 2021
2020 –


Design principles.
Based on BCM principles[1].<p></p>
<p>All messages are integrity protected (message authentication) and all senders are strongly authenticated (client authentication) etc.</p>
Based on the explicit attacker model [2].<p></p>
<p>Message authentication requirements are relaxed so to make it simpler to implement while hopefully not exposing it to threats.</p>


Will it change?
No.<p></p>
<p>It is FINAL and set in stone.</p>
Likely.<p></p>
<p>Baseline is an Implementer’s draft and Advanced is still a working draft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


Are new features possible?
Only in extensions. FAPI 1.0 Baseline and Advanced are FINAL and cannot be changed.
Yes.<p></p>
<p>It is still in development.</p>


Formally Verified for security?
Yes for FAPI 1.0 Advanced.
No. However, as it is created with formal verification in mind, it probably will be easier to formally verify than FAPI 1.0 Advanced.


Is a certification/conformance test suite available?
Yes.
No.


Is it being used?
Advanced: Yes. UK, AU, BR Banking sectors, etc.<p></p>
<p>Baseline: No.</p>
Not yet. It is only at the first Implementer’s Draft and people are implementing it to test it out right now.


Right-sized?
No.<p></p>
<p>Baseline is probably undersized and is mostly not being used, while it is quite simple to implement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advanced is quite well adopted but may contain more features needed for many cases.</p>
Hopefully.<p></p>
<p>Baseline is incorporating some of the essential features from FAPI 1.0 Advanced. While it is enjoying the good part of the most wanted features of FAPI 1.0 Advanced, it is significantly simpler to implement.</p>


Is PAR (RFC9126) Required
No.<p></p>
<p>It is optional.</p>
Yes.<p></p>
<p>It is better for interoperability.</p>


Can it be used with the Grant Management spec?
Yes.
Yes and will be optimized since it is being developed together with it.


Can it be used with CIBA?
Yes.
Yes and will be optimized since it is being developed together with it.


“Non-repudiation” of the resource response.
Limited.
Comprehensive.


Vendor support.
Quite well supported.
Limited as of Dec, 2021.


Backward compatibility with FAPI 1.0?
–
No, although some deployments of FAPI 1.0 Advanced may be compatible with FAPI 2.0 baseline.



<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Recommendation for Deployers 
<p>In short, the FAPI working group recommends that deployments being specified at present use FAPI 1.0 Advanced, since it is Final and has been formally verified. At the same time, we also encourage people interested in FAPI 2.0 development to participate in the working group.</p>

This builds on a conversation started during IIW33. 
 Main topics covered include:
 
 What is the core connector for interoperability? 
 One profile that works across the consortias 
 How does this work with EU initiatives? Should all countries deliver a wallet that is interoperable? 
 The interoperability matrix they are working on: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R0Y4ec1KVYErkcEgC3Qww7VR4CsCY2Lv2Bt-gfryEdw/edit#gid=1316375328">here</a>

 10th Dec - ESSIF-LAB Consent Record Demo - <a href="https://youtu.be/Mq4oXEaOTwg">YouTube recording</a>
 
 Data Agreement demos  from NGI ESSIF-LAB sub-grantees iGrant.io, Gataca and the Human Colossus Foundation. These three demo'd implementations demonstrate how a consent notice (or "data agreement" as it was called in the ESSIF-LAB context) gets signed as a shared record between issuers/verifiers (data controllers) and holders (data subjects). The data agreement sets a clear purpose of usage, what personal data is collected, how long data can be retained and on what lawful basis it can be processed; both parties keep a record, allowing precise GDPR enforcement and transparency on all sides.
 
 The data agreement was originally based on the Kantara Initiative's Consent Notice, which is now being standardized as a new <a href="https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27560.html">ISO standard 27560</a>.

 Call to Participate - DIDComm User Group
 
 Now that the DIDComm v2 spec is nearing completion, and there are robust libraries in multiple programming languages, we are starting a user group to share learnings as we put DIDComm into production. We will organize community resources, produce a handbook, foster application-level protocol creation, maintain the didcomm.org website and repo, and recommend best practices. We invite anyone who's interested to register in the user group's <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/didcomm-usergroup">email list here</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/F4Qw7h6Sr9">Discord channel here</a>. 
 
 
 The first regular meeting will be held on January 10th-14th, with meeting selection to happen prior on the above communication methods. 
 Although this UG is sponsored by DIF, this is not an IP-protected context. We won't be developing specs or working on standards. Thus, you don't have to be a member of any particular org to join, and there are no legal terms to review or paperwork to sign. Please join us!

 Status update for <code>did:keri</code>, and plans to add it as a work item to the ID WG.

 <a href="https://identity.foundation/keri/did_methods/">Current did:keri method specification</a> 
 Current status of did:keri
 
 The goal is to continue and further expand the work on the DID method specification, to figure out how all the KERI building blocks can be utilized together in a method spec. 
 Does did:keri by itself make sense, or only "KERI in the context of an existing DID method" (e.g. did:indy:keri)? 
 The work in the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">KERI WG</a> is in a special state. The goal is to "wrap up" that current status of KERI so that the KERI spec work goes into a "sleep" state. There are two communities, one working in the Trust-over-IP Foundation (ToIP), one working at DIF. 
 The proposal is to contribute the KERI work itself to the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/crypto-wg/">Applied Cryptography Working Group</a>, and the did:keri work to the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/">Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a>.

 3 design options:
 
 1. No awareness - most flexible for higher layers 
 2. Current approach - prefix with bit array to match order to underlying order (doesn't allow for canonicalization algos or higher-level users which need to reorder, i.e. LDP URDNA) 
 3. Append a more elaborate structure - byte array of indices referring to the message order in underlying dataset

 Hyperledger Aries 
 
 To anyone in the Aries Community that either builds Frameworks or deploys Aries solutions:
 
 Many of  in the Aries community want to transition from using the "early days" <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0160-connection-protocol/README.md">RFC 0160 Connections protocol</a> (part of AIP 1.0) to the newer <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0023-did-exchange/README.md">RFC 0023 DID Exchange</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0434-outofband/README.md">RFC 0434 Out of Band</a> protocols.  A "community upgrade" has been proposed that will accomplish that in a way that we can avoid periods of instability between Aries agents (Issuers, Verifiers, Wallets, etc.) if we coordinate a series of changes in our deployments. 
 A PR has been proposed to RFC 0496 (Transition to OOB and DID Exchange)  and is expected to be accepted that will move us to Stage 1 of the transition, where all implementations are to be updated to accept requests using both the older Connections and newer DID Exchange protocols. During that period, all deployments will continue ONLY to send requests using the older Connections protocol. Please see RFC 0496 for the details of the entire transition. 
 
 
 The Aries Working Group is requesting that all deployments of Aries:
 
 Support this transition 
 Update their code bases and deployments to achieve Step 1 of the transition. 
 Document their completion of that Step in the RFC (per instructions). 
 Monitor the conversation around RFC 0496 to be ready to go to Step 2 of the transition. 
 
 
 Please direct any questions to the Aries channel in <a href="https://chat.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger RocketChat</a>.

	 <a></a>1 ABSTRACT 
<p>TLDR: Common technical frameworks and app templates used by hundreds of organizations, when combined with technical weaknesses built into devices and operating systems from Google and Apple, are leading to unregulated and out of control student and parent data sharing to unexpected online advertising companies.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://me2ba.org/school-mobile-apps-student-data-sharing-behavior/">Spotlight Report #1 report</a> from May 2021, the Me2B Alliance Product Testing team audited and analyzed a random sample of 73 mobile applications on Android and iOS used by 38 schools in 14 states across the U.S. — apps used at least a half a million people (students, their families, educators, etc.).</p>
<p>The audit methodology in Spotlight Report #1 primarily consisted of evaluating the 3rd party code packages (also known as software development toolkits or “SDKs”) included in each app, using an external database with historical data on SDKs in apps, combined with a Me2BA risk scoring process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After publishing Spotlight Report #1, we were contacted by the Student Data Privacy Project to examine apps used by 18 schools/districts for their <a href="https://www.thesentinel.com/communities/parents-nationwide-file-complaints-with-u-s-dept-of-education-seek-to-address-massive-student/article_3133b6ce-e30e-11eb-9a6f-4b21a35875b0.html">FERPA Complaint with the Department of Education</a>. Our data supply testers noticed significant network traffic, well beyond the SDK channels, as well as certain legacy development tactics that relied upon in-app browsers opening websites within the apps. The hypothesis was that many of the school utility apps were using in-app WebView methods to display content, and this was, indeed, the culprit. The WebView development technique allows external websites to open within an app, without launching a separate browser (see Appendix A for an example, and guidance on how to spot this technique). This process results in all of the vendors integrated into a website receiving user data in the context of the app that opened that webpage within their in-app browser. For school utility apps, this so-called “context” typically includes the name of their school, or school district. We took a closer look at the network traffic to confirm the assumption and to determine the scope and scale of this data sharing.</p>
<p>Within the domains in the sample, we noticed significant amounts of network traffic associated with school sports pages and discovered a vendor providing sports scores for K-12 schools across the U.S. and monetizing their “free service” with extremely aggressive advertising monetization schemes, baked right into these taxpayers funded school utility apps.</p>
<p>The company providing this “free service for sports coaches” monetized with online advertising is MaxPreps.com, a subsidiary of CBS/Viacom, who are also the owners of the popular kids’ television channel, Nickelodeon.</p>
<p>We did not expect that our deep dive into WebView in-app browsers within K-12 school utility apps would end up requiring us to focus significant time researching a data supply chain owned by one of the largest media companies in the U.S., but we followed the data pipelines and the facts. As noted in Spotlight Report #1, in April 2021, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/technology/advertising-children-privacy.html">Disney, CBS/Viacom and about a dozen other companies</a> were parties to the largest settlement against brokers of kids’ data in U.S. history. CBS and other parties were required to make changes to some of their products and delete certain data. Yet MaxPreps seems to have never come up in that lawsuit, it’s never come up in any significant public reporting or research, and any changes to other CBS products as a result of the settlement do not appear to have not made their way to MaxPreps products. While MaxPreps was never mentioned in the California settlement and the details seemingly would not have required CBS/Viacom to make changes to their subsidiary MaxPreps, it’s clear that the behavior that the settlement pointed out, which CBS/Viacom agreed to stop, is similar if not worse within this subsidiary that offers free products for schools.</p>
<p>Our research took another unexpected turn in the course of the deep dive into MaxPreps, when we came across a handful of “<a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/dangling-domains/">dangling domains</a>.” We wrote about one such dangling domain in particular <a href="https://me2ba.org/dangling-domain-from-sdk-installed-in-150-apple-apps-putting-kids-families-and-crypto-traders-at-risk/">that Apple quietly purchased for $3,695</a> in late September 2021. The domain for sale was previously owned by a company that went bankrupt and the domain was integrated into a legacy SDK product across 159 mobile apps, with 155 of them being on Apple’s iOS marketplace, with a potential install base of tens of millions of devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the dangling domains, we also observed several hijacked domains leading to malicious sites. In at least one instance, we observed in dismay when a dangling domain was purchased by an unknown actor over the course of a few days. The following apps/domains fell prey to hijackers before we could intervene:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Santa Monica-Malibu USD Android App from Blackboard Inc. had a dangling domain of “Malibuhigh.org” – this domain still to this day hosts a fake legal website, and there could still be risks from Business Email Compromise schemes or other ways to abuse the fact that this was a real domain used by a school district in one of the wealthiest counties in the United States. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:smmusd.org">Here is a Google search result</a> showing files where this legacy domain was referenced as being valid – other government agencies communicated with this domain at different points in the past. 
 Maryland’s largest school district’s Android App, also from Blackboard Inc., already lost their sports domain by the time we figured it out, with Magruderathletics (WARNING).org being compromised and still hosting malicious redirects to this very day. After the Me2B Alliance alerted Blackboard Inc., they were able to quickly remove this domain from their active mobile app, reducing some of the risks. This is also an active domain, and <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/business-email-compromise">Business Email Compromise</a> risks for emails that originate from this domain (i.e. “@Magxxxxathletics.org”) remain a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-stole-650-000-from-nonprofit-and-got-away-showing-limits-to-law-enforcements-reach-11623058201">real threat</a>. 
 The Quinlan, Texas School District had a domain that went up for sale for $30 that was integrated into their Android app, which was purchased before anyone could take action. After the Me2B Alliance alerted Blackboard Inc., the dangling domain link was removed from the app, and subsequently the Android app was pulled down from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackboard.community.quinlanisd">the Google Play Store</a> 
 
<p>The research we are releasing today focuses on an intensive evaluation of 11 school utility apps (from an original pool of 18 apps) made by companies who support thousands of other schools with similar app frameworks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, the use of WebView in school utility apps, and the operational challenges to maintain them, creates a significant channel for data sharing and also introduces serious security risks. If people using these mobile apps “can’t choose their own browser” they can’t make informed choices that empower them to block and stop some of these data transfers, which can be downright dangerous when an app for kids integrates dangling domains into WebView interfaces. If Google and Apple merely made a few changes to empower users over developers, these risks for schools, kids, parents, and administrators would nearly completely disappear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These risks have been compounded by certain companies providing “free software for schools” that purposefully monetizes these free tools for apps and websites via data sharing and online advertising, with the new Me2B Alliance research focusing on the CBS/Viacom subsidiary called MaxPreps.com. Another way to think about this research is that we’ve attempted to point out a technical framework that numerous school utility apps are using, which utilizes a type of “Content Management System” (CMS) that allows school administrators to “add links” into an app, without actually submitting a new version of that app into the app store – and the links being added into the apps are merely web URLs, with the web content rendering within the app’s in-app browser. These websites rendering in the apps contain advertising pixels/javascript code, which then collect data within the apps when opened by users, and are sharing the access and user data with new companies – hundreds of them, sometimes more. Rarely do app privacy labels account for these data transfers, and neither the app makers, the schools, or the vendors collecting data within those apps and WebView URLs are currently taking accountability for making these kids user data flows safer. We’re surprised and alarmed by this “advertising for kids” architecture happening within school utility apps paid for by taxpayers, with some companies seemingly earning sizable revenues from these data pipelines. As a result, serious questions need to be asked of all the organizations participating in these schemes.</p>
<p>This report includes guidance on how to identify a school utility app with potentially unsafe WebView links in Appendix A, which we hope provides investigative journalists, data auditors, school administrators, parents, students, app developers, and everyone-in-between with a way to recognize when an app is opening web links.&nbsp;</p>

 <a></a>2 INTRODUCTION 
<p>After publishing our research across 73 school utility apps for Spotlight Report #1, we were contacted by the Student Data Privacy Project to examine apps used by 18 schools/districts for their <a href="https://www.thesentinel.com/communities/parents-nationwide-file-complaints-with-u-s-dept-of-education-seek-to-address-massive-student/article_3133b6ce-e30e-11eb-9a6f-4b21a35875b0.html">FERPA Complaint with the Department of Education</a>. Our data supply testers noticed that data was being sent to third parties beyond just the SDK channels for data sharing. Based on the visual layouts of the apps and our awareness that in-app browsers can create unexpected and unique risks, our hypothesis was that in-app browsing using WebView methods was the core culprit for these advertising companies showing up in our network logs. A simple way to think about these data sharing methods are “websites opening within apps.” Thus, we decided to take a closer look at the network traffic in a handful of apps from the FERPA research schools to validate the assumption and learn more about vendors operating in this space within school utility apps.</p>
<p>This research involved a smaller and deeper analysis, focused specifically on the data supply vendors within school utility apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we found not only validated the hypothesis that school utility apps use WebView in-app browsers extensively to serve content — indeed enabling more data sharing with third parties in unexpected ways –but we also discovered three other disturbing findings:</p>
 
 A website for school sports called Maxpreps.com, used by a large number of schools in the US, shares student data with an untold number of advertising companies. MaxPreps is owned by Viacom/CBS, a public company, named in <a>a landmark settlement</a>. The settlement required Viacom to remove cross-site identifiers related to a children’s app called “Llama Spit Spit” along with several other niche-requirements to comply with laws focused on kids’ data sharing. 
 We found several instances of hijacked domains previously owned by schools, leading directly to “parked domains” filled with online advertising.&nbsp; 
 We documented malicious pop-ups within school utility apps due to advertising data supply chain attacks by malicious advertisers promising “free gift cards.”&nbsp; 
 In addition to hijacked domains, we found several dangling domains, including the one mentioned in our <a href="https://me2ba.org/dangling-domain-from-sdk-installed-in-150-apple-apps-putting-kids-families-and-crypto-traders-at-risk/">blog</a> post from earlier this year.&nbsp; 
 
<p>During the auditing process, our team determined that the majority of school apps analyzed were built using app templates created and licensed by companies who provide app platforms (including the CMS-like backend administrative dashboard) to hundreds if not thousands of schools, and other types of community/religious organizations. In short, the apps were built with a common technical framework, and this practice is widespread, yet neither Apple nor Google seem to account for this behavior with specific in-app browser-default controls – letting users override the use of an in-app browser — a device feature, which would protect end-users from risks created by this legacy development practice.</p>
<p>Common technical frameworks – licensed app templates plus the CMS-like administrative portal – used across many organizations are leading to unregulated and out of control student and parent data sharing to unexpected online advertising and big tech vendors.</p>
<p>In order for many school apps to stay updated with relevant news, events and other details for students and parents, it is a common tactic for developers to integrate web pages directly into the apps, also known as a “WebView”<a>1</a> or an “in-app browser.” This technique allows the school to create menus of several links (URLs/domains) within the school apps that will open an in-app browser to view a related webpage with particular details about the school or program. The schools keep the details updated by maintaining the web pages that host the content or by relying on third party websites to keep content updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a method that allows the school to include dynamic, fresh information in mobile apps without having to update the app itself, and it’s particularly common for school calendars, lunch menus, and details about extracurricular activities and school events. The school’s app administrators update websites, and the apps “auto-update” with the new content from the pages. This is a helpful process to allow more people to provide content updates for apps, but it becomes problematic when those websites share data with unique advertising and analytics vendors. It becomes an emergency (as found during this research) when a school loses control over one of the domains integrated into their school apps, and an even bigger problem when that domain is controlled by spammers and scammers.</p>
<p>This problem would be mitigated if people could designate a default (and privacy respecting) browser to be the default browser used for in-app WebViews, and if Apple and Google didn’t make it possible for developers to override a user’s browser preference.</p>
 <a></a>2.1 What is WebView? 
<p>All mobile apps with an “in-app browser” are using “Webview” code/APIs, and the rules and protections for these in-app browsers are slightly unique between Apple iOS and Android platforms. Other devices / IOT use similar technical concepts, but Apple and Android have the most apps using this legacy practice as they have the oldest app marketplaces.</p>
<p>WebView is a low-level set of functions (APIs) provided by an operating system within a mobile device that allows native apps to present web pages, woven seamlessly into the application without having to open or close a separate browser. WebView allows native apps to selectively become a browser while keeping the user in the app.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2076732.2076781">2011 paper on WebView attacks&nbsp;against Android devices</a> explains this legacy development and data supply chain strategy:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“WebView is an essential component in both Android and iOS platforms, enabling smartphone and tablet apps to embed a simple but powerful browser inside them. To achieve a better interaction between apps and their embedded “browsers”, WebView provides a number of APIs, allowing code in apps to invoke and be invoked by the JavaScript code within the web pages, intercept their events, and modify those events. Using these features, apps can become customized “browsers” for their intended web applications.”<a>2</a></p>
<p>WebView in iOS relies on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit">WebKit</a>, an open-source browser “engine” first introduced 23 years ago in 1998, which later evolved into the Safari engine used by Apple around 2013. The WebView APIs are therefore limited by WebKit capabilities supported in the OS. iOS WebView is restricted and protected by iOS WebKit (built on Safari) limitations, and Android WebView is restricted and protected by a slightly similar concept with Chromium limitations. However, they both ultimately support in-app browsing as a seamless user experience without giving users full control over their own data sharing preferences within these in-app browsers.</p>
 <a></a>2.1.1 Apps That Open a Separate Browser 
<p>In contrast to the use of WebView, some apps will open external webpages by opening a separate browser. In this case, it’s obvious to the user of the app that they are no longer in the app and that they have been redirected to an external website in their default browser of choice. When the app opens a separate browser, it will use the user-specified default browser (privacy settings intact) thus allowing the user more control and security. This is the case on both Apple iOS and Android, although on both platforms app developers “get to choose” and can override user choices by loading an in-app browser instead of letting the user choose.</p>
<p>On Android, there have been some preference shifts that over the past few years that make it slightly easier to default an in-app browser, but these options are largely hidden and don’t seem to prevent app developers from deploying WebView content into apps.</p>
 <a></a>2.1.2 WebView in iOS 
<p>In iOS, original capabilities were provided through UIWebView and WebView.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year however,&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=edwud51q">Apple started a process to deprecate some of the oldest aspects of App WebViews</a>, but the full deprecation deadline was paused seemingly due to Covid-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10188/">also has a 30 minute video and support documentation</a>&nbsp;explaining how developers can update their apps from this legacy WebView coding practice into their more modern “WKWebView” practices, but it appears that no time table to depreciate this has been reset.</p>
<p>On iOS, WebView APIs are restricted by certain rules written into Safari’s Webkit browser, which has some tracking protections that are stronger than Android’s default Chromium browser frameworks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, Safari’s WebView browsers don’t have the ability to send&nbsp;<a title="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/" href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">a “Global Privacy Control” (GPC) signal</a>&nbsp;to send signals to opt-out of data selling and sharing, even though this standard has made its way into both&nbsp;<a title="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-firefox-joins-browsers-implementing-global-privacy-control/" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-firefox-joins-browsers-implementing-global-privacy-control/">the Mozilla Firefox browser and the Brave browser</a>. If Safari’s WebView browsers supported the GPC, a “do not sell or share my data” signal would be sent to third party websites, which would express the preference of these users to opt-out of all data sharing and selling schemes they can legally opt-out of, which would help to keep users of all ages safer. A business can still “ignore” this GPC signal, but ignoring a preference creates unique exposure compared to no preferences being sent from a user via automated signals.</p>
 <a></a>2.1.3 WebView in Android 
<p>For Android developers,&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/webview">Google’s flagship opensource mobile operating system still heavily relies on WebView pages</a>&nbsp;in apps, and to make matters worse,&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/webview%22%20%5Cl%20%22UsingJavaScript">Google has detailed documentation about how to use JavaScript to increase the amount of user data being collected</a>&nbsp;via in-app WebView pages.</p>
<p>Google’s Android provides the ability for a user to set their default in-app browser, but app developers can still seemingly override this behavior and user choice.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>2.1.4 User Control of WebView-Launched Browser 
<p>Originally, users on both iOS and Android had no ability to specify the browser used by WebView, nor did they have access to any controls or settings for these in-app browsers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For iPhone users, there’s no ability to set a default browser to be used by mobile apps that open in-app web pages. Such an ability would ensure that any links open in a preferred, consistent environment, expressing data blocking preferences and automated signals of consent/opt-outs.&nbsp;While Safari’s WebView implementation could be argued is “safer, with less external data sharing” than the Android Chromium WebView implementation, partially due to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212614">Apple’s new iCloud Private Relay</a> which protects network data sent within mobile apps. Yet Apple’s Safari still doesn’t have a way for users to transmit automated opt-out preferences via the Global Privacy Control or any other respected automated signals, even though this automated option is required under new California data privacy laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike on Apple, for newer Android devices/users, there is an option to set a new default browser to open all in-app webpage links, though this feature is not heavily promoted. Moreover, Android apps appear to be able to override or ignore a user’s preference when opening an in-app&nbsp;WebView&nbsp;page, as observed&nbsp;during&nbsp;our research.</p>
<p>It appears Android has gone further than iOS to give users control of WebView in-app browsers, but it doesn’t appear that either platform gives full control to avoid these privacy pitfalls.</p>
 <a></a>2.2 How Pervasive is WebView? 
<p>It’s difficult to estimate what percentage of apps use WebView, but according to a WebView research paper from 2011 research:</p>
<p>“Currently, in the Android market, 86 percent of the top 20 most downloaded apps in 10 diverse categories use WebView.” 6</p>
<p>The use of WebView, however, is a very slowly fading coding practice, but there are a massive portion of legacy apps still using it. Even some new apps deploy in-app browsers due to the additional user data collection benefits they offer app makers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see the use of WebView in older apps that display web-based information, and for apps that conduct sophisticated user data profiling and advertising schemes —which is why Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and many other enterprise apps for large web services employed WebView.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the use of WebView is popular in utility apps built from generalized templates, a business strategy that enables profitable distribution of custom apps to a wide customer base. Virtually every legacy school utility app is precisely this kind of app, where it’s rare to not see an in-app browser being used in some way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order for many school apps to stay updated, with relevant news, events and other details for students and parents, it is a common tactic for developers to integrate web pages directly into the apps – basically creating menus/links within the school apps that will open an in-app browser to view a webpage with custom information about the school — and the schools keep the details updated by maintaining the web pages that host the content.</p>
<p>In research released earlier this year, the Me2BA team found that the school apps in the research sample hadn’t been updated in 11.6 months on average. This statistic may have been slightly confusing for some parents due to the fact that the content seen in these schools’ apps was updated at a much higher frequency. This is due to these apps being built primarily with in-app WebView links, where the apps are mostly just opening website links.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way to explain it: the “app administrators” are actually updating websites, and the apps auto-update with the new content from the pages. This is a helpful process to allow more school personnel to provide content updates for apps, but there are risks involved for end-users because they can’t choose their own browser with consistent data sharing / opt-out preferences.</p>
<p>For reference, <a href="https://www.cpsb.org/cms/lib/LA01907308/Centricity/Domain/81/Blackboard%20Add%20Web%20Link.pdf">this publicly available tutorial</a> on Blackboard’s CMS admin panel provides clear instructions for school administrators on how to add URLs to their app. The tutorial also highlights a feature that makes it possible for school administrators of Blackboard school utility apps to open web links within the app or the user’s default browser (See Figure 1) – and by letting an admin turn off safety features with the toggle of a button, Blackboard has made all of the students, parents, teachers and administrators using their apps less safe.</p>

 <a></a>2.3 How Does WebView Enable Data Sharing? 
<p>In our previous research, we examined third-party data sharing through the use of SDKs (Software Development Kits). Another way data can be shared with third parties is when an app uses WebView to access third-party websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>User data is shared on a website opened via in-app browsers in exactly the same way it happens in a browser, but with fewer controls for end-users. Vendors integrated into these websites can collect network/IP address data, cookies, other local storage / mobile ID fields, and they can reshare this information to new vendors through the same developer tactics used on websites.</p>
<p>Many advanced mobile users have turned to ad blocker apps in order to try and minimize data flows within in-app browsers, but the vast majority of these ad blocker apps rely on “domain / request lists” in order to filter the extra sharing, which is a process that isn’t perfect and can’t protect against the most aggressive data collection efforts from unscrupulous vendors. The only way to truly stop this data sharing is at the device-level, with the support of the device operating system manufacturers.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>2.4 What Information Gets Shared Using WebView? 
<p>For both iPhone and Android users, by default, the network data (IP address) is sent to most of the website vendors who collect data on any web pages that are triggered from in-app browsers. Including network data, these in-app web browsers can share cookies, fingerprint data and other local storage fields that are used to track users persistently over time.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, Apple began to test and roll out their new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212614">iCloud Private Relay</a>, which obfuscates network data and should eventually protect against some types of tracking within WebView in-app browsers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, just like with SDKs, any and all personal information available to the app can be shared with third parties.</p>
 <a></a>2.5 Security Risks of Using WebView 
<p>There are several risks associated with using WebView in particular and using in-app browsers in general. We list only a couple here.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>2.5.1 Dangling Domains 
<p>It is frequently the case that links (domains) included in mobile apps very simply expire and become available for purchase in the open market. We call these “Dangling Domains”—domains that are actively being linked to in mobile apps, but no longer have a viable service provider associated with them. We found two flavors of this happening, and there are undoubtedly more:</p>
 
 Schools simply allow domains to expire, possibly due to personnel turnover, or simply due to credit card expiration. 
 The service provider using the domain goes out of business. See our recent <a href="https://me2ba.org/dangling-domain-from-sdk-installed-in-150-apple-apps-putting-kids-families-and-crypto-traders-at-risk/">blog</a> on this affecting over 150 iOS apps and potentially scores of millions of devices. 
 
 <a></a>2.5.2 Hijacked Domains 
<p>Dangling domains become problematic when those websites share data with unique advertising and analytics vendors, and it becomes an emergency (which we observed&nbsp;during&nbsp;this research) when a school loses control over one of these domains integrated into their school apps. It becomes an even bigger problem when that domain is “hijacked”, controlled by spammers and scammers as our research detailed below.&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Santa Monica-Malibu USD Android App from Blackboard Inc. had a dangling domain of “Malibuhigh.org” – this domain currently hosts a fake legal website, and there could still be risks from Business Email Compromise schemes or other ways to abuse the fact that this was a real domain used by a school district in one of the wealthiest counties in the United States. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:smmusd.org">Here is a Google search result</a> showing files where this legacy domain was referenced as being valid.&nbsp; 
 Maryland’s largest school district’s Android App, also from Blackboard Inc., already lost their sports domain by the time we figured it out, with Magruderathletics (WARNING).org being compromised and still hosting malicious redirects to this very day. After the Me2B Alliance alerted, Blackboard Inc., they were able to quickly remove this domain from their active mobile app, reducing some of the risks. This is also an active domain, and <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/business-email-compromise%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/business-email-compromise">Business Email Compromise</a> risks for emails that originate from this domain (i.e. “@Magxxxxathletics.org” remain a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-stole-650-000-from-nonprofit-and-got-away-showing-limits-to-law-enforcements-reach-11623058201%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-stole-650-000-from-nonprofit-and-got-away-showing-limits-to-law-enforcements-reach-11623058201">real threat</a>. 
 The Quinlan, Texas School District had a domain that went up for sale for $30 that was integrated into their Android app, which was purchased before anyone could take action. After the Me2B Alliance alerted Blackboard Inc., the dangling domain link was removed from the app, and subsequently the Android app was pulled down from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackboard.community.quinlanisd">the Google Play Store</a>.&nbsp; 
 
 <a></a>3 METHODOLOGY 
 <a></a>3.1 Sample Selection 
<p>As with Spotlight Report #1, this research examined school utility apps, which are apps used for communication and sharing between students, parents, and school personnel. We used the list of 18 schools/districts that we investigated for <a href="https://www.thesentinel.com/communities/parents-nationwide-file-complaints-with-u-s-dept-of-education-seek-to-address-massive-student/article_3133b6ce-e30e-11eb-9a6f-4b21a35875b0.html">the Student Data Privacy’s FERPA Complaint with the Department of Education</a>, where we explored the SDKs used in the apps (similar to Spotlight Report #1). Seven of the schools required accounts/logins in order to use the apps, which we were unable to obtain. Thus, we were able to examine some of the apps more deeply than others.</p>
 <a></a>3.2 Data Collection 
<p>For this research, the data collection consists of two steps:</p>
 
 Determining which apps include WebView, and 
 Assembling a list of domains linked to by each app that uses WebView. 
 
<p>During the analysis portion of our research, our team realized that the vast majority of unique advertising requests were initiated within the apps through MaxPreps.com webpages integrated into the “Sports” tabs of the school utility apps. Thus, the testing focused on opening Sports tabs in the apps, in particular.</p>
<p>There are a few common methods to definitively detect WebView use in a mobile app. Please refer to Appendix A for tips on how you can determine if your app is launching an in-app browser.&nbsp;</p>
 
 For more advanced developers or heavy app users, the visual rendering of content within a WebView in-app browser will be noticeable because it loads more like a website (sometimes in stages, sometimes with long load times for large pages), compared to a mobile app where the content has sometimes already been downloaded with the app and the content appears instantaneously. This method can be used as an early indicator prior to more sophisticated network capture tests. 
 One method that works for Android apps and open-source apps (iOS app packages are encrypted and analyzing any source code is uniquely challenging compared to Android) entails analyzing the app source code to see if it is using WebView APIs. There are multiple ways to perform this analysis, one example <a href="https://web.ecs.syr.edu/~wedu/Research/paper/webview_acsac2011.pdf">here</a>. Typically, this method involves examining the app source code for inclusion of the WebView class in the app, although this method should be double checked against the “live app experience” (actually download/use the app on a sandboxed device) because subtle app code and platform changes can trigger these legacy code samples now opening links in the user’s default browser and not within in-app browsers. 
 Another method is to use a software tool to capture and log the network traffic via a proxy/Monster in the Middle (MiTM) connection, using a tool such as <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles Proxy</a> helps to analyze network traffic from the app to third party sites and makes it possible to parse the vendor request and response headers and body payloads for unique ingestions or sharing of user data. 
 
<p>For this research, we utilized the last method to log and capture the network traffic, which we believe is more accurate as it captures the fine-grained details of the user data ingestions and sharing between the app and 3rd party vendors.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>3.3 Data Collection Strategy 
<p>Our testers captured network traffic while using 36 apps representing 18 schools/districts. We conducted manual client-side testing which included navigating around the app, attempting to click all potential links within app menus, and exercising multiple functions in the app in order to find latent URLs triggered by deeper use of the app. Charles Proxy recorded all the domains connected to during the testing. See Appendix H for a sample list of 189 de-duped domains on the “Sports” tab powered by MaxPreps.com within just two Blackboard apps.</p>
<p>When we became aware of the high network activity on the sports pages in apps, we deliberately more deeply probed those pages, which we knew generated sizable ad related traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inherent limitations in this manual testing method are:</p>
 
 It’s not identical from app to app. Our purpose was to “click all the links” so our testers could attempt this until they were satisfied, yet this process does create unique results per app, and the order of clicking links is unique per test. This mostly impacts the analysis, and has minimal impact on whether advertising is shown or specific vendor selections within any one advertising supply chain. 
 The testing didn’t systematically execute every single possible path in the app user experience (UX). We may have missed other harmful links, so don’t hesitate to let us know if you are familiar with any problematic kids’ data brokers. 
 Since external links branch off into numerous (potentially countless) other external sites, the testing didn’t examine every externally linked branch of every possible path in the app UX, down to its terminus. The numbers presented later in the findings section are illustrative only. The reality is that if we’d tested longer, the number of external advertising data transfers would continually rise. 
 The findings represent a single snapshot in time and would likely be different in quality if they were rerun today. 
 
<p>Automated testing could have removed the first limitation above but wasn’t an option as automated testing would have prevented or impacted many of the ad syncs altogether, in addition to a number of other limitations. Automated testing would also have created other challenges and prevented our ability to detect key findings such as:</p>
 
 Many schools have significant problems with their sports feature built via MaxPreps. 
 Dangling domains are displayed to end-users in visually inconsistent ways, we would have likely missed one of the dangling domains being briefly available for sale for $30.

 <a></a>3.4 Analysis 
<p>We conducted an analysis of the unique domains invoked by all the apps during the data collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should be noted that once we realized the “Sports” tabs were full of online banner ads, and syncing unique vendors with every page load, several of the test sessions of these apps and data flows from the MaxPreps sports pages, were merely “refreshing the sports tab” for 5-10 minutes to capture a sample of the advertising vendors who received data within the app. We were not focused on capturing the brands buying ads within MaxPreps, but our screenshots below include major brands like Best Buy, Amazon, Cisco and Bertolli.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note, however, that this was mainly an exercise in curiosity to provide a rough order of magnitude of the kinds of links being invoked. It should only be regarded as informational and not normative or prescriptive. If the tests had gone on longer, we would expect to find new advertising vendors, and our research into the data supply chains across MaxPreps content should be considered a “snapshot.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>And important part of our analysis entails desktop traffic capture using the tool <a href="https://www.crownpeak.com/products/tag-monitoring-and-management">Trackermap from Evidon</a>. Figure 2, below is an example of the “network traffic” captured from one of the MaxPreps school pages. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2 MaxPreps Network Traffic Map</p>
<p>This network traffic map merely demonstrates some of the controller, processor, and co-controller flows of user data across one page load and outside the context of the school utility mobile apps. Within the school utility apps, if a user refreshed the sports pages, numerous more vendors were being captured through the advertising syncs, which we captured in our live tests with real mobile devices.</p>
<p>When auditing any page or app with active advertising supply chains, it’s important to remember that there are tens of thousands of advertising companies globally, and it’s common for unique advertising vendors to receive data before an ad is shown, and then more unique vendors to receive data after an ad is shown. The advertising bidstream is also a constant flow of user data, and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k78ewv/bidstream-data-google-twitter-att-verizon-foreign">a whole separate can of worms</a>. These advertising data flows create a significant sprawl of user data, and depending on where a test is being conducted, unique regional advertising companies are likely to receive data for any one specific advertising supply chain test. Due to these realities, the significant list of advertising companies who received user data from the MaxPreps advertising flows, within school utility apps, should be considered a baseline of data sharing with significantly more data sharing occurring for other users, in other locations, and at other times of the year. In short, what we found was very bad, but the reality is significantly worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the advertising vendors we were able to capture with this process, we distilled all the unique domains invoked by the apps, identified the business owner of the URL, and assigned a risk rating similar to our SDK risk rating in Spotlight Report #1. Table 3 describes the risk ratings for the unique domains. Note that “Malicious” maps to detected malicious redirects. (See <a href="https://product.voxmedia.com/2018/1/22/16902862/why-ads-redirect-to-giftcards-and-what-were-doing-to-secure-them">this</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/technology/personaltech/battling-adware-that-redirects-your-browser.html">this</a> for more information on malicious redirects.)</p>

 <a></a>4 FINDINGS 
 <a></a>4.1 MaxPreps&nbsp; 
<p>Through our examination of the domains called by the school utility apps, we noticed one standout was present in every school utility app provided by Blackboard, Inc., which was MaxPreps.com. Maxpreps.com is a <a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/utility/aboutus.aspx">school sports scores and analysis platform owned by CBS Viacom</a>, who are also the public media company who own the children’s television channel Nickelodeon.</p>
<p>MaxPreps is ostensibly a valuable tool for parents, students, school staff and fans to follow their teams. The problem, however, is that it is a self-avowed advertising platform (see section 4.1.1), that provides no transparency, consent, or control for the aggressive advertising supply chains integrated into their pages, and subsequently integrated into school utility apps via WebView.</p>
<p>Troublingly, we found MaxPreps.com in apps for schools that had students likely under the age of 16, due to the inclusion of Freshman and JV sports data.<a>3</a></p>
<p>MaxPreps provides a free service for coaches and team management tools, with marketing language on pages including: “High School coaches get FREE access to team management and communication tools.” (source @ <a href="https://secure.maxpreps.com/utility/member/login.aspx">https://secure.maxpreps.com/utility/member/login.aspx</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3 MaxPreps Sign In Page</p>
 <a></a>4.1.1 Advertising on MaxPreps 
<p>Currently, MaxPreps offers 17 different advertising formats as shown in Appendix D. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The following is a video of navigating a MaxPreps-powered school sports page in a Blackboard app, with ads that were shown:</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Video 1: MaxPreps-powered Sport Page in Blackboard App</p>
<p>From a high-level, there should be no taxpayer funded mobile apps for schools that have online advertising within them – this should be a hard and fast rule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inclusion of MaxPreps advertising vendors within in-app webpages within school utility apps demands that the advertising on these pages be “technically sandboxed” so that they can’t trigger pop-ups or malicious experiences/redirects/downloads — and the types of ads shown in these apps should be contextual and significantly limiting any user data ingestions. Unfortunately, during our research, we captured both a malicious pop-up network that was breaking the functionality whenever it triggered, served via the Kargo SSP advertising vendor, as seen below in Figure 2, as well as malicious redirects and pop-ups within several of the “Sites” within the MaxPreps’ Sports tabs that had custom domains, where apparently schools forgot to re-register the domain, and the domains were subsequently scooped-up by malicious advertising actors.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>

<p>Here is a short video of the malicious pop-ups in a Blackboard app available to students, parents and teachers: &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Video 2: Malicious Pop-ups in Blackboard School Utility App</p>
<p>MaxPreps also has advertising from Google on many of the pages, which includes behavioral retargeting ads and syncs people’s data to numerous new advertising companies before and after the auctions. The full list of advertising vendors who received data can be requested by contacting the Me2B Alliance at services@me2ba.org.</p>
<p>The MaxPreps search pages (Figure 5, below, shown here on a desktop connection), which let you sort by “Schools,” “Athletes” and “Videos” includes ads from the public advertising company Taboola, which consistently serves up inappropriate ads and links to low quality websites.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 5 Example of Google Advertising on MaxPreps Website</p>
 <a></a>4.1.2 How Many Schools Use MaxPreps? 
<p>According to the MaxPreps website, MaxPreps partners with over 200,000 school coaches throughout the United States (source: <a href="https://support.maxpreps.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004604407-About-MaxPreps">https://support.maxpreps.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004604407-About-MaxPreps</a>). Based on the website’s vast list of teams, thousands of schools in the United States use MaxPreps.</p>
<p>Several resources on the MaxPreps website flaunt the reach of the service. Figure 3 is a portion of the “<a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/documents/CoachHandout.pdf">Coach Handout</a>”, flaunting that the site “already has your school information.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 6 MaxPreps Coach Handout</p>
<p>Note that you can use the <a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/search/default.aspx?type=school&amp;search=&amp;state=al&amp;gendersport=">public MaxPreps search interface</a> (Figure 6) to find out if your school may be using MaxPreps within your school mobile apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 7 MaxPreps School Search</p>
<p>When attempting to determine the scale of schools potentially using this MaxPreps software, it became clear that MaxPreps claims to only work with High School students, but there are countless private and Christian schools who have K-12 curriculum, who are being “serviced” by MaxPreps. For example, Victory Christian Academy, in Chula Vista, California, has a K-12 curriculum, and is frequently covered by MaxPreps. This raises questions about whether certain school apps have users under the age of 13 interacting with the “sports” tab connected to a MaxPreps scoreboard, filled with online advertising.</p>
 <a></a>4.1.3 MaxPreps advertising being purchased by the U.S. Military&nbsp; 
<p>To our surprise, for at least some period of time, MaxPreps was used by the military to serve military recruitment ads to high school students, and one of the example advertising documents from CBS Interactive on MaxPreps is for the U.S. Army National Guard, with the text of the ad saying:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Serve Part-Time</p>
<p>Learn what makes the Citizen-Soldiers of the Army National Guard different. Find out how they serve their communities as well as their country, part time. Click here for more information.”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.cbsinteractive.com/advertise/MaxPreps_Mobile_Wall_Post.doc">https://www.cbsinteractive.com/advertise/MaxPreps_Mobile_Wall_Post.doc</a></p>
<p>In 2015, MaxPreps was mentioned in 3 federal contracts from the Department of Defense, Department of the Army, with all three from the “…Readiness Center” – likely all focused on recruitment. (See Figure 9)</p>
<p></p>

<p>It appears only one contract that mentioned MaxPreps was awarded to a company called “RED CARROT INC” for $4,301,517 and the phrasing of the contracts makes it appear that only a portion of this $4.3 million would have gone to MaxPreps advertising, with the money being spent on other apps and websites. MaxPreps was however mentioned by name in the title of these Requests for Proposals. The details of the federal contracts can be seen <a href="https://sam.gov/search/?index=_all&amp;pageSize=25&amp;page=1&amp;sort=-modifiedDate&amp;sfm%5Bstatus%5D%5Bis_active%5D=true&amp;sfm%5Bstatus%5D%5Bis_inactive%5D=true&amp;sfm%5Bkeywords%5D%5B0%5D%5Bkey%5D=Maxpreps&amp;sfm%5Bkeywords%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=Maxpreps">here</a>.</p>
 <a></a>4.1.4 Obsolete Data Still Being Monetized with Online Advertising<br>
 
<p>MaxPreps seems to have profiles for private schools like the “<a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/va/christiansburg/pathway-christian-academy/">Pathway Christian Academy</a>”&nbsp;(see Figure 10 below) in Christiansburg, Virginia, and various pages for sports at this school (volleyball @ <a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/pathway-christian-academy-(christiansburg,va)/volleyball/home.htm">https://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/pathway-christian-academy-(christiansburg,va)/volleyball/home.htm</a>) yet the Pathway Christian Academy seems to no longer exist and have been replaced by the <a href="http://www.vatechniques.com/staff">Virginia Techniques Training Center</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 10 Obsolete School Data with Ads in MaxPreps</p>
<p>Why does MaxPreps continue to make new team pages for a school that seemingly doesn’t exist anymore? Why are so many pages across MaxPreps empty, yet still serving advertising from major brands?&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>4.1.5 Other Noteworthy Behavior in MaxPreps: 
 
 MaxPreps uses kids’ photos on website pages that are filled with online advertising. For further example, please see Appendix E. 
 We found it peculiar that MaxPreps heavily relies on freelance photographers, who license their photos to MaxPreps without compensation. Photographers are only paid a portion of sales when a photo is purchased from the MaxPreps website, and apparently not a portion of any advertising revenues. Please see Appendix F for more details.&nbsp; 
 MaxPreps generates “profiles” for athletes without their knowledge or consent and prompts other users to “follow” the profile to get alerts for when new photos are added to the site. Please see Appendix G for more information. 
 
 <a></a>4.2 Dangling &amp; Hijacked Domains: An Unexpected Security &amp; Privacy Risk 
<p>The research into the 18 apps unexpectedly revealed another serious and urgent set of risks caused by the use of WebView in mobile apps: expired, embedded URLs (“dangling domains”) that have been acquired (“hijacked) by bad actors. When the domain is hijacked by a bad actor, the compromised website can result in an array of harms to students through malicious website redirects including flagrant collection of personal information for spam purposes, and links to inappropriate websites (such as pornographic content), or scam credit card/gift card offers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 11 Hijacked Domain with an Amazon Gift Card Scam</p>
<p>Here is a video of a dangling domain within a Blackboard app: &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Video 3: Dangling Domain in a Blackboard App</p>
<p>Figure 12 (below) shows a screenshot of a dangling domain within a Blackboard app for a school that was briefly available for purchase for $30. This was an example of a domain that was briefly lost and then the team at Blackboard, after being alerted to the problem by our team, were able to take action by removing the domain from the app and subsequently the Android app was pulled down from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackboard.community.quinlanisd">the Google Play Store</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 12 Dangling Domain</p>
<p>Our team reached out to the internationally recognized anti-malware researchers at Confiant.com with some early details about these compromised websites within apps. The&nbsp;Confiant&nbsp;team was able to confirm the problem existed and pointed our team to additional malware research that had found similar exploits in the past that triggered pop-up ads and other low quality advertising experiences. The Me2B Alliance deeply appreciates the support from&nbsp;Confiant and their work.</p>
<p>We are willing to discuss additional details and concerns with any U.S.-based cybersecurity companies who contact us.</p>
<p>After confirming that several U.S. schools had apps that were hosting compromised websites that injected scams and aggressively shared the student and parent user data, our team reached out to Blackboard’s security team with detailed information about our disconcerting findings. Blackboard responded quickly, and we appreciated the thoroughness of their response: they confirmed early research, they alerted schools, and they removed links from existing apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s unknown if any students or parents at the impacted schools were alerted, and the serious ongoing Business Email Compromise risks from the compromised school domains remain. This warrants more widescale notifications to school districts and states, as well as parents and administrators to alert them that emails from the compromised domains are illegitimate and potentially harmful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, our team still has strong concerns about advertising companies who ingested data via these compromised apps, and we have concerns for any ad buyers who could have been defrauded by these advertising companies allowing these monetization schemes to exist for criminal domain squatters and hijackers.</p>
<p>We could find no indication of a business relationship between Blackboard and MaxPreps, but MaxPreps was integrated into the “Sports” section of every Blackboard app we tested. Nonetheless, app template providers like Blackboard should be taking more steps to make sure their mobile apps are safe from extraneous data sharing from vendors like MaxPreps, or any other vendor who operates advertising networks. (We question whether any webpage that is run by an advertising network should ever be in a K-12 school app.) The safety of this supply chain and technical infrastructure is someone’s responsibility (see also Section 4.4).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We support GDPR regulations and any privacy frameworks that place accountability squarely on the “data controllers”, which we believe companies like Blackboard to be. The data flows that occur in the context of a WebView in-app browser are integrated into that app, no matter the domain integrated into that architecture by any administrator. The core app template architecture creates the risks, which we believe companies like Blackboard should acknowledge, so that they can make changes to their own app code to make these school utility apps safer. In particular, an app admin should not be able to turn off a privacy feature that impacts end-users of the app. Blackboard and any company operating in the school utility ecosystem needs to disable any features that allow this “safety toggling” concept.</p>
<p>As it stands, we’re still waiting for companies like Blackboard to change their systems, but this process is deeply complex due to the shared ownership of their apps with client schools and school districts. Apple and Google can also make changes to their underlying operating systems in Android and iOS that would help all companies like Blackboard comply with user choice and preferences. If this change happened at the operating system level, it would save hundreds of millions of dollars in development costs for developers who want to give users the ability to select their own in-app browsers, without also having to rewrite all their legacy code and apps.</p>
<p>We appreciate that companies like Blackboard are “between a rock and a hard place” and believe that raising these issues in a transparent way will help move these challenging debates forward.</p>
 <a></a>4.3 Extensive Data Sharing Through WebView / In-app Browsers 
<p>Note: This section is provided as informational only and should be viewed as an illustrative “snapshot” of the findings from the manual testing sessions of the apps shown earlier in Tables 1 and 2. This information is included to give a sense of the magnitude of the situation.</p>
<p>This current analysis exposed yet another data conduit to third parties, beyond the use of SDKs. Namely, the practice of including embedded browsers in apps, using WebView (in both Android and iOS apps). Mobile apps with embedded browsers can easily communicate and are sharing student data with an unbounded universe of third parties via URLs/requests from these WebView-invoked vendors – usually sent using JavaScript. The “context” of the app is sent with these third-party requests through a “referrer field” or “path field” which tells advertisers the name of the app being used, creating risks when the app is for K-12 students, parents, teachers and administrators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, users have no choice or control over the use of an in-app browser when the app developers overrule preferences, which means school utility app users can’t configure browser privacy settings, or enable a privacy signal such as the <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">Global Privacy Control</a> signal. Both Apple and Android have some protections on in-app browsers, but they are minimal and the inability for users to always overrule an app and choose their browser of choice to open web links exacerbates the risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Linking to a single webpage within an in-app browser oftentimes results in numerous outbound requests to new vendors. This can go very badly (i.e. hundreds of potential third parties) when the linked webpage is run by an advertising entity who is hosting banner or video ads on the pages.</p>
<p>Troublingly, WebView is particularly common in school utility apps<a>4</a>. The sample size was small, but based on our past experience auditing school apps and awareness of vendors in this ecosystem, we believe that in-app browsers are prevalent due to this process costing less to build and maintain for the tech vendors, and being easier to maintain for non-technical school administrators.</p>
<p>To quantify the magnitude of the situation, through less than 3 “sessions” using each of the apps, we found:</p>
 
 Over 650 unique external URLs were invoked in 11 Android apps, 73% of the links were advertising or analytics related, 9.5% of the links were ostensibly appropriate, but had an unacceptable level of advertising connected to them, and 3% of the links were hijacked domains leading to malicious sites. 
 Over 550 unique external URLs were invoked in 6 iOS apps, 66% of the links were advertising or analytics related, 8% of the links were appropriate but had an unacceptable level of advertising connected to them 
 
<p>The number of external URLs students are sharing data with each day could easily number in the thousands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will each of these vendors be alerted that they could have ingested data from users under 13? Will the advertising companies like Google and Taboola, who hosted the banner ads on pages, be required to alert advertising vendors who synced data from any of these school apps? In California, will users under 16 have their data deleted? If the app can’t tell the difference between an under 13/16 user and other users, should all the data be deleted and vendors encouraged to delete all the data they ingested under that “it could be under 13” threshold? Will these vendors who ingested data from these URLs be required to delete or modify any algorithms and models they optimized using data from these apps?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to once again underscore the fact that this wasn’t necessarily “apples to apples” testing, and the numbers, while large, are likely small subsets of the actual numbers, given the limits of our testing and the reality of advertising data supply chains. There are no conclusions to be drawn with respect to “iOS versus Android” here. The value of the findings has to do with the sheer volume of third parties and the distribution of the kinds of URLs included. If our testing sessions were longer and exercised more functionality, it would have yielded an infinite list of linked URLs from advertising companies.</p>
<p>In short, if 73% of third-party URLs included in these apps are advertising related, this means that students’ and/or parent’s data is being shared with potentially thousands of advertising entities every time students use the app during the course of a school year.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>4.4 Who is the Data Controller for Apps Built from Licensed School App Templates? 
<p>Our research from earlier this year showed that privacy policies for school utility apps were often inaccurate and inadequate. This current, deeper analysis, including a discussion with a team from Blackboard, underscored the reality of “data controller confusion” for licensed app templates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of school utility apps, the school is often the customer of the technology/platform provider, and in the supplier agreement, the school (licensee) typically is understood as the data controller for the app, and the technology provider (licensor) is absolved of any data controller responsibilities (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230">following a Section 230 protections line of reasoning</a>). Further, while the team conducting this research are not lawyers, functions like a radio button to toggle off security and privacy features in a CMS back-end dashboard may possibly void Section 230 protections. The serious problem here, however, is that the school may not be aware of what those responsibilities are, and worse, may not really know they’re responsible. Which begs a larger question of, who is the data controller—or perhaps more accurately—who are the data co-controllers in the case of apps built from licensed school app templates? And who are the data processors? And when there are technical loopholes and missing safeguards to protect kids from being profiled by advertising companies, who along this data supply chain is required to take action?</p>
<p>Important to note that this business model (licensed app templates) isn’t unique to EdTech; this is a pervasive business model for which data controller/data processor roles between the platform provider and the licensee must—and likely will eventually—be clarified in the courts.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>4.5 Key Insights – Summary 
<p>In summary, the key insights from this research are the following:</p>
 
 Mobile apps using embedded browsers (both iOS and Android) present an alternate channel by which personal information can – systematically and at scale – be sent to third parties.
 
 It is, therefore, insufficient to analyze only the SDKs in a mobile app to assess data flow to third parties. And due to the time-based reality of new advertising vendors being synced before and after advertising auctions, these types of data supply chains create infinite risk for students, parents, teachers and administrators. 
 
 
 Mobile apps that include embedded browsers have been found to include hijacked domains with active malicious redirects. More care needs to be taken by schools both for the user data privacy and security implications, but also due to the massive potential harm from business email compromise schemes. It’s our hope at the Me2B Alliance that security experts at the Department of Education, DHS, CISA and FBI are thinking about the risks from public and private schools losing access to their domains, and the ecosystem risks from this behavior being coupled with any criminal business email compromise schemes. 
 There is a thriving practice for bad actors to constantly scan for expired URLs and purchase them, inserting malicious redirects for data collection (advertising/drive by download honeypots), or other harmful tactics. We observed in real time at least one school-related-dangling-domain get purchased by an unknown actor (i.e. not related to the school). Whose responsibility is it to prevent and who should be alerted when the domains are lost? 
 Neither iOS nor Android app stores require developers to disclose either the use of WebView, or the included URLs in the app information label, making it impossible for users to understand with whom their data is being shared. Apps are also not required to prominently note the types of advertising within their apps, and whether advertising vendors who bid and win the chance to serve an ad in the app get an opportunity to sync additional data from the user. 
 The providers of technology (including licensable mobile app templates) are accountable for data processing practices that occur within the context of their app template WebView pages, yet legacy development practices coupled with mobile operating systems not fully supporting user choice for preventing in-app browsers, are making it nearly impossible to keep non-technical customers’ users safe from harm. 
 
 <a></a>5 Me2BA Recommendations 
 <a></a>5.1 Schools 
 
 All schools/districts that have students under the age of 13, and all schools in California that have students under the age of 16, who are using the Blackboard Mobile Communications App and who have added MaxPreps.com into the app:
 
 Immediately remove the MaxPreps.com link from their school/district apps. 
 Immediately send an email to <a href="mailto:support@maxpreps.com">support@maxpreps.com</a> and ask whether MaxPreps can support deletion requests for your schools’ users to the advertising vendors like Google and Taboola. 
 
 
 School app administrators need to be trained on the risks of embedding URLs in apps.
 
 School app administrators should recognize that if they can’t audit a page for advertising or analytics vendors, then they need to find help. 
 Coaches and all school staff need to be warned about digital product monetization schemes and everyone should know the mantra, “if the product is free, you are the product.”&nbsp; 
 
 
 Schools and school districts must have processes in place to:
 
 Keep track of all owned URLs, especially when embedded into mobile apps used by students, parents, teachers and administrators,&nbsp; 
 Ensure that URLs aren’t expiring (due to expired credit cards, etc.).&nbsp; 
 Have a plan for what to do if a domain expires, because a compromised domain for a school could lead to significant Business Email Compromise or specific types of payment fraud against a State or the Federal government. &nbsp; 
 
 
 
 <a></a>5.2 MaxPreps.com/Viacom 
 
 Immediately remove all student data for children under the age of 16, because it was obtained without consent or awareness and it could be impossible to determine what data is under 13 and what data is under 16,&nbsp;
 
 If it’s impossible to determine which users are under the age of 13/16, all data should be purged that was received from school utility apps. 
 
 
 Immediately remove all of the online advertising from the pages integrated within all school utility apps until all behavioral retargeting ads are turned off, all inappropriate ads are turned off, and unsafe data transfers are turned off.&nbsp;
 
 We believe that a full removal of all advertising is the correct initial course and anything less than a full removal of the advertising from these pages will need to be coupled with concrete details about what is being done to give users control and transparency of the advertising data sharing. 
 
 
 Strongly consider not serving online advertising on MaxPreps webpages served within apps until Google and Apple update settings that gives students, parents, teachers and administrators the ability to open in-app WebView links via a browser of their choice.&nbsp; 
 Consider ending the monetization of all MaxPreps.com content with online advertising, not only the content served within school utility apps, but the content on the website too.&nbsp; 
 
 <a></a>5.3 Apple and Google 
 
 The fastest, most efficient way to reduce the serious risks of student data sharing to advertising companies, and malicious redirects through acquisition of expired URLS is for Apple and Google/Android to immediately update their operating systems to allow users to designate a safe default browser for use by in-app embedded browsers, and not let developers overrule that choice. The default browser choice that users should choose should be a browser that is configured to the highest level of privacy and security, such as the Safari, Mozilla’s Firefox, or the Brave browser on iOS devices. Further, the default browser should also be one capable of sending the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal, for maximum privacy (which Safari cannot do yet, although Mozilla’s Firefox and the Brave browser both can send this additional GPC opt-out signal).&nbsp; 
 App privacy labels within the app marketplaces (or any marketplace with an approval process is the data controller for the user data flows within those apps that use marketplace/operating system-derived metadata) must include all third parties who are receiving data – including those receiving data via WebView data flows.
 
 This means the app label needs to include all URLs invoked in the app. 
 Apps should not be able to claim that they don’t track users, if they embed in-app WebView webpages with significant amounts of user data transfers to advertising companies, and active online advertising auctions within these pages. 
 If an app is using online advertising, especially in school utility apps, there needs to be significantly more work done to document all advertising vendors within that data supply chain. If you are the data controller of the app and have partners who monetize this app with online advertising, you take on the obligation of documenting your data processors and co-data-controllers. 
 
 
 
 <a></a>5.4 Developers of licensable, templatized apps (like Blackboard) with in-app browsers 
 
 Include security features in your app configuration service to keep your customers’ users safe—especially when they are children. For example:
 
 The CMS admin panel should default to—and possibly only allow—links to open in a separate browser. Why should admins be able to turn off a privacy and security feature? 
 System should automatically check if a newly entered URL is active before saving the entry.&nbsp; 
 System should automatically periodically (daily) check if client-entered URLs are still active and should alert the app administrator about any dangling domains, and disable any calls to them. 
 System should present highly visible and understandable warnings that expired URLs present serious security risks to their users.&nbsp; 
 System should warn users about the risks for embedded websites via in-app browsers, especially when training for these risks could be the difference between a safe way for students and parents to learn about their school sports program, and the current dystopic reality where an entire company has been created with “free products for coaches” which is actually a product being heavily monetized with online advertising – the kids were the product all-along. 
 
 
 
 <a></a>5.5 Federal, State and Local Policy Makers 
 
 Schools need more training and support to understand and fulfill their duties as Data Controllers and Co-Data Controllers, especially when any student data could be shared with online advertising companies.&nbsp; 
 Schools need resources to be able to “check that their websites and apps are safe from unexpected external data transfers” – and if schools are using vendors who contract across numerous local, state and federal jurisdictions, providing software for a wide variety of schools, there should be federal standards to require these vendors to operate both in good faith and with an acknowledgement that when any utility app for schools is unsafe, it’s usually just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; 
 The Department of Education should consider launching a “privacy bounty program” similar to technical bug bounty programs, to support the public spending time auditing school mobile apps and websites. 
 Schools and School Districts should be required to report lost or dangling domains within a specific period of time, so that the public and other government administrators know that emails from these domains can no longer be trusted. A public registrar of formerly-government-owned-domains would also be useful – the vast majority of these are on .com, .org &amp; .us domain suffixes, as any .gov or .edu domains are apparently more easily recovered. 
 
 <a></a>6 Appendix A – How to Spot WebView Pages in a Mobile App 
<p>Sometimes it’s obvious to detect the launch of an external website from within a mobile app through the recognition of popular brand (like Facebook for example). Other times, it can be harder to distinguish. If you want to be exceedingly certain, we suggest following the methods outlined in Section 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some ways to detect the use of WebView through the interface:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 13 Example WebView Page</p>
<p>Things to look for on the page:</p>
 
 Is there a different color scheme on the page? 
 Is there a large, new logo and brand name on the page (like “MaxPreps” on Figure 13)? 
 Did the page load differently / more slowly and piecemeal? 
 Are there ads on the page (like the car dealership ad in Figure 13)? 
 Is there a new Sign-in button?&nbsp; 
 Is there a separate “hamburger menu” button (usually 3 lines or dots)? 
 Do you see pop-up advertising like the Amazon Prime ad from the Kargo SSP, seen above? 
 
 <a></a>7 Appendix B – Data Flow Analysis Using TrackerMap 
<p>The screenshots below are from a paid tool from Crownpeak called “Trackermap” – the colored nodes are unique vendors receiving data. The vast majority of these data transfers would be “a surprise” to app makers and typically none of these data transfers are accounted for in Apple / Google privacy labels or other types of legal disclosures. Most lawyers don’t know these data flows exist, and many app developers don’t understand this either – and the people updating apps without technical knowledge rarely know about these risks.</p>
<p>When an in-app browser opens a WebView URL, this is represented in the images below with a large purple circle. All of the nodes flowing off this core circle, are the unique vendors who received data in the context of the app that opened the original URL within a WebView.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some of the screenshots below, which are desktop simulated data flows from pages that opened within some of the WebView in-app browser sessions, some of the pages had minimal vendors receiving data – whereas on other pages, countless advertising vendors received data. When a page has numerous advertising vendors collecting data, this usually means there are banner ads on the page, and the potential for a near unlimited number of vendors to receive user data if refreshing a page and the ads on it regularly.</p>

  <p>In the globalized digital economy, the job of verifying the identities of trade partners is becoming more complex and costly as each month passes. GLEIF data (see related links below) highlighted that 50% of financial institutions use, on average, four different identifiers to validate each customer organization. Individual businesses, which lack both the verification skills and the resources of financial institutions, struggle even further. </p>
<p>In November 2021, GLEIF partnered with Contour, a global network of banks, corporates and trade partners working together to revolutionize the trade finance industry by removing barriers to entry. The partnership enables the use of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) within Contour’s platform and puts digital identity at the heart of its proposition. </p>
<p>We caught up with Aaron Seabrook, COO at Contour, to discuss the partnership and explore why digital identity is such a vital component in creating more accessible trade networks. </p>
<p>What are some of the common challenges Contour’s clients encounter when trying to verify the identity of potential trading partners? </p>
<p>When organizations set out to build relationships with new suppliers, establishing that they are indeed who they claim to be is a vital step. We have heard from our member organizations that supplier verification processes are fragmented and inconsistently applied, particularly so following the business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Establishing the identity of a new supplier tends to be a manual process which, of course, is very inefficient: it is prone to human error; a challenge to scale in line with business growth; and really time consuming. </p>
<p>Why did Contour decide to partner with GLEIF?</p>
<p>Contour’s vision is to create a better world for businesses by making global trade accessible, digital, and secure. Our platform’s goal is to simplify the financial workflows between banks and corporations to enable seamless collaboration in real time. By doing so, we hope to reduce complexity and optimize efficiency for all involved. </p>
<p>As we have grown the platform, we have encountered challenges along the way when onboarding new member organizations. Some have multiple connections into disparate networks where they may be registered under a slightly different name, others may register with us using a holding company and be using a trading company to sign into others. When we try to piece this information together, mistakes happen because we’re reliant on manual processes. Digital systems crave structure, so we decided that a unique identification system was for our platform. </p>
<p>We chose the LEI because it is a well-governed and widely adopted global standard.</p>
<p>How will Contour’s customers benefit from access to the LEI as part of this latest partnership?</p>
<p>The LEI is going to become a central part of the Contour onboarding system through our new role as a Registration Agent. When an organization joins Contour, they go through our automated onboarding journey. Part of this system will now include a check to see if they have an LEI. If not, we will not only register them but shoulder the cost of doing so too.</p>
<p>Not only will the LEI improve our users’ customer experience within Contour, but it will also have a significant impact on their overall digital trade journey. Our members have multiple connections within multiple networks. With an LEI, a company’s legal reference data is available electronically to anyone, anywhere, for free - it can be universally validated. When used in international trade and trade finance, this creates greater confidence amongst trading parties resulting in more transparent and efficient cross-border exchanges of goods and data. In addition, the LEI will also lower data reconciliation costs, reduce transaction discrepancies and improve risk management for all our clients. </p>
<p>From their first day of joining Contour, our members will be in possession of a globally recognized digital identifier, applicable not only within Contour but across other international systems as well. This will help them realize the benefits of digitalization more quickly.</p>
<p>What long-term potential do you see for ID initiatives, such as the LEI, for global trade?</p>
<p>We believe that the LEI holds vast potential for global trade. As part of our vision of making trade accessible and inclusive to all, this means providing companies, both large and small, with the tools to improve their access to trade finance. The LEI enables SMEs in developed and developing countries to quickly establish their credentials via a native digital identity that is recognized globally. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/mckinsey-company-and-gleif-leis-and-client-lifecycle-management-in-banking-a-u-s-4-billion-beginning">GLEIF and McKinsey data</a> highlights that banks issuing trade finance could save up to $500 million every year by using the LEI for letters of credit alone. The potential for savings across the entire KYC process are therefore tremendous. Banks may also be incentivized to lend to a broader range of businesses of all sizes if those borrowers could offer up a globally recognized and validated form of organizational identity. </p>
<p>Businesses with LEIs are also more likely to be able to establish credit terms with international partners in the supply chain, creating further opportunities for global economic growth. </p>
<p>The ripple effects that can occur by equipping businesses with LEIs are remarkable. We want to ensure that Contour plays a key part in the drive to make the LEI de-facto means of legal entity ID by continuing to advocate for industry adoption. </p>
<p>A fairer, more open, and more efficient international trade ecosystem is in sight.</p>

<p>ClaimReview is one of the hidden jewels that can be found amongst schema.org's 2700+ definitions. To kick off a series of guest posts around this topic, we bring you a guest post from two members of the factchecking and open data community who have been exploring the potential of this work.</p> Enriching ClaimReview for fact checkers <p><a href="https://twitter.com/mr_dudders">Andrew Dudfield</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ldodds">Leigh Dodds</a></p><br><p>To help fight bad information, search engines, social media platforms and other sources of online content are increasingly highlighting the work of fact checkers by labelling posts with incorrect, misleading or harmful information.</p><br><p>This is often enabled through the publication of structured data that uses Schema.org's <a href="https://schema.org/ClaimReview">ClaimReview</a> schema. This defines a simple approach for <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/factcheck">tagging fact checking articles</a> that has been collaboratively developed and documented through <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>. For more background for a journalistic and factchecking audience, see <a href="https://reporterslab.org/">Duke Reporters' Lab</a>'s <a href="https://www.claimreviewproject.com/">dedicated site</a>.&nbsp;</p> <br> At&nbsp;<a href="https://fullfact.org/">Full Fact</a> we have recently been exploring ways to revise and extend the claim review metadata to provide more detail that might enable further reuse and labelling of content, and further insights into the fact checking process.<br><br><p>Our investigation has covered the following areas:</p><br>  <p>Current scope and application of ClaimReview. The currently defined model provides a lot of flexibility around how much detail might be included in a review, with Google, <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/Webmaster-Blog/September-2017/Bing-adds-Fact-Check-label-in-SERP-to-support-the-ClaimReview-markup">Bing</a> and others recommending specific profiles of that in their structured markup documentation. Full Fact has adopted their own approach for applying the standard,&nbsp;we have reflected on that experience and the current recommendations from Google, Bing and other adopters, in pursuit of a Full Fact profile that is close to those used elsewhere.</p>  <p>Identifiers and linking. How can additional links and identifiers be included in ClaimReview markup to support disambiguation and aggregation of data? We've concluded that Schema.org already provides useful properties which, if applied consistently, can support this goal. In line with its growing role as a clearing house for identifiers, we believe <a href="https://wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a> would be a useful common target for linking data across the community, e.g. making use of schema.org's <a href="https://schema.org/sameAs">sameAs</a> property. Full Fact articles <a href="https://twitter.com/mr_dudders/status/1466362791200280581">now contain</a> experimental markup in this direction.</p>  <p>Enriching Claims. The standard was revised to include the notion of a <a href="https://schema.org/Claim">Claim</a>: a statement made by an author that appears in one or more locations. We believe this is an important part of the data model and one that should be more widely adopted. Consistent use of Claim markup would help to clearly indicate situations in which a person or organisation is repeatedly making the same claim, or where others are repeating the same misinformation. In addition to enriching claims with author and appearance information, the addition of topic information would provide a useful dimension to the data, helping to surface related claims and fact checks.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Corrections and actions. The <a href="https://fullfact.org/blog/2019/jun/how-fact-checking-works/">second wave of fact checking</a> is about more than just writing fact checks, it involves taking action to tackle disinformation. How might we surface data about requests for corrections to published content, and record when those corrections have been made? Schema.org currently includes some vocabulary to help describe corrections and comments which we've explored. But further work is needed to define a useful way of recording and sharing the other activities undertaken by fact checkers</p>  <p>Citing evidence. Finally citing evidence is an essential part of performing a fact check, so how can we use existing Schema.org vocabulary to help to surface the key resources, papers and datasets that were used in producing a fact check?</p>  <br><p>Building on the open, collaborative approach that the community has taken so far, we have published <a href="https://fullfact.github.io/markup-investigation/">our research notes</a> that explore these questions in more detail and present some early recommendations. We welcome feedback from anyone working to tackle online disinformation.</p><br><p>We would also like to propose the creation of an informal mailing list or community group to support ongoing discussion and experimentation, e.g. hosted at W3C alongside the broader <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">Schema.org CG</a>.</p><br><p>Our joint goal would be to create proposals for further enhancing the current Schema.org model, as necessary, and documenting useful patterns of applying the current model to real-world scenarios including both tagging content and developing APIs.</p> <br>

<p>Wolf McNally’s <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lifehash">LifeHash</a> is one of Blockchain Commons’ interoperable specifications intended to make digital infrastructure open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate. A LifeHash takes a cryptographic objects such as a seed or a key (or really, any sort of data) and turns it into a beautiful and easily recognizable image.</p>

<p>You can now play with LifeHashes at <a href="http://lifehash.info/">LifeHash.info</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash-web/">C++ implementation compiled to WebAssembly</a> allows you to enter an arbitrary text string or a SHA-256 digest and view the corresponding LifeHash — using one of a few different LifeHash variants. (We recommend v2 as the “official” LifeHash.) Because it’s compiled into Webassembly, LifeHash.info does all the work in your browser, ensuring your secrets stay safe!</p>

<p>A similar idea called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereum-blockies">Blockies</a> already exists to identify Ethereum addresses. They’re a great addition to the Ethereum ecosystem, but LifeHashes incorporate a few additional features. Because each one is built from an iteration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>, they’re more detailed. They also have been carefully formatted to display well on grayscale screens and low-resolution screens, with our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/quarterlies/Q1-2021-Report/">LetheKit offering a proof of concept</a>.</p>

<p>So why use LifeHashes? They ensure that any time that you see a key or seed in a different environment, you’ll be able to recognize it through the visual hash (and now you can use <a href="http://lifehash.info/">LifeHash.info</a> to display the LifeHash derived from the SHA-256 hash of an object, even if your app doesn’t support LifeHashes). As an adjunct to existing computer and human examinations of digital hashes, LifeHashes can improve your security.</p>

<p>LifeHashes are particularly important for Blockchain Commons given our focus on resilient and independent airgapped architectures: a LifeHash allows for the easy comparison of a cryptographic object on either side of the gap, so that you know that you received what you were expecting. Transferred a seed? Asked to sign a PSBT for a specific account? LifeHashes can help you avoid costly errors.</p>

<p>Our explainer video talks more about LifeHash and demonstrates how it works:</p>





<p>Blockchain Commons is dedicated to improving the human aspects of the digital world; LifeHash does that by considering the human experience of cryptographic hashes and providing visual cues to replace (or at least supplement) the long strings of letters and numbers that we can’t easily differentiate.</p>

		<p>“I have been using Hyperledger technologies for the past two years. The most valuable insights that I gained from this are how a project can be planned and executed. I learnt that, if you plan, document and discuss a task clearly with your mentors and the people in the community, the time it takes to complete it is considerably lower and you don’t need to do any rework for it. This experience also improved my techniques in maintaining proper code and designing the code keeping conventions in mind. Finally, I learnt a lot about Hyperledger Fabric architecture as well as Hyperledger Indy and Docker networks.”</p>

<p>“I have been part of the Hyperledger ecosystem for the last five years and seen it grow to 18 projects, including DLTs, libraries and tools for efficient blockchain development and deployment. Hyperledger Fabric is the most used DLT in enterprise applications, and decentralised identity (DID)/self-sovereign identity (SSI) applications have grown in the last three to four years. To support Fabric as a ledger for Hyperledger Aries will increase the adoption of DID/SSI in enterprises by adding the flexibility to use Fabric as a ledger for SSI/DID systems and will create more interoperability within the Hyperledger ecosystem. It is a really interesting project. I have learnt lot as a mentor and got the opportunity to contribute more to the Hyperledger ecosystem. My mentee, Harsh, did really well. He completed this project and now we are planning to propose this as a Hyperledger Lab to build out the future roadmap.”</p>

<p></p>
 Shops.scot is a new venture under development, that will launch in the new year. 
<p>As the title suggests, this will operate a ‘Multivendor Marketplace’ – A site where multiple sellers can each create their own e-store, and visitors can browse and buy from any of them.</p>
<p>This will accelerate our Digital Nation Action Plan, specifically the digital enablement and support of micro and small businesses. It’s still the case that many don’t even have a web site.</p>
<p>So this will provide them an ultra simple way of achieving that, with the key distinction from other options like EBay or Amazon obviously being that it’s entirely Scotland focused. This means a much more local, hands on technical support, and a concentrated market focus.</p>
<p>Key features will include:</p>
 
 A powerful set of digital marketing tools – As well as loading up your products, you’ll be able to send e-vouchers, email marketing etc. 
 Cryptocurrency – Accept Bitcoin payments et al. This is another key technology field where SMEs know they should be doing more but it is simply beyond them. 
 
<p>In short it will leverage the SaaS (Software as a Service) model to make easily accessible the powerful e-commerce and digital marketing technologies that most small businesses would greatly benefit from but don’t have the resource or expertise to deploy themselves.</p>
<p>There is also great potential to team up with other Scottish innovators, such as <a href="https://www.mi-cnx.com/">Miconex</a>. They offer a gift card system that could tie in with #1, with a particular focus on local towns, such as <a href="https://www.mi-cnx.com/casestudy/case-study--the-perth-gift-card">Perth</a>.</p>
<p>Shops.scot will be able to provide the core e-commerce tools for selling their products, and organized into similarly local sections, like Shops.scot/Perth. This will provide a powerful combined solution to achieve key Scottish Government goals like <a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/news/scottish-government-offers-support-local-online-firms">boosting local commerce for local merchants</a>.</p>

<p>Discussion Papers are to White Papers as a quick sketch is to a finished painting. Where a White Paper advocates for a completed solution as the best solution for a problem or set of related problems, Discussion Papers provide a quick way to write up a radical or unexpected idea to solve a problem in a way that fosters discussion and collaboration on refining the idea.</p>



<p>The goal of Trust over IP working groups and task forces is to produce SSI and related technologies and standards, eventually advocating them outside Trust over IP for general adoption.</p>



<p>White Papers are the gold standard for talking about solutions with enough development, testing and successful deployment to provide evidence that this is a solution that is ready for mainstream adoption.</p>



<p>Discussion Papers are focused on providing a quick way of capturing new directions or ideas for stubborn problems in 500 to 2000 words with a combination of google docs (for authoring) and blogs (for comments) that encourage quick turnaround and lively discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ideas can be radical, opinionated or unexpected, but they do have to solve a problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The structure of a Discussion Paper is problem-focused, focused on issues that customers or consumers of ToIP (or related) technologies have now or need to be solved to make distributed Digital Identity and the Data Economy successful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The (suggested) Discussion Paper outline:</p>

Bild: Anwendungsfälle im Bildungsbereich mit dem Lissi&nbsp;Wallet<p>In diesem Artikel möchten wir einen Überblick über die Anwendungsfälle im Bildungsbereich geben, an welchen wir im Rahmen von <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a> derzeit arbeiten. Der <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/lissi-use-cases-education-c39908690300">Artikel ist auch in Englisch</a> verfügbar.</p><p>Wir verbringen viel Zeit in der Schule oder in Universitäten, um einen guten Bildungsabschluss zu erlangen. Mit erfolgreichem Abschluss an einer (Hoch)Schule wird ein Zertifikat als Nachweis der erbrachten Leistungen ausgestellt. Diese werden aktuell in Papierform ausgestellt und sind somit nicht medienbruchfrei bei Dritten vorzuweisen. Mit Lissi erhältst Du deine Bildungszertifikate direkt in Dein Wallet und kannst es nach Bedarf dritten Parteien, wie z.B. einem potenziellen Arbeitgeber oder einer Universität präsentieren. Wir gehen aber noch einen Schritt weiter und möchten zusammen mit unseren Partnern aus dem Bildungssektor alle Prozesse, welche vertrauensvolle Interaktionen voraussetzen, digitalisieren. Vorerst zählen dazu die folgenden drei Anwendungsgebiete:</p>Bild: Bildungsnachweise im Lissi&nbsp;Wallet Bildungsnachweise: <p>Es gibt eine Vielzahl an Nachweisen für erbrachte Leistungen im Bildungsbereich: Von Abschlusszeugnissen der Schule und Universität bis hin zu Schulungsbestätigungen vom Arbeitgeber oder einer Online-Plattform. Aktuell erhalten wir diese Zertifikate in Papierform oder als PDF, welche nur schwer durch Dritte überprüft werden können. Parteien, die die Zertifikate überprüfen möchten, haben oftmals keine Möglichkeit eine Fälschung von einem Original zu unterscheiden. Dies ist für alle beteiligten ein Problem. Wir arbeiten aktiv mit Anbietern von Bildungszertifikaten daran, diese Nachweise zu digitalisieren, sodass Du diese bequem in Deinem Lissi Wallet speichern kannst und Dritte diese einfach überprüfen können. Unser Ziel ist es, den kompletten Prozess für einen Studenten abzudecken und das fängt bereits im Gymnasium an. Mit dem Lissi Wallet kannst Du alle Zeugnisse vom Schulabschluss bis zum Master und alles dazwischen lebenslang und selbstbestimmt aufbewahren.</p><p><a href="https://www.bwi.de/news-blog/blog/artikel/sichere-digitale-identitaeten-wie-das-pdf-aus-der-bewerbung-verschwand">Ein Beitrag dazu </a>hat unser IDunion Partner, die BWI GmbH veröffentlicht.</p>Bild: Bewerbungen bei Bildungseinrichtungen mit dem Lissi&nbsp;Wallet Bewerbung für Bildungseinrichtungen: <p>Bei einer Bewerbung an einer öffentlichen Einrichtung als Student:in sind oftmals einige Nachweise notwendig. Häufig zählen dazu der Personalausweis, bisherige Bildungszertifikate oder sonstige Dokumente abhängig vom Studiengang und den persönlichen Umständen. Da diese Dokumente im Großteil noch in Papierform vorgelegt werden müssen, ist dies viel Aufwand für Bewerber:innen sowie die Bildungseinrichtung. Mit Lissi möchten wir die digitale Übersendung der Dokumente ermöglichen, welche besonders wertvoll bzw. schutzbedürftig sind. Damit fällt für Bewerber:innen der Mehraufwand weg, z.B. Kopien beglaubigen zu lassen. Bildungseinrichtungen können die Bewerbungen dann schneller und effizienter bearbeiten, was für alle Beteiligten von Vorteil&nbsp;ist.</p> Campusmanagement: <p>Zusammen mit der Technischen Universität Berlin untersuchen wir, wie die Campus Management Infrastruktur mit SSI-Agenten erweitert werden kann. Diverse Leistungen, beispielsweise der Zugang zu den Campus Diensten werden zukünftig mit verifizierbaren Nachweisen angeboten. Lernende sowie Lehrende haben somit über das Wallet Zugang zu den verschiedenen Dienstleistungen der Hochschule. Hierzu zählen z.B. Anmeldungen für Kurse oder Veranstaltungen, der Erhalt von Bescheinigungen, der Zugang zu Räumlichkeiten oder die Beantragung von sonstigen Leistungen. Somit hat die Bildungseinrichtung einen direkten Kontakt zu jedem Lernenden und kann bequem Informationen anfragen und Leistungen zur Verfügung stellen.</p>Patrick Herbke der Technischen Universität Berlin über das Lissi&nbsp;Wallet<p>Organisationen, welche Interesse der Zusammenarbeit an den genannten Anwendungsfällen haben oder neue Anwendungsfälle aus dem Bereich einbringen möchten, können uns gern via info@lissi.id kontaktieren.</p><p>Dein Lissi&nbsp;Team</p>

Picture: Use cases with the Lissi Wallet within the education sector.<p>In this article we would like to provide you with an overview of the use cases within the educational sector we are currently working on within <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a>. The <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/lissi-anwendungsf%C3%A4lle-bildung-7c7bda96ea64">article is also available in&nbsp;German</a>.</p><p>We spend a lot of time in school or universities to get a decent education. Upon successful graduation from a school or university, a certificate is issued as proof of the achievements. However, these are currently still only issued in paper form and therefore cannot be easily presented to third parties. With Lissi, you receive your educational certificates directly in your wallet and can present them to third parties, such as a potential employer or university, as required. However, we are going one step further and, together with our partners from the education sector, would like to digitise all processes that require trusted interactions. For the time being, this includes the following three application areas:</p>Picture: Educational certificates with the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet Educational Credentials <p>There are a variety of proofs of educational achievements: from school and university certificates to training confirmations from employers or an online platform. Currently, we receive these certificates in paper form or as PDFs, which are difficult to verify by third parties. Parties who want to verify the certificates often have no way to distinguish a fake from an original. This is a problem for all parties involved. We are actively working with education certificate providers to digitise these credentials so that you can conveniently store them in your Lissi Wallet and present them to third parties. Our goal is to cover the complete journey for a student and that starts in high school. With the Lissi Wallet, you can store all your certificates from graduation to master’s degree and everything in between for life long&nbsp;usage.</p><p>Our IDunion partner, the BWI GmbH, has published <a href="https://www.bwi.de/news-blog/blog/artikel/sichere-digitale-identitaeten-wie-das-pdf-aus-der-bewerbung-verschwand">an article on this&nbsp;topic</a>.</p>Picture: Applications to educational institutions with the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet Applying to educational institutions: <p>When applying to a public institution as a student different documents are required. Oftentimes these include the identity card, previous educational certificates or other documents depending on the course of study and personal circumstances. Since most of these documents still have to be submitted in paper form, this is a lot of work for both the applicant and the educational institution. With Lissi, we make it possible to send documents that are particularly valuable or in need of protection in digital form. This eliminates additional work for applicants, e.g. the need to have certified copies. Educational institutions can then process applications faster and more efficiently, which is an advantage for everyone involved.</p> Campus management: <p>Together with the Technical University of Berlin, we are investigating how the campus management infrastructure can be expanded with SSI agents. Various services, such as access to campus services, will be offered with verifiable credentials in the future. Learners as well as teachers will thus have access to the various services of the university via the Lissi Wallet. These include, for example, registering for courses or events, obtaining certificates, accessing premises or applying for other services. Thus, the educational institution has direct contact with each learner and can conveniently request information and provide services.</p>Patrick Herbke of the Technical University of Berlin about the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet<p>Organizations which are interested in collaborating on the above use cases or would like to contribute new use cases from the field are welcome to contact us via <a href="mailto:info@lissi.id">info@lissi.id</a>.</p><p>Your Lissi&nbsp;Team</p>

 Virtual Event, 12-14 October 2021<br>  <br>What is the Internet Identity Workshop? <p>IIW is run as an “<a href="https://agilecrete.org/what-is-an-open-space-unconference/">Open Space un-Conference</a>”, designed to be a dynamic, participant-led 'marketplace of questions and topics', to foster conversation, networking and learning. Empowering everyone to speak, ask and present, this format takes partial inspiration from decentralized approaches to technology. Collectively, attendees set each day’s agendas, volunteering a mix of prepared presentations, open discussion, product demos and workshops. Hundreds of attendees, including a number of DIF members, put together a huge programme of content for the 33rd IIW, covering topics ranging from the technical minutiae of IAM and SSI to big-picture discussions about ethics and strategy, and participated in over 110 virtual sessions across the three days.</p><p>A book of proceedings, containing the notes from all of the sessions will be collated and published by IIW (back catalogue from previous IIWs <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops">here</a>, and a wiki of notes from individual sessions <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_33_Session_Notes">here</a>). Here we will overview a few of the topics discussed and sketch out some of the strong and weak signals discernible in the collective discussion. To that end, sessions are clustered thematically and not chronologically.</p> 101 Sessions <p>A staple of IIW, 101 Sessions are conceived as entry-level primers, often given by the same IIW veterans year after year, on various aspects of the digital identity landscape. They are designed to give participants a solid base from which to engage fully with the rest of the programme. 101 Session topics this year included OAuth2 101, UMA 101, OpenID Connect 101, with DIF’s own Chris Kelly and Karyl Fowler (Transmute, DIF Steering Committee) presenting an <a href="https://youtu.be/GWszMWmSLSQ">SSI 101 session on Self-Sovereign &amp; Decentralized Identity</a>.<br></p> Governance &amp; Ethics<br> <p>Informing the whole framing of this technical revolution is a broader, more conceptual sea change. Ever-popular themes for discussion include the ethical underpinnings of decentralized identity, and the increasing awareness of potential pitfalls.</p><p>The contours and workflows of identity in the digital age are largely molded by government regulations around privacy, security, and their historic interest as one of the main issuers of identification documents. For this reason, analyses of policy tendencies and direction are in close dialogue with the design of products and infrastructure, which has long been a hallmark of this particular unconference.</p> Ethics &amp; Equity <p>Identity veteran Adrian Gropper led an indefatigable series of sessions each focused on an interlocking important concern about how identity technologies change how we understand, exercise and protect fundamental human rights across a variety of systems with Human Rights Impact of Identity Protocols. Privacy, a pillar of the decentralized identity movement, got discussed in terms of the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/pimdl-v1-final-html/">Kantara Report</a>, at John Wunderlich’s Privacy Enhancing Mobile Credentials session.</p><p>User choice, data portability and consent also sparked lively discussions with Adrian Gropper and Alan Karp’s session on Policy Managers and John Phillips’ session on Designing for Consent. The ethics of making any of the above mandatory at DID Ethics &amp; Mandatory Vaccine Passports with Timothy Holborn to corona section?</p> Governance of SSI systems <p>The oversight and governance of the decentralized identity community got plenty of attention, as Open-Source organizations like DIF and ToIP introduced themselves and spoke about the work they facilitate. This discussion continued on the topic of Interop(erability) and where the appropriate venue is to continue this valuable work (Kai Wagner, Andreas Freitag, Hakan Yildiz, Eugineu Rusu). <br></p><p>Decentralized Identity tech also offers exciting new possibilities itself for governance, democracy, humanitarian aid and education, as discussed by Drummond Reed, cheqd’s Alex Tweeddale &amp; YOMA’s Nicky Hickman, imagining what the Future of Governance using these tools might look like. &nbsp;YOMA’s work on an interim <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UGUq6wuTrJH-TCkL7Fzw8cHqcFXMoQwK/edit">Governance Framework</a> in Africa, which is ultimately built on <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Governance+Metamodel+Specification">ToIP’s Governance Metamodel Specification</a>, was examined as one example.</p><p>The ongoing effort by the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition to get Verfiable Credentials (VCs) and trust frameworks recognized within Californian legislation was outlined by Kaliya Young and Ally Medina at Verifiable Credentials Policy Committee - &nbsp;Come Help us Pass a Trust Framework in California, identifying challenges and a path forwards towards greater legal and institutional acceptance for VCs.<br></p> Covid, Health, Travel<br> <p>Corona has been a driving force recently in the decentralized identity space, particularly with regard to health and vaccination records, as well as greatly affecting travel. How decentralized identity tech like smart contracts and DIDs can empower individuals and give them granular control over their health data was tackled in Elias Strehle’s session, entitled Controlling your medical data via DIDComm - discussion and feedback on our system architecture. <br></p><p>Building on this system architecture theme, and the challenge of how to deal with varying forms of data arriving from a variety of sources, was teased out at Semantic Interoperability with Layered Schemas and Semantic Pipelines with Burak Serdar, who invited us to test a live, interactive <a href="https://playground.layeredschemas.org/">Layered schema playground</a> that manipulates and edits the various layers as defined by metadata, and then rounding off by considering the implications of this for the storage of digital healthcare data.</p><p>Linux Foundation Public Health launched the Global COVID Certificate Network in June 2021 to enable interoperable and trustworthy verification of COVID certificates between jurisdictions, based on a global trust architecture. Lucy Yang and John Walker outlined the state of this initiative at Updates on the Global COVID Certificate Network, while they were also joined by Kaliyah Young for COVID Credentials: How to Meet the Market Where it is, to join community leaders of the COVID Credentials Initiative (CCI) reviewing the state of play and obstacles to adoption</p> VC-centric Technical sessions <p>Verifiable Credentials (VCs) were an inescapable topic at IIW33, both following up IIW32’s strong theme of roadmapping adoption of BBS+ signing systems for selective disclosure and more generally educating people about the <a href="https://www.lfph.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Verifiable-Credentials-Flavors-Explained.pdf">4 flavors of VCs</a> and how they interact.</p> Vc tooling and education <p>Sometimes the best thing to do is lead by example, and Kyle Den Hartog presented his Working with JSON-LD - Best practices and improvements (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16OTHsmxk_WQsbTfbIGkBUadpryMcSEeR/edit#slide=id.p4">DECK</a>) along with proof of concept code (<a href="https://github.com/kdenhartog/context-integrity">GitHub</a>) to demonstrate how handling JSON-LD data can be done elegantly. As a strong theme at the last two IIWs was that LD-VCs have a steep learning curve and require a 90-degree turn in many approaches to credentialing and data exchange, this will surely be remembered as one of the most useful and educational sessions of the conference.</p><p>At An Extended LDP-BBS 2020 and ZKP-LD Playground, Dan Yamamoto &amp; Kazue Sako dove even deeper into the operation of BBS+ protocols and zero-knowledge proofs. The tagteam recently forked Mattr’s BBS+ LD implementations and were presenting on strategies for handling the “multiple blank node” problem, a common stumbling block in signing over flattened graphs. Attendees were invited to a<a href="https://playground.zkp-ld.org/"> ZKP LD playground</a> to test their approaches.</p> Updates from the OIDF/DIF collaboration: <p>Kristina Yasuda, Torsten Lodderstedt started us off by considering generally Open ID Connect for SSI, examining some potential benefits, and comparing the typical OIDC flow to a more SSI-led Self-Issued OpenID Connect Provider (SIOP) model. Kristina and Torsten returned, this time joined by Oliver Terbu and Tobias Looker, to give us an insight into the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a> work towards a protocol suite for SSI at their session on VC Issuance using OpenID Connect, while considering the potential of the OpenID protocol and how it operates with existing frameworks luke FIDO 2 or Microsoft and Apple’s authentication methods.<br></p><p><br></p> Verifiable Credentials versus Mobile Driver’s Licenses (mDL) <p>Andrew Hughes (Ping Identity) did a series of sessions on Mobile Driving License AND Verifiable Credentials laying out the basics of mDocs (mobile driver's license) as currently released, including the OIDC/web transport specification, and how the data model and protocols could co-exist and whether they should. Discussion here was predominantly about <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO 18013-5</a>, a new ISO standard designed to primarily specify a driving license data models, protocols, and security models, which has led to renewed interest in digital forms of electronic ID (eID) credentials issued by and closely regulated by state identity authorities.</p> VC adoption vectors <p>No new technology can get off the ground without some consideration about how and where it gets adopted and implemented. Trinsic’s Ben Crockett kicked off with an overview of the global playing field, in his Global Verifiable Credential Adoption session. Newly-minted DIF members <a href="http://cheqd.io">cheqd</a> presented Payment rails, customisable commercial models and decentralised governance for SSI, which gave Fraser Edwards &amp; Alex Tweeddale a chance to examine roadblocks, in particular the lack of commercial models, in the adoption path for SSI models and payment systems. They rounded this off with cheqd’s vision of <a href="https://blog.cheqd.io/the-internet-identity-workshop-how-to-make-ssi-work-c3f2fe35b5c6">being the one to bridge this divide</a>.</p> The Universal Registrar and Friends <p>Longtime DIF insider Markus Sabadello introduced the IIW community to DanubeTech's new commercial offering <a href="http://godiddy.com">GoDiddy.com</a> (based squarely on two of DIF's oldest work items, the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver</a> (and <a href="https://uniregistrar.io/">Universal Registrar</a>), following the classic "hosted service, open-source self-hosting option" formula; DanubeTech also gave additional technical sessions about these work items. The Universal Resolver Work Item was recently folded <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/universal-resolver-calls-wrapup/">back into the main DIF Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a>, where work continues. Markus was joined by Azeem Ahamed and Cihan Saglam to discuss DID Registration Architectures more generally, discussing considerations for working with CRUD methods while remaining architecture-neutral<br></p> Other Technical Sessions <p>Sam Curran led a session on-boarding interested community members to the protocol work being organized within and on top of DIDComm. The session was named Fantastic DIDComm Protocols, and How to Write Them because the focus was on DIDComm protocols as a <a href="https://didcomm.org/">community-driven toolkit</a> where sub-protocols and extensions are contributed organically by users, and users discuss design issues and implementation issues with one another in a forthcoming User Group, which provides an “outer circle” to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm Working Group</a> (which will continue on after the completion of the v2 specification to manage the iteration of the DIDComm and the related protocols in an IPR-protected venue).</p><p>The DIDComm reference implementations Session with Alex Scherbakov and Vyacheslav Gudkov gave newcomers to the space a crash-course on DIDComm v2 and DID:Peer, while extolling the virtues of reference implementations for emerging specifications. They also illustrated how basing these implementations on established libraries is important to ensure interoperability with a live <a href="https://github.com/sicpa-dlab/didcomm-demo">DIDComm demo</a>.</p><p>DIDComm was one primary use-case but not the only possible use case discussed by Oliver Terbu and Alen Horvat in a session called “LibP2P as transport layer,” which explored the possibilities of the DIDComm mediator networks and other lightweight infrastructure crucial to SSI systems being spun up in a peer-to-peer way. The <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p library</a>, which came out of the <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> stack for decentralized storage and has found a lot of adoption in blockchain for other peer-to-peer applications and communication transports, could end up being crucial as more infrastructure moves out of centralized clouds and into more organic distributed systems.</p><p><a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189992/Persistent+Compute+Objects">Picos</a> (persistent compute objects) are DIDComm-enabled agents supporting SSI. Picos, DIDComm, and Decentralized SSI Agencies from Phil Windley explores the potential of these microservices, aligned with many of the design goals of decentralized identity, and how they could function as nodes for a scalable Internet of Things (IoT) model.<br></p> DID AuthN WG without DIDs <p>Surprisingly, one of the best-attended sessions at this IIW wasn’t about the DID/VC stack at all, but rather about the Ethereum stack so central to the work of Consensys, Affinidi, Ceramic, and many other DIF members. As part of a <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum/">grant</a> from the Ethereum Foundation and in collaboration with the Ethereum Name Service (a registrar for linking ethereum addresses to a DNS-like record system), Spruce has been been driving a design process for Sign-In With Ethereum informed by community calls to harmonize how relying parties within the Ethereum community request an “off-chain signature” to log into services and create sessions. Both chairs of DIF’s DID Authentication WG (which has not been holding regular meetings while focusing on the Authentication aspects of the DIF/OIDF specification work) have been participating, as have DIF members Ceramic; <a href="https://login.xyz/">work is ongoing</a> and an alpha release will be available soon.</p> User Journeys &amp; Product Thinking <p>Strategies For Bridging to Next-Generation Identity Systems (from the bottom up) from David Schmudde outlined some potential solutions to e-commerce challenges using VCs, OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC). Conversations and topics arising at each IIW often make a reappearance at a later session, and Phil Wolff’s UX: continuing the mid-2021 IIW UX conversation, revisited a UX design session held at IIW32 in April of this year. A unified tech framework ideally needs to be complimented by a common visual language, as well as a standardized way of describing the tools and processes involved.</p> Devices &amp; users <p>Considering end-users’ experiences and which devices they use to access new technology is also incredibly important. To this end, IIW co-founder Doc Searls, along with Joyce Searls and Johannes Ernst hosted User Stories for the VRM Intention Byway. <a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">The Intention Byway</a> presents an alternative vision for how buyers and sellers in a decentralized marketplace can reach one another with their offerings. Bridging Digital and Physical to Make Identifiers Identify by Liam McCarty discussed both the technical challenges between varying device types, while underscoring the need for consumer, community and business interest in decentralized tech to attain widespread adoption and trust.<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explosive-growth-smart-homes-internet-135745356.html"> IoT and Smart Homes add to the growing number of entities online</a> that will need an ‘identity’, and digital assistants as mediator for ‘communal computing was outlined by Chris Butler at Is the smart home a dictatorship, co-op, or homesteading?</p> Organizational Bread-breaking <p>At Time is Running Out - Get to Market: revenue, costs and who pays for what, Kimberly Linson argues that without a convincing business case, adoption of new tech may be slow or even stall, and the financial cost of implementation needs to be borne by someone. Phil Wolff hosted VC Metaphors - Containers and ? to discuss how we can agree on a common language around this emerging technology and how it can be easily presented to policy-makers, customers and businesses alike. In a similar vein, Kaliyah Young used two separate sessions dedicated to Explainers Needed to host an open discussion about where the knowledge or vocabulary gaps are around decentralized identity tech, and how and where we should fill them. The huge number of ideas to come out of these sessions will provide a wealth of informational content for the sector, important for making it cohesive and accessible.</p><p>Karim Stekelenburg, James Ebert and Timo Glastra used Taking the adoption of SSI to the next level to discuss how this conversation also needs to extend to developers, who may not necessarily already be involved in the digital identity space. Ample documentation, open-source communities and extendable functionality of frameworks were just some of the resources name-checked to make the sector welcoming beyond the enthusiasts and dedicated groups seen at spaces like IIW. Illustrated use-cases, specifically one based on Aries and written in JavaScript was highlighted for using familiar, stable and well-documented APIs to improve accessibility. <br></p> Other User-Centric Data Orgs <p>Lisa LeVasseur, at Identification Minimization and other Respectful Tech Principles, explored how decentralized identity solutions can offer increased security, privacy and anonymity. The discussion centered around minimizing user data collection, under the umbrella idea of ‘respectful’ tech design principles, as outlined by the <a href="https://ooqc943yvdw4abzes1q1ezta-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/intro-me2b-spec-iis-101321.pdf">Me2B Alliance’s Attributes for Respectful Me2B Commitments</a>. Lisa returned with Scott Mace to introduce attendees to the IEEE P7012 working group at Privacy Signal Standard Update (<a href="https://standards.ieee.org/project/7012.html">IEEE P7012</a>), the standard for machine readable personal privacy terms. Again, Lisa shared a framework out of the Me2B Alliance to illustrate how P7012 can matter in the arc of a digital relationship, such as between an individual and a web site.<br></p> ToIP <p>Judith Fleenor presented an Introduction To Trust Over IP, introducing <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a>, and reviewing their first year as part of the digital identity community, focussing on not only the technical questions around decentralized identity, but also accountability on the legal, business and social impact layers. Neil Thomson gave an overview of one cluster of related work items at ToIP entitled VCs Meet Reality: Custom VC Evaluation with Privacy that went into the weeds on the nuances of progressive disclosure and privacy considerations of complex, real-world use-cases involving sensitive personal data requiring consent receipts and the like. This work was partly done in the context of the Brussels-funded <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/essif-lab/">ESSIF-LAB incubator</a> project, which allowed European startups (many of them DIF members) to collaborate on privacy and regulatory compliance issues specific to the European context.<br></p> Next Steps <p>Many thanks and much praise to the dedicated team at IIW for running a virtual event of this scale, and providing a virtual venue for such vibrant exchanges and discussion. As always, the conversations at IIW are like games of jump-rope: you can jump in and out at any time with a little tact and coordination. Many of these conversations happen at DIF, or have touchpoints with DIF that give periodic updates at DIF meetings, and the upcoming DIF Face-to-Face in early 2022 will include major updates from many of these. In particular, DIF’s <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/productmanagers">community of practice</a> for Product Managers and UX professionals is actively seeking discussion topics and presentations to keep the momentum going between IIWs and DIF F2Fs, so do <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/groups">join the mailing list</a> and reach out if you’d like to discuss product ideas, user stories, and UX quandaries. As always, the best way to keep up-to-date, gain insight and learn-while-doing is to <a href="https://identity.foundation/join/">get involved directly</a> with the open-source decentralized identity community.</p>

<p>GHP Guardianship Blog<br>John Phillips and Jo Spencer</p>



 Does international travel only ever involve independent adults? 



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need for trusted sharing of verifiable data and the use of digitally-enhanced credentials. Check-in apps may or may not be a temporary requirement whilst we get on top of the pandemic, but the need to present a combination of tickets, visas, identity “documents” and vaccination certificates has always been a challenge for travel and other scenarios. The more you have to show, and the more complex the rules that need to be applied, the more complicated it becomes for all involved. The need to “open-up” safely and support domestic and international travel, as vaccinations roll out widely, gives us the opportunity and need to consider how best to build trusted travel information sharing solutions based on global standards, open software and governed participants and rules.</p>



<p>One of the realizations and perspectives resulting from nearly 2 years of work on guardianship (for minors or adults who need care) is that our societies and economies are not made of independent adults alone, and yet that is all too often an implicit assumption in the way we design and build solutions using digital interactions. Having come to this realisation, we now see this challenge everywhere that digital solutions and interactions are proposed. We need to consider how best to provide support for dependent minors and adults and their guardians in travel, as we should for all affordances in human life.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://lnkd.in/gfwuM-qi">Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint</a> is an international effort of more than 120 people from many organizations and countries. A few months ago, we (Jo Spencer and John Phillips) were asked by chairs working on the Blueprint to write an addendum for guardianship to consider how travel for accompanied and unaccompanied minors and adult dependents might best be enabled with digital health and travel passes.</p>



<p>After several months of work, incorporating the team from the Sovrin Guardianship Working Group and others, with valuable insights from several airlines and people working with International Air Transport Association (IATA), the Guardianship addendum is ready for formal publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can download the&nbsp;<a href="https://live-trustoverip.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GHP-Guardianship-Addendum.pdf">Addendum PDF</a>&nbsp;directly or find it on our&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/deliverables/">Tools &amp; Specifications page</a>.</p>



<p>The GHP Blueprint provides a comprehensive framework for the processes of registration, credential construction and travel planning catered to the use of digital and physical verifiable credentials. However the first release doesn’t cater for supported travel and the resulting process and credential implications.</p>



<p>Travel by accompanied and unaccompanied dependents is all too often not considered by designers – it’s not part of the ‘normal’ flow. A minor consequence of this is poor journey experiences and inconvenience for the carers and their dependents, the major consequence is that it exposes vulnerable people to exploitation and travel companies to risk and liability.</p>



<p>The addendum looks to add value into the GHP Blueprint in the consideration of supported travel. It uses the approach and “mental model” developed within the Sovrin Guardianship Working Group and articulated in the ESSIF-Lab Framework&nbsp;<a href="https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-pattern-list">Mental Models</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The expectation expressed in the addendum is that as travel restrictions are eased, we will see a large up-tick in family travel and hence addressing the need for parents holding digital and digitally-enabled credentials was worth addressing. During the development of the addendum it became obvious that existing processes and practices followed by airlines and others are often informal and most written considerations are aimed at the specific case of travelling minors (rather than travelling dependent adults). The use of digital credentials would need to be able to add levels of trust into the process of registration-departure-travel-arrival and provide practical enhancement and efficiencies, without creating a burden. Current transit processes are generally not focused on providing proof of guardianship statuses, even for unaccompanied travel scenarios.</p>



<p>Applying the developed models of guardianship, using the flexibility of Verifiable Credentials and the trusted mechanisms of sharing VCs, can provide the ability to add guardianship credentials into the travel process (or not) without breaking the existing approach and complicating the technical details defined in the Blueprint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In future releases of the Blueprint, we’ll look to incorporate considerations of supported travel and guardianship throughout the Blueprint. For now, the addendum provides an overview of the implications and insights into how accompanied and unaccompanied travel scenarios can be enhanced, efficient and trusted.</p>

  <p>Currently available technology enables global trade to become fully digital. To support this, technical standards must be created, and rules and legislation must be harmonized internationally. Public administrations are to invest in digitalization to the same extent as those trading and also the numerous service providers around trade. The outcome will be promising,  but one success factor is close collaboration between the various players.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bpb.de/nachschlagen/zahlen-und-fakten/globalisierung/52543/entwicklung-des-warenhandels">volume of globally produced goods and services</a> has approximately doubled in the past 30 years and trade has more than tripled. Many areas of production and trade have been digitized, but in the absence of a universal approach to digital networking, siloed systems have been implemented, creating countless ‘digital islands’. Data is still transferred between the participants’ computer systems on printed documents or as unstructured PDFs. This burden is caused by the lack of interoperability and needs to be overcome, if the potential of digitalization is to be fully leveraged, and to change processes to become safer, more reliable, more sustainable and less expensive. Addressing this challenge would also support preventing criminal or dubious business practices, such as trade-based money laundering, fraud or sustainability claims which are difficult to verify. It will also serve to make trade finance a great deal more accessible to SMEs and so help to close the so-called ‘trade finance gap’ and would also spur sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>Over the same period of time, the past 30 years, information and communications technology has developed very dynamically. While home computers were expensive in the early 1990s and mobile phones were luxury goods, smartphones are now the global standard. Almost all of the performance parameters of these handheld computers exceed those of the supercomputers of the 1990s at drastically reduced energy consumption. The miniaturization and integration of circuits now allows networked sensors and actuators to be connected to machines and everyday objects, which are also becoming increasingly available everywhere. This is the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). Machines ‘talk’ to each other and also interact via smartphones, wearables or voice commands with humans. Ubiquitous computing has become a reality. Data processing can now happen everywhere, at all times and for all purposes!</p>
<p>Again, over the same period, internet and <a href="https://www.dstgb.de/Publikationen/Dokumentationen/Nr.%20148%20-%20Mobilfunk%20-%20Gestern%20-%20Heute%20-%20Morgen/Doku_148_mobilfunk_030518.pdf?cid=6eo">mobile networks</a> have developed just as rapidly. While the focus at the start of digital mobile communications was still on voice transmission, this is now a marginal quantitative event, accounting for less than 1% of the data volume generated in the networks. Data transfers predominate, connectivity speeds and data amounts per month are being sold, the call minute has become obsolete as a billing unit. High quality mobile networks have been commissioned on a global scale. <a href="https://gulfnews.com/special-reports/how-satellites-could-revolutionise-high-speed-internet-for-the-unconnected-know-the-benefits--and-risks-1.1623153273647">Satellite constellations</a> are being put in the sky and will complement mobile networks to entirely close existing connectivity gaps. Every point on the earth’s surface will be networked with high bandwidth and low latencies. Production facilities in Germany, copper mines in Zambia, container ships in the middle of the Pacific and aircrafts flying over China or Brazil will as a result become participants in a continuous data exchange. </p>
<p>This data exchange, running everywhere, at any time and for any purpose can be called ubiquitous networking. Through combining ubiquitous computing and ubiquitous networking, endpoints for human interaction with processes modelled in software become available everywhere. Also machine to machine interactions, more precisely between the software processes running on them, become available everywhere and at any time.</p>
<p>Decentralized business networks, DLT, IoT, AI</p>
<p>The administration of foreign trade takes place within a multitude of systems, most of which are operated in the data centers of trade participants and their service providers. Paper or paper substitutes with poorly structured data are still used in most instances to transfer data between systems. A PDF file is an example of a paper substitute. Although this file is generated and transmitted digitally, it often only replaces the slow mail delivery and does not readily support programmed end-to-end processes. Also the providers of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have insufficiently addressed this challenge so far. Although datasets can be exchanged between the ERP systems of sellers and buyers, this scenario seems to lack technical standards or “neutral ground”. Often data transmissions entail a legal background, for which time stamps are desired along with a legally binding signature. The development of <a href="https://www.tradefinanceglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Periodic-Table-WTO-TFG-DLT-Trade-2020.pdf">distributed business networks</a>, featuring a certain degree of decentralization and being located between ERP systems may close this gap.</p>
<p>In the future, decentralized business networks will serve as orchestration means for most complex business processes between stakeholders and service providers. Business interactions related to financial services, logistics services, insurance, customs clearance, inspection certification, certifying origin and other required services can be undertaken within these distributed systems. Required data will be entered into and retrieved from these networks. This will obsolete re-keying of data and data quality will increase as a consequence. For most service providers in the supply chains, decentralized networks may become the primary point of sale. </p>
<p>Generally, the networks are underpinned by a distributed ledger, which restricts system entries to consensus based append only mode, on the basis of predetermined, programmed rules. This creates ‘technical trust’ and will allow the automation of cross-organizational business processes on an unprecedented scale. Smart contracts determine the agreed rules and defined procedures for business processes in code and will be programmed across company boundaries.</p>
<p>A number of technical standards and protocols already exist for exchanging data between different networks, the participants’ back-office systems and the environment’s IoT data sources and sinks. Others are in the design stage and are being developed. The end-to-end use of ISO standards and compliance with United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) <a href="https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/tf_recommendations">recommendations</a> is becoming a prominent quality feature of trading systems. Certification of the standard conformity of these systems may become a service. Extensive data permeability between the networks is the goal, and zero configuration scenarios may become a possibility through standardization. Efficient access to data facilitates the use of artificial intelligence alongside prescriptive and predictive analytics. Use cases could be around fraud deterrence, meeting regulatory obligations without effort, and enabling promising big data based applications. Paper as a means of data sharing will be considered old fashioned and eventually become obsolete. Or even suspicious. But how will the wet ink signatures look like in this new world? How will a data transfer or a data based transaction become legally valid?</p>
<p>Digital identities</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">Digital identities</a> for organizations, people, objects and software processes will be means to grant access rights to numerous systems and networks and to the transactions managed on them. Directory services, which today assign role based access privileges in software systems, and regulate access to organizations' resources and services, will gradually be replaced by external services for digital identities, and so migrate into the decentralized space between the companies. Roles and privileges will in this way be exposed in a programmable and verifiable way to the outer world, into a fabric of digitally rendered services. </p>
<p>In simple terms, a digital identity consists of one <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">identifier</a> (or many) and several <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials</a> attached to it. Both components have been extensively standardized by the W3C. As the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a company’s globally unique identifier it will serve well as root of an organization’s identity. The verifiable Legal Identifier will allow to amend the LEI by verifiable credentials, some of which can grant an organization’s employee access to transactions in third-party systems. The verifiable credentials granting access or certifying facts are digitally signed by those granting or certifying, and hence programmatically verifiable by the stakeholders of the respective transactions by means of software processes This can therefore take place  automatically, reliably and audited.   </p>
<p>An example from the field of digital identities illustrates this: To process a letter of credit, a bank will need to access several business networks in which the purchase order, commercial invoice, bill of lading and certificate of origin are all digitally recorded. The access rights to the respective transactions in these third-party systems will be transferred into the bank’s digital identity as a set of verifiable credentials as soon as the buyer specifies in a B2B-network or letter of credit network that the bank has been commissioned to issue the letter of credit pertaining to the transaction. The bank may then delegate the access right to these datasets to its employees involved in the process, by transferring a corresponding verifiable credential into their personal digital identity. This will allow the bank’s employees or even the bank’s software autonomous processes to act on their behalf.</p>
<p>The transaction conducted by means of a digital identity relies on an X.509 certificate, which is part of a chain of trust that ends at the trust root. The authorization and authenticity of the transaction carried out by these means is cryptographically guaranteed and is likely to be covered in Germany by the eIDAS implementing act and the legal directives issued for this purpose. Equivalent regulations in non-European legal areas would be necessary and should be asserted, produced and enacted.</p>
<p>Creating network effects</p>
<p>Similar questions about ‘statutory congruence’ arise when using electronic records for trade documentation. Little progress can be made if the use of electronic records for bills of lading and consignment bills is legally admissible in the exporting country, while the importing country enforces a fallback to expensive and slow paper processes for legal reasons. The legal basis for doing business in globally strung networks should be standardized. In 2017 the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) presented a proposal for national laws to be adapted, the <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records">ML-ETR</a>, i.e to cater for globally harmonized legislation on the transfer of property titles securitized in negotiable trade instruments.</p>
<p>The vision of an internet of trade also requires considerable joint efforts on a technical level to become a reality. Technical standards ensure interoperability and should be jointly developed and also deflated where several existing standards compete for the same purpose. A technical commercial language of uniform vocabulary, semantics and syntax is desirable as it would significantly ease, cheapen and accelerate the interlinking of the multitude of systems and networks. An example is the core business vocabulary in the <a href="https://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/docs/casestudies/gs1_epcis_source_to_shelves.pdf">EPCIS standard from GS1</a>.</p>
<p>Trading parties and their service providers, such as banks, insurers, logistic service providers and inspectors are facing major changes. These will impact internal IT and process landscapes, qualifications of employees involved in trading processes and products offered. Public administrations and customs authorities should play a leading role in this process and ideally set a global course. <a href="https://peppol.eu/about-openpeppol/history-of-openpeppol/">Peppol</a> is a European example for this.</p>
<p>The ICC has taken up the role as a global convenor of the numerous standardization bodies working towards these goal. The <a href="http://dsi.iccwbo.org/">ICC Digital Trade Standards Initiative</a> has started operations in mid 2020.</p>
<p>The changes will be so sweeping that even large organizations and enterprises will not be able to make a difference on their own. To create a network of networks and realize the full potential of  network effects, all parties must cooperate in a coopetion effort. COVID-19, besides being a regrettable misery for many, has worked as an unprecedented accelerator for global digitalization efforts.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>World trade will become almost entirely digitalized and networked in the course of the next decade. Siloed systems and paper-based documentation are becoming increasingly sidelined and will soon be deemed in arrears. From the convergence of different technologies, a nervous system of the world economy is emerging and is about to be woven with ever increasing density.</p>
<p>The ability to participate digitally in commercial trade is becoming critical and requires companies to embrace new processes and skills. Public administrations should seize the opportunitiy and rapidly progress their digitalization efforts and promote technical standards. Global cooperation among the large variety of stakeholders around trade is required.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> are two of the popular open source repositories that can help propel development of decentralised identity products and services. Aries is a toolbox of several blockchain-agnostic repositories that allow for trusted online peer-to-peer interactions based on decentralized identities and verifiable credentials. The project grew out of work that was happening in Indy to create technologies for managing decentralized identity. Aries was moved to graduated status by the TSC in February 2021. Indy graduated in 2019 and provides a specific blockchain purpose-built for identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seeing the growth in interest for these two projects, Hyperledger Foundation has partnered with member company <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> and its team of deeply experienced developers and architects to develop this free, multi-course curriculum to help developers and architects gain a deeper understanding of decentralized identity, with a deep dive into Aries and Indy. Registration and preparation information can be found on this <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/events/Workshops">Workshops page</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These two four-hour, beginning level hands-on workshops provide opportunities to install and run the Indy and Aries components just like you would if you were making a real Indy-based network or Aries-based application. They introduce the necessary Git repos as well as how to use the Indy Command Line Interface (Indy CLI), run the Aries toolbox and create and issue a verifiable credential. They also introduce some current projects using Aries and Indy to help you accelerate your understanding of decentralized identity and build the skills necessary to successfully make changes to the underlying code with hands-on guidance to develop your own projects.</p>

<p>Neil Thomson – QueryVision</p>



 Terms 



<p>PII/SD – a broader capture of personal data to include Personally Identifiable Information (<a href="https://piwik.pro/blog/what-is-pii-personal-data/#what-is-personally-identifiable-information-(pii)?">PII</a>) and (personally) Sensitive Data (SD). Examples: medical or financial records or location history</p>



 Introduction 



<p>Several problems currently remain unsolved in the ToIP stack and SSI in general, which appear a natural fit for a digital equivalent of a “Notary public” as a trusted independent agent (or agent/agency), which may be a combination of human and computational services.</p>



<p>In the SSI book scenario, “Alice sells the car to Bob”, the transaction is completed between Alice and Bob directly. They individually deal with car financing, payment, ownership exchange, and license transfer themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This paper builds on that scenario with “Bob buys a house from Alice”. A home purchase is an example of a more complex, real-world transaction. In the non-SSI world, it typically involves formal agreements and can require personal guarantees, exchanging PII through a Lawyer or “Notary Publique/Public Notary”.</p>



<p>A Notary acts as a trusted 3rd party for both Bob and Alice. The Notary’s duties include ensuring documentation is complete, issues are resolved (state of the home/property), creating a sale contract, doing various searches and registration updates, overseeing fund transfers, paying taxes, etc.</p>



<p>The rationale for working through an SSI version of a home sale is to explore how to structure online transactions in a privacy-preserving manner while preventing the following scenario:</p>



  A Financial transaction between individuals fails– Alice agrees to a financial transaction with Bob to provide a service via a direct person-to-person peer-DID (“contextual” identities) connection with some VC/proof exchange to establish trust, but otherwise avoiding the exchange of PII or root identity.  Bob accepts payment from Alice, then dissolves the relationship by tearing down the communication channel, wipes any record of Alice or their own contextual identity (peer DID), does not provide the service and when eventually found by Alice, disputes the agreement.  



<p>As a side benefit, this scenario also explores the Digital Notary role as a transaction assistant, acting as a trusted delegate of both Bob and Alice.</p>



 Problem 



<p>The direct Bob/Alice interaction model of “Alice sells the car to Bob” was intended to show that SSI interactions can handle real-world transactions. The example includes a person-to-person transaction using DIDS that includes a car as an SSI entity in its own right, with its own independent identity and related records.</p>



<p>Given that base, how does SSI handle the more complex day-to-day transactions, including inter-personal and person-to-organization transactions?</p>



<p>Online Transactions and the ability to negotiate – Currently, a standard way of handling online interpersonal transactions is via a service like PayPal. The problem is that the individual frequently has no control over the transaction “contract” nor the ability to negotiate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A case in point is buyers and sellers using PayPal as a transaction broker, where “Legal Agreements for PayPal Services” primarily protects PayPal vs. Buyers, Sellers or the actual money transfer.</p>



<p>This problem is resolved in “human space” via agreements negotiated directly or through a 3rd party, including penalties or holdbacks (or performance bonds).</p>



<p>Privacy – Bob and Alice are most likely strangers who, for most interactions, only need to establish contextual identities, with trust established for the current context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In human space, transactions that can result in (financial) harm (such as selling a home) require bank-level KYC level identification verification.&nbsp; This is required to reach either party should terms and conditions in a contract not be met or damages sought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As was debated at IIW 33, you only have complete control of your personal data (and privacy) if you don’t interact with anyone or anything, in person or digitally.</p>



<p>The human space solution is to interact via a mutually agreed trusted 3rd party.</p>



<p>This also serves to address the problem for Bob and Alice, that they may not be aware of all the tasks that are required in a transaction that does not result in injury to one or both parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What could a digital, SSI version of the human space solution look like?</p>



 Requirements for the Solution 



<p>Buying and selling a house has potential complications which could financially impact the Buyer or Seller. So the overall requirement is to protect the buyer and seller through:</p>



  Ensuring that all financial and non-financial issues related to the property and home are known and transparent to the Buyer and Seller  That the parties in the transaction MUST be identified to a bank-level “know your customer” to ensure complete transparency and accountability, including that:&nbsp;  The Seller is, in fact, the owner and is authorized to sell  That there are guarantees, with enforcement, on redressing financial and physical problems with the home and property after closing the sale  That the Seller will be paid, in full by the Buyer  That the Buyer is entitled to purchase the property (citizenship requirements)    That the privacy and PII/SD data of the Buyer, Seller (and any other parties) must not be disclosed to other parties in the transaction.  That any disputes about the property or home are known and addressed  That all documentation, taxes and other process steps are completed correctly.  The buyer and seller do not personally have to be experts on houses, properties, or a house sale’s legal ramifications.  That the solution provides a framework for semi or fully automating the transaction process, contracts and other agreements, that provides for governance as an integral component  Provide a mechanism for different jurisdictions to provide a model and mechanism for organizations to incorporate governance controlled contracts, terms and conditions    



 Solution(s) 



<p>Note: &nbsp;For this discussion, a Digital Notary is a service that spans the range from a human Notary Public with digital tools to a fully computational home sales process and contracting service, realizing a complete service as a “smart contract”. The same is assumed of other services in this Scenario.</p>



<p>The following is proposed:</p>



<p>An independent agent (Digital Notary) works as a trusted intermediary for parties in transactions within a framework that allows for partial or complete automation of the transaction workflow, including support for formal or “smart” contracts.</p>



<p>The Digital Notary is a first-class SSI entity that can establish communication channels with the parties and supporting services, including establishing trust and exchange of Verifiable Credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Digital Notary (software components) and its collection of related services must be subject to, and certified by, governance authorities (or delegated agencies) for the jurisdiction(s) in which they will operate.</p>



<p>A Digital Notary may collect “know your customer”/”Foundational Identity” PII data from the Buyer and Seller to do the following:</p>



  Bind the buyer and seller to terms and conditions in the house sales contract such that they can be “reached” in the case of a dispute or where “performance bonds” (or equivalents) are required  Obtain delegation from the Buyer and Seller to collect and verify with financial institutions, land registry and financial Lien registries any and all documentation concerning the potential pitfalls about the buyer, seller and the house/property. This may include delegation to make and receive payments on behalf of the parties.  



<p>The current practice for non-digital house sales provides PII (root identity class information) of the Buyer, Seller, and potentially other parties in the sales contract/agreement and related “paperwork” distributed to the Buyer and Seller.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this proposal, privacy can be increased through the Notary holding (in trust) the only copy of the complete documentation, including full PII/SD information. The Buyer and Seller receive depersonalized copies.</p>



<p>Disputes on the transaction would be via the Notary of record or delegated to another trusted 3rd party (Lawyer, Courts, etc.) through formal means.</p>



 



 Solution Workflow 



<p>Bob and Alice have agreed that Bob will buy Alice’s house. They have collected the required information and are ready to proceed:</p>







  Bob and Alice create a session with a Digital Notary (DN) Service, where a list of qualified Digital Notaries which can handle house sales in their (governance) jurisdiction(s) are presented. Both parties work to select and agree on the Digital Notary (DN) used.  The selected DN is instantiated and establishes connections with Bob and Alice, establishing trust as a licensed, governed entity using standard SSI workflow.  The DN establishes the specifics of the house sale transaction from Q &amp; A with Bob and Alice, including collecting initial information on the property and house, which may be in the form of documents, claims or VCs, plus any other pertinent information to establish the “components” needed to complete the transaction and any conditions.  The contracts (and other document types) made available for the transaction are from a jurisdiction governed repository of templates, including contract types, terms, clauses, permissible conditions,&nbsp; plus supporting documents, executables, etc. that are required (and optional) and are compatible with the transaction.    The DN requests the required level of identity and delegation authority to complete the transaction  Bob and Alice are requested to provide “know your customer” level (aka “foundational”) identities and grant access to the underlying identity claims to the DN, which the&nbsp; DN verifies with the Issuer(s)  Bob and Alice are asked to delegate the DN the rights to act on their behalf for specified financial transactions, access to house-related information registries and to update or create new entries with specified agencies and services. This may involve using Foundational class identifiers.    The DN interacts with Bob and Alice to collect information to determine the clauses, terms and conditions of the (house sales) contract, which may be constrained by the jurisdictional template(s).  This may include resolution of issues with the property (roof repair) prior to the sale or conditions (a property survey is required, which must not find blocking issues)    The DN may construct manual or automatic logic on steps taken (and verified) and payments to be exchanged as part of the contract  This will likely include the handover of the property and occupancy steps for the new owner (Bob).&nbsp;  This may include holdbacks or performance bonds on post-sale warranties for work done or unknown defects    Bob and Alice (crypto) sign the contract.&nbsp;  The contract is now in execution mode, which will use notifications and events with Bob’s and Alice’s personal Agents to inform each of the obligations, confirm completion of clauses in the contract with completion events from those Agents.  Bob and Alice get copies of the contract(s) and other documents related to the house sale where Bob, Alice and any other parties are de-identified.  The DN registers the contract within the DN trust framework with all the related documentation, including “foundational” identities of the parties    On completion of the contract (including expiry of any conditions, the DN archives the house sale artifacts and “dissolves”&nbsp;  Access to the house sale archive for non-performance of the contract or later discovered issues may be requested with a jurisdiction controlled court order or equivalent.    



 Pros, Cons and Vulnerabilities 



<p>Pros</p>



  Provides an SSI “pattern” of allowing PII information to be used in any interaction between parties in a manner via an independent entity that uses has mechanisms to capture and use PII without disclosure outside the transaction.  Provides a mechanism to immediately use human notaries (or equivalent) as the “glue” using SSI to connect with Bob, Alice and all the related services and agencies in an SSI transaction contract, with the ability to migrate over time to fully automated digital notary/SSI contracts, starting with simple online purchases and moving to more complex contracts over time  



<p>Cons</p>



  “Smart” Contracts are just in their infancy and primarily focused on crypto-coin and currency exchange to non-crypto, so how they evolve is speculation.&nbsp;  



<p>Vulnerabilities</p>



  Unknown – However, the intent is that all the components of the “contract framework” and “digital notary” concepts are that all the components would be 1st class SII components and subject to the same rigour and security standards.

 Why Trust Over IP is even more profound than we thought 



<p>by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielhardman/">Daniel Hardman (LinkedIn link)</a>, Principal Ecosystem Engineer, SICPA</p>







<p>I became involved with the self-sovereign identity movement in 2016, and I have been lucky enough to witness many of its milestones — the finalization of the VC and DID specifications, the launch of Sovrin and Hyperledger Indy, the advent of production deployments and serious interoperability, the invention of peer DIDs and KERI and BBS+ credentials, the implementation of the exciting communication technology now known as DIDComm…</p>



<p>In this list of exciting events, I’ve long felt that the launch of the Trust Over IP Foundation deserved special mention. I coauthored two of the first public papers about the Trust Over IP Stack. For me, the vision represented a first and best effort to articulate and focus the principles that undergird all our decentralized and self-sovereign ambitions.</p>



<p>Yet despite this enthusiasm, I’ve recently realized that I’ve been underestimating our potential impact. Surprising but true.</p>



<p>In January of 2021, I joined SICPA to work on the problem of digital cash — not cryptocurrency, but bits-and-bytes versions of a euro, a dollar, a rupee, a real. Of course I took with me all my love for decentralized identity, DIDs, credentials, governance, and peer-oriented protocols.</p>



<p>As I learned this new problem domain, I saw a need for undergirding trust infrastructure; digital cash and its ownership needs verification, much like verifiable credentials do. That meant I needed primitives analogous to identity’s verifiable data registries. I also saw the need for identifiers and connections, and atop them, rich protocols — similar to the credential-oriented ones I’d appreciated in identity, but now having a monetary focus. For example, we obviously needed a protocol for buying and selling, another for negotiating a price, another for putting a value in escrow… And of course the big vision for cash was a trustworthy ecosystem, quite similar to the ones I’d been advocating in identity.</p>



<p>The more I pondered, the strong the parallels and resonances became. Permeating this new stack of value was the same need for governance, the same need for privacy and oversight, and the same opportunity to reset power imbalances by emphasizing peers and decentralization.</p>



<p>I looked at the Trust Over IP stack diagram with fresh eyes. And I saw that, like the funny English expression, “Can’t see the forest for the trees,”&nbsp; perhaps our perfectly reasonable focus on the details of credential implementation was distracting us from a profound generalization that the name of our foundation, “Trust Over IP,” had suggested all along:</p>



<p>We are about trust over underlying tech primitives — not just about identity or credentials.</p>



<p>It is true that credentials are a profound innovation — one that we’ll need in a digital cash stack, for sure. And it’s also true that identity is a key enabler of trust. But money taught me that these key components are&nbsp;necessary, not&nbsp;sufficient. With money, I also want verifiable mechanisms like escrow and insurance. That’s true even (perhaps especially) when I’m transacting with a faceless stranger.</p>



<p>I also pondered what perspective I might have acquired if my job shift had been to the problem of fake news, or education, or supply chain integrity, or healthcare, or academic and scientific research. And I realized that the same realizations would likely have surfaced from any of those perspectives. Each of these fields aspires to a dynamic and ecosystem. Each needs an expansive catalog of composable workflows that produce and consume trust. Such workflows depend on secure connectivity, which in turn derives from data formats, cryptographic algorithms, public commitments, and so forth. They all need governance, from the top of the stack to the bottom. And in all cases, trust is an emergent property of combining these patterns carefully.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That led me to imagine a revised version of the Trust Over IP stack:<a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1MrxTKHywQ5qO6gAYvCOvvQVC5KBNHpoEzF0uWwzEv2c/edit"></a></p>







<p>This isn’t actually much of a departure from our original formulation; it just focuses more on the principles that characterize a layer, rather than on the specific mechanisms we might assume. And I hope it lets us see the forest for the trees. </p>



<p>I don’t know that my diagram is all that profound or unique to me. Other smart people in the space have begun saying similar things, and perhaps we’ll find a different way to explain that works even better. But I do think that experience and time are having a beneficial effect on all of us. The Tech Stack Working Group of Trust Over IP Foundation recently began debating a revision to our framing of this stack, and I am thrilled to hear many profound generalizations emerging from the discussions. The world desperately needs trust over IP, and I think we’re well on our way to delivering it.</p>

<p>While predictive analytics (PA) has been proliferating over the last decade in a range of sectors, PA systems are, <a href="https://rd4c.org/articles/why-we-need-responsible-data-for-children/index.html">as noted by UNICEF and Govlab</a>, “often designed with (consenting) adults in mind, without a focus on the unique needs and vulnerabilities of children.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020 and 2021, The Engine Room conducted research in partnership with UNICEF to look into predictive analytics specifically in relation to children. Among other questions, we asked:&nbsp;</p>



  How is PA currently being used or proposed in contexts that impact or will impact children?&nbsp;  What are the potential benefits and risks involved?  What should be taken into account when deciding on how – if at all – to implement PA systems in these contexts?&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>We looked at how PA has been or is being used or planned in a number of relevant sectors, including health, education, social welfare and child protection.&nbsp;</p>

 Research findings: Where predictive analytics might impact children, special caution is needed 



<p>Our research posits that it is crucial to carefully consider the ethical implications of predictive analytics specifically as they relate to children, who as a demographic may have distinctly different needs (as reflected in the <a href="https://www.unicef.org/child-rights-convention">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>). Since machine learning algorithms are typically trained on the data of adults, assumptions based on the behaviour of adults are baked into these models –&nbsp;meaning that their outputs may well be inappropriate for children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our research found that, despite limited evidence of PA’s effectiveness in real-world implementation, it does have potential to offer benefits in certain contexts, if responsibly deployed in a way that builds upon contextual knowledge and local expertise, and if used as just one stream of information in combination with these others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Potential benefits might include, for example, improving humanitarian crisis management or enabling more efficient resource allocation, and these benefits best reveal themselves at the population level – that is, in using predictive analytics with population-based outcomes where children are indirectly impacted. It’s worth noting, however, that though the benefits of PA are often touted as increasing efficiency, the evidence in relation to this claim is not comprehensive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When PA is used to generate predictions that are targeted to individual children, the potential risks are significant. Our research showed that using PA in this context requires comprehensive risk mitigation measures to avoid causing harm; these are outlined in the report. In this context in particular, predictive analytics should only be understood as part of a much broader assessment to support decision-making –&nbsp;that is, PA should never be relied upon as the sole source of information for making decisions about children’s lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hope our findings serve to support both decision-makers and those already working with PA systems, and ultimately contribute towards ensuring the protection of children’s rights throughout.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 23,748,232 NFTs on the OpenSea marketplace, each with a different level of quality and technical construction. Some are secure, made for longevity, and technically sound. Many are not – subjecting buyers to hacks, rug pulls, broken images, and missing metadata. </p><p><a href="https://www.fungyproof.com/">FungyProof</a> surfaces this information for users so they can make more informed decisions and improve the quality of their existing NFTs. <a href="https://app.fungyproof.com">Check out the Fungyproof app</a> to discover information about your own NFTs!</p> Not all NFTs are created equal <p>When purchasing NFTs, most users simply look at the associated digital asset (art, song, ticket, etc.) or the creator before pulling the trigger. But an NFT is much more than a single boilerplate Smart Contract. NFTs actually consist of custom logic for token trait randomness (e.g. Chainlink VRF) and Smart Contract properties, linked metadata, linked assets such as images, animations, audio files, 3D files, and more. The manner in which Smart Contract logic is written and external assets are linked varies with each NFT. Combined, these properties make up the NFT’s “Mint Conditions.”</p><p>Want to learn more about how an NFT is constructed? Read this <a href="https://learn.fungyproof.com/">NFT Primer</a>.</p> Token grading can inform NFT buyers <p>Most users are flying blind when purchasing or selling visual media NFTs today, often using subjective measures or social signal to influence buying behavior. With Fungyproof's grading algorithm, users can start to make more informed, data-driven decisions for more intelligent purchasing. Grading a token consists of running the token’s “Mint Conditions'' through the FungyProof grading algorithm. This algorithm is a weighted, score-based system, which assigns a grade based on the technical implementation of a token as well as a few other factors such as energy usage (gas efficiency) and asset retrieval latency. For a full list of the 30+ data points checked, take a look at the <a href="https://fungyproof.notion.site/Grading-Rubrics-f348a35f8b164bb3ab97dec36e6a6e08">grading rubric</a>.</p> Cases protect and enrich your NFT assets  <p>FungyProof Cases enrich existing NFTs, digitally binding to the asset to protect it and help it stand out from the rest. The first set of cases will enrich your NFT by backing it up to decentralized storage solutions (IPFS + Filecoin). This immortalizes the NFT’s Mint Conditions and improves asset and metadata storage, thus improving your NFTs grade. Future cases will enable other enrichments such as carbon offsets, Arweave permaweb storage, attaching encrypted data, earning achievements, and more.</p><p>Cases are a new token standard developed by the Fungyproof team, known as a Non-Fungible Enrichment (NFE) that enables NFTs to own other NFTs. With cases, you can associate new data to your token without having to wrap or otherwise affect it. Once an NFE is bound to a token, any data associated with the NFE, such as the token backup, is then tied to the NFT provably and immutably.</p><p>The team's first set of cases include the standard FungyProof Case and the limited Neon Cases, which support ERC721s and many non-standard NFTs (CryptoPunks, CryptoKitties, etc.). Over time, more cases will launch with new functionality, rarities, and support for more chains. Cases are currently only available on FungyProof, but in the future the team plans to offer the option to "unbind" Cases, allowing users to remove and trade them on marketplaces. </p> Making data accessible through an open registry <p>The registry is a public service that allows anyone to view all of the information about an encased NFT. This information includes a token’s Mint Conditions, bound enrichments, provenance, and more. The registry is accessible through the FungyProof app, API, or on-chain through an NTF’s case via the enrichmentURI contract property.</p><p>The registry is designed for a few use cases:</p>  Buyers purchasing an NFT who want to browse the registry for NFT grades to select one that has been selectively upgraded  Sellers who want to ensure their NFTs are high quality and technically sound for the long-term and protect their reputation  Marketplaces that want to add information for their users    Using Ceramic to Append Metadata  <p>The glue between the FungyProof Case and the NFT registry is the Ceramic metadata. When binding a Case to an NFT, FungyProof needed a mutable metadata storage solution. Changes that occur to the NFT's data -- such as grading, new enrichments, and transfers – need to be appended to the metadata creating a historical audit trail. </p><p>Using Ceramic, FungyProof has created one of the first implementations for dynamically appending metadata to an NFT over time. When you bind a case to an NFT, a metadata file is also generated and stored with it. As the NFT and its value changes, or new enrichment types are available, the Ceramic stream can be updated. This opens the door to unlimited possibilities for enrichable NFTs.</p> What's next for Fungyproof? <p>FungyProof is just getting started. Future plans include new types of enrichments, browser extensions, marketplace and wallet integrations, economic incentives for community contributions, and more.

<p>New Zealand cybercrime continues to grow with the government cyber incident tracking agency, CERT, reporting a 14 percent increase in scams and fraud in the last quarter.</p>



<p>Fraud awareness this week is important for raising awareness of the potential risks Kiwis are facing with increased online activity.</p>



<p>This just shows how critical digital identity trust is in a world that is rapidly becoming more digital, Digital Identity New Zealand executive director Colin Wallis says.</p>



<p>Secure digital identities are an important foundation for the digital economy and with so much business, communication and purchases happening online it is more important than ever to be able to trust in peoples digital identity, he says.</p>



<p>“Having a secure, privacy-aware and trustworthy digital identity system will be important for enabling the economy. This is why Digital Identity NZ members are collaborating to provide feedback via the submission process on the government’s proposed digital identity framework.</p>



<p>“We are also hosting a large conference in May next year on digital trust, bringing together experts in digital identity, privacy and security, which are all needed to create trust.”</p>



<p>Digital Identity NZ is a not-for-profit member association in the NZ Tech Alliance. Wallis says it is working to create a country where people can express their identity using validated and trusted digital processes.</p>



<p>Identity fraud has increased a staggering 86 per cent in the last financial year, while investment fraud has risen by 37 per cent over the same period.</p>



<p>A total of 79 percent of New Zealanders are concerned about the protection of their identity and use of personal data by organisations, according to survey commissioned by Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ).</p>



<p>Walls says there is public concern and some frustration about how their personal data is shared online. Change in behaviour is occurring with 73 percent of Kiwis claiming to have made a change to their online behaviour because of privacy concern.</p>



<p><a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2019/05/Digital-Identity-Yabble-Benchmark-Research-Infographic-May-2019.pdf">Their recent survey</a>&nbsp;found 85 percent of respondents said there was a lack of transparency, as well as concern in having to share data with so many organisations.</p>



<p>Additionally, only one in 20 New Zealanders have a fully satisfied experience with registering new accounts. Nine out of 10 New Zealanders find the idea of being more in control of their digital identity appealing.</p>



<p>For further information contact Colin Wallis on 021 961955 or NZTech’s media specialist Make Lemonade NZ editor-in-chief Kip Brook on 0275 030 188</p>

 SIOP special calls have been making a steady progress, Following are notable changes introduced to a SIOP v2 spec 
 Introduced DID Resolution method as part of RP Registration metadata section. When SIOP request is signed, RP’s <code>client_id</code> can be a DID and SIOP can obtain a key signing the request from RP’s DID Doc. The rest of the RP metadata must be obtained from a <code>registration</code> parameter in the SIOP request. 
 Introduced Dynamic SIOP Discovery metadata option. When RP has pre-obtained SIOP’s issuer identifier, it can use OpenID Connect Discovery to obtain SIOP’s metadata, namely <code>authorication_endpoint</code>. When Dynamic discovery is used <code>iss</code> in the ID Token in SIOP response must be a SIOP issued identifier and NOT <code>self-issued.me/v2</code> 
 OIDC4VP specification has been stable with minimum changes. Work on a spec how to issue VCs using OpenID Connect (which has an option to use Credential Manifest) is also happening, so stay tuned!

  <p>As we’ve heard from our partners throughout this interview series, the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative in Africa has been a success for all involved. It is, however just the start. It has been a model showcase for how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across the world can gain ‘financial inclusion’ through Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs). The World Bank’s definition of financial inclusion for businesses is that they ‘have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs – transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way’.</p>
<p>While financial inclusion for SMEs across the world is a desirable end goal in its own right, it is also important to recognize that the impact of this initiative – when it is rolled out more broadly across multiple emerging markets – will go far beyond the SMEs and financial institutions involved. It has the potential to positively impact the broader economy by significantly strengthening the global supply chain. Let me explain how these two concepts are linked. </p>
<p>The lack of a universal identity prevents SME growth and overseas trade</p>
<p>SMEs make up 90% of businesses globally. However, without legal credibility or a way to officially prove their identity across borders, many of these businesses struggle to access finance, form partnerships or trade overseas – particularly for those in developing markets where a higher risk factor may be perceived. Banks are prohibited from offering them trade finance without undergoing painstaking and costly Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering checks – processes which are hampered without a verified identifier. As a result, the gap between the demand and supply of global trade finance is growing and has now reached <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-11/global-trade-finance-gap-widens-to-1-7-trillion-on-covid-19">$1.7 trillion following a 15% rise since 2018</a>.</p>
<p>The launch of the business identity initiative has illustrated this problem with a focus on Africa. However, it’s important to remember that this is a global challenge faced by SMEs and banks all over the world. And as a result, countless SMEs are prevented from engaging within the global supply chain – whether that is because they can’t invest, scale, or form the necessary partnerships – due to one simple factor. An inability to prove who they are. </p>
<p>The LEI supports expansion of global supply chains and traceability of suppliers</p>
<p>As we’ve seen in Africa, a profusion of benefits arise when financial institutions facilitate the issuance of LEIs to SMEs by becoming <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/validation-agents">Validation Agents</a>. Which is why financial institutions should now be motivated and encouraged to use this model to deliver a globally recognized identity to their SME customers. Not only will it give SMEs broader access to financial services – a clear benefit to banks – but it has the wider impact of enabling SMEs to apply for trade finance and establish contractual, regulated agreements with banks, payments networks and trading partners. The result will be greater participation in domestic and international markets and a bolstered flow of inbound capital, which can then be used to further fuel the market’s economic development. </p>
<p>Imagine a world where millions more SMEs were able to scale and trade, with trust, internationally. How many more – both in terms of volume and diversity – products and services would be available to us all through the global supply chain, and what would the impact of increased competition be on service and price? It’s an aspirational thought and one which lies within reach. By opening up cross-border trading opportunities to more SMEs, the LEI can be seen as a critical – and immediately available – tool in the drive to create a much broader and more competitive supply chain for businesses worldwide. Additionally, using a global open identifier would help bring transparency to supply chain relationships – a critical component of sustainable supply chain monitoring and reporting.</p>
<p>What’s needs to happen next?</p>
<p>All change has to start somewhere – and the success of the first iteration of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative in Africa shows what great potential lies ahead for the global supply chain and subsequently the world’s economy if financial institutions across more countries take up the reins and drive it forward.</p>
<p>The result of greater financial inclusion among SMEs will be a strong, more diverse, transparent and competitive global supply chain ecosystem. Consequently, we could expect to see the positive impact – financial growth and prosperity – across all types of companies across all regions of the world. </p>
<p>Now that the initaitive has been set in motion, GLEIF invites more financial institutions to explore the benefits of becoming a Validation Agent to support – and derive the benefits from – broader financial inclusion among SMEs. GLEIF continues to seek dialogue with governments, NGOs, banks and other stakeholders interested in either expanding the LEI initiative across Africa or in replicating the model in other developing countries. We’re here to help.</p>

<p>By Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Editor’s Note: This is the final blog posting covering the 2021 FIDO Developer Challenge. We invite you to read the previous blog posts to learn more about past stories:</p>



  <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/announcing-the-fido-developer-challenge-for-developers-across-the-globe/">Announcing the FIDO Developer Challenge for Developers Across the Globe</a>  <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-developer-challenge-welcoming-teams-to-the-implementation-stage/">FIDO Developer Challenge: Welcoming Teams to the Implementation Stage</a>  



<p>This year’s FIDO Developer Challenge reached a successful conclusion, with a ceremonial event during <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/event/authenticate-2021-conference/">Authenticate 2021</a> in Seattle. The recorded <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-developer-challenge/">video</a> of the ceremony is available now, and we’re pleased to share more detailed stories of the three finalists as well as the rest of the teams that made it to the final stage.</p>



 Leaders of the Top Three Teams. 



<p>Gold Winner – Lockdrop</p>



<p>Lockdrop, a company based in Toronto, Canada, strengthened their document transfer service using end-to-end encryption with WebAuthn as an MFA authentication option. The team wants to help businesses and people exchange larger datasets easily and securely, a problem that is prevalent across most industries and results in people falling back to insecure and/or archaic forms of data transfer such as email, fax, CD-ROMs (yes, CD-ROMs!), and USB sticks.</p>



<p>Silver Winner – Shaxware</p>



<p>Shaxware is a company located in Tokyo, Japan. They created a Proof of Concept, fashioning the Japanese National ID Card (My Number Card) into a FIDO roaming authenticator. They proposed to extend WebAuthn by using the external IC card as a primary digital certificate.</p>



<p>Bronze Winner – SoundAuth</p>



<p>SoundAuth is the team name for a company (Trillbit) based in Boston with R&amp;D staff stationed in India. This team built a FIDO MFA solution that leverages data over sound technology to provide a seamless user experience while eliminating the need to rely on an additional hardware token or internet connectivity.</p>



<p>From the initial pool of applicants, fourteen teams from eight different countries (Canada, France, India, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, USA, Vietnam) competed throughout the FIDO implementation stage – including the three finalists detailed above. There were also many concepts that did not make the top three yet have shown compelling ways to leverage the strength and usability of FIDO Authentication. Examples include:</p>



  a FIDO and AI-based remote test proctoring system (India)  a web payment system, leveraging FIDO-based digital wallet (France)  a FIDO-based online note-taking apps for developers (Vietnam)  FIDO-based VPN access (South Korea)  FIDO and AI-based assisted technology for visually impaired people (South Korea)  



<p>Thanks and final thoughts</p>



<p>The 2021 FIDO Developer Challenge was made possible by the support and active engagement from the event <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-developer-challenge-our-sponsors/">sponsors</a> – who not only helped fund the event operations and prizes, but gave hands-on feedback and guidance as judges. Thanks also to the W3C and WebAuthn community for guidance and support through the FDC Discord Channel – it was great to see so many people weighing in to help these development teams.</p>



<p>We were very pleased to have built off of our prior developer hackathon efforts in Korea, to have brought the challenge global, and to have added&nbsp; a focus on public APIs.

<p>When I first came across <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a>, I was still a student at the University of Applied Sciences in Utrecht. I had never contributed to open source, and only minimally understood how the process of contributing and maintaining even functioned. Now, only two years later, my company (<a href="https://animo.id/">Animo</a>) specializes in building SSI solutions using Hyperledger Aries and other SSI technologies, and I am one of the core contributors to a lot of the open source libraries built on top of it.</p>



<p>In this blogpost I’m going to share what it’s like to be a maintainer for the Hyperledger Aries project. You’ll learn how you can start contributing and maybe even set yourself on a path to becoming a maintainer.</p>



 The ecosystem 



<p>Hyperledger Aries provides standards and protocols focused on holding and exchanging verifiable credentials, but it is much more than that. Hyperledger Aries provides the foundation for peer-to-peer interactions, exchange of verifiable credentials and secure messaging. It provides standards through the so-called <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Aries RFCs</a> and has open source implementations in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go">Go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx">Rust</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">.NET</a>.</p>



<p>Aries uses <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0005-didcomm/README.md">DIDComm</a> for a secure messaging protocol, but <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDComm is a lot more than just a way to exchange credentials</a>. Once you start getting a sense of the enormous potential of DIDComm, it’s difficult not to get excited. Aries provides you with an agent that helps you manage your digital interactions, just like your browser helps you interact with the web.</p>



<p>At <a href="https://animo.id/">Animo</a>, we’re leveraging Aries at the core of almost all of our projects. We contribute to several open source frameworks, develop applications on top of these frameworks and build end-to-end solutions using verifiable credentials. For example, we recently started a pilot with the <a href="https://odyssey.org/past-editions/odyssey-2020/public-safety-and-security/inclusive-safety-communities">Centre for Emergency Control Room Innovation</a> that leverages DIDComm for secure communication and exchange of location between the emergency call centre staff and a qualified volunteer. Although we are involved with several Aries frameworks, we have a particular expertise in (and fondness for) Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ).</p>



<p>We use AFJ for most of our projects. We’ve contributed a lot to it because, simply put, we saw the potential of the framework and someone needed to do the work to get it there. Being a maintainer of a project means more than just contributing code.It means you’re responsible for the overall direction and vision of the project. Maintainers concern themselves with the roadmap, the place of the project within the ecosystem and coordination of working group efforts and calls. On a more operational level, there’s also a lot of reviewing pull requests, addressing github issues, answering questions on Rocket.Chat and writing documentation. If this sounds time consuming, that’s because it is. But putting in the effort is essential to creating long lasting, structurally sound code that can be freely used by anyone to build amazing things.</p>



<p>Contributing to a project hosted by Hyperledger, specifically, means you get a lot of the needed infrastructure other projects might not have. There is a wiki for meeting notes, a Zoom account for our meetings, GitHub repos, unlimited CI minutes, a chat platform, and assistance from the Hyperledger staff when needed.</p>



 Becoming a maintainer 



<p>I can recommend that every developer be involved with open source, and every company invest in open source software. Open source software provides the foundation for almost all software in the world, and is essential for a world where self-sovereign identity becomes a standard.</p>



<p>Besides, working on open source software can be a really good learning experience. You get to work with some of the greatest minds of the industry on the future of digital identity. Maintaining and contributing to Hyperledger, and open source in general, has been really valuable for me. There is something magical about how open source works, and how we can work together towards a shared goal, even if you’re halfway across the world.</p>



<p>I can imagine that sounds a bit intimidating. Luckily, you don’t have to start out this way. You can start the way we all do, by quietly listening to working group calls until you find something you want to participate in. Once you decide you’d like to become a contributor or a maintainer, you’ll find that communities will be happy to help you get started.</p>



<p>Here are some of my personal tips to get involved with a Hyperledger project. I’ve used the AFJ community as an example throughout.</p>



  Attend working group calls – Working group calls are the perfect place to introduce yourself and show your ambition to contribute to the project. This is also the place to stay up to date on the current and planned work of the project. (<a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ARIES/Framework+JS+Meetings">AFJ Meetings</a>)  Get familiar with the codebase – Even though it can be daunting and hard to make sense of a project at first, it is important to get familiar with the project. You should make it as easy as possible for maintainers to review your initial PR and get it merged! (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript">AFJ Repository</a>)  Answer questions on Rocket.Chat – Help other people get started with the project and answer their questions! You learn a lot by finding answers to other people’s questions. And also don’t hesitate to ask questions yourself. There are a lot of people with very specific domain knowledge eager to answer your questions. (<a href="https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries">Aries Channel</a>, <a href="https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-javascript">AFJ Channel</a>)  Look at open issues – Knowing what to work on can be complex when getting familiar with a new project. Github issues often describe missing features or bugs, which can be a great way to find the first item to work on. In AFJ, we currently have more than 70 open issues,&nbsp; all waiting for someone to pick them up. (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/issues">AFJ Open Issues</a>)  Read about the topic – Read about the topics that underpin the project. For SSI, I recommend reading the <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self Sovereign Identity</a> book. If you’re ready to get a bit more in-depth, I recommend to start reading the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Aries RFCs</a>. These are fundamental for contributing to any Aries project.  



<p>My best advice is to experience it yourself. Even the smallest pull request is valuable to a project and can give you the confidence to keep going. And, before you know it, you’re the maintainer of a project yourself.</p>



<p>If you have any questions, or if you’d like to make contributing to open source software your job, you can reach me at timo@animo.id. We’re always looking for motivated and ambitious people to join our team and are always happy to help new contributors get started.</p>

<p>The breakthrough innovation of the Ethereum blockchain is the enablement of smart contract execution in a decentralized way, which opened the door for decentralized applications interacting with digital assets. The next major step on the roadmap of web3 will be the bloom of decentralized social networks and the blockchain-based Metaverse. A decentralized social graph protocol to describe the relationships between users and entities will be a critical backbone for this. </p><p>Using Ceramic, CyberConnect is building a new decentralized social graph protocol. This critical piece of web3 infrastructure is blockchain-agnostic and openly accessible for developers to build decentralized social networks and other apps in the Metaverse.</p><p>Want to get the latest updates on CyberConnect? Follow the team on <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberConnectHQ">Twitter</a>!</p> The downfalls of today's gated social networks  <p>The rise of global social network giants has empowered the centralized tech cartels to misuse user data, infringe on user privacy and impose censorship. As reported after the investigation by Cambridge Analytica, Facebook collected social graphs and personal profiles from millions of users without their consent, with the end goal of fueling more directed political advertising and inappropriately profiting from the personal data of their users. The current landscape of web2, filled with centralized social networks, has deviated from the principle of the World Wide Web. Namely: to enable the decentralization of information on a large scale.</p> CyberConnect Protocol: A user data solution for Web3.0 <p>In the early web2 era, there were isolated social graphs for each social application, but people quickly got tired of registering and redeclaring friends on every new site. Thus, the optimal solution at that time was to consolidate all the relationships onto one app, i.e. Facebook. As soon as Facebook gained mass adoption and realized the value of the social graph it owned, the company swiftly changed its policy and shut down its API to protect itself from future competition. The initial promise of a shared social graph was broken, and the door to the world's largest social data was closed for good.</p><p>To combat this paradigm, CyberConnect aims to empower Web3 social networks to be decentralized, censorship-free, and self-sovereign. CyberConnect is proposing a new decentralized social graph protocol, a web3 infrastructure that is blockchain-agnostic and openly accessible to all. The goal is not to build a one-for-all social network. Instead, CyberConnect welcomes all web3 citizens and dApps to contribute to the protocol, building social networks and Metaverses collaboratively.</p><p>As the next stage of web3 begins to take shape, the CyberConnect protocol will offer decentralized options for how data is used and perceived with the following features:</p>  Publicly accessible: the decentralized social graph data will be publicly accessible for all dApps as an add-on feature for developers to leverage user connections to grow beyond their existing user base  Self-sovereign: while the social graph data is open to all, only users have full control over their own social graphs (i.e., adding, deleting, and updating the connections)  Blockchain-agnostic: instead of tying to a single blockchain, the protocol is created for a multi-blockchain ecosystem to support connections from anywhere  Decentralized governance: inspired by Ethereum’s vision, CyberConnect will commit to the ideals of shared security, permissionless systems, and decentralized governance, which will shape the roadmap and development of the protocol   Token-incentivized: in order to support the long-term development of the CyberConnect Protocol, CyberConnect will introduce a token-incentivized model in the beginning stage to fairly reward all contributors who help bootstrap the social graph  Options for privacy-preserving features: CyberConnect knows some users care about their connection data more than others do, and as such is actively researching the technical solutions for enabling privacy-preserving features in the future  Play socially with friends and see your rank in web3 games Using Ceramic to build a decentralized social graph database  <p>At the heart of CyberConnect is a tamper-proof data structure that efficiently facilitates the creation, update, query and verification of user-centric data. Long-term data retention on CyberConnect is guaranteed through Ceramic’s blockchain anchoring and a custom data pinning service. </p> Multi-account identity <p>CyberConnect also uses Ceramic and the platform's 3ID DID method to ensure that users are authenticated and authorized to write data streams. The 3ID DID handles secure key rotation (different from blockchain private key) so that users are not at risk of losing their transactional private key and thus access to all their corresponding social data. 3ID DID also supports cross-chain, multi-wallet use cases so that users can connect accounts into a seamless identity structure, ensuring CyberConnect is future proof.</p> Identity index for composability <p>CyberConnect also uses IDX, Ceramic's identity protocol, for easy user data indexing and integration with other protocols and applications. IDX provides a unified interface for application developers to query data within an user's namespace, both within and outside of CyberConnect.</p> Universal social graph index <p>CyberConnect also sources and curates social graph data from platforms including Foundation, Rarible, and even web2 platforms such as Twitter. The aggregation of all this data creates a rich and unique user experience. For example, imagine a social platform that is able to provide every user with an automatically generated "suggested user list" based on who they have bought NFTs from historically, who they've transacted with (sent/received tokens or NFTs), and who they follow on other platforms like Rarible and Twitter. This is dramatically different from most new social platforms being created in today's centralized architecture, in which you start from scratch at every opportunity. </p><p>CyberConnect also indexes higher dimensional network data, which allows it to generate new connection suggestions based on existing social graphs. This curation and indexing aims to combine both the user-owned publicly accessible social graph with other off-chain data from across web2 and web3 applications.</p>Get content recommendations based on a personal social graph<p>This universal social graph index is exposed to application developers through an API gateway. Developers can easily build a new "instagram for NFTs" without worrying about building and managing the corresponding database to store contact lists and follows. As such, CyberConnect accelerates time to value for application developers, allowing them to focus on content curation and recommendation algorithms based on the social graph data. Similarly, developers can focus on game experience instead of social components, using CyberConnect to import existing friends lists, similar to Steam.</p> What's Next for CyberConnect <p>Beyond the CyberConnect Protocol, the CyberConnect team has also recently announced CyberChat, a trustless, decentralized chat app that helps round out the social ecosystem for web3. CyberChat enables users to log in with a blockchain wallet, create their user profile based on on-chain data, and frictionlessly send chat messages while interacting with the blockchain. With CyberChat, decentralized projects and DAOs can now manage their communities on a crypto-native basis.</p><p>For more information, read the official white paper on the <a href="https://cyberconnect.me/">CyberConnect website</a>.

<p>Updated 18 Nov 2021 with more details about our second community call, scheduled for December 2nd 2021.</p>



<p>As the effects of the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-are-living-in-a-climate-emergency-and-were-going-to-say-so/">ongoing climate emergency</a> amplify, the fight for environmental justice has become more crucial than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While technology is being used to support these efforts, it is also part of the problem: technological ‘innovation’ <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/climate-strike/">is taking its own environmental toll</a>, climate disinformation <a href="https://hkingaby84.medium.com/climate-disinformation-the-threat-to-cop26-3e43094360c0]">flourishes online</a>, climate justice activists are facing increasing digital attacks and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/us-listed-climate-activist-group-extremists">surveillance</a>, and for many of the <a href="https://www.openglobalrights.org/climate-change-and-human-rights/">communities affected the most by the climate emergency</a>, lack of internet access has meant limited access to information about relevant changes, policies and support mechanisms.</p>



<p>The recent emergence of spaces designed to bring together digital rights and climate justice activists – such as t<a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/news/gathering-for-a-sustainable-internet/">he gathering for a sustainable internet</a> and <a href="https://www.appropedia.org/Open_Climate">the Open Climate series</a>, among others – show an increasing interest in exploring how convergence between these two communities could strengthen the work of both.</p>



 New research: exploring connections&nbsp; 



<p>With that in mind, we are excited to announce a new research project <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/upcoming-research-how-digital-rights-and-climate-justice-intersect/">supported by the Ford Foundation, Ariadne and Mozilla</a> that will look at how climate and environmental justice can be centered in digital rights movements and explore some of the areas where digital rights and environmental justice intersect. Specifically, we’ll be exploring what kinds of collaborations between the two currently exist, what challenges these collaborations face, and what opportunities there are for strategic action to achieve goals on both fronts in an intersectional way.</p>



<p>Through our research we aim to develop a set of recommendations for funders to support them in implementing grantmaking strategies aimed at maximising impact in both areas.&nbsp;</p>



 Join our second community call&nbsp;on December 2nd 



<p>We kicked off our research with an initial community call in November, which aimed to discuss preliminary research findings, hear from practitioners working on environmental justice and digital rights issues, discuss challenges, and try to identify opportunities for greater collaboration. </p>



<p>To continue the discussion, we’ll be hosting a second community call on December 2nd from 9-10am EST/ 3-4pm CET. </p>



<p>For this call, we’ll be using a more interactive format, with breakout discussions. Topics will include: </p>



  How does your work address environmental justice and/or digital rights, and how do you want it to?  What kinds of support do you think work at this intersection needs in order to be able to address the urgency of the continued, accelerating climate crisis?  On the flip side, what kinds of tensions and contradictions exist between digital rights and environmental justice, which must be taken into consideration going forward?  



<p>Whether you’re working in either the environmental justice space or the digital rights space or are just interested in the topic, we’d love to see you there. Everyone is welcome!</p>



<p>To register, please email us at hello [at] theengineroom [dot] org.</p>



 We want to hear from you! 



<p>If you’re working at or exploring the intersection of climate justice and digital rights, we’d love to hear from you: please feel free to email us at hello [at] theengineroom [dot] org.&nbsp;For updates on how our research is going, follow us on Twitter @engnroom, or sign up to our newsletter <a href="https://us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=1747fd8a7bf587bd4a215d984&amp;id=53139510a0&amp;e=8a7f1d5bf0">here</a>.</p>

<p>This statement was co-written by DIF and ToIP, it can also be read at <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2021/10/29/a-dif-toip-joint-statement-of-support-for-the-decentralized-identifiers-dids-v1-0-specification-becoming-a-w3c-standard/">ToIP’s blog here</a>.<br></p><p>On 3rd August 2021, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/PR-did-core-20210803/">proposed</a> advancing the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 specification to their W3C Recommendation stage, the ultimate level of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#RecsW3C">W3C standards process</a>, which indicates that the specification as currently defined is technically sound, mature and ready for adoption. This includes the expectation that this will allow for widespread implementation, as well as further development and ongoing evaluation, paving the way for future versions.<br></p><p>Collectively, the memberships of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/#members">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) and the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/about/members/">Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation</a> represent over 350 companies globally who are committed to the development and implementation of decentralized identity and trust infrastructure. Many of these organizations have contributed directly or indirectly to the W3C DID 1.0 specification for one simple reason: the DID layer of cryptographically verifiable identifiers is foundational to the common infrastructure we are building together and on top of; therefore, this spec is an integral part of DIF’s and ToIP’s shared vision for an empowered, secure and interoperable future, and in line with <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/">W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles.</a><br></p><p>As such, DIF and ToIP support the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 1.0 specification becoming an official W3C Recommendation. DID 1.0 represents the efforts of over thirty active W3C Working Group contributors over the past two years— on top of contributions from dozens of others in the W3C Credentials Community Group and its predecessors for several years before that. This is a significant milestone in the digital identity sector. Having common ground for development, particularly in terms of interoperability, allows work to continue with renewed energy and focus. It also mitigates the risk of shifting goalposts, which seriously hinders long-term development, investment, and widespread adoption. <br></p><p>DIDs are a critical part of a technical foundation for the products and activities of many of our members. Many of the implementations in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/#report-by-methods">DID Working Group’s implementation report</a> were developed by engineers and companies who collaborate openly at DIF on points of technical interoperability, and at ToIP on points of policy and governance. DIF also hosts the <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">Universal Resolver</a>, a community project which puts practical intra-DID method interoperability into practice by co-developing a “translation engine” for diverse DIDs with contributions from DIF members and non-members alike. Similarly, other DIF efforts like the <a href="https://didcomm.org/">DID Communications</a> protocol and the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange</a> protocol and ToIP efforts like the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Trust+Registry+Protocol+Specification">ToIP Trust Registry Protocol</a> serve to align a broad range of implementations and ecosystems already building on these standards, laying the groundwork for robust interoperability across ecosystems and diverse families of technologies.</p><p>This specification is the result of half a decade of sustained, broad-based, dedicated work on the part of W3C, DIF, and ToIP members. We acknowledge also the work done by numerous, forward-thinking organizations who have already built working implementations using the provisional specification, thereby laying the foundations of new infrastructures for “identity data”. We believe DIDs will change the course of digital identity by building in better user controls, portability, and interoperability at the lowest possible level, while also offering increased security and simplicity for implementers and service providers. This advancement unlocks new opportunities for our digital lives, and we look forward to leveraging DIDs and other technologies developed in the community to champion a new class of user-first, self-owned digital identity systems.</p><p></p><p>Signed,</p><p>Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) &amp; Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)<br></p><p>October, 2021<br></p>

 Reference Libraries 

<p>Some of our most important work at Blockchain Commons is on specifications that improve the interoperability and resilience of cryptocurrency wallets. Our reference libraries allow developers to incorporate those specifications into their own code.</p>

<p>SSKR Security Review. However, there’s one more thing required before our libraries can be used in production releases: security reviews. Our vision is that third-party developers using our libraries will work with us to contract a security review from a third-party. They can take advantage of all the libraries already reviewed, and then they can increase that selection with a review of their own. Our sustaining sponsor, <a href="https://bitmark.com/">Bitmark</a>, began that process this quarter by arranging a security review for our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir">bc-shamir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">bc-sskr</a> libraries through <a href="https://radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security (ROS)</a>.</p>

<p>The folks at ROS tested our software and noted potential security problems. We then worked with them to close all issues that we felt were a priority. Because Blockchain Commons is dedicated to transparency, we have published the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/reviews/2021-security-review.pdf">review</a> and our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/SECURITY-REVIEW.md">response</a>, which includes a listing of issues that we resolved, as well as those we did not (and why). Thanks to this review, we feel that the <code>bc-shamir</code> and <code>bc-sskr</code> libraries are the first of our reference libraries ready for production deployment.</p>

<p>Project Nayuki Port. We also released a minor new utility library, a port of the Project Nayuki QR library into Swift as <a href="https://github.com/blockchaincommons/QRCodeGenerator">QRCodeGenerator</a>. We’d discovered that Apple’s native iOS QR generation is inefficient for QR codes where individual segments require different optimization. Nayuki does the right thing, by individually optimizing each segment, so we ported it over as a replacement for the native Apple libraries, for use in our own code and by other developers.</p>

 Reference Apps 

<p>Our reference apps provide exemplar use of our specifications (and libraries).</p>

<p>Seed Tool Updates. The release of Seed Tool was one of our big events in Q2. In Q3 we’ve continued that work through two notable upgrades, releasing <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/README.md#version-history">1.1 in July, 1.2 in August, and 1.2.1 in September</a>. Some of the biggest updates included arbitrary key derivation, preset SSKR schemes, and developer functions that make it easier to test out QR &amp; UR-based requests and responses. We also added our first Ethereum support, through the ability to derive Ethereum private keys and addresses from your stored seeds. Our updated <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/Docs/MANUAL.md">Seed Tool Manual</a> describes all of the latest functionality.</p>

<p>QRTool Updates. Seed Tool wasn’t the only reference app to get attention; <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QRTool</a> also received some minor updates in July, though those largely took the form of minor bug fixes. Updating QR Tool to use the Project Nayuki library port will be our next big update for QR Tool, sometime in the future.</p>

 Bitcoin Utilities 

<p>Other utilities make it easier to use Bitcoin and other blockchain and crypto-technology.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Standup Updates. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts">Bitcoin Standup</a> was one of Blockchain Commons’ first releases. It automates the installation of a secure Bitcoin Core setup on a Debian Linux device or virtual machine . However, Bitcoin Core is always changing, requiring occasional updates. Our newest version of Bitcoin Standup, 0.8.0, updates the scripts to work well with Bitcoin Core 22.0 (which made some changes to its code signing).</p>

<p>However, Bitcoin Standup 0.8.0 does more than that. We’ve always imagined Standup as an engine that can install a wide variety of cryptocurrency and blockchain applications, and the new version of Standup offers the opportunity for the first such addition: <a href="https://cypherpunkpay.org/">cypherpunkpay</a>, an easy and accessible server for receiving Bitcoin payments. This addition, though just a starting point, was one of the <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a> projects initiated by our 2021 interns, to offer cyryptocurrency support for activists.</p>

<p>Gordian Server Officially Released. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS">Gordian Server</a> project took Bitcoin Standup as a jumping-off point and offered the same ability to easily install Bitcoin Core on the more accessible macOS UI. Like Bitcoin Standup it’s intended as the heart of a self-sovereign setup, where you can control both your wallet and your server. We released Gordian Server in some preliminary versions in 2020, but we’ve now polished it to improve its stability and ease of use, and have released it as the Feature-Complete <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/releases/tag/v1.0.0">1.0.0</a>. Like our newest Standup release, this version of Gordian Server has also been updated to work correctly with Bitcoin Core 22.0.</p>

 Learning Resources 

<p>One of Blockchain Commons’ goals has always been to improve the developmental understanding of Bitcoin. We also extend that goal to our own releases by working to make our specifications as accessible as possible.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Translations. Our popular <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course</a> has brought numerous developers into the industry. We’re thus thrilled to offer complete translations in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/portuguese-translation/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/spanish-translation/es">Spanish</a>. This enormous amount of work was the product of a number of volunteers, some of whom were also working with us as interns, which means that the <a href="https://hrf.org/">HRF</a> should again be thanked for their support. We hope that these translations will help bring Bitcoin development to the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world, which seems particularly important given El Salvador’s recent move to Bitcoin as a currency. (Learning Bitcoin also enjoyed quite a few minor edits as a result of the translations, as well as updates to include i2p and some recent revisions, resulting in our release of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/releases/tag/v2.1.0">version 2.1</a>; we’ve also got plans for <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/TODO-30.md">3.0</a>.)</p>

<p>New SSKR Docs. Shamir’s Secret Sharing is a critical element of #SmartCustody in today’s digital-assets world, which is why our SSKR library received our first security review. We’ve also been expanding our docs to talk more about how and why to use secret sharing (and why not to). Our newest <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-overview.md">SSKR docs</a> include <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md">Designing SSKR Share Scenarios</a>, which discusses many models for sharing (including all of the default scenarios now found in SeedTool), and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Dangers.md">SSKR Dangers</a>, which talks about why we ultimately prefer multisigs to secret-sharing.</p>

 Building to Specifications &amp; Laws 

<p>Specifications and supportive references are the first steps in bringing new ideas to the industry. To reach their fullest potential, those ideas eventually have to become something more …</p>

<p>DID Standardization. The DID specification, which is currently a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">1.0 candidate recommendation</a> for an international standard, is our next big technical step forward for self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, big centralized companies such as Apple and Google have taken notice and unsurprisingly raised complaints. We’ve offered some support with language and with championing the hard work already done, though the heavy lifting continues to be done by the editors, including Drummond Reed, Manu Sporny, Amy Guy, and Markus Sabadello.</p>

<p>Principal Authority. Many specifications and standards need legal support to reach their fullest potential. Our work in Wyoming has resulted in the state legislature arriving at a legal definition of digital identity that centers on the concept of principal authority. This quarter, we released <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">a paper</a> on how principal authority defines self-sovereign identity, and what the next steps are. (We also presented the paper and testified about it to the Wyoming legislature.)</p>

<p>eResidency &amp; Other Testimony. Overall, we’ve been thrilled to be working with Wyoming, creating some of the first and best laws for supporting blockchains, cryptocurrency, digital identity, and digital companies. In a <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2021/S19-2021092109-01E-Residency.pdf">recent presentation</a>, we urged them to leverage the infrastructure they’ve created into an eResidency program that can extend these benefits to companies worldwide. In other testimony for Wyoming, North Dakota, Texas, and the Netherlands we have provided support new laws for DAOs, updates to GDPR regulations and have advised how to avoid vendor lock-in and future-proof technology.</p>

 Other Future Expansions 

<p>Finally, we’re also looking to the future in other ways.</p>

<p>Ethereum Expansion. As noted, we’ve expanded Gordian Seed Tool to support Ethereum key derivations. We’ve also been experimenting with selling some self-sovereign-identity NFTs to raise funds for Blockchain Commons. Generally, this all demonstrates our goal of bringing many of our philosophies, architectures, and models to the Ethereum blockchain. In particular, we believe that #SmartCustody, and especially SSKR, could help Ethereum, which has a lot of its own challenges for responsible key management, such as the lack of true multisig. If you’d like to support our expansion into Ethereum, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a> and let us know why you did (or watch for upcoming NFT auctions!).</p>

<p>Second Intern Program. Finally, we’ve just completed our second summer’s intern program, and we’re thrilled to have another batch of interns who we helped to introduce to the world of blockchain development and who in turn helped us push forward projects such as our Learning Bitcoin translations and revisions. They also: produced a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Secure-Development-Setup-macOS">secure development setup guide</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Pseudonymity-Guide">pseudonymity guide</a> that offered more support for activists and HRF; developed a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli">mori-cli program</a> for leaving behind your digital assets; worked on creating a stable version of Esplora; and more. Some of our 2021 interns have already gone on to other paid work in the field; we’re looking forward to seeing what they create next!</p>

<p>Thank you, as always, for your interest in Blockchain Commons and the improvement of the entire blockchain field. If you like what we’re doing, we again encourage you to become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">Github sponsor</a> so that we can continue forward with our work of making the industry independent, private, interoperable, and resilient!</p>

<p>As I write my first newsletter to you as Digital Identity New Zealand’s Executive Director, I’m acutely aware that I am familiarising myself with the controls as I operate them. Michael left large shoes to fill, so my feet will have to grow! I’ve been away from Aotearoa a while, so it’s good to be back and appreciate the progress being made. In my time away, I was privileged to lead an international digital identity industry organisation; one of the very few that operate a digital identity trust framework. So, you’ll understand how excited I was to arrive back in time to see the <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_116015/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill">Digital Identity Trust Framework Bill</a>&nbsp;progress through Parliament to its current Select Committee stage.<br>&nbsp;<br>I look forward to joining you on that journey and bringing some learnings from my previous gig along too. I expect it to be DINZ’s key focus these next few months. Stakeholder collaboration is the key to success in the case of Trust Frameworks, so you can be sure that I’ll be looking for opportunities where DINZ can play a role.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would also like to remind the community that nominations for the DINZ Executive Council are currently open. All member organisations&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2021/10/07/executive-council-nominations-now-open/">can nominate a representative</a>. Please help shape both the history and future direction of Aotearoa’s Digital Identity sector by submitting your nomination using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc2vbc4LJwrENW5a6VxGOUhsG2wj9ZQCljN9uyjm9YzwuqXNg/viewform">online form</a>. The deadline for nominations is 5pm Thursday 28 October. Online elections will follow, and the new Council will be announced at our Annual Meeting on Thursday 2 December. If you are a member and would like to attend the Annual Meeting&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/digital-identity-nz-annual-meeting/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=2c3334cb9a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_04_24_COPY_05&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-2c3334cb9a-118146817">please register beforehand</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>As many of you will be aware, the <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_116015/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill">Digital Identity Trust Framework (DISTF) Bill</a>&nbsp;was introduced to Parliament, has had its First Reading and the Select Committee is now accepting public submissions. This is great news and something that industry in general has encouraged and now welcomes. There is no better time to join and get involved in Digital Identity New Zealand to help shape this piece of the country’s tech history.<br>&nbsp;<br>To that end, DINZ received a request from the Department of Internal Affairs to circulate to its primary member contacts some information about the Select Committee schedule and process. DINZ duly did so on October 15th and now wishes to share that with the wider community. Have your say on the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Bill by <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/make-a-submission/document/53SCED_SCF_BILL_116015/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill">making a submission</a>&nbsp;before 2 December 2021.<br></p>



<p>Ngā mihi,</p>



<p>Colin Wallis<br>Executive Director</p>

  <p>All around the world, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the legal documentation that can prove who they are to banks, service providers and other businesses. As a result, millions are struggling to access trade finance and create partnerships, particularly in developing economies. </p>
<p>Following the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative designed to bridge this trade finance gap in Africa, we’re catching up with our key partners to hear their thoughts on how the project will bring about greater financial inclusion for SMEs on the continent and beyond. </p>
<p>Munyaradzi Kamhozo is Account Relationship Manager at NMB Bank Limited, a registered commercial bank based in Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>NMB Bank’s role in this initiative is to act as the Validation Agent, working with the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as the Local Operating Unit (LOU), to issue SME clients with globally recognized digital business identities. Project partners GLEIF, Cornerstone Advisory Plus and Cenfri supported NMB Bank Limited to complete the required qualification process. </p>
<p>The LEI presents a significant opportunity to help close the current trade financing gap and support more SMEs to engage in international and domestic trade. NMB Bank Limited saw that potential, which drew them to the Validation Agent role, supporting its key objectives to create a market leading proposition for its SME client base, foster greater financial inclusion in the region and support the growth and formalization of the Zimbabwean economy. </p>
<p>How could this LEI initiative improve domestic and international trade out of Zimbabwe? </p>
<p>Most Zimbabwean SMEs rely on an international supply of raw materials. At least 80% of our SME customers engage with international suppliers on a regular basis. Currently, however, if an SME in Zimbabwe completes a telegraphic transfer to a supplier based in Europe, the correspondent bank will have to validate the identity of the Zimbabwean business and, without an established form of legal identity, this process can take up to a month.  </p>
<p>The LEI initiative will help by building trust in both the global financial ecosystem and in key supplier relationships. Using an LEI can significantly reduce the time correspondent banks take to validate the identity of the SME, ensuring that they can quickly access key supplies without building up excessive interest on local currency loans which, for SMEs in Zimbabwe, range from 40 per cent to 60 per cent per annum depending on the financial institution. </p>
<p>The benefits of the LEI also apply to Zimbabwean exports. By obtaining an LEI, SMEs can increase their international visibility and credibility with new overseas clients. All buyers must screen new suppliers to validate that they are who they say they are. With an LEI, this process will be faster and simpler than ever before. This will help to create new opportunities for our exporters, enabling them to foster new markets and grow domestic and international trade. </p>
<p>How is the LEI initiative helping NMB Bank compete and/or differentiate itself in the financial services marketplace? </p>
<p>One of the principal benefits of being a Validation Agent is that NMB Bank is now able to offer an entirely new service to our SME clients which allows them to save significant time when partaking in international transactions and opens opportunities to access trade finance, something which none of our competitors can offer currently. Addressing these key pain points will help us grow our client base and deliver an attractive proposition to SME customers. </p>
<p>From a compliance perspective, becoming a Validation Agent meant NMB Bank also had to undertake a comprehensive training program to get us up to speed with GLEIF’s regulatory standards. This has allowed us to realign our internal processes with an international standard of best practice. We can now set the standard for due diligence processes in the region. </p>
<p>By supporting SMEs as part of the Validation Agent role, NMB Bank is also actively supporting the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s National Financial Inclusion strategy, which aims to increase financial and economic inclusivity in the country. </p>
<p>What long-term potential do you see in the LEI initiative, both for banks and SMEs in Zimbabwe?</p>
<p>Zimbabwe, like many African countries, has a sizeable ‘informal economy’. It is estimated that around 80.8% of those employed in sub-Saharan Africa work within the informal sector.  Unfortunately, this means businesses operating in this sector lack the credentials necessary to grow and often find themselves losing money when undertaking cross-border transactions. In the long term, we can see the LEI helping to formalize our economy. With a globally standardized identifier, our businesses can prove their legitimacy and engage in regulated trade, leading to the generation of more money for the businesses and their employees. </p>
<p>We also believe that the LEI will have long term impacts on access to trade finance. SMEs currently struggle to access finance as they are perceived as ‘too risky’ by international lenders. As a result, the current trade finance gap in African stands at $81 billion.  When we apply for credit lines for our SME clients with an LEI, the screening process undertaken by the Development Finance Institutions to identify the applicant will be much simpler, meaning SMEs can access more trade finance, faster than ever before. This will also allow many businesses to be freed from the control of loan sharks as more legitimate lines of credit become available to them. </p>
<p>For banks, in particular, the LEI initiative will help to streamline onboarding processes. By adopting the role of Validation Agent, banks can provide a faster and more efficient experience for new clients by handling the LEI issuance process internally. Banks will also benefit from a simplified approach to establishing automated beneficial ownership systems, in line with Zimbabwe’s national project to do so. This means the initiative will contribute significantly to supporting Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism. </p>
<p>What kind of change in Zimbabwe would you like to see result from broad LEI adoption among SMEs?</p>
<p>Overall, we want to see accelerated financial inclusion in line with Zimbabwe’s National Inclusion Strategy. Broad adoption of the LEI is a big step towards achieving this.  </p>
<p>The formalization of Zimbabwe’s economy as a result of LEI adoption will not only benefit banks and SMEs, but the entire population. At an international level, a formal economy means more taxes are paid, which, in turn, means our government can invest more into key infrastructure projects to support the growth of the nation, improving the standard of living for all. </p>
<p>We’d also like to see a change in the perception of Zimbabwe in international markets. Our national mantra is ‘open for business’. We want to be seen in this way. Currently, we are seen as a risky market in the eyes of international lenders, banks and suppliers. The LEI presents an opportunity to help us overturn this perception. If the world knows who you are, the opportunities will flow in.</p>

  <p>The Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF) is proud of its ongoing transparency initiatives. Namely its open approach to providing unrestricted access to the latest LEI data from around the world with the Quarterly LEI System Business Reports, which are made publicly available free of charge. Through this ‘LEI in Numbers’ blog series, GLEIF aims to highlight key data from the latest report, explaining trends and profiling successes from the global LEI rollout. </p>
<p>The latest report, covering Q3 2021, shows positive growth in the volume of LEIs worldwide. More than 60,000 LEIs were issued in Q3, representing a quarterly growth rate of 3.3%. This steady increase is welcome news as it is common for issuance levels over the summer months to slow. As a result, the total active LEI population is now 1.88 million. </p>
<p>For a further summary of the past quarter’s data, the below infographic contains the key statistics from Q3 2021. </p>
<a href="https://www.gleif.org/thumbs/newsroom/blog/q3-2021-in-review-the-lei-in-numbers/q3-business-report-infographic_final-750x1994.jpg"></a>
<p>In Q3, Iceland was the largest growth market for LEI issuance, with one of the highest growth rates seen in 2021 (30.8%). This is another significant quarterly increase for Iceland. Between Q1 and Q2, it doubled its growth rate from 9.2% to 19%. This regional growth was driven largely by strong competition among LEI issuers.</p>
<p>Aside from growth in new LEI issuance, renewal rates grew across EU jurisdictions (65.5%, up from 65.0% in Q2) and non-EU jurisdictions (63.0%, up from 62.9% in Q2). The average renewal rate of jurisdictions with more than 1000 LEIs globally remained steady. This consistently high level of LEI issuance and renewals across multiple regions is testament to the maturity of the Global LEI System and its increasingly central role in bringing trust to ecosystems. </p>
<p>In Q3, a new issuer was onboarded into GLEIF’s network of Local Operating Units (LOUs): NordLEI. Previously, NordLEI had been operating as a registration agent in the Nordics before adjusting their status to LOU to actively drive greater LEI adoption across Northern Europe. </p>
<p>For the full report which includes further detail on the status of LEI issuance and growth potential, the level of competition between LEI issuing organizations in the Global LEI System and Level 1 and 2 reference data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Reports page. </p>
<p>If you are interested in reviewing the latest daily LEI data, our Global LEI System Statistics Dashboard contains daily statistics on the total and active number of LEIs issued. This feature now enables any user to review historical data by geography, increasing transparency on the overall progress of the LEI.</p>
<p>For further detail, or to access historical data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Report Archive. We look forward to sharing our progress each quarter as we continue to drive LEI adoption in 2021.</p>

				 <p>OKP4 takes on a European dimension by opening an office in Munich</p>
<p>While OKP4 is beginning to deploy its first use cases in France, particularly in agriculture and logistics, the company is now opening a German subsidiary in Munich. This is an opportunity for the company, specialized in the creation and animation of Data Spaces, to take on a European dimension that can be very essential when it comes to data issues.</p>
<p>OKP4 has officially launched its German subsidiary in Munich at the beginning of October 2021, in collaboration with SCE Space Cooperative Europe, founding member of aNewGovernance. OKP4 GmbH, the new subsidiary of the young Toulouse-based company, will be able to deploy OKP4’s Data Spaces offerings on the German market, particularly in agriculture and industry.</p>
<p>The creation of this subsidiary was also an opportunity for OKP4 GmbH to welcome Onecub, another founding member of aNewGovernance, into its capital for their expertise in digital identity management and consent management.</p>
<p>OKP4’s goals in Germany are clear: to establish Data Spaces projects within German organizations, but more importantly, to reinforce OKP4’s position as a reference in Europe about governance and Data Spaces management for organizations.</p>
<p>Emmanuel MONDON and Markus HAUSER of SCE seized this opportunity to organize a real learning expedition with interesting meetings such as: Invest in Bavaria (the development agency of the state of Bavaria), The Bayerischer Bauernverband (the Bavarian Farmers’ Union), and innovation consulting structures such as ARTTIC or EURA AG.</p>
<p>The founders of OKP4 GmbH also met with the heads of the TUM World Agricultural Systems Center (Hans Eisenmann-Forum for Agricultural Sciences) to discuss agricultural data sharing ecosystems and to consider academic collaborations in the context of European innovation projects (Eurostars 3 and Horizon Europe).</p>
<p>The European network of actors working on Data Spaces continues to grow and shows a growing dynamic with even more collaborations and more partnerships. Data Spaces are the future!</p>

<p>Earlier this year a popular vote has rejected a proposed law on electronic identification (<a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/digital-identity-scheme-faces-scepticism-around-data-privacy/46399636"> results </a>).&nbsp; It was however very clear that a new solution has to be found soon as e-ID can be an important enabler for multiple use-cases and accelerate digitalisation of many daily processes for both the individuals and organisations, if done correctly.</p>
<p>Federal Department of Justice and Police (FDJP) has started a <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/zielbild-e-id.html">public consultation</a>, which should inform Federal Council’s upcoming policy decision.&nbsp; A discussion paper “on the target vision for an e-ID” has been <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/dam/bj/en/data/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id.pdf.download.pdf/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id.pdf">published</a>, which explores a number of different options and approaches to the future of electronic identity.&nbsp; Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp; (SSI) has been highlighted as one of the possible options and a number of questions has been raised.</p>
<p>It was a great opportunity for DIDAS to provide in-depth commentary to the proposed vision and contribute our collective ideas and expertise to help make a well informed decision. Our submission (in German) is available <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Stellungnahme-DIDAS-FINAL-V1.0-website.pdf">here</a></p>
<p>So what did we advocate for?</p>
<p>For us, the members of DIDAS, it was crucial to emphasise that the upcoming policy decision will determine the future of digitalisation efforts in Switzerland and, consequently,&nbsp; its position at&nbsp; international level. The authors of the discussion paper have proposed 3 “levels of&nbsp; ambition”:</p>
 
 e-ID ( secure identification option without media discontinuity&nbsp; – e.g. identity card that can be used in the digital world&nbsp; + login) 
 e-ID linked to other state-regulated proofs&nbsp; ( basic electronic identify + cryptographically linked additional attributes – e.g. driver’s license, diploma, COVID certificate, criminal record, etc) 
 Ecosystem of digital proofs&nbsp; ( e-ID is just one credential, other credentials that are independent of the e-ID are possible, government and private bodies can issue credentials&nbsp; ) 
 
<p>It’s very clear to us that only the Ecosystem of Digital Proofs (Level of Ambition 3) represents the actual ambition that is worth pursuing – creation of a true, future-proof and flexible foundation for digital Switzerland.&nbsp; To create such an ecosystem it’s important to adopt the right approach ( principles, technology, governance model, etc) and&nbsp; make sure that the government plays the appropriate role and enables rather than hinders the future growth and success of this ecosystem.</p>
<p>We have made strong argument in favour of focusing on adopting SSI principles and best practices as the foundation for Ambition Level 3.&nbsp; We highlighted and outlined both the advantages that this will bring ,as well as the open questions that still need to be addressed. E.g. on technology and legislation level.&nbsp; We know that SSI is not perfect yet, but we need to focus on the rapid progress that is being made ( as well as contribute to it) in order to create solid foundation that will last for years to come rather than make a short term decision in favour of something better understood but not designed for the ownership and privacy of the data, open ecosystems, transparent governance and flexibility.&nbsp; We are fully convinced that given the timeframe to draft and implement the future legislation we have ample opportunity and time to get it right!</p>
<p>We further argued that the Government will play an important, enabling role for the ecosystem and by adopting SSI can safely focus on the attributes (or verified credentials) that it has historically been providing. Thus facilitating a smooth transition from a paper-based world to&nbsp; a future, where verifiable data enables new levels of efficiency and flexibility without negatively affecting privacy for both the individuals and organisations.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to the future collaboration with relevant governmental agencies and policy makers that are engaged in decision making process. We’ll continue to explain and promote SSI. Many of our members already implement solutions using SSI principals and technology stack – we happy to provide this expertise to help build the true digital foundation for the future of Swiss Confederation.</p>

  <p>All around the world, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the legal documentation that can prove who they are to banks, service providers and other businesses. As a result, millions are struggling to access trade finance and create partnerships, particularly in developing economies. </p>
<p>Following the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative designed to bridge this trade finance gap in Africa, we’re catching up with our key partners to hear their thoughts on how the project will bring about greater financial inclusion for SMEs on the continent and beyond. </p>
<p>We spoke with Alberta Abbey, LEI Analyst, Data &amp; Analytics, LSEG to discuss how this initiative will support wider adoption of globally recognized business identities, in the form of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs), across Africa and how to encourage more entities across Africa to obtain LEIs.</p>
<p>LSEG performs an important role in the Global LEI System as a LEI Issuer, also known as a Local Operating Unit (LOU). LEI Issuers are accredited by GLEIF to issue LEIs to legal entities, supplying registration, renewal and other services, and acting as the LEI system’s primary interface with legal entities. They also work in cooperation with Validation Agents, a new operational model within the system which allows financial institutions to obtain and maintain LEIs for their clients, to support their issuance workflows. </p>
<p>What was LSEG’s role within this flagship initiative? </p>
<p>As the LEI issuing organisation, we provide training and ongoing support to the African Validation Agent.</p>
<p>Why did you decide to become involved with the initiative?</p>
<p>LSEG joined this initiative to facilitate wider LEI adoption across Africa. By demonstrating the uses and benefits of LEIs, our aim is that this project will encourage more entities across Africa to obtain LEIs. We started the project with a partnership approach, which we intend to continue beyond the pilot.</p>
<p>As the 2nd largest issuer of LEIs globally, this project is a good opportunity to partner with the African agent to make LEIs more easily accessible across the continent.</p>
<p>As the LEI Issuer in the Africa LEI initiative, what benefits does LSEG hope to realize through its participation, for itself and also for the banks and SMEs in the region? </p>
<p>We’re pleased to be working with NMB Bank, which is the Validation Agent. Through the collaboration, we’re providing the platform that gives entities in the region access to obtain LEIs, thereby making their status internationally verifiable through GLEIF.</p>

 Digital trust summit a call for action to address Aotearoa’s digital identity challenges. 



<p>The Digital Trust Hui Taumata/Summit will headline next year’s Techweek22 festival and provide an opportunity for a cross-section of stakeholders to share insights on building a thriving trust economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scheduled for the 19th of May at TSB Auditorium, and with a one-day programme featuring keynote talks, panels, use cases and roundtable discussions, the Digital Trust Summit is a must-attend event for all those invested in the future of New Zealand’s digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>Personal data is the new currency of the digital economy. Used effectively, this data can deliver benefits for individuals, businesses and government. But as Aotearoa reaches its digital adolescence, pertinent questions remain:</p>



  How will identity, security and experience integrate?  How can citizens maintain sovereignty over their personal data?  What underpins a successful transition toward open finance?  How will Te Ao Māori be woven into Aotearoa’s Digital Identity?  What are the global opportunities for New Zealand as a ‘trusted digital economy’?  



<p></p>



<p>The speed of our digital transformation and the benefits it delivers for society has much to do with trust. That is to say, declining trust in the way personal information is secured, validated and applied will prevent us from realising the collective economic benefits of digital. With an undoubtedly kiwi flavour, the Digital Trust Hui will seek to answer these questions and more with the help of local and international leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In December 2019, members elected the first Digital Identity NZ Executive Council. The Council is the governing group for the association; providing guidance and direction as we navigate the developing world of digital identity in Aotearoa. Each Council member is elected for a two-year term, with elections held annually and results notified at the AGM in December. So, as we approach the end of the year it is time for us to call for nominations for the Council seats coming up for re-election.<br><br>This year, there are seven&nbsp;positions up for election, x3 positions in the Major Corporate, x3 positions in the Corporate Other, and x1 position for the SME/Start-up category.<br><br>When we formed the Executive Council we asked that you consider electing a diverse group of members who reflect the diversity of the community we seek to support. You did that. The power of that diversity has shone through in the work of the Council this year, especially as we consider the importance of Te Tiriti in a well-functioning digital identity ecosystem.<br><br>As the Council has considered its own makeup, we’ve identified a number of areas where diversity, as well as expertise in the digital identity space, might help us better serve the community. Nominations from those involved in the business and service sectors and kaupapa Māori organisations are especially encouraged. We also encourage suggestions from young people within your organisations, as the viewpoint of young people is extremely essential and relevant to the work we perform. Digital Identity NZ has a policy on Board diversity which you can read&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6cd211649fd1d09c759c0112f&amp;id=50a0dc76a6&amp;e=40f3555481">here.</a><br><br>Once elected in December, one of the first responsibilities of the new Council will be to elect a new Chair for the EC Council or consider re-electing the current chair. Following the departure of David Morrison, who served as Chair of our organisation since 2018, in February 2021, the council elected Ben Tairea as the new Chair, and both are excellent Kairahi (guides/counsellors/leaders). Currently supporting Ben diligently are Sat Mandri, co-chair and Tamara Al-Salim, deputy chair and their serving terms are through to 2022.<br><br>2022 is a pivotal year for digital identity with the introduction of the Digital Identity Bill and further development of the ecosystem. We are looking forward to some stellar nominations to help us in exploring and pursuing the best opportunities for Digital Identity NZ to make a positive difference in 2022 and beyond. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

  <p>All around the world, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the legal documentation that can prove who they are to banks, service providers and other businesses. As a result, millions are struggling to access trade finance and create partnerships, particularly in developing economies. </p>
<p>Following the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative designed to bridge this trade finance gap in Africa, we’re catching up with our key partners to hear their thoughts on how the project will bring about greater financial inclusion for SMEs on the continent and beyond. </p>
<p>Barry Cooper is a Technical Director at the Centre for Financial Regulation and Inclusion (Cenfri), an independent, not for profit think tank which works on African financial sector development.</p>
<p>Cenfri has a wide reach across Africa, holding relationships with both regulators and Financial Service Providers (FSPs). Cenfri’s role in the initiative was multifacted and involved finding candidate banks in suitable jurisdictions where the initiative could have the most impact on MSMEs and act as a demonstration case; engaging with regulators regarding the initiative; leading working sessions with the selected bank to guide them through the LEI process and address any challenges; and report writing and validation; among others.  Cenfri and Cornerstone Advisory Plus’s evaluation mechanism successfully identified suitably regulated markets and FSPs that have a strong interest and investment in their micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) clients. </p>
<p>Why did you decide to become involved with the initiative?</p>
<p>Cenfri has done a lot of work on identity, anti-money laundering (AML), counter financing of terrorism (CFT), know-your-customer (KYC) and MSME finance issues and this opportunity resonated with our work. In addition, we strive to lead on best and next practices and were greatly attracted to this initiative as this was the first in Africa, and provided a significant opportunity to shape key practices. </p>
<p>How does your organization benefit from its involvement in the LEI initiative?</p>
<p>Involvement in this initiative benefits Cenfri as we gain unique learnings from prototyping the process, helping to inform our approaches to solving MSME finance issues, particularly in our focus countries in Africa, which include Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>The LEI initiative has also provided a tool that we can recommend to institutions and regulators to address AML-CFT, compliance and de-risking challenges. In addition, Cenfri obtained its own LEI, which we can benefit from using ourselves. </p>
<p>What problems does LEI usage enable SMEs in Africa to overcome in the medium to long-term?</p>
<p>There are 54 states in Africa, each with their own incorporation bodies and registries, which each have varying processes and idiosyncrasies. Reliable verification and further incorporation of information for due diligence and risk management processes require high local country skill levels, can take significant time and is prohibitively costly and hence employed more in larger transactions. MSME, and even some corporate, transactions in Africa are either not progressed or are subject to default assumptions of higher risk. </p>
<p>LEI usage enables MSMEs to obtain a much stronger identity which is globally accessible, trusted and verified. Local banks have deep expertise in their national systems, risks and processes. The LEI harnesses this knowledge in a globally accessible format. The LEI is positioned to overcome risk management information asymmetries enabling better formal trade flows through more accessible trade finance, more accurate finance risk ratings, reduced unfavourable risk premiums, limited transaction delays and fewer outright rejections. It also helps to create more visibility for MSMEs and increases opportunities to trade and connect with partners they may otherwise not have been able to connect with. In addition, it can solve compliance challenges for AML-CFT by ensuring they are adhering to the highest standards globally.</p>
<p>What would the African SME landscape look like if Africa’s $81bn trade finance gap could be narrowed? What would this mean for the regional economy?</p>
<p>Narrowing the $81bn trade finance gap could have material implications for the African economy and its people, with the potential to enable significant growth and competitiveness in international markets. The question remains whether changes in trade activity would be inclusive with positive impact at the lowest income levels or if the benefit would be limited to primary industries and existing corporates, benefitting established social strata. Positive measures, like the LEI, are intended to help MSMEs to participate on a fair footing, promoting sustainable growth and economic diversity. Contributing over 50% of employment worldwide according to the World Bank, a small increase in the size and income of MSMEs can have a significant impact on employment levels and enable the supply of services more efficiently throughout markets. Narrowing the trade gap should link with fostering intra-regional trade between African countries to further enable inclusive growth and development.</p>
<p>What opportunities could be created for the people of Africa if all SMEs could be equipped with globally recognized business ID?</p>
<p>Equipping all SMEs with an LEI will create a universal, continent-wide, robust and interoperable global identity. We see the unlocking of significant latent business and employment opportunities not only for global trade but particularly for trade within the Africa region which in the past has been systemically difficult between 54 states. The LEI will greatly enhance the accessibility and competitiveness of MSMEs not only globally but within their countries and the region. As mentioned previously, moderate MSME growth can have a significant impact in employment across diverse economic sectors and particularly at the lower income levels. Through enhanced networking effects the LEI can also result in better distribution of goods and services across countries, enabling access to additional local, sustainable products and services for Africans.</p>

<p>How we keep pace with changes in digital technologies, and how they are used in our economy and across our communities, will have a strong impact on Aotearoa New Zealand’s future prosperity.</p>



<p>The potential benefits from digital ways of working are exponential. They will help improve lives, expand consumer and career choices, and contribute to solving wider issues, such as climate change.</p>



<p>Our government is embarking on a journey to create&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3628718/national-strategy-digital-twin-and-skills-shortages-on-nz-tech-minister-s-mind.html">A Digital Strategy for Aotearoa</a>&nbsp;that seeks to respond to the social, economic, education and cultural opportunities from digital technology, along with the risks that these technologies can bring.</p>



<p>The strategy will endeavour to set out key goals, priorities and activities for the short to medium term (two-five years), as well as longer term results (out to 2031 and beyond).</p>



<p>The overarching framework for the strategy will consist of three pillars:</p>







 
 
<p>As we have stated previously,&nbsp;Identity&nbsp;along with&nbsp;Privacy&nbsp;and&nbsp;Security&nbsp;is one of the three core elements of&nbsp;Trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the Digital Strategy for Aotearoa begins to take shape, DINZ will be at the centre of the conversation around why a thriving Digital Identity ecosystem is an essential element in achieving the strategic vision of&nbsp;enabling all of Aotearoa New Zealand to flourish and prosper in a digital world.</p>

<p>The Ceramic community is committed to providing the best possible developer experience for building Web3 data applications. Over the past few months, the community has made significant upgrades to Ceramic's emerging open source developer tools and data standards ecosystem, including replacing the popular IDX.js client with a more powerful and flexible set of tools. This post describes the best ways to build applications on Ceramic today as of October, 2021.</p> The Web3 data architecture <p>The primary difference between Web3 and Web2 applications is their data architecture. Web3 applications rely on a user-centric ("self-sovereign" or "sovereign") data storage architecture. In this model, application data is hosted on a decentralized network, stored with each individual user, and is written to and queried by applications client-side. This contrasts to Web2 applications, which rely on an application-centric design where all data for all users of an application is stored in a single database server siloed to that application. </p> What's needed to build sovereign apps? <p>Therefore, building Web3 data apps requires a few foundational primitives:</p>  Network for decentralized data availability with fast mutability  Protocol for identity-centric, model-based data storage and retrieval  Client for performing CRUD operations on users' stores at runtime   User-centric data models <p>As you can see, Web3 data applications are built on the concept of data models for storing and retrieving structured data from user-controlled storage. Web3 takes a model-based approach vs. an application-based approach in order to allow for simple data reuse and composability across applications. It's much easier for applications to share individual data models with other applications (e.g. <code>user profile</code>, <code>social graph</code>, <code>skills</code>, <code>linked blockchain accounts</code>) than it is to force these applications to share entire databases containing all different kinds of data, many of which are not shared between applications. </p><p>Creating a great developer experience around building applications with user-centric data models is important to accelerating adoption of this new Web3 data architecture. Tools that improve the developer experience and increase cross-application data interoperability include: </p>  Tooling to create and deploy data models  Tooling to share, discover, and reuse data models   Example: Decentralized social network <p>As a simple example of how this all works, let's consider a decentralized social network. Behind the scenes this application can be reduced to just four data models, where each user maintains their own data in their own store for each model:</p>  <code>PostList</code>: stores an index of a user's posts  <code>Post</code>: stores a single post  <code>Profile</code>: stores a user's profile  <code>FollowList</code>: stores a list of users they follow   Application deployment and usage <p>To deploy this data application, a developer would deploy each of these data models to Ceramic. After they're available on the network, they can be used by any application to CRUD a user's data store for that model. For example, if another developer is building a new social network and wants to bootstrap it with existing users and content, they can simply reuse the same data models as the initial social network and their application will be able to automatically load and support storage interactions on this existing data. This is how multiple applications can collaborate on shared data sets, and how open data standards and protocols can emerge from any developer in the community.</p><blockquote>For an example of two applications building on the same data models to achieve data interoperability, try the <a href="https://self.id">Self.ID</a> and <a href="https://dns.xyz">DNS</a> applications. Any change to data in one application is automatically reflected in the other.</blockquote> IDX: ID-centric, model-based storage protocol <p>Ceramic provides a decentralized network for data availability with fast mutability, the foundation upon which Web3 data applications can be deployed and run. About a year ago the Ceramic community first introduced <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-11/CIP-11.md">CIP-11 "Identity Index"</a>, commonly referred to as the <code>IDX protocol</code>. It specifies a protocol for identity-centric, model-based data storage and retrieval implemented on top of Ceramic – the second requirement for building sovereign applications.</p> IDX.js: The most popular IDX client <p>IDX protocol (CIP-11) is just a specification and not working code. To make the protocol usable by application developers, the <a href="https://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a> team created IDX.js, a runtime library for performing CRUD operations on users' data stores – the third and final requirement for building Web3 data applications. They also created supporting tools such as the IDX CLI, and a reference application, <a href="https://self.id">Self.id</a>, to showcase IDX.js and related Ceramic technologies.</p><p>By serving as a simple entry-point to building applications on Ceramic, adoption of IDX.js has accelerated in lockstep with growth of the Ceramic ecosystem and has become the most popular way to build applications on Ceramic. Almost all of the applications currently deployed on Ceramic mainnet are using IDX.js.</p>Usage of IDX.js has accelerated with usage of Ceramic Why change a good thing? <p>In an attempt to offer more features, service more use cases and provide the best developer experience, the scope of IDX.js grew beyond simply providing a bare-bones implementation of the IDX protocol to a point where it became unnecessarily monolithic and opinionated. </p><p>As a result, IDX.js and associated libraries <code>idx-constants</code>, <code>idx-tools</code>, <code>idx-cli</code> are being deprecated. They are replaced by a new collection of tools outlined in the rest of this post.</p><blockquote>If you are currently using IDX.js and/or 3ID Connect, there is no rush to upgrade your code. There are no breaking changes to the IDX protocol itself, and the data interactions of the new libraries are fully compatible with IDX.js.</blockquote> DataModels: Open source for data models <p>DataModels allows developers to create, share, reuse, and discuss open source data models for Ceramic applications that can be used with the IDX protocol, enabling cross-application data interoperability.</p> DataModels Registry <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels">DataModels Registry</a> is an open-source, community-created repository of reusable application data models for Ceramic. It provides a single place where developers can openly register, discover, and reuse existing data models – the foundation for interoperable applications built on shared data models. Currently the registry is implemented as an open source Github repository dual-licensed under MIT and Apache 2. In the future, it will be decentralized on Ceramic.</p> Installation &amp; Usage <p>All data models added to the registry are automatically published to <code>npm</code> under the @datamodels organization. Any developer can install one or more data models by using the <code>@datamodels/model-name</code> convention, making those models available for storing or retrieving data during runtime with any IDX client, including DID DataStore or Self.ID, both of which are described below.</p>Install DataModels from the @datamodels npm org DataModels Forum <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/discussions">DataModels Forum</a> is located within the DataModels Registry repository. Every model in the DataModel Registry has its own discussion thread which the community can use to leave reviews, have discussions, discuss upgrades, etc. Developers can also post <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/discussions/categories/ideas">ideas</a> for DataModels to solicit input from the community prior to adding it to the Registry.</p> Glaze: Ceramic Developer Suite <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/overview/">Glaze</a> is a suite of low-level developer tools for building applications on Ceramic. Glaze aims to provide developers with more flexibility and control by unbundling IDX.js into smaller, more specific packages.</p> DID DataStore.js: Core IDX client <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/did-datastore/">DID DataStore</a> is a bare-bones IDX runtime client – a stripped-down replacement for IDX.js – with less scope and fewer dependencies. If you've used IDX.js, you'll notice that DID DataStore does not come bundled with default data models, such as <code>basicProfile</code>, nor does it support CAIP-10 blockchain accounts links out of the box. If you want to use DID DataStore with data models or blockchain accounts you will need to separately install these as packages. If you want a more bundled, drop-in solution similar to IDX.js, see Self.ID below.</p> DataModels.js: A runtime for DataModels <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/datamodel/">DataModels.js</a> is a runtime library that simplifies the process of using data models in your application. It is frequently used with DID DataStore, and supports a few useful runtime features for DataModels:</p>  Availability – ensures the data models used your application are available on your Ceramic node, so they can be used with a Ceramic or IDX client, such as <code>DID Datastore</code>  Aliasing – allows developers to assign human-readable names to their data models, so they can more easily be used within application code instead of needing to reference data models via their <code>streamID</code>  <blockquote>If you've used IDX.js or the IDX CLI, DataModels serves as a replacement for running the <code>idx bootstrap</code> command or using similar bootstrap files, and eliminates the need to create aliases at runtime.</blockquote> More Glaze Tools   <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/development/#devtools-library">DevTools</a> is a library for managing the full lifecycle of DataModels, such as creating custom models, adding to existing or creating new schemas and definitions, and publishing DataModels to any Ceramic node.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/development/#cli">Glaze CLI</a> is an upgraded command line interface that is designed to support Glaze development flows. It provides more functionality than the core Ceramic CLI, and adds native functionality for DataModels and DID Datastore.   Self.ID: Bundles for building Ceramic apps <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/overview/">Self.ID</a> is a suite of high-level bundles that simplify the development process for building Ceramic applications. </p> Self.ID Core: Read-only bundle <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/read/">Self.ID Core</a> is a package that comes pre-installed with everything you need to build applications that read data from accounts on Ceramic. Self.ID Core offers cross-platform support, but read-only APIs. If you are currently using IDX.js, Self.ID Core is very similar. It includes: </p>  Ceramic client: <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/javascript/http/">JS Ceramic HTTP Client</a> with all required setup. The only thing you need to do is pass in your node's <code>CeramicURL</code>  IDX client: DID DataStore.js  DataModels runtime: DataModels.js  Popular DataModels: <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/identity-profile-basic">Basic Profile</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/3id-keychain">3ID Keychain</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/identity-accounts-crypto">Crypto Accounts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/identity-accounts-web">Web Accounts</a>  Popular utilities: Support for CAIP-10 blockchain accounts    Self.ID Web: Browser bundle <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/write/">Self.ID Web</a> extends the Self.ID Core bundle with write APIs and provides built-in user authentication. Self.ID Web only supports browser applications, and is now the most popular bundle for building Ceramic applications.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a>: Browser-based, cross-chain user authentication system that is compatible with blockchain wallets. 3ID Connect allows users to connect one or more blockchain accounts from any chain to their Ceramic decentralized identity. 3ID Connect supports all EVM chains and other blockchain platforms such as NEAR, Cosmos, Filecoin, and Tezos.   More Self.ID Tools   <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/utilities/#image-interactions">Image Utilities</a>: for uploading images to IPFS, storing them in multiple sizes and resolutions, and retrieving one most desirable to your application UI. Great for optimizing application performance when handling images such as user profiles photos. Sometimes you want to show a full-resolution image (e.g. profile page), and other times you only low-res thumbnails (e.g. dashboard).  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/self.id/tree/master/packages/3box-legacy">3Box Legacy Profiles:</a> A utility function for loading a legacy 3Box profile as a BasicProfile. Previously, this was provided by IDX.js.   FAQs  Which library should I use? <p>If you are already familiar with IDX or are more advanced in your development needs, DID DataStore is likely a better option; it offers the most flexibility and new features will be implemented there first. If you use custom data models (schemas and definitions), you should get familiar with the new set of tools for data models including the DataModels Registry and DataModels.js.</p><p>If you are just getting started with Ceramic and IDX, Self.ID should provide a smoother experience. It allows you to build Web3 data applications without having to understand all the concepts in order to have a working setup. You should still learn about Ceramic and the rest of the ecosystem if you want a better understanding of the full set of possibilities.</p> What should I do now? <p>IDX.js and related packages are being deprecated. Moving forward new features and improvements will only be implemented in the Glaze and Self.ID packages. We recommend that you update your app to use the new packages whenever possible.</p> Join the developer community <p>The Ceramic community is passionate about building Web3 data applications. If you want to learn more about anything mentioned in this post, encounter any issues trying to use the new tools, either for a new project or migrating from IDX.js, please <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">join the Ceramic Discord</a>!</p><p>To get started building Ceramic applications, head over to the developer documentation for <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/overview/">Glaze</a> and <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/overview/">Self.ID</a> now!</p>

Bild: Diskussion über die Sicherheit von Wallets für digitalen Identitäten Aktuelle Diskussion und&nbsp;Kontext <p>Am 23. September 2021 hat die Bundesregierung erstmals den digitalen Personalausweis und Führerschein für das <a href="https://my-digi-id.github.io/index.html#mobile-app">ID-Wallet</a> einer breiten Öffentlichkeit vorgestellt und es war für kurze Zeit möglich einen Personalausweis und Führerschein in das ID-Wallet abzuleiten. Hierbei ist es leider zu Problemen gekommen, da die Nachfrage um ein vielfaches höher als angenommen war. Im weiteren Verlauf haben Mitglieder rund um den Chaos Computer Club (CCC) die ID-Wallet, sowie die zugrundeliegende Technologie in einem <a href="https://lilithwittmann.medium.com/mit-der-id-wallet-kannst-du-alles-und-jeder-sein-au%C3%9Fer-du-musst-dich-ausweisen-829293739fa0">Artikel</a> kritisiert. Da das Lissi Wallet hier genannt und gezeigt wurde, möchten wir eine Einordnung schaffen, einen Überblick über die angesprochenen Probleme geben und potenzielle Lösungen diskutieren.</p> Abgrenzung ID-Ökosystem der Bundesregierung und “Schaufenster sichere digitale Identitäten”. <p>Seit 2019 führt das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi) ein Projekt zur Förderung neuer digitaler Identitätslösungen durch. Nach einer sechsmonatigen Wettbewerbsphase, für die sich jede Institution in Deutschland bewerben konnte, wurden vier Projekte zur Förderung im Rahmen der <a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Navigation/DE/ProgrammeProjekte/AktuelleTechnologieprogramme/Sichere_Digitale_Identitaeten/sichere_digitale_ident.html">Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten</a> ausgewählt. Die ausgewählten Projekte (im folgenden Schaufensterprojekte) sind Forschungsprojekte, die mit über 120 involvierten Institutionen gemeinsam innerhalb von drei Jahren neue Lösungskonzepte für digitale Identitäten erforschen und umsetzen, darunter zahlreiche Institute mit dem Schwerpunkt IT-Sicherheit. Folgende Projekte nehmen am Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten teil: <a href="https://www.once-project.de/">ONCE</a>, <a href="https://id-ideal.hs-mittweida.de/">ID-Ideal</a>, <a href="https://www.sdika.de/">SDIKA</a> und&nbsp;<a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a>.</p><p>Parallel dazu hat die Bundesregierung im <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/975188/1824788/372199dfb12ff630da046dae6ae2849d/2020-12-03-europaeisches-oekosystem-digitaler-identitaeten-data.pdf?download=1">Dezember 2020</a> ein eigenes ID-Ökosystem rund um die ID-Wallet gestartet. Das <a href="https://www.bmi.bund.de/Webs/PA/DE/verwaltung/projekt_digitale_identitaeten/projekt_digitale_identitaeten_node.html">BMI</a> beschreibt das Projekt wie folgt: “Bürgerinnen und Bürger können künftig persönliche Daten und digitale Nachweise verschlüsselt in ihren Smartphones speichern und dann selbstbestimmt, sicher und einfach für Online-Dienste von Unternehmen und Behörden verwenden.”</p><p>Das <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi Wallet</a> ist bisher nicht Teil des ID-Ökosystems der Bundesregierung und wird überwiegend im Rahmen des Schaufensterprojekts “IDunion” genutzt und weiterentwickelt. Es ist bisher nicht darauf ausgelegt offizielle Dokumente wie den Personalausweis und Führerschein zu speichern und dies war bisher für Endanwender*innen auch nie möglich. Ziel der Schaufensterprojekte ist es allerdings genau dies in Zukunft zu erreichen und dafür entsprechende Sicherheitsmechanismen zu entwickeln.</p><p>Insofern sind wir für jede Kritik an der Lissi Wallet sehr dankbar und nehmen die von Lilith Wittmann und Fabian Lüpke, der unter dem Pseudonym “Flüpke” im Internet Auftritt, geäußerten Bedenken ernst. Gleichwohl ist es sehr wichtig diese immer im Kontext der verschiedenen Anwendungsfälle und deren Vertrauensniveaus zu betrachten!</p> Probleme und mögliche Lösungswege <p>In ihrem <a href="https://lilithwittmann.medium.com/mit-der-id-wallet-kannst-du-alles-und-jeder-sein-au%C3%9Fer-du-musst-dich-ausweisen-829293739fa0">gemeinsamen Artikel</a> sowie einer <a href="https://github.com/Fluepke/ssi-poc">Proof of Concept (PoC) Implementierung</a> sprechen Lilith und Flüpke mehrere Probleme der Walletlösung an. Wir möchten diese Probleme nochmal kurz in eigenen Worten erklären und mögliche Lösungsoptionen aufzeigen.</p> 1. Verifizierung von anfragenden Parteien <p>Bei verifizierten Dokumenten in einem ID-Ökosystem ist ein wichtiger Aspekt, dass die ausstellende Partei nicht in die Präsentation eines Nachweis gegenüber der anfragenden Partei involviert ist. Für den Prozess der Anfrage und der Präsentation wird eine direkte Kommunikation mit Ende-zu-Ende Verschlüsselung zwischen Nutzer*innen und der anfragenden Partei genutzt. Um die benötigten Schlüssel für die sichere Kommunikation auszutauschen, wird hierzu oftmals ein QR-Code genutzt, welcher Nutzer*innen über einen bereits bestehenden sicheren Kommunikationskanal übermittelt werden&nbsp;muss.</p><p>Beschriebenes Problem: Sollte der sichere Kanal kompromittiert werden, kann dies einer Angreifer*in erlauben, eine sogenannte “Man-In-The-Middle-Attacke” durchzuführen. Hierzu tauschen Angreifer*innen Schlüssel und Endpunkte aus und präsentieren Nutzer*innen einen gefälschten QR-Code, welcher das Ergebnis der Abfrage und damit die persönlichen Daten umleiten. Das Problem besteht darin, dass Nutzer*innen grundsätzlich keine Möglichkeit haben, die anfragende Partei innerhalb der Wallet zu authentifizieren und Betrüger*innen sich als beliebige Institution ausgeben könnten um persönliche Informationen anzufragen. Die Verantwortung den initialen Kommunikationskanal zu überprüfen liegt somit auf der Nutzerseite.</p><p>Mögliche Lösung: Um die Legitimität einer Anfrage verifizieren zu können, müssen sich anfragende Institutionen zuvor in einem öffentlichen Register z.B. mit öffentlichen dezentralen Identifikatoren (DIDs) registrieren. Die öffentlichen DIDs können durch eine vertrauenswürdige Partei (z.B. einem <a href="https://esignature.ec.europa.eu/efda/tl-browser/#/screen/tl/DE">Vertrauensdiensteanbieter</a>) in einer “Trusted List” zertifiziert werden. Das Wallet von Nutzer*innen kann bei neuen Anfragen die Authentizität über die entsprechende “Trusted List” validieren und Nutzer*innen die verifizierte Identität der anfragenden Partei anzeigen.</p><p>Grundsätzlich wäre auch denkbar, dass nur verifizierbare Institutionen hoheitliche Dokumente abfragen dürfen. Ob dies in der Realität sinnvoll wäre ist zu diskutieren. Alternativ müssen Nutzer*innen darüber aufgeklärt werden, dass die anfragende dritte Partei nicht verifiziert werden kann und die Daten nur geteilt werden sollten, wenn Nutzer*innen dem Kontext der Anfrage vertrauen. Mit der zunehmenden Offenheit der Ökosystems ergeben sich somit auch zusätzliche Risiken für Nutzer*innen.</p> 2. Der Missbrauch von verifizierten Daten: <p>Wenn Informationen mittels einer verifizierbaren Präsentation mit einer dritten Partei geteilt wurden, dann erhält diese Partei die angefragten Klardaten (z.B. Name, Geburtsdatum) und eine entsprechende Signatur vom Aussteller der Informationen, um zu überprüfen, dass die erhaltenen Informationen unverfälscht sind.</p><p>Beschriebenes Problem: Angreifer*innen, welche verifizierte Identitätsdaten abfangen konnten, können diese missbräuchlich verwenden. Dieses Problem unterliegt der Annahme, dass ein Angriff, wie in Punkt 1 beschrieben, möglich und erfolgreich war.</p><p>Bestehende Lösung: Jede verifizierbare Präsentation eines verifizierbaren Nachweises ist mit einer Nonce versehen, die sogenannte Replay-Attacken verhindert. Die Angreifer*in ist somit nicht in der Lage mit den gestohlenen Daten weitere Anfragen zu beantworten und neue verifizierbare Präsentationen zu erstellen. Sie kann ausschließlich die gestohlenen Klardaten nutzen. Da schon durch die Preisgabe der Klardaten ein Schaden entstehen kann, ist es trotzdem notwendig den unter Punkt 1 beschriebenen Angriff auszuschließen.</p> Wie geht es&nbsp;weiter: <p>Neben den aufgezeigten Lösungsansätzen gibt es sicher noch eine Reihe weiterer Möglichkeiten und auch das beschriebene Angriffsszenario ist, wie bereits erwähnt, je nach Anwendungsfall differenziert zu bewerten.</p><p>Sowohl im ID-Ökosystem der Bundesregierung als auch in allen Schaufensterprojekten kommen sogenannte “selbstbestimmte” Identitätslösungen (kurz SSI) zum Einsatz. Viele andere Staaten weltweit, entwickeln derzeit ähnliche Lösungen. Deutschland geht dabei keinen Alleinweg.</p><p>Grundsätzliche Problemstellungen werden z.B. global auf dem halbjährlich stattfindenden <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW) diskutiert. Der nächste IIW findet vom 12. — 14. Oktober statt. Wir möchten gern alle Beteiligten aufrufen sich hier zu treffen, um offen und konstruktiv über die Lösungsansätze zu sprechen.</p><p>Darüber hinaus werden wir im Rahmen der Schaufensterprojekte gemeinsam mit zahlreichen Institutionen die bestehenden Herausforderungen lösungsorientiert angehen und begrüßen konstruktive Kritik und die Beteiligung der Öffentlichkeit. Nur gemeinsam können wir erfolgreich ein Fundament für unsere digitale Gesellschaft schaffen!</p><p>Das Lissi Team freut sich auf eine konstruktive Diskussion.</p>

 Investment in transportation, agriculture, healthcare, and education should take priority over investment in surveillance technologies. <p>While artificial intelligence (AI), a signature technology of the 4th Industrial revolution (4IR), has been projected to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2020/01/13/the-future-is-intelligent-harnessing-the-potential-of-artificial-intelligence-in-africa/">transform</a> the socioeconomic landscape of Africa by creating <a href="https://oecd-development-matters.org/2021/02/09/developing-an-artificial-intelligence-for-africa-strategy/#:~:text=Africa%20has%20a%20unique%20opportunity,economic%20problems%20that%20Africa%20faces.">new efficiencies</a> in the public and private sectors, it has some way to go to live up to this hope. Instead of exciting <a href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/news/36-million-boost-for-ai-technologies-to-revolutionise-nhs-care/">public-led</a> applications such as the use of AI by the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom to fight diseases, the most promising applications of AI in Africa are, not surprisingly, private sector-dominated. From behemoths like <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/07/mapping-africas-buildings-with.html">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/facebooks-ai-team-maps-out-where-everyone-in-africa-lives/">Facebook</a> to smaller startups, private firms are attempting to create impact at scale in Africa through applications such as <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2020/03/05/meet-africas-bot-builders-the-startups-pioneering-chatbot-solutions-on-the-continent/">chatbots</a> in healthcare and the financial industry and AI <a href="https://african.business/2021/04/agribusiness-manufacturing/drones-and-ai-move-africas-farmers-to-greener-pastures/">drone-empowered</a> disease surveillance in agriculture. As I’ve explained <a href="https://paradigmhq.org/4th-industrial-revolution-readying-africa-for-the-emerging-ai-decade/">elsewhere</a>, African countries will falter in their quest for an AI-led 4IR economic boost if they neglect investments in foundational 2nd and 3rd IR technologies such as efficient transport systems, power grids, and reliable broadband connections for a critical mass of the population. The 4IR does not happen in a bubble; it feeds upon successful integration with 2nd and 3rd IR technologies. Little wonder, then, that the most visible public-private partnership in AI deployment for societal good during the Covid-19 pandemic was its use for <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/news/latest-news/research-news/2020/2020-12/ai-helps-to-identify-new-covid-19-hotspots-in-gauteng.html">disease surveillance</a> in Johannesburg — within Africa’s most advanced economy where 2nd and 3rd IR technologies are better developed than in most of&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>A huge part of AI’s ineffectual public sector-led impact in Africa is poor <a href="https://datatopics.worldbank.org/statisticalcapacity/">statistical capacity</a>, which might be a good intervention point for AI capacity-building grants for the continent. Government and other public statistical agencies are poorly equipped to keep accurate and granular records in critical sectors such as economic indicators, health data, environmental data, and even transportation data. AI systems <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2021/09/03/can-national-statistical-offices-shape-the-data-revolution/">feed</a> on large, accurate, and digitized datasets to produce insights for development, and in Africa today, the organizations with the capacity to harness such data power are typically in the private sector. We probably should not expect a replica of a UK NHS intervention in Africa anytime soon. There doesn’t seem to be enough political will to build efficient public statistical systems in Africa. The only exception seems to be in biometric surveillance.</p>Photo: <a href="https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/security-cctv-camera-monitoring-system-with-panoramic-view-of-a-city-on-blurry-gm962263118-262802771?utm_source=pixabay&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=SRP_image_sponsored&amp;referrer_url=http%3A%2F%2Fpixabay.com%2Fimages%2Fsearch%2Fbig%2520brother%2520surveillance%2F&amp;utm_term=big%20brother%20surveillance">Pixaby</a><p>It seems ironic that one of the most extensive public sector-led applications of AI in Africa is the implementation of biometric surveillance technology. Many African cities have become urban experiments in the deployment of AI-powered biometric surveillance. A few examples will suffice. In 2019, Police in <a href="https://africacenter.org/spotlight/surveillance-technology-in-africa-security-concerns/">Uganda</a> bought $126 million worth of CCTV surveillance technology from telecommunications firm Huawei to help control crime in Kampala, the country’s capital. In Nairobi, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/specials/connected-world/government.html">Kenya</a>, Huawei has also implemented a new communications network which links 1,800 surveillance cameras with 195 police bureaus and 7,600 police officers. In <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2021-05-09-big-brother-south-africa-will-not-only-be-watching-you-hell-also-share-your-biometric-data-with-the-cops/">South Africa</a>, the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHA) draft identity management policy proposed that biometric information recorded by numerous surveillance cameras installed in public spaces across the country will be linked to the DHA’s population register and this database shared with the Police. In <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202003/biometrics-and-digital-id-in-africa-this-week-increasing-cctv-surveillance-new-id-document-contracts">Madagascar</a>, Huawei is also installing over 1,000 CCTV cameras in the country’s major cities. Other African countries which have deployed <a href="https://africacenter.org/spotlight/surveillance-technology-in-africa-security-concerns/">surveillance</a> technology include Algeria, Botswana, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p><p>A conspicuous thread linking many of these projects is Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. Many of these surveillance projects are linked with Huawei’s <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/watching-huaweis-safe-cities">safe cities</a> project, a Chinese-led global partnership in security infrastructure. China has been a major partner in Africa’s economic renaissance, having built <a href="https://africacenter.org/spotlight/surveillance-technology-in-africa-security-concerns/">about 70%</a> of the 4G telecommunications infrastructure on the continent. The Infrastructure Consortium for Africa <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/02/chinese-firms-african-labor-are-building-africas-infrastructure/#:~:text=Chinese%20enterprises%20have%20dominated%20the,toward%20African%20infrastructure%20development%20projects.">estimates</a> China’s contribution to infrastructure development financing at $25.7 billion in 2018, about a quarter of the total $100.8 billion committed to infrastructure projects. China is also emerging as perhaps Africa’s most important trading partner, with an estimated <a href="http://www.sais-cari.org/data-china-africa-trade">$200 billion</a> worth of trade in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>China will remain an important partner for Africa. Nevertheless, it does not seem right that in the poorest continent on the planet, the most visible, public-led 4IR implementation is in security — and is simply a tool to maintain authoritarianism in many countries. Security is not the most urgent problem confronting Africa. Indeed, there are those who would argue that Africa’s security challenges are exacerbated by poor governance. The same local political will that has brought about these security investments in Africa can also be brought to ensure that 4IR impacts are more strongly felt in public sectors such as transportation, agriculture, healthcare, education — probably Africa’s greatest needs. A good place to start might be in partnerships to strengthen public statistical capacities and international knowledge transfers critical for the success of AI applications in Africa. The China-African partnership might be more meaningful if some of the agenda setting is African and recognizes that implementing effective public sector AI applications which improve the livelihoods of ordinary people will improve security better than a thousand biometric surveillance systems.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/big-brother-a-critique-of-the-4th-industrial-revolution-in-africa-fdcd1a5fdddd">Big Brother: A critique of the 4th Industrial Revolution</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>All around the world, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the legal documentation that can prove who they are to banks, service providers and other businesses. As a result, millions are struggling to access trade finance and create partnerships, particularly in developing economies. </p>
<p>Following the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative designed to bridge this trade finance gap in Africa, we’re catching up with our key partners to hear their thoughts on how the project will bring about greater financial inclusion for SMEs on the continent and beyond. </p>
<p>We spoke with Yann Desclercs, Managing Director, Cornerstone Advisory Plus to discuss how broad adoption of the LEI in the African financial system could help to reduce the continent’s trade finance gap. Cornerstone Advisory Plus is an advisory firm based in Cote d ́Ivoire, West Africa. It specializes in compliance advisory and training services for private and public sector institutions, including regulators and financial sector supervisors.</p>
<p>As part of the multi-stakeholder initiative, Cornerstone Advisory Plus assisted with the coordination of the project in collaboration with the other project partners. In addition, the Cornerstone team provided technical content and insight, facilitated stakeholder engagements and conducted data analysis with a special focus on compliance and KYC data. Cornerstone Advisory Plus also brought a francophone West African and international perspective to the project. </p>
<p>Having worked on the ground with financial institutions in Africa, what impact could broad LEI usage have on the broader financial system?<br>
African financial institutions are struggling to access international correspondent banking networks, either because they do not have the critical size required in terms of volume of activity, or, more importantly, because they are not always fully compliant with international AML and KYC standards and sanction regimes. As a result, the African financial system is widely perceived as high risk by the international financial community. International banks have therefore formed the assumption that establishing links with these institutions would lead to costly due diligence processes, which would outweigh the potential additional revenue generated by transaction fees. The outcome of this risk vs reward analysis usually prevents these banks from establishing links with African financial institutions and can lead to them severing ties from existing relationships, a phenomenon known as ‘de-risking’. </p>
<p>Broad usage of the LEI can provide greater transparency in the African financial system. This would help improve the risk assessments for individual entities together with the perception of system itself, opening it up to a worldwide network of international financial institutions. This would certainly help support the effective inclusion of African financial institutions in the global economy.</p>
<p>Do you think the broad usage of the LEI could also have an impact on SMEs in the region?<br>
Of course. As we know, de-risking has a huge impact on African economies and SMEs in particular, which make up the largest economic subset. A recent report from AfDB and Afreximbank shows that the continent’s trade finance gap is estimated at US$81bn, largely due to compliance and KYC issues and de-risking.  SMEs are the most affected by this issue. Reversing the trend of de-risking by fostering transparency of the African financial system through the broad adoption of the LEI could help to reduce the trade finance gap for SMEs and wider African economies.</p>
<p>How can the LEI initiative help banks with their internal processes? How can they become more efficient as a result?<br>
Banks that participate in this LEI initiative and take on the role of a Validation Agent can leverage their existing KYC process to obtain LEIs for their customers, with minimal to no additional steps, depending each bank’s KYC framework. As a result, participating banks can obtain strong global business IDs for their customers and help them to address globally recognized verification processes, all while streamlining their internal processes for periodic KYC renewals and ongoing customer information updates. </p>
<p>Another key benefit of equipping clients with an LEI is the simple identification of parental links between corporations using the GLEIF database, which can prove particularly useful in establishing beneficial ownership links as required by FATF recommendations and most jurisdiction’s laws. All these efficiency gains in the KYC process could eventually lead to greater cost efficiency by reallocating compliance resources proportionally and utilizing an effective risk-based approach as per FATF’s first recommendation, which is translated into most international  and national laws.</p>
<p>What strategic benefits can banks realize by participating in the LEI initiative? How does it help them grow revenue, opportunities or market share?<br>
Participating banks can benefit from improved risk perception within the international financial community, ultimately leading to increased trade capacity and corresponding market share. They can also develop a competitive edge by offering their customers globally recognized business IDs, delivering additional benefits for their SMEs and corporate customers. </p>
<p>This competitive edge coupled with the enhanced trade capacity could lead to significant growth in both market share and revenues, subject of course to an aligned and appropriate commercial, marketing and communication strategy.</p>
<p>What kind of ID services could an African bank anticipate developing once it has equipped its SME customers with LEIs?<br>
The sky is the limit. However, for the purpose of this interview, let’s focus on existing platforms such as the MANSA repository created and managed by a partnership led by Afreximbank. The MANSA repository is a single source of the primary data required for the conduct of customer due diligence on African entities including financial institutions, corporates and SMEs. Subject to an agreement between MANSA initiative and GLEIF, the LEI could be offered as an option/choice for the identification verification part of the repository. The LEI being an internationally recognized global business ID, it could potentially add on to the already established reputation of the MANSA repository and fast track the onboarding for all entities who already have an LEI.</p>
<p>This fast-tracked onboarding process could apply to any other national or regional ID platform on the continent. To achieve this in practice, discussions need to be conducted between GLEIF and the platform managers around the continent in order to establish collaborative avenues in order to reach an LEI-based onboarding process in the existing ID platforms.</p>

<p>Authentication plays an increasingly important role in how governments are providing services around the world.</p>



<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit on Sept. 23, 2021, users, experts and vendors from around the world detailed how strong authentication helps to enable government services and new efforts to secure online identities. Users including the U.K. National Health Service (NHS), as well as the U.S. Government’s <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provided insights into the present and future of online authentication and digital identities.</p>



  



<p>In the opening session of the event, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance, outlined the strategic imperative for FIDO in government services around the world.</p>



<p>“COVID-19 created an imperative to really accelerate digital transformation activities,” Shikiar said. “When the pandemic hit all of a sudden, everyone was at home and all activity brought requirements for modern authentication schemes that go far beyond passwords, even beyond traditional multi-factor authentication.”</p>



<p>Shikiar noted that the FIDO Alliance standards align very well with global regulations and policies and there is a growing trend of government guidance for authentication that cites the use of FIDO.</p>



<p>“It’s important to enable trust in the government ecosystem,” Shikiar said. “This comes through the engagement FIDO does with different regulators and government bodies and ultimately will be manifested through the secure implementation of digital identity services to citizens worldwide.”&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Technology Helping to Push FIDO Strong Authentication Forward</p>



<p>A key path for enabling FIDO specification is via vendors that support government efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patrick Sullivan, CTO of security strategy at Akamai, commented that password credential stuffing attacks are very common. He noted that Akamai’s platform sees as many as a billion password attacks per day. That’s where multi-factor authentication and more specifically strong authentication based on FIDO Alliance standards play a strong role. Sullivan noted that there is a clear need to provide multi-factor authentication in a low friction environment where it’s delivered in the form factor of an app on a smartphone.</p>



<p>“We’re not asking users to carry around a hardware token to accomplish FIDO2 as we move in that direction, and by introducing less friction, there’s less risk of our users doing something anomalous,” Sullivan said.</p>



<p>Jeff Frederick, manager of solutions engineering at Yubico, noted during his session that in government, many agencies in the U.S use Common Access Card (CAC)/Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials that go beyond basic passwords. Frederick noted that FIDO2 standards, which are supported on his company’s YubiKey device, provide a strong impersonation resistant authentication protocol that uses public private key cryptography.</p>



  



<p>“It’s very similar to PIV/CAC and FIDO2 is an open standard that’s managed by the FIDO Alliance, so that any vendor can support this and use it today,” Frederick said. “It’s built into all major operating systems and all major browsers so there’s no middleware that you need to install to make this work and it’s just an easy to implement solution that will modernize the federal authentication infrastructure across the board.”</p>



<p>Making Identity and Authentication Less Taxing at the IRS</p>



<p>The IRS proofs and authorizes tens of millions of taxpayers every year, across both digital and non digital channels, according to Courtney Rasey, assistant to the director, Identity Assurance, Privacy Governmental Liaison, &amp; Disclosure (PGLD) at the IRS.</p>



<p>“None of those tens of millions of taxpayers who are calling the IRS are doing so just because they want to, it’s not really a fun weeknight activity,” she said. “They need to resolve an issue to meet their tax obligation and we know that, so we’re always striving to provide better service to taxpayers, to help them get the service that they need in the most convenient and efficient way possible.”</p>



  



<p>One way the IRS is looking to be more convenient to taxpayers is with its Secure Access Digital Identity (SADI) platform that was launched in June of 2021. Rasey explained that SADI leverages a Credential Service {rovider (CSP) that identity proofs the taxpayer and then provides the IRS with a digital identity credential.</p>



<p>“Users are eventually going to be able to access all IRS online applications utilizing that single digital identity credential,” Rasey said. “The IRS is moving more and more applications behind SADI throughout fiscal year 2022 and as we do move more applications taxpayers are going to be able to do so many things with just one credential.”</p>



<p>Moving Toward Zero Trust with Strong Authentication</p>



<p>In May, President Biden signed Executive Order 1402, which directs U.S. government agencies to improve cybersecurity. One of the primary provisions of the executive order is to move the federal government toward a zero trust architecture.</p>



  



<p>“When we talk about zero trust, we’re talking about an architecture where people and their devices aren’t trusted just by virtue of being inside an organization’s enterprise network,” explained Eric Mill, senior advisor, Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>



<p>Mill noted that in a zero trust model, people and devices are validated at each step and&nbsp; authentication is context-aware. The OMB is strongly encouraging the adoption of phishing resistant multi-factor authentication, with FIDO WebAuthn as a good alternative option in environments where CAC/PIV isn’t feasible.</p>



<p>“We’re pushing very hard on multi-factor authentication and we really view reliable authentication as a critical foundation of zero trust architecture,” Mill said.</p>



<p>In a Policy Deep Dive session, Jeremy Grant, managing director, technology business strategy at Venable, noted that there are a number of reasons why authentication is important to governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grant said that FIDO specifications can help governments to protect access to their own assets and can help to enable more high-value citizen facing services to the public.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think what we’re seeing in 2021, is a really different environment across the globe, where FIDO authentication is emerging, not just as another permitted option, but in many cases as a preferred choice of governments across the world,” Grant said.</p>



  



<p>How the National Health Service (NHS) uses FIDO</p>



<p>Among the areas in the world where FIDO is finding a home is in the U.K.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly funded medical and healthcare system in the U.K. and it has embraced FIDO standards to help improve human health.&nbsp; With the NHS Login service, citizens get a centralized identity for health services while the NHS app provides a simplified application for accessing and managing an individual’s access to health services.</p>



<p>Priyanka Mittal, technical architect for the NHS Login and NHS app, said that over the past 18 months there has been a 10-fold increase in the user base for NHS login as demand has grown during the pandemic.</p>



  



<p>Sean Devlin, tech lead for the NHS App, explained that initially the services started out using an SMS based two-factor authentication approach, but wanted to find a more seamless approach. NHS decided to use FIDO UAF and built out its own implementation, using eBay’s open source FIDO implementation as a starting point.</p>



<p>Devlin said that before using FIDO, users had to navigate as many as five different screens to get through a multi-factor authentication flow. With FIDO, it’s a single screen.</p>



<p>The NHS has also saved a lot of money by moving to FIDO. With over 500,000 FIDO logins per day, Devlin estimates that the NHS is saving on the order of £8,000 per day on SMS messaging costs.</p>



<p>Bringing FIDO Strong Authentication to Login.gov</p>



<p>FIDO specifications also play a pivotal role at login.gov, which is a single sign-on platform for U.S. government services.</p>



  



<p>Jonathan Hooper, login.gov Engineering Lead at the General Services Administration (GSA), explained that the authentication portal fronts over 200 sites across the U.S. government,&nbsp; spread across 27 different agencies. Hooper explained that starting in 2018,<a href="http://login.gov"> login.gov</a> began expanding the use of multi-factor authentication, including the WebAuthn specification.</p>



<p>“We don’t want to be ‘big brother,’ we want to make sure that we can protect users’ privacy and the things built into the protocol that helped to do that were very attractive to us,” Hooper said. “WebAuthn is also very cheap, it is much cheaper to do a WebAuthn authentication event than it is to do SMS by several orders of magnitude.”</p>



<p>Improving Digital Identity with FIDO</p>



<p>A FIDO-based approach for digital identity could soon be finding its way to Canada as well according to Joni Brennan, president, Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC). An effort currently underway is the Pan Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) which is an information assurance framework.</p>



<p>“We think that there’s a great opportunity here to leverage an information assurance framework, coupled with FIDO Alliance driven specifications, to create and to verify that end to end experience that’s needed for&nbsp;digital ID adoption,” she said.</p>



  



<p>The need for secured digital identities was also highlighted by Amit Mital, special assistant to the President and senior director, National Security Council at the White House.</p>



<p>“Today, when we authenticate ourselves and identify ourselves, we might use one of dozens of popular systems,” Mital said. “</p>



<p>So the ecosystem itself is very decentralized, and it’s very unharmonized. It is also fundamentally unsecure.”</p>



<p>Mital said that there is a clear need for strong remote identity solutions that can provide easy, secure, affordable and reliable ways to identify consumers across digital systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s clear that there are a diverse and large number of scenarios that need digital identity and there is no single entity that can solve all these scenarios,” Mital said. “We need an ecosystem that brings together the best ideas and innovation from the private sector, both large companies and startups, as well as the government at both the federal and the state, the local, tribal and territorial lands.”</p>



<p>Wrapping up the day’s event, Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance, observed that there are a lot of conversations ongoing about&nbsp; different types of government services and their dependency on secure digital identity.</p>

 🚀 Foundation News 
 DIF "Frequently Asked Questions" Knowledgebase 
<p>DIF has launched a massive Decentralized Identity <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/">Knowledgebase</a>, structured as a long series of frequently-asked questions and answers. This synthesizes a year of educational efforts in the interop WG, blog posts, newsletters, and many other DIF inputs in a format we hope will be helpful as a reference and onboarding document throughout the decentralized identity space.  Please peruse it, particularly the sections about your personal research focus and/or your company's specialty and products, opening issues, or PRs on GitHub wherever you feel a correction or addition is needed.  This is intended as a community resource, so PRs are open to your input, and feel free to share the document or subsections on the broader community!</p>
 H&amp;T group is looking for more technical engagement 
<p>Work on Decentralized Identities continues apace at H&amp;T. There are a number of item-based weekly calls discussing the details of various theoretical models, real-life challenges, and applied use-case scenarios for the sector. Anyone with interest is invited to join their calls and tackle the technical challenges ahead together. More details about the meeting series and how to attend: <a href="https://www.notion.so/dif/HOSPITALITY-TRAVEL-SIG-242105321e1747f8bce776bf634a55b3">Here</a></p>

 Joint working group with OIDF 
 
 The work on "OpenID Connect for SSI" specification family conducted in liaison between DIF and OpenID Foundation has been presented twice during EIC 2021, mainly featuring two specifications "Self-Issued OP v2 (SIOP v2)" and "OpenID Connect for Verifiable Presentations (OIDC4VP)". 
 Link to the slides: <a href="https://t.co/Ltey1guLWu?amp=1">https://t.co/Ltey1guLWu?amp=1</a> 
 Link to the recordings: <a href="https://t.co/lTyCZnwef1?amp=1">https://t.co/lTyCZnwef1?amp=1</a> 
 Both specs are ready to start implementing and being improved based on implementation feedback. 
 In OIDC4VP, progress has been made on using Presentation Exchange in the request-response syntax, for example, agreeing to include presentation_submission inside the signed ID token even when VP is being sent back separately as a VP Token. 
 In SIOP v2, some relevant discussions worth highlighting are how to use DIDs as Relying Party's (RP) client_id to resolve it and obtain RP's registration metadata; using universal links and trust frameworks to invoke SIOP instead of using custom URL schema.

<p>Submitted by SecureKeys' <a href="https://medium.com/@baha.abushaaban">Baha Shaaban</a>, edited by <a href="https://medium.com/@chris.lp">DIF's Chris Kelly</a>.<br></p><p>In short, ECDH-1PU is a key derivation process that allows for sender authenticity and enables a “<a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/11/what-is-perfect-forward-secrecy/#:~:text=Perfect%20forward%20secrecy%20means%20that,of%20the%20user's%20sensitive%20data.">Perfect Forward Secrecy</a>” mechanism, in addition to significant performance gains over JWS message nested in a JWE envelope, as used by existign ECDH-ES aproaches. This article walks through how ECDH-ES works step by step, showing how it achieves sender identity authentication using nested messages (JWS in JWE), and finally showing how ECDH-1PU is a better choice for authenticating the sender.

So-called “Diffie-Hellman” key exchanges ensure that messages sent over the channel they create can only be correctly interpreted by the sender and intended recipient, regardless of eavesdropping or security breaches on the communications channel.</p><p>As described in the<a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#message-encryption"> Message Encryption</a> section of the DIDComm v2 specification, the DIDComm protocol for transmitting Decentralized IDentifiers (DIDs) requires protecting a message using either Anonymous Encryption (aka `Anoncrypt`) or Sender Authenticated Encryption (aka `Authcrypt`). Either of these methods take different inputs and create a secure channel between two or more parties.</p><p>In the “AnonCrypt” handshake, there is no pre-existing “sender key” involved and it is intended for only the recipients of the message. This mechanism requires encryption with a Content Encryption Key (a “cek”) being wrapped with a key agreement mechanism using `ECDH-ES` for each recipient. DIDComm uses this “key-wrapping mode” with<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4.6"> ECDH-ES</a> to ensure only the intended recipients can decrypt the final message. The benefit of using `ECDH-ES` is that it's widely used and available in many crypto libraries for most modern languages. Building JWE envelopes using this type of encryption should be relatively easy using existing JOSE libraries in your preferred language.</p><p>“AuthCrypt'', however, requires a pre-existing (and published/discoverable) sender key to encrypt the message for the sender, and against which the sender can be authenticated. This encryption mechanism uses the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04"> ECDH-1PU</a> specification from IETF, the main topic of this article. As a growing number of independent implementations get announced, 1PU advances on the Standards Track at IETF and achieves maturity as a specification; for this reason, we are offering this educational resource so that understanding of its mechanisms can grow as well.</p> The all-important “Z” in ECDH-ES, first step in understanding ECDH-1PU <p>To understand how ECDH-1PU is significant, knowledge about the internals of ECDH-ES is required. ECDH-ES key agreement requires the sender to execute the following steps for each recipient to derive the key used to wrap the `cek`:</p><p>1. Generate an<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4.6.1.1"> ephemeral key</a> (aka `epk`).</p><p>2. Build `apu`, the producer (sender) identity. For Anoncrypt, this will represent the X value of `epk`, base64URL-encoded.</p><p>3. Build `apv`, the receiver (recipient) identity. It can optionally contain the recipient `kid`, base64URL-encoded.</p><p>4. Compute `Z`: the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4.6.2"> key derivation</a> process output of ECDH for each recipient using the above values with the **private** `epk` key and the recipient’s **public** key on the sender side. An example is found in<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#appendix-C"> appendix C</a> of the IETF RFC7518. On their end, the recipient will get the **public** `epk` and therefore does the same computation with their own **private** key.</p><p>5. Finally, the computed derived key is used to wrap the `cek`, the symmetric key used to encrypt/decrypt the payload content (the `ciphertext` section) of the JWE envelope .</p><p>So, to be clear, ECDH-ES takes as mandatory inputs an ephemeral key generated by the sender and the recipient's public key (a static long-lived key) to compute the key derivation `Z`; for this reason, the ES notation means Ephemeral-Static in ECDH-ES. This derivation fits neatly the requirement to protect messages for recipients without revealing the sender's identity (ie: no static sender key is used in the key derivation process when the recipient derives `Z`).</p> Key derivation beyond ECDH-ES to enable AuthCrypt <p>In the previous section, key derivation using an ephemeral key does not reveal who sent the message. This is useful for messages requiring anonymity of the author, e.g. a router agent receiving a message does not need to authenticate the sender in any way; its only purpose is to route the message to an end recipient. For this router agent, passing along Anoncrypt messages is acceptable.</p><p>In most cases, an end recipient requires authenticating the original sender. This means recipients will need to hold the sender's public key prior to receiving their messages in order to authenticate them. Since ECDH-ES does not involve the sender key, the only way to authenticate a sender is to nest a JWS in a JWE message which is “heavier” &nbsp;than a plain JWE-only message, i.e., more complex (i.e. expensive) to process and route.</p><p>Another, newer, option would be to use a new key derivation process that involves the sender's key.<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04"> ECDH-1PU</a> was introduced for this specific purpose; it uses the sender's static key in the key derivation process. The following section is dedicated to this process.</p> The Advantages of using ECDH-1PU (adapted from the DIDComm v2<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04#section-1"> Introduction</a>) <p></p><p>The advantages of public key authenticated encryption with ECDH-1PU<br>compared to using nested, signed-then-encrypted documents include:</p><p>Size and Efficiency</p><p>The resulting message size is more compact, as an additional layer of headers and base64url-encoding is avoided. &nbsp;A 500-byte payload when encrypted and authenticated with ECDH-1PU (with P-256 keys and "A256GCM" Content Encryption Method) results in a 1087-byte JWE in Compact Encoding. &nbsp;An equivalent, nested-then-signed-then-encrypted JOSE message using the same keys and encryption method is 1489 bytes (37% larger).</p><p>In both cases, though, the same cryptographics primitives achieve the same levels of confidentiality and authenticity, so these savings in code size, so crucial for constrained environments, come at no cost to privacy and security outcomes.</p><p>Increased Security</p><p>The generic composition of signatures and public key encryption involves a number of subtle details that are essential to security (namely, to the traits of Public Key Authenticated Encryption or<a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/12/14/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-iii/"> PKAE</a>). Providing a dedicated algorithm for public key authenticated encryption reduces complexity for users of JOSE libraries, which lowers the incidence of human error and design flaws with cybersecurity implications.</p><p>Flexibility</p><p>ECDH-1PU provides only authenticity and not the stronger security properties of non-repudiation or third-party verifiability. This can be an advantage in applications where privacy, anonymity, or plausible deniability are goals.</p> ECDH-1PU for sender authentication <p>Similar to ECDH-ES, the 1PU process executes key derivation to compute a Z but has 2 computations rather than 1, with the final result being formed by concatenating both as described here (Adapted from the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04#section-2.3"> Key Derivation</a> section of RFC7518):</p><p>1. The first is called `Ze`, which is the exact same key derivation as ECDH-ES using a private encryption provider key (`epk`) and the public recipient key on the sender side. (The recipient side will involve the public `epk` and the private recipient key).</p><p>2. The second is called `Zs`; in this second computation, we use the sender's static (long-lived) key instead of `epk`. So on the sender side we derive `Zs` by using the sender's private key and the recipient's public key. (The recipient side will use the sender's public key and the recipient's private key on their end).</p><p>The final `Z` is the concatenation of `Ze` and `Zs` which is then used in the key-wrapping, analogously to ECDH-ES.</p><p>There are special considerations in the process to protect against sender impersonation as described in Section<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04#section-2.1"> 2.1</a> of the draft:</p>  In Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode, the JWE Authentication Tag is included in the input to the Key Derivation Function as described in section Section 2.3. &nbsp;This ensures that the content of the JWE was produced by the original sender and not by another recipient, as described in the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4"> Key Management Algorithms Section</a> of the RFC.  Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode MUST only be used with content encryption algorithms that are compactly committing AEADs as described in the Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2-05"> specification</a>.  The AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 algorithms described in<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-5.2"> section 5.2</a> of RFC7518 are compactly committing and can be used with ECDH-1PU in Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode. Other content encryption algorithms MUST be rejected.  In Direct Key Agreement mode, any JWE content encryption algorithm MAY be used. This mode is NOT supported in DIDComm V2.  <p>The requirement to include the JWE Authentication Tag in the input to the Key Derivation Function implies an adjustment to the order of operations performed during JWE Message Encryption described in section 5.1 of [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516">RFC7516</a>]. &nbsp;Steps 3-8 are deferred until after step15, using the randomly generated CEK from step 2 for encryption of the message content.</p><p>To sum up, these considerations require:</p><p>1. The use of the `AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA` family of content encryption algorithms to encrypt the payload. Currently, JWE supports the following three algorithms in this family:</p><p>1. A128CBC-HS256</p><p>2. A192CBC-HS384</p><p>3. A256CBC-HS512</p><p>Note, however, that the DIDComm v2 specification<a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#curves-and-content-encryption-algorithms"> constrains payload encryption options</a> to minimize interoperability issues across implementations, so only the third-listed encryption algorithm, A256CBC-HS512, should be used for DIDComm v2 purposes.</p><p>2. Encrypt the payload prior to wrapping `cek` with the derived `Z`. The output is labelled `ciphertext` and `tag`</p><p>3. Use the resulting `tag` from the previous step as the value `len(tag)`+`tag` set in `cctag` in the key derivations of `Ze` and `Zs`.</p><p>Additionally, the `skid` protected header is also introduced as a `kid` (key ID) to reference the sender key. This will help recipients resolve the key behind `skid` and execute the ECDH-1PU process explained in the previous section.</p><p>For the sake of consistency, `apu` and `apv` must be set to the values mentioned in<a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#ecdh-1pu-key-wrapping-and-common-protected-headers"> section 5.8</a> of the DIDComm Messaging protocol to further restrain and protect the message.</p> Conclusion <p><br>ECDH-1PU is a public-key derivation process that allows for sender authentication and offers not only increased security, but also performance gains as mentioned above, especially when compared to a JWS message nested in a JWE envelope. This article walked through the implementation of ECDH-ES, showing how it achieves sender identity authentication using nested messages (JWS in JWE), and finally showing how ECDH-1PU is a better choice for authenticating the sender. This helps maintain the use of a single JWE message (without JWS) to meet the need for constrained agents (such as IOT devices) by reducing their communication footprint, as well as making it suitable where anonymity and privacy are of particular concern.<br></p><p>To find out more about joining the DIDComm Working Group at DIF, visit their page<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html"> here</a>, or follow their work on GitHub<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging"> here</a>.<br><br><br><br></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2018, Var Group entered the capital of commercio.network, one of the most innovative European blockchains. In fact, commercio.network is focused not on cryptocurrencies but rather on three crucial topics of digital transformation for companies:</p>
 
 E-identity. Identity management respecting privacy 
 E-signature The management of advanced electronic signatures 
 E-delivery Certified delivery of documents and proof of their existence 
 
<p>Var group, through its BlockIT company, became one of 100 independent validator nodes on July 4, 2020. The commercio.network blockchain &nbsp;instead of using electricity to validate its network, &nbsp;uses a new consensus algorithm called POS. This consensus mechanism consumes in a year what Bitcoin consumes in a minute, making it the most sustainable blockchain in the world and consequently the cheapest in the world as each transaction costs only a euro cent plus VAT</p>
<p>From July 4, 2021 Commerc.io srl offers the opportunity to all independent developers to use its commerce.app platform to create applications. commerce.app allows to solve the problem of wallet security through a fully-hosted platform based on HSM devices and programmable via API.</p>
<p>For developers participating in Var Group’s hackathon, commercio.io has provided two free online seminars consisting of 10 one-minute videos that explain respectively:</p>
<p>How to do business with blockchain :(in italian only) &nbsp;in which it is finally explained the substantial difference between blockchain and Internet and 36 use cases of applications to be developed related to 36 big problems that can be solved only through the blockchain of Commerce network. The video is available at the link <a href="https://commerc.io/farebusiness">https://commerc.io/farebusiness &nbsp; </a>Using the invitation code: VarGroup</p>
<p>How to make apps with blockchain:&nbsp; (in italian only) &nbsp;a seminar explaining how to use the Commerce.app , a managed wallet platform that provides a set of APIs to develop any application on Commerce.network. This platform allows developers to save 99% of time and cost to create any application after a few minutes and not months.

				 <p>I am proud to say our Board now spans 4 continents after Dixon joins us. This is a testimony to human-centric data infrastructure being on track to become a global standard.</p>
<p>As the Data Strategy and the Data Spaces are being put in place in Europe, as the new US Administration is questioning the operating practices of global platforms, as new digital public and private services are created the world over, it is critical our approach over Personal Data Sharing is truly Global, and brings elements which are not just influenced by the framework of the European Data Strategy we help shape, but is the mirror of the actual needs of individuals, tech-savvy or not, and the realities of a very competitive market. This is why we are thankful Dixon has agreed to join us, bringing his experience of Chief Evangelist of Personium which is the only open-source personal data store platform in Japan.</p>
<p>In parallel to his role at Personium, Dixon is a software engineer at Fujitsu Limited. Currently, he is also leading the MyData movement within Fujitsu.</p>
<p>After attending MyData 2018, he was moved by the passionate people involved and is now heavily involved in the overall MyData movement in Europe, Asia, and Global South. He also drives human-centric projects in areas like data interoperability, child data protection with UNESCO, and common data platform for the next pandemic.</p>

				 <p>A Decentralized Key Management Infrastructure (DKMI) is essential to any SSI&nbsp;implementation. DKMI is the cryptographic infrastructure upon which the necessary&nbsp;authentication keys are exchanged between SSI actors. In 2020, a new type of ultra-secure,&nbsp;ledger agnostic DKMI made its way through the SSI community: Key Event Receipt&nbsp;Infrastructure (KERI). Currently being developed by DIF (the Decentralized Identity<br>Foundation) KERI is making its first appearance in real world applications as the first&nbsp;truly &amp; fully decentralized identity system.</p>
<p>With KERI Ecosystem components developers of SSI solutions will be able to:</p>
 
 move between networks and ledgers with your identifiers (can work with blockchain and non-blockchained networks) 
 delegate identifier to another identity (no matter on which network or system it was created) 
 provide key provenance log for production ready Verifiable Credential management 
 recovery from key lost through pre-rotation event 
 use your identifiers at scale 
 resolve any identifier through Distributed Hash Table algorithms without relying on centralize resolver or network. 
 operate with any type of Verifiable Credentials across network

				 <p>DOOR empowers participating entities in the ESSIF-Framework to establish trust by providing strong verifiable evidence and assurances on the origin and integrity of the presented verifiable credentials. DOOR achieves this goal by building a trusted layer between interacting parties that is based on strong cryptographic privacy-preserving tools. In this way, DOOR can enable the handling of VCs requiring higher level of assurances locally at the holder’s wallet.</p>
<p>We achieve the above goal by providing a new component on the Holder side that enables the use of hardware-based keys and offers the possibility to bind Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to the wallet of the holder. In this way, we transfer the root of trust of the SSI ecosystem purely on the digital wallet by considering an underlying Trusted Component as part of the wallet, without making any assumptions on the trustworthiness of the other layers.</p>
<p>Innovators can build on our extension to integrate hardware-based keys and bring trust to the holder’s wallets, thus, enabling the vision of a decentralized data protected approach for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Since the DOOR component is agnostic to the implementation of the wallet and the type of the VC Data Model considered (e.g. W3C or Indy), multiple SSI ecosystems can interoperate in a trustworthy manner. Overall, innovators can use our component to create a hardware-based trust anchor and build services that offer a high level of assurance.</p>

				 <p>The Aries Mobile SDK is a complete toolkit for cross-platform iOS and Android development using React Native. With this one SDK, developers can build mobile SSI solutions for any use case. The SDK contains reusable issuer, holder and verifier components as well as essential components for mobile development (e.g. deeplinking, state management, biometric wallet unlocking). Developers can either start from scratch or integrate a selection of components into their existing mobile app. The Aries Mobile SDK is credential format and DID method agnostic, it uses the latest open standards to break out of the Indy &amp; Aries ecosystem (e.g. W3C VCs, DIF PE, BBS+ Signatures).<br>The Aries Mobile SDK is 100% open-source, focuses on interoperability and open standards and is accessible for developers of any skill level. It aims to drastically lower the barrier of mobile SSI development.</p>
<p>The Aries Mobile SDK is built on top of Aries Framework JavaScript. Modules combine all recurring flows into high-level methods, allowing to e.g. create a connection and issue a revocable credential in a few lines of code.<br>The SDK uses DIDComm for secure and encrypted communication between agents. Aries protocols (AIP2.0) are used for creating connections and exchanging credentials (Indy, JSON-LD) and presentations (Indy, DIF PE). BBS+ signatures are used for W3C compliant privacy preserving VCs. Aries Askar provides encrypted storage as well as cryptographic methods used for encrypting DIDComm messages (V2 ready) and signing credentials (e.g. ed25519, bbs, p256, secp256k1). Interoperable mediation standards allow any agent to be used as a cloud-based connection point for mobile devices (e.g. ACA-Py, AF-GO). New React Native Codegen and Turbomodules are utilized to write a cross-platform wrapper around native rust libraries (Aries Askar, Indy Credx, Indy VDR) (design).</p>

				 <p>SSI-powered interactions need to be trustworthy and safe for all participants in order to achieve widespread adoption. In addition to technical assurance through cryptography, human trust must be achieved through governance. These capabilities must usable offline, transparent to wallet holders, and configurable by enterprises.</p>
<p>Trust Registries are one of the critical components of machine-readable governance frameworks. Through this component, holders can avoid coercion by verifying the verifier; verifiers can discern offline which issuers they trust; issuers can communicate to holders which governance framework they are associated with. It will lead to additional safety and confidence for all participants.</p>
<p>Component Description<br> A trust registry maintains a list of all authorized entities in a trust ecosystem, the types of data they’re authorized to exchange, and the operations they’re to perform on those types.<br> The registry supports operations to register, revoke, and query for authorizations granted to entities on data type operations within a trust ecosystem. For example, authorizing a specific university to issue a diploma. The core of the solution is developing authorization rules engine that is able custom defined policies based on the requirements of a trust registry.<br> This solution will use NIST recommended approach to Role-Based-Access-Control (RBAC) authorization implemented in a popular language. The solution will be pluggable to existing infrastructures as a microservice module running in a container instance.</p>
<p>Integration with TRAIN<br> Our component is a spec and implementation of a trust registry, using <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/essif-train-by-fraunhofer-gesellschaft/">TRAIN</a> as a starting point. First, we will finalize the spec provided previously in a ToIP working group. Then, instead of building from scratch, we will use TRAIN as a starting point and champion it within the Covid credential and ToIP groups we’re a part of. The result is an API that enables more than just querying DNS for issuer records; support for DIDs in addition to DNS, holders verifying issuers and verifiers, offline functionality, and role-based programmatic governance over the types of credentials organizations are authorized to issue/verify are included.<br> Ultimately, this becomes a foundational element of machine-readable governance frameworks. It also bridges the TRAIN and ToIP communities with a solution that meets both requirements. Finally, it discourages others from splintering the community with bespoke solutions. All of which are important to scale SSI to meet the complex demands of global adoption.</p>

<p>This summer, we’ve been iterating through an article intended to talk
about the success that Blockchain Commons has had working with the Wyoming
legislature to help to define a first-in-the-country legal definition
of digital identity.</p>

<p>The Digital Identity Working Group for the Wyoming Select Committee on
Blockchain meets again next week, on September 21-22, 2021. I will be
providing testimony there at 2pm MST. As a result, we’ve decided to
release the current draft of this article on digital identity and how
Wyoming has defined it using Principal Authority, with the goal of
helping to shape the agenda for digital identity for the next year,
both in Wyoming and elsewhere.</p>

<p>—Christopher Allen</p>

 

<p>In 2016, I wrote <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">“The Path to Self-Sovereign
Identity”</a>
to talk about the historic evolution from centralized identity to
user-centric identity and to define the next step: a self-sovereign
digital identity that was controlled by the user, not some third party.
In it I also offered <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md">10 Self-Sovereign Identity
Principles</a>
which have been widely accepted by the decentralized identity community.</p>

<p>Self-sovereign identity has matured and grown considerably since, as I
chronicled in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-five-years-on">“Self-Sovereign Identity: Five Years
On”</a>.
There are now specifications, products, and entire companies supporting
the concept. However, recent legal efforts to define self-sovereign
identity may be just as important for catapulting it into the mass
market.</p>

 Defining Identity 

<p>Defining identity is by no means easy. That core topic could encompass a
paper much longer than this. The following are some various definitions
of identity drawn from the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot10-buenosaires/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/glossary-primer.md">RWOT
Glossary</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Identifier: A label that refers to an entity and can be used to establish or maintain an identity. For example, a name or UID.</p>

  <p>Identity: A conceptual construct that enables the differentiation between distinct entities that are individually considered to be unique, but which may possess class or group characteristics. An identity gives these entities the ability to interact as peers in collaborative or competitive ways. It is not the entity that it represents.</p>

  <p>Identity, Digital: A digital representation of an entity, managed by digital tools, over which that entity has personal or delegated control.</p>

  <p>Identity, Functional: How we recognize, remember and respond to specific people and things.</p>

  <p>SSI: Self-sovereign identity. A decentralized digital identity that does not depend on any centralized authority and whose information is portable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Digital identity is just one aspect of a complex, interconnected web of
different digital models. It’s not the same thing as identification
(where you prove you are a distinct entity with unique characteristics),
authentication (where you prove you were the same entity as before), or
personal data (which is information related to an identified or
identifiable entity).</p>

<p>Those other elements all need to be considered, but it’s digital
identity, and now self-sovereign identity, that gives us the linchpin to
do so.</p>

 Turning Digital Identity into Law 

<p>For self-sovereign identity to truly achieve international success, I
feel that it needs to not just be embraced by the technological sector,
but also to have a basis in law. In recent years, I’ve been progressing
toward that goal through work with various state and national
legislatures.</p>

<p>Collaborating with the Wyoming legislature has borne the first fruit.
This year they passed
<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">SF0039</a> on digital
identity, which the Governor signed into law and which went into effect
on July 1, 2021. It defines digital identity as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(xviii) “Personal digital identity” means the intangible digital
representation of, by and for a natural person, over which he has
principal authority and through which he intentionally communicates or
acts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So where’s the self-sovereign identity in that?</p>

<p>As with much legislation, it’s all about the careful selection of words.</p>

 Defining Principal Authority 

<p>To understand how Principal Authority relates to self-sovereign identity
requires insight into what Principal Authority is. The concept comes out
of English Common law. It appears in most Commonwealth countries but has
also found its way into the laws of other countries, including the
United States. It’s primarily used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency">Laws of
Agency</a>, an area of
commercial law where an agent is empowered to take on certain tasks.</p>

<p>As the name would suggest, Principal Authority first requires a
Principal: a person or entity. It then requires that entity have
Authority: some power. Principal Authority is thus the power derived
from a person or entity, which they can use or which they can delegate
out to others. When applied to digital identity, Principal Authority
says that a Principal has Authority over his identity — which is a clear
restatement of self-sovereign principles.</p>

<p>In fact, the recognition of a Principal is itself a statement of the
first of the principles of self-sovereign identity: existence. It
asserts that digital identity is always a representation of an actual
entity, who predates any digital representation, and who is also the
first and foremost beneficiary of that representation.</p>

<p>However, in drawing on the Laws of Agency, the concepts of Principal and
Principal Authority go beyond that. Because the person at the heart of
an identity has the ultimate power to control the self-sovereign digital
representation that they’ve created (and/or that they use), this means
that any others who exert Principal Authority over that identity data
are doing so only as agents of the Principal.</p>

<p>By focusing on Agency, the concept of Principal Authority also ensures
that the Principal always has the ability to revoke their delegation to
the agents whom they have temporarily offered Authority regarding their
identity. This is a requirement for other self-sovereign principles such
as portability, and it’s a real necessity in the digital world, where
we might need to delete personal data or to cancel Terms &amp; Conditions
that we signed without real, informed consent.</p>

<p>Altogether, this new definition of Principal Authority adds a lot of
nuance to self-sovereign identity, and much of that comes thanks to the
implicit incorporation of Agency.</p>

 Defining Control 

<p>In saying that a Principal has the ultimate authority to control their
digital identity, care also needs to be taken to define what that
control means. It means that a Principal has (or can delegate) the
Principal Authority to identify as that identity; to authenticate as
that identity; and to know the contents of the data held by that
identity.</p>

<p>However, any digital identity also exists as part of a larger ecosystem,
and the Principal does not have control over the larger ecosystem. They
cannot control how other entities rate, rank, or note the reputation
of their identity; and they cannot control comments, flags, or other
notes that other entities might attach to their identity.</p>

<p>Further, a Principal cannot necessarily prevent other entities from
creating new digital identities related to them, which may or may not
link to an existing identity. (Though states are increasingly
recognizing the limits of voluntary disclosure of information, digital
identity laws will ultimately never prevent a police station from
creating their own identity record related to a criminal, or a civic
authority from creating government-related identity records.)</p>

<p>In other words, self-sovereign identity, and the establishment of
Principal Authority over it, lays down boundaries for what the Principal
controls — boundaries that are much wider than those established for
digital identities controlled by third parties. However, those
boundaries still exist.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, control of a digital identity means that the Principal
can expect to maintain the continuity of that identity for as long as
they see fit, but in doing so must accept the battle scars inflicted by
interactions in a larger ecosystem that are implicit to the identity
itself.</p>

 Agents &amp; Their Duty 

<p>The ability to delegate Principal Authority, as revealed by the Laws of
Agency, may be as crucial to self-sovereign identity as the concept of a
Principal itself. It allows the empowerment of agents by a Principal —
who might be physical agents or, in the increasingly digital world,
virtual agents. But, it also institutes the core requirement that those
agents be working for the good of the Principal when they are exerting
Principal Authority over the identity holder’s identity data.</p>

<p>This concept of “duty” is crucial to the Laws of Agency. Duty requires
that an Agent only use their delegated Principal Authority as the
Principal requests, in a way that benefits the Principal, and with care
and due diligence, while frequently reporting back what they’ve done.</p>

<p>This is a notable change from the way that digital identities have been
treated traditionally. Compare that to banks, who represent you in
financial transactions, and then sell your spending data; compare that
to Facebook, who collects as much personally identifiable data and other
information as you’re willing to give them, then sells that to
advertisers; or compare it to Google, who infers personally identifiable
and demographic data based on the information you input into their tools
and the choices you make. In large part, you don’t even know what these
identity representatives and data holders are doing. In the world before
<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">Europe’s GDPR</a> or <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California’s
CCPA</a>, you had little input into their
actions. Even now, with those early and rough attempts to protect
digital self-sovereignty, you’re typically opting-out, not opting-in —
which is barely agency at all —&nbsp;and you’re still not protected against
people who are self-serving nor those who are inferring information from
scattered pieces of data.</p>

<p>That’s because any duties currently required of the entities to whom you
grant agency over your data are quite minimal. Maybe there’s a duty of
privacy, maybe there’s a duty of safety, but in general they don’t need
to work in your best interest. That’s why we need to ensure that new
definitions of digital identity, particularly self-sovereign identity,
follow the Laws of Agency in ways that our current systems do not.</p>

<p>This sort of agent agreement needs to be part of delegation. To date,
this has been true to a limited extent with federation protocols such as
SAML and Oauth, but that needs to be extended to every person. Wyoming’s
digital-identity law is the first example of legislation that focuses on
Agency in this way, and that’s much of its power.</p>

<p>However, this isn’t a simple issue. Even with Agency-focused
legislation, we need to determine a source for duties. This article will
try to outline some of them, using not just the traditional duties of
agents, but also the self-sovereign principles themselves. However, it’s
a mere starting point, with a stronger legal foundation required.</p>

 Principal Authority &amp; The State 

<p>Before defining duties, it’s important to note one other interesting
element of Principal Authority and its foundation in Agency: it focuses
not just on a single person’s authority, but also on their ability to
delegate to and require duties from other entities. In other words, it’s
a peer-to-peer relationship; this relationship works within the context
of a state who recognizes the concept of Principal Authority, respects
its ability to enable Agency, and enforces its established duties.</p>

<p>However, though the state is involved, this peer-to-peer relationship
still lies in stark contrast to traditional property law, where property
is always in some way beholden to the state: the state might be the
original source for property, they might be able to reclaim it by
eminent domain, and they might be able to seize it through asset
forfeiture. Those ideas all run counter to the idea of self-sovereignty
— which is yet another reason that we choose to focus on the Agency of
Principal Authority, not property law, as the core legal metaphor for
self-sovereign identity.</p>

 Restating the Self-Sovereign Principles 

<p>The use of Principal Authority to empower self-sovereign identity
provides a legal foothold for many of my original 10 principles.</p>

<p>What follows is a restatement of the self-sovereign principles that
reorganizes the original ten as rights and duties that are suggested by
customs, expectations, and best practices, but which need to be better
codified to become true duties. It also proposes five additional duties
that could come from customs implicit in the Laws of Agency.</p>

<p>Together, these ideas may allow us to both better understand how to turn
the self-sovereign principles into concrete usage and also to more
easily translate them into duties bound by legislation.</p>

 The Rights of Self-Sovereign Authority 

<p>Some principles of self-sovereign identity are implicit in the idea of
a Principal.</p>

 
   Existence. The definition of Principal requires that there be a real entity at an identity’s heart. 
   Control. The definition of Principal Authority says that the Principal always retains control of an identity, within specifically defined boundaries, no matter who is holding it at a particular time. 
   Persistence. Because of their uncontested Principal Authority, a Principal may decide to have an identity last for as long as they see fit. 
   Consent. Anything that happens within the defined boundaries of the digital identity is implicitly with the consent of the Principal, who may delegate or revoke Principal Authority at any time. 
 

<p>Self-sovereign rights recognize that an identity exists to benefit its
Principal. These core principles likely derive explicitly from a
definition of digital identity such as that created by the Wyoming
legislature.</p>

 The Duties of Self-Sovereign Identity 

<p>The remaining principles of self-sovereign identity can be stated as
duties owed to a Principal by an agent who has been granted Principal
Authority over an identity for certain purposes.</p>

 
   Access. An agent must provide the Principal with access to data related to their digital identity. 
   Transparency. An agent must be open about how they will administer a digital identity. 
   Portability. An agent must make a digital identity portable upon the request of the Principal. 
   Interoperability. An agent must use standard, interoperable protocols when making an identity portable, and should also use those interoperable protocols when interacting with other identity systems. 
   Minimization. An agent must minimize the data collected, stored, transmitted, and shared regarding an identity so that it only includes data that is strictly necessary in the context of a request made by the Principal. 
   Protection. An agent must place the protection of the identity above their own needs or desires. 
 

<p>Identity duties says that agents will tell you how they’re using your
identity, use it in the most minimalist way possible, and make it easy
for you to reclaim the identity. However, legislation may be required to
turn these best practices into duties bound by law.</p>

 The Duties of Self-Sovereign Agents 

<p>The idea of Principal Authority itself suggests additional duties that
were not included on the original list of principles of self-sovereign
identity, but which are generally defined in the Laws of Agency to be
due from agents to Principals.</p>

 
   Specificity. An Agent will use Principal Authority to serve specific tasks as instructed by the Principal, or as required by Custom, and do nothing more with an identity. 
   Responsibility. An agent will serve those tasks with reasonable care and skill, with due diligence, and without further delegation. 
   Representation. An agent will act in the best interests of the Principal, without secret profit, and will not take on other responsibilities that might conflict with that. 
   Fidelity. An agent will serve those tasks in good faith. 
   Disclosure. An agent will maintain accounts and report their actions back to the Principal. 
 

<p>Agent duties say that agents will be trustworthy in their use of your
identity. These duties are more likely to implicitly be a part of any
legislation that was built atop the Laws of Agency.</p>

 Taking the Next Steps 

<p>Wyoming’s definition of personal digital identity helps us to lay more
foundation for self-sovereign identity, but it’s still just a starting
point.</p>

<p>There’s more to do.</p>

 Laws of Custom 

<p>To start with, the Laws of Agency are largely built on Laws of Custom,
which are as likely to be common law as any formally codified
legislation. When creating new laws related to self-sovereign identity,
we’ll be creating new Laws of Customs for the digital frontier, an area
that’s so fresh that the tradition of customs has been limited.</p>

<p>This creates real challenges, as we must decide what customs we want to
create and then we must develop them from common law to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_law">legal
customs</a> to (eventually)
codified duties. We can integrate these with the Laws of Agency, and we
can figure out how that interrelates with old common laws such as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_(law)">Use Laws</a>. We may even need
special courts to set these common laws and achieve remedies, such as
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Chancery">Court of
Chancery</a>.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, there’s a lot of work to be done here; recognizing the
existence of a Principal and the use of delegatable Principal Authority
bound by the Laws of Agency is just a starting place. New customs, even
though understood as best practices, will not automatically become legal
duties.</p>

 Open Questions 

<p>Beyond that, I’m not a lawyer. There may be other legal elements that
can support our definition of digital identity. Are there additional
duties that we could bring in? Are there fiduciary or agency laws that
we could leverage? Are there other legal models of interest we can draw
from, such as the UNCITRAL Model Law of Electronic Commerce approach,
which says that “The actions, promises, rights and obligations of a
person shall not be denied legal validity on the sole ground they are
effectuated through their digital identity”? These possibilities need to
be studied, preferably with the help of legal experts.</p>

<p>Even once we’ve fully defined digital identity, we still must consider
how digital identity may need to be more carefully protected. Are there
ways we can give specific protection to private keys used for signatures
and to express authority? Can we protect against the theft of private
keys that might allow impersonation or false witness? Can we prevent the
misuse of digital biometric or genetic information? Can we protect
against other “crimes of authority”?</p>

<p>There’s also a flipside: digital identity should give us some new
advantages not found in traditional identity. For example, there have
always been problems with individuals with low market power being at a
disadvantage when negotiating with larger parties. Can new digital
identity laws help start to resolve that imbalance?</p>

 Final Notes 

<p>One of the most important steps going forward will be to continue
working with the Digital Identity subcommittee in the Wyoming
legislature. However, I’d also welcome discussions with other states and
nations, to ensure that we have great definitions of digital identity
that support self-sovereign identity everywhere.</p>

<p>If this is important to you too, consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">supporting Blockchain
Commons</a> to make this a
reality.</p>

  How the HOPR network is using Ceramic to provide off-chain logging information to node runners, while keeping the data private.

<p>The HOPR protocol is a layer-0 privacy foundation for the new generation of decentralized applications. The incentivized HOPR mixnet lets any application send data without leaking data or metadata. HOPR nodes will rely on Ceramic to track node payments without sacrificing user privacy. <br><br>Interested in learning more about the privacy protocol? Visit <a href="https://hoprnet.org/">HOPRnet.org</a> to run a node yourself.</p> Encryption is not enough for privacy  <p>Standard end-to-end encryption does not provide sufficient privacy, because it still leaks important metadata, such as who is exchanging data, when, and how often. Given enough metadata, global adversaries and private companies can identify your behavior across multiple applications, even when the content of the traffic you exchange remains encrypted. Services like VPNs can hide your information from your internet service provider (ISP) but can’t protect you from the general fingerprinting of your browser, mobile devices and websites visits on a daily basis. Over time, this online behavior creates a profile that can be traced.</p><p>HOPR addresses this challenge by ensuring all the data and metadata you produce and consume online stays private. To do this, HOPR feeds content through a state-of-the-art mixnet - the HOPR network. </p> The HOPR protocol <p>HOPR incentivizes node runners who relay packets using its own currency, the HOPR token. Messages routed through the network are embedded with HOPR tokens in the form of “tickets” to pay each node along the route. HOPR’s proof of relay mechanism ensures a node can’t claim a ticket until the data packet is relayed to the next downstream node. This creates positive incentives for nodes to be good actors in the network. Tickets are cashed out via an Ethereum compatible blockchain (EVM) but are not always valid. This probabilistic payment system ensures a node’s online behavior can not be analyzed using timing attacks.</p><p>To ensure privacy at any level of network usage, the HOPR network is constantly fed with cover traffic: arbitrary data which provides cover for real users. This is particularly important in the early years of the network, when usage will understandably be lower.</p><p>The HOPR Association has allocated 250M HOPR tokens to cover traffic, to be released over four years. These will be issued anonymously by nodes sponsored by the HOPR Association and routed through nodes based on multiple parameters including HOPR tokens staked, amount of channels open, and general connectivity.</p> Verify off-chain activity without compromising privacy <p>This incentivized cover traffic system, combined with proof of relay, is what sets HOPR apart from other privacy networks, which either lack the proper incentives to scale or end up compromising on privacy or decentralization. Privacy networks are very challenging to develop and then test - how can you monitor and verify node activity without sacrificing privacy? <br><br>This is particularly important for the development of cover traffic and the long-term economic balancing of the network. Since running HOPR nodes incurs electricity and internet bandwidth costs, it’s important to be able to distinguish between the kickstarter cover traffic (artificially high for the first four years) and real traffic (initially minimal, but growing as the network scales). <br><br>Tickets issued by cover traffic can be tagged as such and shared off-chain. This would allow analysis but prevent inspection by other nodes. The HOPR team needed a reliable way to implement this approach, since simply logging this information in a decentralized IPFS node, which anyone can add data, would allow &nbsp;information about cover traffic metrics to be skewed or manipulated by any party in the network.</p> Using Ceramic to create a decentralized monitoring tool for HOPR nodes <p>Using Ceramic, HOPR can propagate user-specific data and allow node runners to inspect and share their node's information as needed. To do this, nodes create a log entry in a Ceramic Stream, a DAG-based data structure for storing continuous, mutable streams of content on IPFS, every time they receive a particular message (for example, one with the cover traffic tag). Since this information is published with the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1">secp256k1</a> private key used by the HOPR nodes, this information can be connected to a HOPR node and verified as such. This prevents outside manipulation of data.</p><p>HOPR node runners can use the HOPR dashboard to see their node data, and by checking the Ceramic Streams pinned by their nodes, obtain meaningful information about the cover traffic sent to their nodes. In this way, Ceramic not only helps HOPR developers, but also allows users themselves to verify the state of the network without involuntarily compromising their privacy.</p><p>Previous iterations of HOPR testnets issued unverifiable cover traffic via a bot, which was cumbersome and of limited utility. Thanks to Ceramic, HOPR nodes can now easily compare notes and assess their own ability to connect to other nodes.</p><p>The HOPR Network is the first of its kind using Ceramic to log decentralized data for an open-source protocol, and we believe this approach can be used by any project which relies on peer-to-peer off-chain data, which would otherwise be unverifiable.</p> Using IDX to connect HOPR nodes to external accounts <p>Since HOPR nodes have their own private keys, which need to quickly sign and submit transactions on-chain, each node has a unique private identity. This is extremely important for privacy, but it also makes engaging with a community of node runners challenging. As a result, it wasn't trivial for the HOPR team to link HOPR node runners to another digital identity, enrich node runner data, or perform promotional actions linked to their <a href="https://stake.hoprnet.org/">staking program</a>, which would be trivial in a centralized (but not private) setting. This is where Ceramic provides a lot more flexibility.</p><p>The identities of HOPR node runners are private, but they don’t have to be anonymous. It’s possible to connect node runners with another digital identity, as long as that connection is verifiable.<br><br>The HOPR team has already started using Ceramic’s identity protocol, IDX, for this use case in a recent testnet on the Polygon network. HOPR nodes leverage IDX to connect to external Ethereum accounts outside of the HOPR network. With IDX, HOPR nodes now have the ability to sign an Ethereum account, enabling users to connect their nodes with an existing pseudonymous digital identity - real or not.</p> What's next for HOPR? <p>In the coming weeks, the HOPR team will start to test our cover traffic nodes, which will become the cornerstone for the HOPR network. The HOPR Association will continue to run testnets with the community to finetune the HOPR protocol. From there, node adoption and development of the protocol will continue alongside the community. The HOPR team will continue to use Ceramic to strike the right balance between data gathering and privacy.</p><p>We’re excited about what’s next to come for the HOPR team and the impact they'll have on data privacy.

  <p>There are currently a few initiatives around the world that want to develop digital vaccination records and bring them to market. However, the past has shown that even established solutions such as the international vaccination certificate (“Yellow Card”) cannot be digitized so easily. The current OwnYourData research project IDunion – funded by the “IKT der Zukunft” program from the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology in Austria (<a href="https://projekte.ffg.at/projekt/4125456">FFG Projekt 887052</a>) – aims to adapt the previously <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/hall-of-fame/dip/">NGI DAPSI project “Digital Immunization Passport”</a> for the Austrian market and to develop a functional prototype in order to examine the business, legal, technical and social aspects of such a solution and to discuss them in a broader public.<br>
Technically, the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) network offers interesting opportunities for citizens, authorities, and companies, a new form of trusting cooperation. Through a cooperation with the <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion SSI network</a> in Germany, we take the opportunity to test this technology specifically for the administration of COVID-19 test certificates from individuals in Austria.<br>
Legally, it is necessary to define, document and enforce any data exchange through clearly defined terms of use. We will continue to expand the existing concept of usage policies and use semantic technologies to show that this enables an automated and GDPR-compliant implementation of consent management.<br>
The big economic challenge is how health authorities and SMEs can access personal data in order to benefit from the potential of personal data just like internet companies. In this project, we present a technology platform that offers small and medium-sized businesses a simple approach to the use of SSI networks for managing digital certificates and enable them to exchange data between citizens and authorities / companies.<br>
The social aspect of this solution is based on the human-centered approach of handling personal data. In this project, the citizen is the point of integration of all health-related data streams and has the option of managing COVID-19 test certificates either in a digital wallet on the smartphone, or also operating a personal data store in order to manage their own personal data in a self-sovereign way.<br>
This project offers the opportunity to try out new architectures and technologies for an acute social and health issue. It is not a project that will make a solution immediately available, but it shows fundamental possibilities for a new approach to human-centered technology. This research project lays the foundation for developing the most secure and most modern health passport for Austria.</p>

  <p>We do not have to look back further than the global economic collapse of 2008 to fully understand the worst-case scenario of unverified legal entities engaging in financial transactions. The LEI was created at the request of the G20 and Financial Stability Board (FSB) in response to this global catastrophe. Its objective is to provide a means to uniquely identify any legally distinct entity that engages in a transaction and subsequently reduce fraud and mitigate risk within the ecosystem. </p>
<p>With the LEI’s origin and objective in mind, it follows naturally that it offers potentially immeasurable value too when it comes to delivering transparency and trust in payment transactions. This value is widely recognized among many payment industry insiders, and in recent years, there has been burgeoning appetite and advocacy for LEI usage in a broad range of payments use cases. There has been significant industry-wide progress with two concrete mandates for LEI usage recently emanating from the Reserve Bank of India and the Bank of England in specific payment applications. Additionally, many regions and regulators are consulting on transformation within the ecosystem, and considering what role the LEI could play as a result. Since early 2020, GLEIF has shared information with regulatory authorities and organizations in the payments space on the LEI and its credentials in identity management via nine public consultations. Many more are anticipated in the years ahead.   </p>
<p>Below is a summary of key recent developments within the payments’ arena, which demonstrate widening acceptance of the LEI as a tool capable of delivering an enhanced global payments ecosystem.    </p>
<p>Mandate: LEI for Large Value Transactions </p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has introduced a new mandate for the use of the LEI for all payment transactions of the value ₹50 crore (approximately €5.5 million) and above for entities using the Reserve Bank-run Centralized Payment Systems viz. Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT). By 1 April 2021, banks had to ensure that all remitter and beneficiary information in RTGS and NEFT payment messages were populated with the LEI. Data showed that in Q1 2021, India was ranked fifth in terms of the jurisdictions with the highest rate of LEI growth. This offers an indication of the mandate’s impact on LEI issuance.   </p>
<p>A strong proponent for the LEI, the RBI had earlier introduced it as a requirement in over the counter (OTC) derivative and non-derivative markets and large corporate borrowers.</p>
<p>The RBI’s use of the LEI to verify the identity of participants in large value transactions is the first use case of its kind. Yet the potential risk management advantages it offers make it a compelling tactic that other central banks may wish to consider adopting.   </p>
<p>Mandate: LEI in CHAPS Payments Message Standard (ISO 20022)  </p>
<p>In December 2020, The Bank of England (BoE) published its ‘Policy Statement: Implementing ISO 20022 Enhanced data in CHAPS’. Within the document, the BoE reaffirms its proactive position “to support the wider uptake of the LEI - beyond the financial sector - to corporates. […] the Bank believes wider uptake of the LEI could unlock a number of key benefits and is working with Government and national and international stakeholders to promote LEI use cases. These include their potential role in enhancing cross-border payments as part of the Financial Stability Board’s roadmap, as well as the role the LEI can play to help tackle financial crime.”</p>
<p>The paper confirms the BoE’s long-held intention to “introduce the LEI into the CHAPS payment message standard when migrating to ISO 20022, in line with industry views and international consensus, including HVPSplus and CBPRplus guidance.”</p>
<p>It then sets out the following initial phasing timeline:  </p>
 
 February 2023: LEIs will be introduced into ISO 20022 standard CHAPS payment messages on an ‘optional to send’ basis. While the BoE encourages all CHAPS Direct Participants to start using LEIs as early as possible, it will not become mandatory until spring 2024.  
 Spring 2024: The BoE will begin mandating LEIs to be used in by certain circumstances, with a vision to widen out the requirement to all participants over time. The BoE will mandate the use of the LEI where the payment involves a transfer of funds between Financial Institutions.  
 
<p>Within the report the BoE notes that the earlier firms adopt the LEI, the sooner they will derive its benefits. It also states an intention for the BoE to monitor the use of LEI for all transactions, with a view to assessing whether the mandatory requirement to include LEI data should be extended to all CHAPS payments. Industry will be provided with at least 18 months’ advance notice if the BoE extends any mandatory LEI requirements. </p>
<p>Consultation: Cross Border Payments </p>
<p>In February this year, GLEIF published a blog exploring the FSB’s support for the LEI in its Stage 3 roadmap on Enhancing Cross-Border Payments. In that publication, the FSB lists several focus areas that require global coordination and action to overcome the challenges and frictions in cross-border payments. Of particular note is the identification of ‘Establish Unique Identifiers with proxy registries’ as a key building block in the FSB’s roadmap to enhanced cross-border payments. </p>
<p>An action-oriented framework is laid out in the roadmap, which commits the FSB and GLEIF to collaborate in consultation with other prominent stakeholders to: “explore the scope for, and obstacles to develop, a global Unique Identifier (UI) for cross border payments and potentially other financial transactions, that takes into account existing identifiers including the LEI for legal entities….” This collaborative work effort is scheduled to run from October 2020 until December 2021 and GLEIF welcomes the opportunity to engage with it.</p>
<p>Additionally, as a further action mapped to the same ‘Establishing Unique Identifiers…’ building block, GLEIF will work in close coordination with the FSB, the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) and national authorities to explore options for improving LEI adoption. This work effort will run from June 2021 to June 2022.</p>
<p>Reassuringly, the FSB roadmap makes the association between an enhanced payments ecosystem and legal entity identification. For cross-border payments, the ability for identity verification to happen across borders is critical and this is why the LEI is perfectly poised to provide a solution. Its universality makes it the perfect candidate for bestowing transparency in relation to entity identification across the global payments landscape.  </p>
<p>Consultation: Instant Payments </p>
<p>In March 2021, the European Commission (EC) published its Consultation Strategy on Instant Payments in the EU. The purpose of the consultation is to identify obstacles to the creation of efficient pan-European instant payment solutions, to assess the effectiveness of potential solutions and to measure the potential benefits and costs of those solutions. The first part of this consultation involves surveying payment service providers (PSPs) and providers of supporting technical services. Of relevance to the LEI are the questions regarding sanctions screening. The survey asks whether there is a need for alleviated screening of transactions by PSPs involving clients vetted or whitelisted beforehand, or if a common EU-wide list of false hits and/or the use of the LEI for firms and digital IDs for individuals could solve any sanctions screening-related issue that instant payments may create. </p>
<p>GLEIF welcomes the EC’s consideration of the LEI as a potential solution to support the screening of instant payment transactions against sanction and watch lists and has a keen interest in the outcome of the survey. </p>
<p>The ‘LEI Lightbulb Blog Series’ from GLEIF aims to shine a light on the breadth of acceptance and advocacy for the LEI across the public and private sectors, geographies and use cases by highlighting which industry leaders, authorities and organizations are supportive of the LEI and for what purpose. By demonstrating how success derived from strong regulatory roots is giving rise to a ground swell of champions for further LEI regulation and voluntary LEI adoption across new and emerging applications, GLEIF hopes to educate on both the current and future potential value that ‘one global identity’ can deliver for businesses, regardless of sector, world-wide. </p>

<p>By Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director &amp; CMO, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Leaders from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and IBM met with President Joe Biden at the White House last week to discuss strategies the government and private sector can use together to improve the nation’s cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the meeting, Amazon announced that it will provide eligible AWS customers with access to free FIDO Security Keys. Not only will this protect the burgeoning number of businesses that run on AWS, but it will help instill better authentication practices as these keys can be used across many other business (e.g., G Suite, Github, Dropbox, Stripe) and consumer (Facebook, Twitter, Coinbase, Bank of America) services.</p>



<p>Amazon has been a leading stakeholder in FIDO Alliance for several years now – it is wonderful to see their leadership extended to the market at large. As more businesses move to the cloud, it is absolutely critical that cloud service providers follow suit to protect this critical infrastructure. Threats and attackers are growing in sophistication, and the impacts are non-trivial. Hundreds of millions of personal records are being stolen and resold on the dark web on an alarmingly regular basis. This is a clear and present threat to our economy, our national security and our society.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to name a breach from the past five years that wasn’t tied to stolen credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest prominent attack, which was carried out on Colonial Pipeline, used <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/colonial-pipeline-ceo-tells-senate-cyber-defenses-were-compromised-ahead-hack-2021-06-08/">a single stolen password</a> to essentially cripple the U.S eastern seaboard.</p>



<p>It is important that all businesses take steps to educate and protect their employees and customers from such threats. “Traditional” means of multi-factor authentication (such as OTPs) simply aren’t fit-for-purpose to protect against these attacks, which can financially cripple a company or organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, credential-based breaches (like Colonial Pipeline’s) wouldn’t be possible if accounts were protected with FIDO Authentication, which requires local possession of a device with no knowledge-based authentication credentials passed over the network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance has come a long way since our inception. What started as a whiteboard concept has evolved into technology that is becoming part of the web’s DNA. Virtually every platform and device can now support FIDO Authentication, and there are public SDKs and tools, plus a rich ecosystem of FIDO Certified vendor products and services that can help companies implement FIDO for their sites and apps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amazon’s move to provide free FIDO Security Keys sets a strong – and important – example. We encourage all other cloud service providers to urgently consider following suit by at a minimum enabling FIDO authenticators for admin access to networks.</p>
