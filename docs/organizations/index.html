 A Final Specification provides intellectual property protections to implementers of the specification and is not subject to further revision. This note starts the 60-day public review period for the specification draft in accordance with the OpenID Foundation IPR policies and procedures.

For the convenience of members, voting will actually begin a week before the review period ends, for members who have completed their reviews by then. 
 &nbsp; 
 The relevant dates are: 
 
 Final Specification public review period: Wednesday, April 16, 2025 to Sunday, June 15, 2025 (60 days) 
 Final Specification vote announcement: Monday, June 2, 2025

Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate. Find out more at<a href="http://www.openid.net/">&nbsp;openid.net</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 ZeWIF Specification 

<p></p>

<p>The Zcash extensible Wallet Interchange Format (ZeWIF) has been Blockchain Commons’ main priority since the Zcash Community Grants program approved our proposal at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Why It’s Important. Blockchain Commons talks a lot about interoperability, and that’s what ZeWIF is: it’s a way to freely exchange data between Zcash wallets in a standardized form. What we don’t talk about as often is why interoperability is important.</p>

<p>It goes back to our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">Gordian principles</a>. Interoperability supports at least three of them.</p>

 
   It supports independence because any user can freely move their data among the interoperable software systems. 
   It supports openness because any developer can easily join the ecosystem by adopting a mature, well-understood specification. This creates an environment of coopetition (cooperative competition) that leads to advances in technology and usability. 
   It supports resilience because the interoperable format makes data less likely to be lost: it’ll be in a form that will be understood and therefore accessible, well in the future. 
 

<p>For a wallet ecosystem, interoperability means that users will have the freedom to move their digital assets among Zcash wallets. That’s the precise independence we want users to have, which is why it’s been worth spending a few months of time on this project.</p>

<p>The ZeWIF Meetings. To support the ZeWIF project, Blockchain Commons held <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/#meetings">three meetings</a> in the first quarter: on the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/meeting1/">initial wallet survey</a>, on the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/meeting2/">first demo of the zmigrate tool</a>, and on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/meeting3/">ZeWIF data abstractions</a>. Meeting with developers to ensure that specifications serve everyone’s needs has always been a bedrock policy for Blockchain Commons, so we’ve of course extended it here. (At least one more meeting is planned, for April 16th, to demo the data file format.)</p>


  
    
      #1: Wallet Survey:

      #3: Abstraction Discussion:










   
    
   



    
  


<p>What We’ve Released So Far. The ZeWIF project is built around the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zewif">zewif library</a>, which stores Zcash wallet data in an in-memory format. We’ve also written <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zewif-zcashd">zewif-zcashd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zewif-zingo">zewif-zingo</a> to demonstrate the import of data from those wallets to ZeWIF, while our partners at <a href="https://zingolabs.org/">Zingo Labs</a> have produced “zewif-zecwallet” for importing zecwallet data (though that PR hasn’t been merged yet). Finally, we authored <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zmigrate">zmigrate</a>, which is a demo CLI for importing zcashd content. With these demos and libraries in hand, other wallet developers can start working to interchange their own data via the ZeWIF format.</p>

<p>What’s Still to Come. With our releases so far, data can be interchanged between different Zcash wallets as long as it’s all done on the same machine: you just import into the in-memory ZeWIF format from one wallet, then export to another. But we expect most use cases will instead involve at least two different machines. That’s where the ZeWIF file format comes into play. Building on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a>, it translates the ZeWIF in-memory storage into a fixed file that can then be moved to a different machine. We expect to demo the Envelope ZeWIF format at that upcoming April 16th meeeting.</p>

 Post-Quantum Commons 

<p></p>

<p>Is Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) the next big thing? We were able to support our friends at Foundation with some PQC work just as we got the ZeWIF project going at the start of the year.</p>

<p>Why It’s Important. Quantum Computers are starting to appear, and though they’re far, far from what would be needed to break cryptography at the moment, there’s no telling when there’s going to be a sudden “quantum” leap. Though today’s cryptography might not need PQC, if you’re working on something that might be around for 5 or 10 years, you should be thinking about it!</p>

<p>PQC Meeting. Our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/meetings/2025-03-pqc/">March Gordian meeting</a> contained all the details of our PQC work, including what Quantum Computing is.</p>



 
    
   

<p>QuantumLink. The highlight of the meeting was a discussion of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/assets/pdfs/202503-quantumlink.pdf">QuantumLink</a> from our friends at <a href="https://foundation.xyz/">Foundation</a>. This is a  quantum-resistant protocol for Bluetooth communication that is a critical component of their new <a href="https://foundation.xyz/buy-passport-prime/">Passport Prime</a> wallet. It allows them to use Bluetooth with high security and for that security to remain strong 5 or 10 years in the future, in case Quantum Computing does make those big strides forward.</p>

<p>What We’ve Released So Far. The QuantumLink technology was enabled by new PQC support that Blockchain Commons incorporated into its libraries. You can now use the PQC algorithms <a href="https://hackmd.io/@bc-community/rJ8DOmCd1e">ML-DSA and ML-KEM</a> in our Rust stack, from <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-components-rust">bc-componenents</a> on up.</p>

 Open Integrity 

<p></p>

<p>We had one other big release in Q1: <a href="https://github.com/openintegrityproject">Open Integrity</a>, a system for increasing the trust of software being developed in Git. Well, technically it was released on April 7th, the 20th anniversary of Git’s release, but this is something that Blockchain Commons Architect Christopher Allen has been working on for about a year, so we’re thrilled to get the word out.</p>

<p>Why It’s Important. We wrote <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/open-integrity/">a whole article</a> discussing why Open Integrity is important. But, in short: Git repos are growing increasingly important for the deployment of critical software, and Git doesn’t actually provide a high-level of trust for those repos, despite the ability to sign commits. Open Integrity bridges the gap betwen what Git offers and what online software distribution needs.</p>

<p>What We’ve Released So Far. The Open Integrity project is now available in an early form at <a href="https://github.com/openintegrityproject">GitHub</a>. A <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity_Problem_Statement.md">Problem Statement</a> offers  details on the issues we’re trying to solve and our solutions. We’ve also got a number of tools and scripts, the most import of which creates an <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/src/setup_git_inception_repo.sh">inception commit on a repo</a>. This inception commit is the root of trust that lays the foundation for ensuring that you always know who’s in control of a repo.</p>

<p>If you want to try out Open Integrity, see the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity_Script_Snippets.md">Open Integrity Snippets file</a>, which has complete instructions on how to get that inception-commit script running, plus many examples that will allow you to experiment with Open Integrity.</p>

 

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s it for our big Q1 projects, but we had a number of smaller releases over the course of the quarter as well.</p>
</blockquote>

 

 New Articles 

<p>The Right to Transact. We think the right to transact should be an international freedom. Read more in Christopher’s recent article, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/RightToTransact/">“The Case for an International Right to Freedom to Transact”</a>, which builds on his 2024 musing, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/ValuesDesign/">“How My Values Inform Design”</a>.</p>

<p>SSI Orbit Podcast. Christopher also was interviewed for the <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/videos/SSI-Podcast/">SSI Orbit Podcast</a>. It’s been nine years since he wrote the foundational <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">“Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>. Where do things stand today?</p>

 New Dev Docs 

<p>SSKR Pages. We updated our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">SSKR dev pages</a> with the big focus being differentiating <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/#what-are-sskr-urs">SSKR URs</a> (where you split up a key) and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/#what-are-sskr-envelopes">SSKR Envelopes</a> (where you protect the entire contents of an Envelope by creating and splitting up a key). The <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/vectors/">test vectors</a> also now demonstrate both cases.</p>

<p>UR Pages. We similarly did some big updates to our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/">UR dev pages</a>. Here the issue was that URs had seen some changes over the years, especially as we locked down CBOR tag registration, and our examples were no longer up-to-date. Now, every page and every test vector should be correct. There’s also a new page on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/envelope/">URs for Gordian Envelope</a>.</p>

<p>Meetings Pages. All of Blockchain Commons’ meetings are now documented on a new <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/meetings/">meetings page</a>, which also includes subpages with videos and slides (and usually transcripts) of everything from the last few years!</p>

<p>Improved Crate Docs. Finally, we’ve used some lessons learned from the documentation of ZeWIF to improve the documentation of our Rust stack. As a result, docs.rs now has improved docs for <a href="https://docs.rs/dcbor/0.16.5/dcbor/">bc-dcbor</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/bc-components/0.18.2/bc_components/">bc-components</a>, and <a href="https://docs.rs/bc-envelope/latest/bc_envelope/">bc-envelope</a></p>

 New Ports 

<p>Lifehash to Rust. Lifehash is now available in a new <a href="https://github.com/GalactechsLLC/lifehash-rs">Rust Implementation</a> courtesy of Ken Griggs. Lifehash is a critical element of the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/oib/">object identity block</a>, which can help users to recognize seeds and keys. We hope this will allow for more deployment.</p>

 New Research 

<p></p>

<p>Provenance Marks. One of our newest innovations, courtesy of Blockchain Commons Lead Researcher Wolf McNally, is the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2025-001-provenance-mark.md">provenance mark</a>. The provenance mark is a cryptographically secure chain of marks that facilitates the easy verification of authenticity. We’ll have more on them in the months ahead, but in the meantime, you can read Wolf’s <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2025-001-provenance-mark.md">research paper</a> on the topic!</p>

<p>Provenance References. If you want to start playing with provenance marks right now, 
we’ve already released a series of reference apps and libraries. They include our original <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Provenance">Swift implementation</a>, our newer <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/provenance-mark-rust">Rust implementation</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/provenance-mark-cli-rust">CLI</a> that can be used to create and manage marks!</p>

 

<p>That’s it for the moment. For the next quarter, we’ll be closing out our initial work on ZeWIF in April, and we’ll be offering more looks at Provenance Marks in the months ahead.</p>

<p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) has officially launched its <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/hospitality-travel-wg.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Hospitality &amp; Travel Working Group</a>, evolving from the ongoing H&amp;T Special Interest Group (SIG). This new working group will focus on developing standards, schemas, processes, and documentation to support the self-sovereign exchange of data between travelers, services, intermediaries in the hospitality and travel industry, and their AI agents.</p> Mission and Focus <p>The primary goal of the working group is to enable travelers to maintain ownership and control over their personal data while allowing for seamless interactions with travel service providers. The group will address critical aspects of traveler profiles, focusing on data portability, privacy, and interoperability across the travel ecosystem.</p> Meeting Schedule <p>The working group will convene twice weekly:</p>  Tuesdays at 10:00 AM Eastern Time  Fridays at 10:00 AM Eastern Time  <p>These regular meetings will facilitate ongoing collaboration among industry stakeholders, technology providers, and standards bodies.</p> Leadership Perspectives <p>"We are enormously proud that the hard work of our dedicated Hospitality &amp; Travel SIG has led to a Working Group that will develop key specifications. From sharing boarding passes and hotel preferences to loyalty programs and dietary requirements, travelers constantly provide the same information to different companies throughout their journey.</p><p>"Travelers need to share, and overshare, the broadest range of personal data on their voyage, ranging from seat or dietary preferences, to government identities or passports, across multiple service providers who may not have the best data handling practices. This working group will develop standards that allow travelers to control exactly what data they share, with whom, and for how long - eliminating both unnecessary data exposure and the frustration of repeatedly entering the same information," said Kim Hamilton Duffy, Executive Director of the DIF.</p><p>Douglas Rice, industry veteran and Hospitality &amp; Travel Working Group chair added: "The travel ecosystem has long struggled with fragmented approaches to customer data and identity management. This working group will help establish the technical foundations needed for travelers to maintain control of their data while enabling the personalized experiences they expect. We're building toward a future where your travel preferences, loyalty information, and credentials can move with you seamlessly across your journey—all while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security, and enabling AI agents to act on verified information about the traveler.”</p> Next Steps <p>The working group will initially focus on defining standardized schemas for travelers or their digital agents to present profiles, establishing protocols for secure data exchange, and developing guidelines for implementation across various travel touchpoints. Industry participants are encouraged to join the working group to contribute their expertise and perspectives.</p><p>For more information about participating in the DIF Hospitality &amp; Travel Working Group, visit the <a href="https://identity.foundation/join/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation website</a>.</p>

<a href="https://keyless.io/"></a>



<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Keyless?</p>



<p>Our vision is for a safer, more private world. Keyless is on a mission to redefine how the world authenticates – enabling people to securely access services with a simple look, without compromising their biometric data.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>We can answer this with a simple example: mule accounts. Fraudsters will pay people to open bank or crypto accounts using their real ID, then take over and use those accounts to launder money. On paper, the account looks legitimate – but the person using it isn’t who the bank thinks it is.</p>



<p>This kind of fraud is only possible when identity assurance is weak. With trustworthy digital identity, this can be stopped by verifying who is really behind the screen not just at sign-up, but every time they log in, send a payment, or change account details.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digital identity is the foundation for secure online interactions. It drives inclusion, cuts costs, and reduces fraud. When companies can trust their users, they grow faster and more confidently.</p>



<p>Keyless sits within consumer apps – often in banking and fintech, but also in government and university portals. Whenever a user performs a sensitive action, like logging in or approving a payment, Keyless triggers an authentication selfie using the device’s camera. Unlike text messages, call centers, or even FaceID, this process actually proves who the user is – not just that they have access to a device or mobile number. </p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada is already taking significant steps toward becoming a global leader in digital identity. The government is actively developing a nationwide digital ID program designed to make accessing both public and private services faster and more secure.</p>



<p>By continuing to invest in public-private collaboration, Canada can lead the way in building trusted, inclusive digital ecosystems that other countries look to for guidance.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>We joined DIACC to help shape the future of digital identity in a way that’s secure, user-friendly, and preserves citizen privacy. We believe in collaboration and are excited to contribute our expertise in biometric authentication and privacy-preserving technologies.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Within the biometric authentication space, Keyless is known for its privacy-preserving approach. Uniquely, we authenticate users without storing their facial biometric data anywhere – keeping their biometric information completely private.</p>

<p>Organizations are encouraged to take the Passkey Pledge ahead of World Passkey Day on May 1&nbsp;</p>



<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., April 9, 2025 – The FIDO Alliance is inviting organizations around the world to take the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">Passkey Pledge</a>, a voluntary commitment to increase awareness and adoption of passkey sign-ins to make the web safer and more accessible.</p>



<p>Since passkeys were introduced to the world in 2022, hundreds of service providers have embraced the greater security and usability that passkeys bring to users. Over 15 billion user accounts are now equipped with the option to use a passkey instead of relying on passwords, which are easy to steal and reuse for account takeovers and fraud. Organizations that deploy passkeys are consistently finding that a greater percentage of their users are able to sign into services in far less time – which helps generate added revenue and/or employee productivity while also reducing fraud and account takeovers.</p>



<p>To further advance and promote the use of passkeys, the first Thursday in May each year is now recognized as World Passkey Day (previously World Password Day). Companies can take the Passkey Pledge in advance of World Passkey Day and commit to making a good-faith effort to achieve the following goals throughout the year:</p>



 
 For service providers that have an active implementation of passkeys for sign-in – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions taken to measurably increase the use of passkeys by users when signing into the company’s services. 



 For service providers that are in the process of implementing passkeys for sign-in – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate measurable actions taken to enable passkeys for signing into the company’s services. 



 For vendors with a FIDO-based products and/or service – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions taken to measurably increase the use of passkeys through adoption of the company’s products and/or services. 



 For vendors developing FIDO-based products and/or services – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate measurable actions to FIDO certify its products and launch a product or service with passkey sign-in support. 



 For industry associations and standards organizations&nbsp;– Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions to increase the visibility and benefits of passkey sign-ins. 
 



<p>Organizations that take the pledge will receive assets to support their involvement and will have the opportunity to take part in activities and announcements planned for World Passkey Day on May 1, 2025.</p>



<p>More details on the pledge, including the sign-up form, can be found at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Taking Action: Resources to Help Organizations to Fulfill the Pledge 



<p>The FIDO Alliance has resources and best practices for Passkey Pledge organizations to take action, including:</p>



 
 Sharing their commitment to the Passkey Pledge via external communications channels 



 Leveraging the guidance on <a href="http://passkeycentral.org">passkeycentral.org</a> to plan, implement and expand their passkey rollouts 



 Implementing the <a href="https://www.passkeycentral.org/design-guidelines/">FIDO Design Guidelines</a>, data-driven UX best practices for passkey rollouts 



 Getting their products <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">FIDO Certified</a> to demonstrate that their products are compliant, interoperable and secure 



 Releasing case studies on their or their customers behalf to share implementation journeys and business outcomes. Organizations can reach out to <a href="mailto:info@fidoalliance.org">info@fidoalliance.org</a> to submit case studies directly to the FIDO Alliance 



 Taking part in the FIDO Alliance <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/become-a-member/">member activities</a> and working groups to further drive passkey optimization and adoption&nbsp; 



 Planning and/or taking steps to <a href="https://www.passkeycentral.org/passkey-roll-out-guides/prevent-phishing/">remove passwords as a sign-in option</a>. 
 



 About the FIDO Alliance 



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.

<p>April 8, 2025</p>



 Current Landscape 



<p>Governments worldwide are accelerating their digital transformation efforts to meet the growing expectations of citizens and businesses. Canada is no exception, with public sector services increasingly moving online to improve efficiency, accessibility, and security. However, this shift brings significant challenges, including data privacy concerns, cybersecurity threats, and the need for seamless, interoperable services across jurisdictions.</p>



<p>When DIACC was established in 2012, its mission was to create a secure digital ecosystem. Today, this goal is even more critical for modernizing government services while ensuring security, privacy, and usability. DIACC has evolved from research to certifying real-world digital trust solutions, setting audit standards, shaping policies, and connecting businesses and government to strengthen Canada’s digital economy.</p>



<p>Digital trust—which empowers individuals, businesses, and government agencies to engage online securely and transparently—is essential for delivering reliable public services. Without it, citizens may lack confidence in digital government initiatives, limiting their adoption and effectiveness.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust, Canada can strengthen its public service infrastructure, enhance citizen confidence, and improve service delivery. Interoperable frameworks such as the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™ (PCTF) ensure that digital services remain secure, adaptable, and trusted while protecting personal electronic information between government agencies and service providers.</p>



 Advancing Digital Trust to Modernize Government Services 



 1. Driving Efficiencies, Cost Savings, and Economic Growth 



<p>Governments can leverage DIACC, the PCTF, and PCTF certification along with technical standards to help streamline processes, reduce costs, and create economic opportunities through:</p>



 
 Reducing Implementation Costs: Standardized digital trust solutions lower costs associated with developing, integrating, and maintaining digital trust capabilities. 



 Enhancing Service Efficiencies: Digital credentials and interoperable frameworks minimize redundancies and enable faster, more secure service delivery. 



 Unlocking Interprovincial Trade: A unified digital trust framework will enable seamless service delivery to Canadians across Canada, regardless of province of residence.&nbsp; 



 Facilitating Labour Mobility: Efforts to reduce interprovincial trade across Canada mean the importance of secure and portable digital credentials has never been greater. Reducing bureaucratic licensing and certification verification barriers will ensure workers can move between provinces more efficiently. 



 Boosting Public-Private Collaboration: By aligning digital trust standards with industry best practices, governments can foster innovation and attract investment in secure digital services. 
 



 2. Strengthening Public Confidence in Digital Services 



<p>For government digital services to succeed, citizens must trust them. Implementing robust digital trust solutions allows governments to:</p>



 
 Ensure secure and seamless access to online services 



 Protect citizens’ data from fraud and misuse 



 Increase adoption of digital services by providing verifiable trust measures 



 Improve operational efficiency by reducing manual verification processes 
 



 3. Enhancing Trust Through the DIACC PCTF 



<p>The DIACC PCTF provides a framework for governments to:</p>



 
 Strengthen identity verification in digital government services 



 Improve efficiency in service delivery by reducing reliance on physical documents 



 Enhance interoperability across departments and jurisdictions 



 Ensure compliance with privacy and security standards through auditable criteria 
 



 4. Protecting Citizens from Fraud and Identity Theft 



<p>Fraud prevention is a top priority for digital government services. To mitigate risks, governments should:</p>



 
 Implement secure identity verification measures for accessing digital services 



 Use verifiable credentials for social benefits, permits, and tax filings 



 Ensure public education initiatives on digital trust and security best practices 
 



 5. Enabling Seamless Intergovernmental Collaboration 



<p>All federal, provincial, and municipal governments must collaborate to support a trustworthy digital ecosystem. Digital trust frameworks like the PCTF facilitate:</p>



 
 Secure data exchange across agencies while maintaining privacy 



 Interoperable digital identity solutions for seamless citizen experiences 



 Compliance with national and international regulatory requirements 
 



 6. Leveraging Digital Trust for Innovation in Public Services 



<p>Governments can harness digital trust to:</p>



 
 Develop secure digital identities for all citizens and businesses 



 Improve emergency response coordination through trusted data-sharing networks 



 Support AI-driven public service applications with built-in trust safeguards 
 



 Best Practices and the Way Forward 



 1. Adopt Existing and Emerging Digital Trust Technologies to Address Pain Points 



<p>Government agencies should leverage trusted digital trust, verification, and credentialing solutions aligned with the PCTF. Implementing PCTF-certified solutions will enhance security, efficiency, and trust in digital service delivery. While whole-of-government modernization is needed, our stakeholders recommend rapidly unlocking digital driver’s licences, passports, permanent resident cards and verified income to address the economic urgency.&nbsp;</p>



 2. Collaborate for Consistency and Interoperability 



<p>DIACC fosters collaboration between governments, technology providers, and industry stakeholders to promote consistent digital trust practices, using standards and certifications to ensure security and privacy across public services.</p>



 3. Educate and Empower Citizens and Public Sector Leaders 



<p>DIACC is committed to advancing digital trust in government through:</p>



 
 Public awareness campaigns on the benefits and security of digital services 



 Training and resources for government officials on digital trust implementation 



 Policy recommendations to support the adoption of digital trust frameworks 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Modernizing government services requires a foundation of digital trust. By recognizing frameworks like the PCTF, governments can enhance service delivery, protect citizens’ data, and foster trust in digital public services.</p>



<p>Together, we can build a future where government services are more efficient, secure, and accessible to all Canadians while reinforcing Canada’s leadership in digital trust and innovation.</p>

 A New Era for Sustainable Computing <p>Demand for computing power is exploding as AI models, cloud services, and decentralized applications consume ever-greater amounts of energy. But not all energy is created equal. In some regions, a data center might be drawing power from a coal-heavy grid, while elsewhere excess wind or solar power goes unused. For the past decade, tech giants addressed this by buying renewable energy or improving efficiency. But what if we could take a more dynamic approach — shifting computational workloads across location and time to maximize use of clean&nbsp;energy?</p><p>Enter Carbon-Aware Nomination, a groundbreaking mechanism from Energy Web that does exactly that. It ensures computational tasks run where and when they have the lowest carbon intensity. This isn’t a standard cloud feature or a typical blockchain project, but a fusion of both: it connects decentralized computing networks with real-time carbon intensity data from <a href="https://watttime.org/">WattTime</a> and the Green Software Foundation’s <a href="https://carbon-aware-sdk.greensoftware.foundation/">Carbon-Aware SDK</a>. And the best part — it’s going open-source, inviting the entire industry to build a greener digital future together.</p> The Carbon Cost of Computing: Why It&nbsp;Matters <p>Computing today has a massive carbon cost. Data centers account for around 1–2% of global electricity use (on par with the airline industry), and that share is rising fast. Some forecasts warn that with the AI boom, data center energy demand could hit double-digit percentages of global consumption by 2030. In short, if we don’t make computing more sustainable, it will hinder global climate goals. Today’s solutions to decarbonize workloads rarely have real-time “carbon awareness.” This means a lot of flexible computing — like batch processing or AI training jobs — might be running at the worst possible times for the planet. Carbon-Aware Nomination changes that paradigm by intelligently routing workloads to times and places where electricity is greenest.</p> Why Carbon-Aware Nomination Is a Game-Changer <p>Carbon-aware computing isn’t an entirely new idea, but no one has implemented it the way we have. Existing approaches have serious limitations:</p>  Blind Spots in Conventional Cloud Sustainability: Major cloud platforms have introduced sustainability dashboards and efficiency tools to help customers estimate carbon footprints. However, these proprietary solutions require you to trust their reporting. There’s no independent way to verify if a given workload actually ran on low-carbon energy. In other words, you might see carbon-saving claims, but you can’t prove them. While Carbon-Aware Nomination is built for decentralized compute networks, its methodology could be adapted for cloud orchestration. However, the current implementation is blockchain-native, ensuring verifiable, tamper-proof sustainability claims.  Decentralized Compute Lacks Climate Intelligence: Emerging networks like iExec, Golem, and Akash distribute workloads across many nodes, leveraging blockchain for compute marketplaces. Yet, they schedule jobs without considering the carbon intensity of those nodes. A task might just as easily run on a coal-powered node as on a solar-powered one. Until now, no decentralized computing platform has integrated real-time carbon optimization into its scheduling logic.  <p>This is where Carbon-Aware Nomination stands apart. It combines decentralized computing with live carbon-intensity data for the first time. By doing so, it delivers several unique benefits that neither traditional clouds nor existing blockchain compute projects&nbsp;offer:</p>  Decentralized &amp; Trustless Architecture: Built on the Energy Web X blockchain, every decision and claim is transparent. There’s no single company controlling the process, and sustainability claims are tamper-proof and verifiable by anyone. This brings a new level of trust to green computing — auditors or stakeholders can confirm, via the public ledger, that a workload ran at a time of low grid emissions.  Real-Time Carbon Intelligence: The system taps into WattTime’s API and the GSF Carbon-Aware SDK to get live and forecasted grid emissions data. Workloads are continuously matched to the cleanest energy times in real time. If wind picks up in Region A or solar output surges in Region B, the scheduler knows and can route tasks accordingly. We’re not offsetting carbon with credits or averaging it annually; we’re actively avoiding emissions as they&nbsp;happen.  Hybrid Public/Enterprise Nodes: Flexibility is built in. Organizations can nominate workloads to run on public decentralized nodes or their own infrastructure — whichever meets the carbon criteria. For example, an enterprise could use its private servers when they’re running on green power, or tap into a public pool of nodes in another region when local power is dirty. Carbon-Aware Nomination isn’t “all or nothing” — it’s a smart overlay that finds the greenest option across a mix of resources.  Verifiable ESG Reporting: Every workload handled through this system generates a digital proof of its execution with associated carbon data. Think of it like an eco-receipt. This proof can feed directly into ESG reports or sustainability audits, backed by blockchain records. Instead of saying “we think our computations were low-carbon,” organizations can cryptographically demonstrate it. This level of accountability is increasingly crucial as investors and regulators demand hard evidence of climate&nbsp;action.  Open-Source Collaboration: Unlike proprietary cloud solutions, Carbon-Aware Nomination is being released as open-source software. This invites an entire community — from researchers to startups — to use it, audit it, and improve it. By sharing the code, Energy Web ensures transparency of the algorithm and accelerates innovation. Anyone will be able to plug into the system or even contribute new features (for example, supporting new types of workloads or integrating additional data sources). We believe an open approach is the fastest way to standardize carbon-aware computing across the&nbsp;world.   How It Works (In Simple&nbsp;Terms):   Checks Carbon Data: A group of computers (nominators) analyze real-time electricity grid data to find where energy is greenest.  Finds the Best Spot: The nominators select and agree on the cleanest available computing resources to execute the workload and qualify for&nbsp;rewards.  Runs &amp; Verifies: The selected computers can accept and execute the workload, and the blockchain records proof of completion, ensuring eligibility for&nbsp;rewards.   How It Works (In detail): The Carbon-Aware Nomination Pool <p>So, how does the system actually orchestrate a “greener” workload? Rather than a central scheduler deciding where tasks run, Carbon-Aware Nomination uses a decentralized pool of worker nodes and nominators that collectively determine the optimal execution plan. Here’s a high-level look at the&nbsp;process:</p>  Live Carbon Data Feeds: Using the Carbon Aware SDK, the system continuously pulls real-time and forecasted carbon intensity data from WattTime’s service. This data covers different regions and grids, updating as conditions change (like when a big solar farm comes online in the afternoon or when a coal plant ramps up at&nbsp;night).  Normalized Comparison: Because “100 gCO₂/kWh” means different things on different grids, the scheduler normalizes carbon intensity across regions. This prevents it from always favoring the same region and ensures a fair comparison. In essence, the algorithm knows what “clean” means for each location and time — a form of smart&nbsp;context.  Energy Web X Worker Registry: All participating compute nodes (whether run by individuals, companies, or data centers) register on the Energy Web X blockchain registry. They publish metadata about their location, hardware, and efficiency. This on-chain registry is like a directory of available computing resources, with info crucial for carbon-aware decisions. It’s also transparent — anyone can see which nodes are available and where they&nbsp;are.  Green Nomination Process: When a workload needs scheduling, a separate group of decentralized nominators, independent from the compute nodes themselves, evaluates the available options. These nominators analyze live carbon intensity data (from step 1), assess each node’s performance and capacity, and rank them based on sustainability. Essentially, the nodes compete, but not on price or speed alone, on verifiable carbon performance. The system then nominates the best-suited, lowest-carbon node to execute the task, ensuring a trustless and tamper-proof selection process.  Workload Execution &amp; Proof: The chosen node runs the computation. During and after execution, it logs the energy used and the carbon intensity at that time. This information is reported back and recorded (for example, as an attestation on Energy Web X). The result is a verifiable proof that “Task X was executed at Time Y in Region Z with carbon intensity Q gCO₂/kWh.” If someone doubts the claim, the proof is on the blockchain for anyone to&nbsp;verify.  <p>Continuous Optimization: Over time, the system can employ incentives to improve efficiency. For instance, node operators who consistently provide low-carbon compute (by perhaps adding their own renewable energy or load-shifting) could be rewarded. Likewise, if the network notices certain regions becoming cleaner (say a new wind farm installed), it will naturally start shifting more workloads there. The feedback loop encourages the whole ecosystem to move towards cleaner operations, as sustainable nodes get more business.</p><p>In practice, this means a company using Carbon-Aware Nomination could submit a batch job and know that the job will run at the best possible time (perhaps an hour later when a green energy surge comes) and in the best location (maybe on a server one country over where it’s a windy night), all without manual intervention. The heavy lifting of “when and where to compute” is handled by the decentralized logic in a transparent way.</p> How Carbon-Aware Nomination Fits into Energy Web&nbsp;X <p>Carbon-Aware Nomination is a component of the broader Energy Web X (EWX) ecosystem. EWX is Energy Web’s new architecture for decentralized solutions, and it supports multiple “nomination” methods (i.e., scheduling and matching mechanisms) for every single compute workload of their solutions. Carbon awareness is one powerful approach, but not the only one — some applications might optimize purely on cost or latency, for example. Within&nbsp;EWX:</p>  Solutions can opt-in to Carbon-Aware Nomination if minimizing emissions is a priority, or choose other nomination modules better suited to their needs. This flexible architecture means EWX can cater to different preferences (greenest vs. fastest vs. cheapest, etc.), and Carbon-Aware Nomination is available for any solution that cares about sustainability.  Even for applications that prioritize performance, Carbon-Aware Nomination can run in the background or as a secondary filter. For instance, if two nodes are equally capable, why not pick the one on cleaner energy? In this way, the carbon-aware mechanism can enhance other scheduling strategies by adding a sustainability lens.  All of this happens while leveraging the security and transparency of Energy Web’s blockchain. The nominations (scheduling decisions) and the resulting proofs are recorded on-chain, which aligns with Energy Web’s mission to use open digital infrastructure for the clean energy transition. EWX provides the trust layer that makes Carbon-Aware Nomination’s claims audit-proof.   Decentralized Nomination: Trustless, Transparent, and Resilient <p>Unlike a traditional cloud scheduler (where one company’s software decides where your job runs), Carbon-Aware Nomination operates without a single controlling entity. The decision process is distributed among many participants and governed by open algorithms. This decentralized approach brings several advantages:</p>  Trustless operations: You don’t have to trust Energy Web or any cloud provider’s claims — you can verify the outcomes yourself on-chain. If a workload was supposed to run on green power, anyone can check the records and confirm it did. This is crucial for companies that need to report emissions reductions to regulators or want to avoid greenwashing.  Transparency: Every step, from the carbon data used to the final selection of a node, can be made transparent. Community members could even watch a dashboard of live nominations happening, seeing in real time how the system is chasing the lowest-carbon resources. This level of openness is unheard of in proprietary cloud scheduling.  Resilience: Decentralization also means there’s no single point of failure. The nomination process can continue even if one node or one data feed goes down. Multiple nodes participate in making decisions, and the blockchain ensures a canonical record. It’s much harder to corrupt or game the system — doing so would require attacking a broad, global network of participants.  <p>For users, this simply translates to peace of mind. You get a robust service that not only optimizes for sustainability but is also inherently reliable and tamper-proof.</p> Why Open Source&nbsp;Matters <p>Energy Web is committed to open-sourcing the entire Carbon-Aware Nomination system. By making it freely available to developers, enterprises, and even competitors, we aim to set a new industry standard for carbon-aware computing. Transparency is a core value here — anyone can inspect the code to understand how decisions are made and suggest improvements. Open source also accelerates innovation: a global community can adapt the tool for new use cases (imagine carbon-aware scheduling for edge devices or for other batch processes like rendering and scientific computing). We’re releasing this under an open license so that this carbon-aware logic can proliferate everywhere, not just within Energy Web’s ecosystem.</p><p>Ultimately, climate change is a shared challenge. We believe that by open-sourcing this solution, we enable network effects — more contributions, more adoption, and more emissions saved. No single company can decarbonize IT on its own, but together, we can make carbon-aware computing the “new normal” for all data centers and&nbsp;devices.</p> Join the&nbsp;Movement <p>Carbon-aware computing is the future. Whether you’re an enterprise managing thousands of servers, a blockchain enthusiast, or a developer hacking on weekends, you can start integrating Carbon-Aware Nomination into your workflows to make a tangible impact. This isn’t just an Energy Web project — it’s a call to all cloud providers, decentralized network operators, and software platforms: join us in running workloads on clean energy. Imagine a world where every AI training, every render job, every transaction validation automatically seeks out the greenest energy available. That’s what we’re building, and we invite you to build it with&nbsp;us.</p><p>The code will be open-sourced on Energy Web’s GitHub (and accessible through our developer portal). We’ll be hosting community calls and tutorials for those who want to implement it or contribute. By working together, we can ensure that the digital infrastructure of the future not only powers our economies — but also heals our planet. It’s time to decarbonize the cloud, one workload at a&nbsp;time.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/carbon-aware-nomination-system-for-decentralized-computing-is-now-live-604996982c0f">Carbon-Aware Nomination System for Decentralized Computing is now live</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

By embracing this approach, organisations can ensure microcredentials acknowledge diverse achievements and highlight contributions that might otherwise be overlooked.</p><p>For instance microcredentials can&nbsp;help:</p>  Charities — Recognise the skills gained through volunteering, advocacy, and community projects, offering participants portable evidence of their contributions.  NGOs — Validate the efforts of community workers, promoting inclusion and recognising the expertise developed in challenging environments.  Co-ops — Highlight collaborative and informal learning within member-driven structures, supporting collective progress and innovation.  Businesses — Align microcredentials with organisational priorities, such as sustainability or diversity, to strengthen employee development and retention.  Higher Education — Create stackable credentials that integrate with degree programmes and reflect industry partnerships, enabling more flexible and relevant learning pathways.   The Responsible Use of Technology <p>Technology plays a critical role in delivering effective microcredentialing systems. Tools like <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/What_Are_Open_Badges%3F">Open Badges</a> and Verifiable Credentials ensure transparency, portability, and security. Digital wallets give learners control over their achievements, while AI can assist in mapping skills and recommending pathways.</p><p>However, implementing these tools requires careful consideration. Equity, accessibility, and data privacy must be central to their design to avoid excluding certain groups or compromising trust. By prioritising interoperability and avoiding proprietary systems, organisations can ensure credentials remain functional across platforms and contexts.</p> Encouraging Cross-Sector Collaboration <p>The development of impactful microcredentialing systems relies on partnerships across education providers, employers, policymakers, and technology developers. Collaboration can:</p>  Align microcredentials with societal goals and workforce needs.  Establish shared quality assurance frameworks to build&nbsp;trust.  Pool resources and expertise to address challenges like accessibility and&nbsp;cost.  <p>Such partnerships help ensure that microcredentials are not only useful but also widely recognised and respected.</p> Embedding Inclusivity and&nbsp;Equity <p>For microcredentialing systems to achieve their full potential, inclusivity must be at their core. This means designing platforms that are accessible to people with diverse needs, reducing financial barriers, and proactively engaging marginalised communities. Embedding these values ensures microcredentials contribute meaningfully to social equity and support lifelong learning opportunities.</p> Taking the Next&nbsp;Step <p>Microcredentials have the potential to celebrate diverse learning experiences, allowing individuals to present their skills and achievements in ways that matter. Whether your organisation is considering a pilot project or a larger-scale initiative, We Are Open Co-op can provide the expertise you need. From strategic planning to technological implementation, we ensure your microcredentialing projects are impactful and learner-focused.</p><p>👋 <a href="https://weareopen.coop/#four">Get in touch</a> with us today to explore how we can support your journey toward a more inclusive and forward-thinking approach to credentialing.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-7-4ce87debec12">Reframing Recognition: Part 7</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>When can you trust a software release? How do you know that a software repo is safe, that it represents the intent of its creators? On the 20th anniversary of Git, these questions are more important than ever.</p>

<p>Obviously, Git lays the foundation for trust in software releases with its ability to sign commits, but the trust of the system is unfortunately shallow. Untrusted content can be merged into a trusted repo, commit histories can be rewritten, and trust can’t be reliably extended into the future. These are crucial issues to solve if we are trusting software that originates in Git … and some pretty crucial software originates with Git, from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">Microsoft’s vscode</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl">OpenSSL project</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/core">vue.js framework</a>. Which is what led me to the design of the Open Integrity system. Though Git may look like to the average user like it offers a strong level of trust, it’s a dangerous mirage. Open Integrity makes repo trust a reality.</p>


  


<p>Open Integrity is still built with Git, meaning that it can be used on GitHub, GitLab, or whatever other Git tool that you prefer. There are no additions required other than the Open Integrity scripts themselves. However, Open Integrity makes trust the default rather than an add-on, establishing a root of trust when a repo is created, defending it against inappropriate additions, and extending that trust to new users and new keys as a project evolves.</p>

<p>Beyond that, Open Integrity’s root of trust can also be used as a DID (decentralized identifier) identity, supporting <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> for a user or a project. But taking advantage of that might be the next step. For the moment, let me dive a bit further into the problems of Git’s current trust framework and how I designed the architecture of Open Integrity to resolve them.</p>

 A Problem of Trust 

<p>The foundation of trust in Git is signing commits with a signing key that is registered with a Git account, but that turns out to be a fragile level of trust because it leaves a number of loopholes.</p>

 
   
    <p>Signing isn’t required. Even if an account has a legitimate signing key, use of that key isn’t required. Even if a Git hosting service enforces commit signing, unsigned commits can typically still be merged from branches.</p>
   
   
    <p>Merging doesn’t guarantee signatures. Generally, merging offers one of the biggest gaps in signing security. It’s not just that merged commits can be unsigned, but that a branch can be deleted after merging, leaving no trace as to whether its commits were signed or not.</p>
   
 

<p>Things don’t necessarily get better when signing actually occurs.</p>

 
   
    <p>Repo origin can’t be verified. Though you can verify signed commits belong to the person who currently controls a repo, there’s no way to verify that they haven’t illegitimately taken over the repo since its inception.</p>
   
   
    <p>Chain of trust functionality is non-existant. On the flipside, there’s no way to show a legitimate transfer of authority between a repo’s originator and its current controller.</p>
   
   
    <p>Key revocation is weak. Though keys can be manually revoked, there’s no way to automatically do so, and there are no warnings if a revoked key was used for signing.</p>
   
   
    <p>History can be rewritten. Finally, Git includes a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">purposeful tool</a> to allow you to rewrite commit history: editing commit messages, rebasing at a large scale, and even removing or changing files! This will change SHA-1 checksums, but as with other dangers here, there’s inadequate messaging to warn of this issue.</p>
   
 

 Solving the Problems 

<p>Solving Git’s trust issues are relatively easy in theory:</p>

 
   Repo ownership needs to be cryptographically provable back to a repo’s origin. 
   Signing needs to be required for commits and merges alike. 
   Commit history needs to be irrevocable. 
   Strong warnings are needed when these conditions aren’t met. 
 

<p>However, nothing is ever that simple in practice. To practically solve the problems required designing an Open Integrity architecture that resolved each of the highlighted problems:</p>


  
    
      Problem
      Solution
    
  
  
    
      Unverified Origin
      Inception Commit
    
    
      Unverified Transfer
      Trust Transition Commit
    
    
      Key Revocation
      Trust Transition Commit<br>Improved Logging
    
    
      Signing Not Required
      Scripted Functions<br>Defined Settings
    
    
      Merging Issues
      Scripted Functions<br>Data Preservation<br>Defined Settings
    
    
      History Issues
      Improved Logging<br>Defined Settings
    
  


<p>Here’s how each of these architectural elements work:</p>

<p>Inception Commit. An inception commit is the first commit made to a repo. It locks the repo’s inception (initial) key with an empty commit, and so secures the repo with both the SSH signature and a SHA-1 hash that’s hard to purposefully collide because of the minimalism of the commit.</p>

<p>Trust Transition Commit. Any authorized key can be used to generate a trust transition commit, which is another zero-sized commit. Additional, trusted keys can be added, and keys can also be revoked. This allows both keys and team members to change over the course of a project, which is crucial for an open-source or large-scale project. The first trust transition commit is done with the inception key; after that any authorized key can be used.</p>

<p>Improved Logging. Many of the protections of Open Integrity arise from scripts that incorporate extensive logging, ensuring that users can see that all security measures are being met. This is done with Git commit messages and with <code>git note</code>.</p>

<p>As an example, here is what the commit logging looks like for an inception commit, a trust transition commit, and a key revocation:</p>

<p>Inception Commit:</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #a3306ef [🏁 Inception Commit] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Initialize repository and establish a SHA-1 root of trust"
    ├─ Signed by: @a61TkTtL... (🏁 Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Empty: true (no files added)
    ├─ SHA-1 Protection: Constrained content + SSH signature
└─ Verification: Platform-independent
</code>   

<p>Trust Transition Commit:</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #b24d9c1 [🔑 New Allowed Commit Signers File] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Added second device key for Alice"
    ├─ Signed by: @a61TkTtL... (🏁 Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
    └─ New Authorized Commit Signers:  
        - 🏁 Inception Key explicitly not included for future commits
        - + @a61TkTtL... (Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)  
        - + @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 2 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
</code>   
<p>Key Revocation:</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #c3d7f12 [🔄 Key Rotation: Removed Alice's Second Device] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Revoked second device key"
    ├─ Signed by: @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 2 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Authorized Commit Signers changed:
        - 🗑️ @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;) is no longer authorized.
        - @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 2 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
        - @b73RkKpQ... (Bob using Work Laptop &lt;bob@example.com&gt;)  
        - @c58XmWpL... (Charlie using Home PC &lt;charlie@example.com&gt;) 
</code>   
<p>The commits also clearly show when something is done that violates the basic precepts of Open Integrity. For example:</p>
   <code>    ├─ 🚨 ERROR: Commit was signed using a previously revoked key!
</code>   

<p>Scripted Functions. Logging and the other protections of Open Integrity are available through scripts and one-line “snippet” scripts that can run from aliases. They replace the bare <code>git</code> functions with ones that ensure that each commit or merge meets all the Open Integrity requirements. For example, here’s a <code>git merge</code> alias:</p>
   <code>git merge feature-branch --verify-signatures \
    --require-author-signature \
    --require-committer-authorization
</code>   

<p>Defined Settings. Git allows settings for repos and workflows; securing these settings can improve the security of repos. <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Enforcing_Signed_Commits_And_PRs_GitHub.md">“Enforcing Signed Commits and Pull Request Requirements in GitHub”</a> describes how GitHub makes use of these settings; similar functionality is available elsewhere in the Git ecosystem.</p>

<p>Data Preservation. Logging, aliases, and settings together ensure the preservation of some data related to a merge. As the following commit shows, information such as an author’s key is preserved when a merge occurs, along with information that the committer verified the original signature.</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #fa34d76 [🔀 Merge Commit with Verified Author] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Merge feature-branch: Added authentication layer"
    ├─ Committer: @c58XmWpL... (Charlie using Home PC &lt;charlie@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Author: @e83TkLqM... (Eve using Dev Machine &lt;eve@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Author Signature: Verified ✓ (signed 2024-02-10T15:30:00Z)
    ├─ Committer Authorization: Verified ✓ (in allowed_signers since 2024-01-15)
    └─ Signatures stored: ./config/verification/signatures
</code>   
<p>The original author’s signature is not currently preserved due to the complexity of doing so. Working to preserve the signature without having to keep the branch around forever remains on the TODO list for Open Integrity.</p>

 Using Open Integrity Now 

<p>Open Integrity is available at the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject">OpenIntegrityProject repo</a>. Though it’s still in development, you can get started with it right now.</p>

<p>You should do so if you have a use case for Open Integrity such as:</p>

 
   You’re developing or releasing software through Git that holds sensitive information (such as a digital-asset wallet, a healthcare app, or even a web browser). 
   You’re developing or releasing software through Git that might be used by people or companies that also hold sensitive data (such as financial or medical companies), even if your app does not. 
   You’re developing or releasing software that requires any level of trust from its users. 
   You have a team of developers that changes over time. 
 

<p>The docs at the Open Integrity repo include a more extensive <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity_Problem_Statement.md">Problem Statement</a> that goes beyond what’s in this article, but the most important file might be the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/src/setup_git_inception_repo.sh">setup_git_inception_repo.sh</a> script, which will create a new Open Integrity repository for you. If you want to better understand how it works under the hood, see <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity-CLI_One_Liners.md">One Liners</a>, which also documents step-by-step how to setup and use an Open Integrity repo. Future plans can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/ROADMAP.md">Project Roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>Give it <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity-CLI_One_Liners.md">a try</a>, and if you have questions, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/issues">open an issue</a> or <a href="https://github.com/orgs/OpenIntegrityProject/discussions">start a conversation</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on Open Integrity for about a year now. I started this work because I thought the promise of trust implicit in Git was extremely important for software design and release, but that it needed improvement. I hope you’ll agree and find the improvements worthwhile!</p>

<p>But that should not stop us from developing for it. Because what it specifies is laid out plainly in its PAR (Project Authorization Request):</p>
<blockquote><p>This draft standard covers contractual interactions and agreements between individuals and the service providers they engage on a network, including websites.</p>
<p>It describes how individuals, acting as first parties, can proffer their privacy requirements as contractual terms and arrive at agreements recorded and kept by both sides.</p>
<p>These terms shall be chosen from a collection of standard-form agreements in a roster kept by an independent and neutral non-business entity.</p>
<p>Computing devices and software performing as agents for both first and second parties shall engage using any protocol that serves the purpose.</p>
<p>The first party shall point to a preferred agreement, or a set of agreements, from which the second party shall accept one.</p>
<p>Party-to-party negotiations over terms in any of these contracts or other agreements are outside the scope of this standard. If both parties agree, the chosen contract or agreement shall be signed electronically by both parties or their agents.</p>
<p>A matching record shall be kept by both sides in a form that can be retrieved, audited, or disputed, if necessary, at some later time–and which is available to do so easily.*</p></blockquote>
<p>MyTerms does not specify what tech to use. It just says what needs to happen. This is to leave development as open as possible.</p>
<p>The main thing is that MyTerms obsolesces cookie notices by putting individuals in charge of their privacy requirements—and putting those requirements in the form of contracts, which individuals proffer as first parties.</p>
<p>Never mind that this hardly seems thinkable to the status quo. The same was once said of the Internet, the Web, email, and other free and open graces we take for granted today.</p>
<p>Putting each of us in charge of our privacy online is what makes MyTerms <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">the most important standard in development today</a>. But only if we make it so.</p>

Google’s tightening restrictions on the mass delivery of spam emails to your inbox is working and it’s having a devastating impact on the industry spawned to plague you with marketing messages. “Over the last year,” website&nbsp;<a href="https://martech.org/apple-and-gmail-make-it-harder-for-email-campaigns-to-get-to-the-inbox/">MarTech</a>&nbsp;says the industry has seen “engagement rates (open and click rates, especially) drop considerably. Their emails only show up in the inboxes of people already engaging with the brand. For most subscribers, the emails are getting flagged as spam.”</p>

 Challenges and Risks in Microcredentialing Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>This is the sixth in a series of blog posts drawing on insights from a <a href="https://www.ndln.ie/new-learning-and-teaching-models">report authored by We Are Open Co-op</a> (WAO) for the Irish National Digital Leadership Network (NDLN). The report explores the historical roots of credentialing, the emergence of microcredentials, and the opportunities they present for reshaping education and professional development.</p><p>While microcredentials present exciting opportunities, their implementation comes with challenges that require careful consideration. Issues such as equity, quality assurance, and unintended consequences must be addressed to ensure these systems benefit learners, organisations, and society as a whole. WAO uses the lens of <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Open Recognition</a> to help address some of these challenges.</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-1-50b0fc77cd05">Part 1 — Introduction and&nbsp;Context</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-2-985ab20a1176">Part 2 — The Evolution of Credentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-3-c3c956c09574">Part 3 — Demystifying Microcredentials</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-4-4a0811255a00">Part 4 — Trends Shaping the Future of Microcredentials</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-5-fde07efdcbd2">Part 5 — The Role of Technology in Microcredentialing</a>  Part 6 — Challenges and Risks in Microcredentialing (this&nbsp;post)  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-7-4ce87debec12">Part 7 — A Vision for the Future of Microcredentials</a>   Equity and Accessibility <p>Microcredentials have the potential to widen participation in education, but they must be designed to include all learners. Organisations need to ensure their systems are accessible to users with diverse needs, including those with disabilities, limited digital literacies, or restricted access to technology.</p><p>Financial barriers also pose a challenge. For learners in marginalised communities, the cost of earning and using microcredentials could limit their accessibility. Subsidised or open-access credentialing models can help bridge this gap and make microcredentials a tool for inclusion rather than exclusivity. As can credentialing existing knowledge, skills, and behaviours, in accordance with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_of_prior_learning">Recognition of Prior Learning</a>.</p> Quality Assurance and&nbsp;Trust <p>One of the most pressing challenges is ensuring that microcredentials maintain credibility and rigour. Open Badges provide a robust digital framework that ensures credentials can be verified and trusted, embedding metadata that describes the skills achieved, the criteria met, and the issuing organisation. This transparency builds trust among stakeholders, enabling credentials to be portable and interoperable across different platforms and contexts.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>However, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/building-credibility-into-digital-credentials-59945d07ace0">quality assurance</a> ultimately rests with the issuing organisation. It is their responsibility to ensure that criteria for earning the credential are clear, the evidence supporting the achievement is credible, and the learning experience is both meaningful and relevant. Aligning credentials with recognised national or international standards further enhances their credibility and utility, ensuring they meet the expectations of both learners and employers.</p> Avoiding Vendor&nbsp;Lock-In <p>The reliance on proprietary platforms for issuing and managing microcredentials can create significant risks. As mentioned in a prior post, vendor lock-in limits portability and learner control, undermining the principles of openness and inclusivity.</p><p>Adopting open standards, such as Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials, ensures that microcredentials are interoperable across systems. This not only protects learners but also encourages innovation by encouraging collaboration between organisations and technology providers.</p> Data Privacy and&nbsp;Security <p>Microcredentialing systems rely on digital platforms to issue, store, and share credentials, making data privacy and security critical concerns. Protecting the personal information of learners is both a legal and ethical responsibility.</p><p>Open Badges v3 offers solutions by enabling credentials to be controlled directly by learners. Features such as selective sharing ensure that individuals can decide what information to share and with whom. However, care must be taken to avoid systems that lock learners into proprietary platforms, restricting the portability of their achievements.</p> Unintended Consequences <p>Microcredentials can create new opportunities for recognition, but poorly designed systems may have unintended effects:</p>  Overloading learners with excessive or narrowly focused credentials can lead to “credential fatigue,” where the value of individual achievements is diminished.  Issuing credentials for specific skills or behaviours might inadvertently disadvantage those without them, regardless of their actual capabilities.  Systems that favour those with more resources, digital literacy, or prior access to credentialing risk perpetuating inequalities rather than addressing them.  <p>To avoid these pitfalls, microcredentialing systems should adopt <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Open Recognition</a> principles, which aim to value diverse experiences and learning pathways. Recognising informal, community-based, and lived experiences alongside formal achievements can help ensure inclusivity.</p> Sector-Specific Challenges <p>Different sectors face unique challenges when adopting microcredentials:</p>  Charities — Struggle with limited resources to implement digital credentialing systems that are both accessible and effective.  NGOs — Face difficulties in ensuring that microcredentials are inclusive for the communities they serve, particularly in low-resource environments.  Co-ops — Need to balance member-driven governance models with the technical requirements of interoperable credentialing systems.  Businesses — Risk prioritising microcredentials that align only with short-term goals, neglecting broader workforce development needs.  Higher Education — Must address resistance from academic departments that may view microcredentials as a threat to traditional degree programmes.  <p>Each of these sectors brings its own priorities and constraints to the table, but many of the challenges share common threads. Limited resources, resistance to change, and technical hurdles can all undermine the successful implementation of microcredentials if not carefully managed. Recognising these shared difficulties can help inform more effective, cross-sector strategies.</p> Practical Steps for Addressing Challenges <p>To overcome these challenges, organisations need to adopt thoughtful and inclusive approaches that address both technical and systemic barriers.</p>  Collaborate on shared frameworks that not only ensure technical validity but also assess the clarity of criteria, credibility of evidence, and relevance of learning experiences. These frameworks build trust across institutions and sectors, making microcredentials more valuable and credible.  Use open standards like Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials to ensure that microcredentials are portable, secure, and learner-centred. These standards allow credentials to be recognised across platforms and contexts, giving learners more control over their achievements.  Focus on recognising diverse forms of learning, including informal, community-based, and experiential achievements. This approach ensures inclusivity and acknowledges the broad spectrum of skills and contributions individuals bring.  Continuously evaluate systems for equity and accessibility, addressing barriers such as financial constraints, digital literacy gaps, and platform design issues. By identifying and mitigating these challenges, organisations can expand participation and make microcredentials more inclusive.   Looking Ahead <p>Addressing these challenges requires thoughtful design, collaboration, and a commitment to inclusivity. By developing systems that prioritise accessibility, quality, and openness, organisations can harness the potential of microcredentials to empower learners and drive meaningful change.</p><p>In the final post of this series, we will explore a vision for the future of microcredentials, outlining actionable steps for organisations to integrate them into their strategies effectively.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-6-fe96ea9be396">Reframing Recognition: Part 6</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Allegro: Enhancing online shopping with trusted data
 
 
     

 
             As e-commerce grows, Allegro is reducing duplicates and improving search with GS1 GTINs for a better shopping experience. 
     

 
             <p>As Poland’s leading e-commerce platform, Allegro faced challenges with duplicate listings and inconsistent product data, making it harder for shoppers to find what they needed. By integrating GS1 GTINs and Verified by GS1, Allegro is improving searchability, streamlining product listings, and enhancing the overall shopping experience.</p><p>As Allegro expanded, managing duplicate listings and ensuring accurate product information became increasingly complex. Without a standardised approach, shoppers encountered multiple listings for the same product, leading to confusion and inefficiencies.</p><p>To tackle these challenges, Allegro implemented GS1 GTINs to uniquely identify products and integrated Verified by GS1 to authenticate product data. This verification process ensures that only genuine GTINs are used, helping Allegro eliminate duplicates, maintain data integrity, and create a more seamless shopping experience for both buyers and sellers.</p><p>By leveraging GS1 standards, Allegro continues to enhance its marketplace, making product discovery more efficient while supporting sellers with a streamlined listing process.</p>

 Energy Web, WattTime, and Green Software Foundation Unveil Open-Source Carbon-Aware Nomination to Green Decentralized Computing <p>Zug, Switzerland &amp; Oakland, CA — April 3, 2025 — Energy Web, a global nonprofit building open-source Web3 technologies for the energy transition, WattTime, an environmental tech nonprofit providing real-time grid emissions data, and the Green Software Foundation (GSF) today announced the launch of Carbon-Aware Nomination, an open-source system for scheduling computing workloads based on electricity carbon-intensity. This first-of-its-kind solution leverages GSF’s Carbon-Aware SDK, blockchain technology, and live emissions data from WattTime to ensure that applications run when and where power is cleanest, drastically reducing the carbon intensity of computing workloads.</p><p>A New Standard for Carbon-Aware Compute</p><p>Carbon-Aware Nomination combines Energy Web’s decentralized computing platform with WattTime’s Automated Emissions Reduction (AER) data feeds and GSF’s Carbon-Aware SDK, allowing any batch job or flexible workload to automatically “chase” the lowest-carbon energy available. Instead of running immediately or in a fixed location, a task can be delayed or relocated — for example, executing at night in a region with abundant wind energy — with the entire decision process orchestrated and verified on the Energy Web X blockchain. Unlike traditional cloud computing tools, this system provides cryptographic proof of the carbon emissions caused, giving enterprises and developers unprecedented transparency into the sustainability of their IT operations.</p><blockquote>“Our community has been looking for ways to cut IT emissions without sacrificing performance or trust,” said Mani Hagh Sefat, CTO of Energy Web. “Carbon-Aware Nomination delivers that by leveraging decentralization. By partnering with WattTime and integrating GSF’s Carbon-Aware SDK, we’re injecting the best real-time data into an open, trustless network of computing resources. The result is a game-changer — any organization can now ensure its workloads run with the lowest possible carbon impact, and they can prove it. We’re excited to open-source this tool and work with others to scale it up; this is about creating a new norm for green computing across the industry.”</blockquote><p>Collaboration Across Climate-Tech Innovators</p><p>WattTime’s leadership echoed the significance of this collaboration.</p><blockquote>“This partnership demonstrates how data and technology can come together to fight climate change in new domains,” said Gavin McCormick, WattTime co-founder and Executive Director. “Energy Web’s innovative use of our emissions intelligence, coupled with the Green Software Foundation’s Carbon-Aware SDK, ensures that even computing workloads can automatically prioritize clean energy. We’re thrilled to see Automated Emissions Reduction principles expanding into cloud and blockchain infrastructure. By giving organizations the power to run tasks when renewables are abundant, Carbon-Aware Nomination turns climate intention into&nbsp;action.”</blockquote><blockquote>The Green Software Foundation (GSF), which has been advancing sustainability in software development, also sees this as an important milestone. “GSF’s mission is to reduce the environmental impact of software, and integrating our Carbon-Aware SDK into decentralized compute systems represents a major step toward that goal,” said Asim Hussain, Executive Director of Green Software Foundation. “By working with Energy Web and WattTime, we’re proving that sustainability can be a core part of modern computing — measurable, verifiable, and open-source.”</blockquote><p>An Open-Source Future for Climate-Smart Computing</p><p>The Carbon-Aware Nomination system is fully open-source, with documentation and developer tools provided by Energy Web. Companies and developers can integrate it into cloud workflows, decentralized applications, or scheduling software to begin reducing the carbon emissions of their operations. Because the solution runs on a public blockchain, any sustainability claims are transparent and auditable by third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>This initiative also aligns with broader efforts by the tech sector to cut emissions: recent studies estimate that data centers and networks account for over 1% of global electricity use, and industry leaders are keen to mitigate this&nbsp;impact.</p><p>By launching Carbon-Aware Nomination in collaboration with WattTime and the Green Software Foundation, Energy Web aims to foster an ecosystem of climate-smart computing. The three organizations plan to engage cloud providers, enterprises, and researchers in adopting the approach. This joint effort showcases the power of cross-sector partnerships, bringing together blockchain-based decentralization, real-time environmental intelligence, and software-driven carbon-aware scheduling.</p><p>Energy Web, WattTime, and GSF invite interested partners to join the initiative, contribute to the open-source codebase, and collectively drive a new era of sustainable digital infrastructure.</p><p>About Energy&nbsp;Web</p><p>Energy Web is a software company developing open-source technologies to accelerate the energy transition.

 An intense and unforgettable two days for the OpenID Foundation 
<p>The OpenID Foundation was again invited to lead cutting-edge interoperability&nbsp; demonstrations at the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/identity-access-management-uk">March 2025 Gartner Identity &amp; Access Management Summit</a> in London this week. This time, two Working Groups, <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">Shared Signals</a> and <a href="http://authzen">AuthZEN</a>, had a presence. The demand for our sessions far exceeded expectations, making them some of the most attended and well-received presentations at the entire event.</p>
<p>Each demonstration session was packed to capacity – so much so that crowd control became necessary! The sheer level of interest was overwhelming, with participants queuing down the corridors and waiting up to 25 minutes just to get into the room. Attendees ranged from deeply technical professionals to those relatively new to interoperability, highlighting the broad industry appeal and necessity of these innovations.</p>
<p>Over the course of two days, over 200 people attended these sessions, eager to witness the future of authorization and real-time security signaling. It was incredible to see how many firms were integrating and implementing these groundbreaking technologies. We’re proud that these sessions occupied such a unique and forward-looking place at Gartner IAM.</p>
 AuthZEN — A vision for the future of digital security 
<p>Traditionally, authorization systems have functioned in silos, creating barriers to interoperability. AuthZEN has emerged as a game-changer, much like OpenID Connect did for authentication, by bridging Policy Decision Points (PDPs), identity providers, and API gateways. Its standardization enables organizations to scale while maintaining strong security—a necessity in today’s complex regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>During the event, 15 prominent industry players, including Aserto, Axiomatics, AWS, Cerbos, OpenFGA, Topaz, Rock Solid Knowledge, Sgnl, Amazon API Gateway, Broadcom, Envoy, Kong, Tyk, WSO2 and Zuplo, conducted <a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OpenID-AuthZEN-Datasheet-Gartner-London.pdf">live demonstrations showcasing how AuthZEN seamlessly integrates multiple systems into a unified security fabric</a>. This approach not only reinforces the principle of least privilege, but also introduces dynamic separation of duties and continuous authorization enforcement, greatly enhancing auditability and compliance.</p>
<p>One of the standout moments was the executive session titled “<a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AuthZEN-Gartner-IAM-2025-London.pdf">AuthZEN: The OpenID Connect’ of Authorization</a>.” Working Group Chairs Omri Gazitt, CEO of Aserto, and David Brossard, CTO of Axiomatics, took the stage to provide deep insights into the strategic importance of AuthZEN. Their presentation emphasized how the rising number of interoperable implementations since December 2024 signals an “OAuth moment” for runtime authorization—a turning point in the industry. The immense interest from attendees underscored that the industry is ready to move beyond legacy authorization systems and embrace a dynamic, scalable future.</p>
 Shared Signals Framework- Strengthening trust in real time 
<p>Alongside the success of AuthZEN, the event also celebrated the growing impact of the Shared Signals Framework (SSF) and the Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol (CAEP). These technologies are driving new levels of transparency and reliability in authorization by enabling real-time sharing of security signals.</p>
<p>Led by Atul Tulshibagwale, Corporate Board Member of the OpenID Foundation, WG Co-Chair, and CTO of SGNL, SSF was showcased by nine industry leaders, including SGNL, Google, IBM, Okta, Omnissa, Relock, SailPoint, Thales, and Beyond Identity. <a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OpenID-CAEP-and-SSF-Datasheet-Gartner-London-2.pdf">Their demonstrations illustrated how SSF and CAEP create a “trust fabric”—a dynamic, interconnected system that enhances security through continuous access evaluation.</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Atul Tulshibagwale’s presentation, “<a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mar25-Gartner-IAM_-Building-a-Trust-Fabric-with-the-OpenID-Shared-Signals-Framework.pdf">Building a Trust Fabric with the OpenID Shared Signals Framework</a>” was another major highlight. The session drew a large audience keen to understand how SSF is reshaping security through proactive, real-time decision-making. The overwhelming turnout reinforced the industry’s commitment to adopting innovative trust-based frameworks for authentication and authorization.</p>
 A glimpse into the future of security 
<p>The convergence of AuthZEN and Shared Signals at Gartner IAM 2025 marked a pivotal moment in addressing the complex challenges of modern authorization. These technologies are not only robust and scalable, but also agile enough to adapt to evolving security threats and compliance requirements.</p>
<p>For security professionals, IAM teams, and technology architects, these sessions served as a call to action—an invitation to rethink, refine, and revolutionize their authorization strategies. The event provided a valuable forum for the community to discuss, question, and contribute to the ongoing evolution of these standards, fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation.</p>
<p>Looking back, the energy, the discussions, the live demos, and the sheer enthusiasm of attendees made it clear: AuthZEN and Shared Signals are not just theoretical advancements, they are practical, game-changing solutions already making a significant impact on enterprise security. And the OpenID Foundation is proud to be at the forefront of this transformation.</p>

Open standards ensure that credentials can be shared and recognised across different systems, making them more portable and trustworthy.</p><p><a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/What_Are_Open_Badges%3F">Open Badges</a>, first introduced in 2011, set the stage for this revolution. These digital credentials provide important information, such as what the learner achieved, who issued the badge, and the criteria they met. The latest version, Open Badges v3, goes even further by aligning with a global framework called Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>This update brings several improvements:</p>  Learner Control — Credentials can now be managed by the individual rather than being tied to a single institution or platform.  No Mandatory Image — While the badge image remains a useful visual, the most important feature is the detailed information embedded in the credential, which helps employers and others verify it&nbsp;easily.  Rich Information — Microcredentials can now include deeper context about what was achieved, such as specific skills, the learning process, and connections to recognised frameworks or standards.  <p>These advancements make microcredentials more meaningful and usable, not just in local settings but internationally as&nbsp;well.</p> Digital Wallets: Empowering Learners <p>Digital wallets, sometimes referred to as ‘credential management’ apps, are a transformative tool for managing microcredentials. By storing credentials in a secure, user-controlled environment on their mobile device, learners gain full ownership of their achievements. This flexibility allows individuals to share only the information needed for specific opportunities, such as job applications or further study, while maintaining privacy.</p><p>For example, a learner could use their digital wallet to share a single credential with a potential employer, without needing to reveal unrelated personal details such as their age or gender. This approach protects privacy and gives learners greater control over how their achievements are presented.</p><p>Digital wallets also facilitate the portability of microcredentials, ensuring that they can be recognised across different contexts. For organisations, adopting digital wallet-compatible credentials demonstrates a commitment to learner-centric practices and enhances the usability of their offerings.</p> Sector-Specific Applications <p>Technology enables microcredentials to meet the unique needs of different sectors, enhancing their impact and relevance:</p>  Charities — Use digital badges to recognise volunteer contributions, fundraising efforts, and advocacy skills, providing participants with evidence of their&nbsp;impact.  NGOs — Leverage open standards to validate community workers’ skills and promote inclusivity in recognition practices.  Co-ops — Employ interoperable credentials to highlight informal learning and collaborative problem-solving within member-driven environments.  Businesses — Integrate microcredentials with existing professional development platforms to enhance employee upskilling and retention, focusing on sustainability or diversity goals.  Higher Education — Adopt technologies like digital wallets to make credentials earned through co-curricular activities or industry collaborations more accessible and portable for students.   Balancing Innovation with Responsibility <p>Technology offers new possibilities for recognising and showcasing skills, but its use must be carefully planned to avoid potential pitfalls. Challenges such as over-reliance on specific vendors, risks to data security, and barriers to access can undermine the effectiveness and fairness of microcredentialing systems.</p><p>To address these concerns:</p>  Adopt open-source and interoperable solutions — These reduce the risk of being locked into a single provider’s platform, ensuring flexibility and long-term sustainability.  Focus on accessibility — Systems should be designed to include users with a wide range of needs, enabling participation from all, regardless of ability or circumstance.  Prioritise data security and privacy — Organisations must implement robust measures to protect sensitive user information, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and building trust among learners and stakeholders.  <p>By taking a responsible approach, organisations can ensure that their microcredentialing efforts are not only innovative but also equitable, secure, and adaptable for the&nbsp;future.</p> Looking Ahead <p>Technology is more than just a way to expand microcredentials — it is reshaping how learning is recognised and valued. By using approaches built on open standards, organisations can create microcredentialing systems that are secure, accessible to everyone, and focused on the needs of learners.</p><p>In the next post, we will explore the challenges and risks associated with microcredentialing, including how to address equity, quality assurance, and unintended consequences.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-5-fde07efdcbd2">Reframing Recognition: Part 5</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Specialists from different fields in the digital identity ecosystem have shed light on what it takes to be accredited for New Zealand’s Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF). They shared their thoughts during a webinar on March 26 moderated by the Executive Director of Digital Identity New Zealand, Colin Wallis, during which they also explained details about the process and the benefits that come with the accreditation.</p>



<p>The DISTF in New Zealand is a legal framework designed to regulate digital identity services as the country looks to expand its digital ID services. New rules and accreditation system of the DISTF&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/new-zealand-finalizes-digital-identity-services-trust-framework">took effect</a>&nbsp;last November.</p>



<p>The objective of the webinar dubbed “DISTF Evaluators Showcase” was to provide an opportunity for those considering a DISTF accreditation to have an understanding of its advantages for small and large scale entities, organizational roles, costs and time frames, and the preparation process for the evaluation of compliance with standards which precedes the accreditation application.</p>



<p>Discussants included security consultant at Middleware Group,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-norcliffe-2646061/">Tom Norcliffe</a>; Director of Cyber, Privacy and Resilience at Deloitte which is an accredited evaluator,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-bossert-02186b11/">Marcus Bossert</a>; and Founder of Cianaa Technologies,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cianaatech/">Rizwan Ahmad</a>, who are all&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">Digital Identity New Zealand</a>&nbsp;members. There was also the Regulatory Practice Manager of New Zealand’s Department of Internal Affairs,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deanne-myers-746628a7/">Deanne Myers</a>.</p>



<p>The first three speakers took time off to make an introduction of their companies, highlighting their services and key projects across the domains of digital identity and cybersecurity. They also mentioned some of their projects in New Zealand and the institutions they work with.</p>



<p>Bossert, for a start, explained the work Deloitte as a consultancy services firm is doing in the digital security assessment space. He mentioned that the firm offers services in cyber strategy, transformation, digital privacy, trust, and enterprise security, application cloud security, emerging technology solutions, threat detection and response, as well as operational security services. He also said that they have worked extensively on digital identity projects.</p>



<p>He said evaluation for the DISTF accreditation process looks at several factors including enterprise security, cloud security, security and resilience mechanisms, and threat detection and response, among others. The official also explained that the firm plays a significant role in guiding organizations through the accreditation process, helping them to align their cybersecurity and privacy expertise in order to ensure successful transactions.</p>



 Accreditation not a mere compliance formality 



<p>The accreditation, he insisted, is not just for the purposes of compliances but is something that enables entities demonstrate robust security practices which are vital for building confidence and trust among stakeholders such as boards, customers, and even regulators.</p>



<p>“If you think about why you want to get accredited, you’ve got to think about the stakeholders that are involved in this. But fundamentally, you have to think about it from a more practical and operational perspective as well,” Bossert said.</p>



<p>“Security, privacy, development and operations teams are really interested in knowing that you have solid security practices built in. It is quite valuable for them to understand and have clarity on what the control measures are. So, I see the accreditation process as a mechanism to build confidence that your stakeholders need,” he stated.</p>



<p>“[Thanks to] the work that we do, our knowledge and global network, we can help you accelerate readiness and navigate the shortest path to success, so that we help you focus on those things that really matter, get your accreditation and accelerate operational readiness.”</p>



<p>For his part, Norcliffe from Middleware Group emphasized the importance of the digital ID trust framework, saying it is crucial for most of the work they are doing with government entities and the private sector in New Zealand.</p>



<p>Taking the floor, Ahmad said Cianaa Technologies has a framework on which their team of independent security evaluators offer services which include penetration testing, privacy, and GDPR compliance.</p>



<p>“We assess organizations based on this [framework]. We see whether you’re keeping the information confidential, whether you have the integrity intact, whether your services are available, whether it has non-repetition, and if it has the proper authentication authorization,” he said.</p>



<p>“Now, when we assess your organization based on that, it actually automatically gives up to the right assessment, because if something is missing, then there’s something missing in security.”</p>



 Overview of accreditation application process 



<p>Myers said the team she manages is responsible for basically all aspects of the accreditation process. She gave an overview of components of the application process required by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dia.govt.nz/Trust-Framework-Authority">Trust Framework Authority</a>&nbsp;(TFA), noting that the entire process is transparent.</p>



<p>“We receive and assess applications for accreditation as a trust framework provider. We monitor ongoing compliance with the requirements of accreditation, assess applications for renewal, and obviously deal with any issues that arise in the course of these processes.”</p>



<p>She explained that a part of the application process requires results of an independent evaluation undertaken by independent evaluators, including a conformance assessment against the New Zealand identification standards. “Those outputs or deliverables will be submitted as part of an application,” she stated.</p>



<p>“There are currently 15 independent security evaluators who have been appointed and three privacy independent evaluators. However, we are currently undertaking an expression of interest process, calling for interest from other agencies who are able and who meet the criteria to be appointed as either a privacy or security evaluator, or both.”</p>



<p>Myers also shared important links and resources which can help those seeking accreditation to better understand what is required of them and how they can go through the process successfully. She also said the application would need to be submitted within 12 months of the standards compliance evaluation.</p>



 Understand what you need 



<p>The speakers also noted the place of AI in the trust framework evaluation process. Ahmad said while the technology can make a positive contribution to the process, it can also bring about challenges that effect these assessments.</p>



<p>Bossert added that those applying for accreditation must clearly understand what they need, and often, they expect the process to be as quick, painless and cost-effective as possible.</p>



<p>“If you’ve ever done something like an ISO accreditation, you would understand or know that it is very useful to be clear on the scope of accreditation that you’re looking for. So don’t apply for accreditation for areas that you don’t need. For example, if you’re not going to be providing personal information, then don’t sign up for accreditation for that,” he advised.</p>



<p>He also said for evaluators to have their work made easy, those seeking to provide trust services must take certain key factors into consideration, including having the right control and risk management mechanisms in place.</p>



<p>“I would suggest that you have a look at your solution and do a proper risk assessment early on so that you’ve got visibility of those risks and that you can start building in the necessary controls. In terms of risks, if you can demonstrate that you’re actively managing them and you have visibility and control, then that certainly helps to give the confidence needed.”</p>



<p>The aspect of pricing for the evaluation process was also addressed, with the speakers saying the process can range, approximately, from between $10,000 and $50,000, depending on the scope and the level of preparedness of the entity to be evaluated.</p>

		<p>Early on, Patricia Morreale, Ph.D., knew she was drawn to a career in science or engineering. With an early exposure to problem-solving through math, science, and the hands-on experience of taking things apart, her interest in these subjects continued to grow. Later during college, her exposure to computer science set her on a path to becoming a leader in the field, a journey that would take her from a curious student to Professor and Chair, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Hennings College of Science, Mathematics, and Technology, at Kean University.</p>
<p>Unlocking Opportunities through Computer Science<br>
During a university summer program following her junior year of high school, Morreale had the chance to explore a programming language and how to apply it to solve problems. “I was fascinated by the idea that I could instruct machines to perform tasks, and this sparked a new interest in programming and engineering,” shares Morreale. “I realized that computer science was at the core of nearly every engineering field, and I liked the idea of being involved in something so fundamental to technology. At the time, I wasn’t sure what specific career I wanted, but I knew I wanted something versatile and portable. Computer science, with its broad applications and adaptability, stood out as the perfect choice.”</p>
<p>As she often tells her students, the beauty of computer science lies in its portability. “You can get off a plane anywhere and they’re going to need you,” says Morreale. “Whether working remotely or joining a local firm, computer science skills are in constant demand. Unlike professions that require specific licensing, computer science offers flexibility and relevance in today’s world. In fact, with the increasing reliance on technology in everyday life, understanding how computers work has become an essential skill for managing the modern world.”</p>
<p>After receiving her B.S. in computer science from Northwestern University, Morreale worked in the industry for several years in network design where she helped build large-distributed networks that went from coast to coast. “During this time, I returned to graduate school in hopes of opening doors to new opportunities,” shares Morreale. “I wanted more control over the work I was doing and the ability to pursue my own interests, so I took a year off to complete my Ph.D. residency, eventually transitioning into academia with positions at Northeastern Illinois University, and later, Stevens Institute of Technology. Having credentials that are portable allows me the flexibility to explore different opportunities and meet the needs of an ever-changing industry.”</p>
<p>In her transition from industry to academia, Morreale says having colleagues who have also worked in the industry provides a shared understanding of organizational goals, time management, and return on investment that enhances their ability to lead effectively. “My industry experience has been crucial in managing people who are results-driven and focused on efficiency. I’m able to speak to corporate partners, write proposals, and apply a big picture perspective to smaller tasks. We also have a commitment to student success that parallels the industry mindset—viewing students as valuable assets to our department and whose development is key to their broader impact in the world.”</p>
<p>Promoting Interdisciplinary Conversations<br>
Making significant contributions through her research in machine learning and network systems, Morreale has helped drive innovations in error detection and secure processing, which have been patented and brought to market. “My earlier work in network systems and machine learning is a result of partnering with a colleague at Argonne National Laboratories and our interest in detecting degradation in a network environment,” explains Morreale. “By detecting early signs of degradation, we could intervene before a complete collapse or failure occurred, sampling and testing indicators to address issues proactively rather than waiting for a hard failure.”</p>
<p>“These solutions resulted from collaboration and casual conversations among researchers and showed the importance of regularly discussing topics, whether via email, at conferences, or in the hallway,” continues Morreale. “Cross-pollination and interdisciplinary conversation is highly important to overcoming challenges and finding impactful solutions. Talking to different people who all bring unique experiences and perspectives helps generate innovative ideas and leads to breakthroughs that wouldn’t be possible in isolation. So many different fields are impacting computer science—whether it’s artificial intelligence (AI) being used for biological discovery and new drug development or computational methods applied to large and ambitious problems. By working across disciplines, we not only solve technical problems but also address real-world challenges with solutions that are more comprehensive, effective, and far-reaching.”</p>

		<p>Instilling Computational Thinking<br>
Along with facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration, Morreale is dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by promoting faculty development and encouraging undergraduate students to engage in research opportunities. “I encourage my students from all backgrounds to see themselves as part of the tech world,” says Morreale. “Through outreach programs and campus tours, we create an inclusive environment at Kean where students are reminded, ‘You can be here.’ Whether through K-12 initiatives or conversations with prospective students, I want to make sure they recognize that everyone, has a place in computing and that this discipline is fundamental to our day-to-day lives. We aim to flatten access to technology and demonstrate that with the right support, anyone can reach their goals.”</p>
<p>To help improve student success, Morreale says we need to reach students earlier in their education. “As technology and knowledge evolve, many of the topics that were once reserved for graduate courses—such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data visualization—are now part of undergraduate and high school curricula. This shift reflects the fact that K-12 students are entering college with a stronger foundation in areas like cybersecurity and the basics of AI, including skills like shaping search criteria and using tools like ChatGPT. These tools are advancing rapidly, and academic institutions need to be prepared to meet students where they are in their understanding.”<br>
“Looking back about ten to fifteen years ago, there was a focus on instilling computational thinking in K-12 students—teaching them to think sequentially, with an understanding of what comes first, second, and third to solve a problem,” continues Morreale. “Today, many students are already coming to college equipped with this kind of thinking, showing that early exposure to computational concepts is paying off. To continue improving student success, it’s crucial to build on this foundation and ensure that higher education institutions are ready to challenge and support these students as they advance in their knowledge of technology and its applications.”</p>
<p>To promote AI and advanced technology education earlier, Kean is making professional development a priority to help faculty be well-equipped to mentor incoming students. “The research topics that today’s undergraduates are ready to take on are even more advanced, so we must ensure we have a sophisticated faculty mentoring program to help our new student researchers build their own ideas, work collaboratively, understand constructive criticism, and manage a project from start to finish.”</p>
<p>As a member of the Council of Undergraduate Research (CUR), Kean is able to access valuable resources and networking opportunities that help support undergraduate research and strengthen the institution’s research presence. “To cultivate the next generation of scientists and researchers, we must invest in undergraduate students, providing them with opportunities to engage in research and develop their skills early on,” says Morreale. “In working with CUR, we can identify and mentor young talent, empowering them to create research posters, write papers, and pursue advanced degrees. I’ve been very fortunate to have had many great students who have gone on to amazing careers, continued to graduate school or became teachers who are now shaping the next generation of students.”</p>
<p>Morreale is involved with the NCWIT, which aims to increase participation in the field of computing. “I’ve learned many wonderful techniques from NCWIT to encourage students to consider technology careers and find computing experiences that align with their interests,” shares Morreale. “This organization also led me to work with the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI), which is more than eighty colleges and universities in the United States working together to recruit, retain, and advance students in computing.

		<p>Supporting Local Workforce Development<br>
To help retain graduates within the state, many institutions are focusing on developing strategies that aim to keep skills within the local workforce rather than seeing professionals take their talents elsewhere. “New Jersey has an outstanding community college and higher education system,” says Morreale. “We want to make sure there are plenty of opportunities for our students within our region to excel in the workforce. The New Jersey AI Hub provides a remarkable opportunity for collaboration between industry and university, and I think our state can lead the nation in supporting workforce development and advancing research and innovation.”</p>
<p>Building a strong support system is essential for engaging students in meaningful research opportunities, significantly enhancing their academic experience and contributing to a positive career trajectory. “We want to demystify the traditional idea of what a research career looks like and show students that research can take many forms and offer diverse career paths in various fields,” explains Morreale. “We begin by introducing topics of interest and research in our classes and encouraging students to meet with us outside of class. Faculty members also inform students about academic careers and the rewards they can offer, which has proven helpful. For example, when a conference paper is accepted, the excitement of presenting it at a prestigious conference, sometimes in fascinating locations, can be a thrilling experience for students.”</p>
<p>Morreale adds, “We also highlight the various rewards academic work can bring, such as having your name published or securing research funding. Many careers lack direct feedback, making it difficult to know if your contributions are making a significant impact. In academia, however, there’s more immediate recognition—students can see the results of their work, whether through published papers or funded grants. I want to make sure I emphasize these successes and explain the process behind them. Kean also provides summer support for faculty-student researcher teams that helps develop critical skills, foster innovation, and provide valuable hands-on experience in collaborative environments.”</p>

Together, we are leveraging cutting-edge technologies to empower researchers, educators, and students, accelerating innovation and driving impactful solutions for the challenges of tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Building the Future of AI<br>
In April 2020, NJIT began exploring the addition of an M.S. program in Artificial Intelligence. “The program was conceived to address both the evolving needs of the tech industry and NJIT’s mission to offer innovative, cutting-edge education,” shares Wang. “At the beginning, AI wasn’t perceived as having widespread demand and there was some skepticism about launching such a program. Some colleagues expressed concerns that this venture might be premature and would require too much work. However, we strongly believed in the transformative potential of AI and the growing demand for expertise in the field. The process involved multiple stages of curriculum development, course creation, and rigorous approval procedures.”</p>
<p>During development, one of the foundational courses created was Natural Language Processing, which plays a crucial role in larger language models. “This course, along with others, was proposed and discussed in collaboration with colleagues, ensuring that the curriculum was comprehensive and aligned with industry needs,” explains Wang. “After receiving approval for these courses from NJIT’s Committee on Graduate Education, the next phase was to develop the program proposal for the M.S. in AI. The proposal went through a multi-layered approval process, beginning with the NJIT Faculty Senate, which gave its endorsement in November 2021. Following this, the program was announced to over thirty universities across New Jersey for feedback. With positive responses, the program moved forward with formal submissions to the New Jersey Department of Education and other regulatory bodies. By April 2022, NJIT began the process of complying with new standards for academic degree programs, which required submitting updated forms.”</p>
<p>By September 2022, the program had undergone external review from Dr. Jim Handler, a fellow of IEEE, ACM, and AAAI, who evaluated NJIT’s resources, faculty, and infrastructure to ensure the program’s viability. “After Dr. Handler’s site visit and a thorough review process, the program received approvals from the NJIT Budget Office, Faculty Senate, and the Board of Trustees, moving it closer to its official launch,” says Wang. “Later in the Spring of 2023, after receiving final approvals from New Jersey’s Academic Integrity Committee and the New Jersey President’s Council, the program was officially greenlit. By summer 2023, NJIT launched the M.S. in Artificial Intelligence program, positioning the university as a leader in AI education and offering students opportunities to explore interdisciplinary research and collaborate with experts in fields like solar science, finance, and transportation.”</p>
<p>“The launch of this program marks a significant milestone in NJIT’s efforts to prepare students for the growing AI-driven job market,” continues Wang. “The program is not only a response to AI’s rising prominence, but also a reflection of NJIT’s commitment to providing students with practical skills through hands-on learning, capstone projects, and industry partnerships. Through this degree, NJIT aims to train the next generation of AI professionals and contribute to the development of the evolving AI ecosystem.”</p>
	 
 



 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“Gender diversity plays a critical role in fostering innovation in AI. Diversity in AI is not just about representation or societal impact—it directly contributes to more effective problem solving and system optimization. Since AI systems learn from data and build models based on algorithms, ensuring diverse cognitive viewpoints helps mitigate biases and enhances problem-solving efficiency. If the perspectives shaping these systems are homogeneous, AI development risks reinforcing limitations and failing to fully leverage the strengths that arise from different cognitive abilities.”</p>

		<p>Establishing Ethical and Effective AI Governance<br>
As the only academic representative on the New Jersey Supreme Court Committee on AI and the Courts and a contributor to the Governor’s AI Taskforce AI Innovation Group, Wang acknowledges the transformative power AI has had on our lives and society. “AI has reshaped various sectors, including the legal system, and while it presents remarkable opportunities, this technology also introduces new challenges that require careful governance and oversight. I am honored to serve as the only academic representative on the New Jersey Supreme Court Committee on AI and the Courts and in the Governor’s AI Taskforce AI Innovation SubGroup. These roles have provided me with valuable insights into both the potential benefits and risks of integrating AI into legal and governmental frameworks.”</p>
<p>One of the pressing concerns in AI governance is ensuring fairness in automated decision-making systems. AI models learn from historical data, which may contain biases that can result in unintended discrimination in areas such as hiring, and credit decisions. Additionally, large language models can exhibit hallucination problems, generating inaccurate or misleading information. Given these risks, the use of AI in legal and governmental settings must be approached with caution and guided by clear policies and ethical considerations. “The New Jersey Supreme Court Committee on Artificial Intelligence released preliminary guidelines on AI usage in January,” explains Wang. “As stated in the Guidelines, ‘In furtherance of its responsibility to uphold the highest level of professionalism among lawyers, the New Jersey Supreme Court seeks to balance the benefits of innovation whilst safeguarding against the potential harms of misuse. To that end, the Court here provides preliminary guidelines on the use of AI to support lawyers who practice in New Jersey and the clients who depend on those lawyers.’”</p>
<p>As the potential of AI continues to unfold, it becomes clear that this advanced technology can play a pivotal role in enhancing access to essential services. “AI has the potential to significantly improve access to legal and government services, particularly for underrepresented and economically disadvantaged communities,” says Wang. “AI-powered legal assistance can help individuals navigate legal processes more efficiently, while automated public service tools can streamline administrative tasks and improve response times. Multilingual AI systems can further enhance accessibility for non-English speakers, ensuring equitable access to legal resources. AI governance is about more than just regulation; it is also about fostering responsible innovation. While regulatory frameworks are essential to mitigate risks, they should also encourage AI research and development that benefits society. Policymakers must strike a balance between protecting public interests and enabling technological advancements.”</p>

		<p>The Role of Diversity in AI Innovation and Leadership<br>
Research has consistently shown that while the average IQ scores for men and women are nearly identical, their cognitive strengths often manifest in different domains. Men tend to excel in spatial reasoning tasks, whereas women often outperform in verbal intelligence and memory-related skills. These differences, however, extend beyond individual abilities—they also influence the broader landscape of innovation, particularly in fields like AI. “Gender diversity plays a critical role in fostering innovation in AI,” says Wang. “Diversity in AI is not just about representation or societal impact—it directly contributes to more effective problem solving and system optimization. Since AI systems learn from data and build models based on algorithms, ensuring diverse cognitive viewpoints helps mitigate biases and enhances problem-solving efficiency. If the perspectives shaping these systems are homogeneous, AI development risks reinforcing limitations and failing to fully leverage the strengths that arise from different cognitive abilities.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being the first female IEEE Fellow at NJIT represents more than just a personal achievement for Wang; the accolade marks a significant step toward broader representation in the field of AI. “Recognitions like this help break stereotypes and inspire future generations of underrepresented groups to pursue leadership roles in AI, further enhancing diversity and innovation in the field. Acknowledging women based on merit, rather than gender, is essential to fostering diversity and innovation.”</p>
<p>“Such recognition helps combat social bias, encourages more women to pursue careers in AI, and enables them to realize their full potential—ultimately benefiting both society and the scientific field,” continues Wang. “In terms of leadership, success in AI requires a balance of technical expertise, emotional intelligence, interpersonal skills, and visionary thinking. Gender diversity strengthens leadership by bringing in a wider range of perspectives and problem-solving approaches, contributing to more inclusive and effective decision-making.”</p>
<p>Addressing the Ethical and Societal Impacts of AI<br>
To address the new ethical and societal challenges posed by AI, Wang says we can approach the problem from two perspectives. “The White-Box Approach involves analyzing AI systems in a transparent and interpretable manner to pinpoint specific components or processes that contribute to ethical concerns. By understanding which aspects of the AI system introduce challenges, we can develop targeted countermeasures, such as refining training data, improving model interpretability, or implementing fairness constraints. In cases where AI models are too complex or opaque for direct examination, the Black-Box Approach focuses exclusively on their outcomes. This requires quantitative evaluation of AI’s societal impact through auditing and fairness assessment methods. If discrepancies or biases are identified in real-world applications, appropriate interventions and policy adjustments can be implemented to mitigate harm.”</p>
<p>Beyond these technical approaches, some challenges related to the adoption of AI are rooted in social and psychological factors. “Public skepticism, misinformation, and fear of AI can influence its perception and acceptance,” notes Wang. “Therefore, AI education for the general public is essential to foster informed discussions and responsible adoption. Encouragingly, I have observed a strong and growing public interest in AI, which presents an opportunity to enhance awareness and ensure its ethical integration into society. As AI continues to advance, promoting transparency, fairness, and ethical accountability, alongside increasing public awareness, will be key to ensuring that AI benefits society as a whole. By integrating these efforts, we can navigate the complexities of AI adoption and create a future where innovation is both responsible and inclusive.”</p>

		<p>From his early days studying computer science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to his current leadership role as Executive Director of the Massachusetts Green High-Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC), John Goodhue has blazed a career path at the intersection of networking and computing. “When I was graduating and finishing my last class, I remember my professor telling us about a company in western Cambridge that was working on the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET),” recalls Goodhue. “This pioneering computer network was a precursor to the Internet, and I was able to join their team right out of college. It turned out that they were also working on smaller networks for interconnecting many individual computers and turning them into what we now call clusters.”</p>
<p>Serving on the management teams for several early-stage Boston-area startup companies, Goodhue was at the forefront of the networking field as the Internet was taking shape, playing a pivotal role in the development of foundational technologies that would help shape the digital landscape. “I led the formation of a startup that became the first acquisition of what was an obscure company called Cisco Systems,” says Goodhue. “Starting In 1995 when the commercial internet was starting to explode, I spent nearly ten years building out the Internet and later riding through the crash of 2000. Throughout this period, I discovered I had a real passion for leading teams who could turn ideas into reality. Along the way, I’ve learned that being a good leader means taking time to understand people and resolve disputes within your team, often doing so between individuals who are smarter than you.”</p>
<p>Supporting Growing Computing Needs<br>
With experience leading initiatives to advance Internet routing and high-performance computing technologies, Goodhue joined MGHPCC as the executive director in 2010. “At the time, the organization was still a startup,” says Goodhue. “We built a facility, assembled a consortium, and it’s now a thriving high-performance computing center with an emphasis on green, sustainable computing.”</p>
<p>Designed to serve the growing scientific and engineering computing needs at six of the most research-intensive universities in the northeast, MGHPCC is a joint venture of Boston University, Harvard University, MIT, Northeastern University, The University of Massachusetts, and Yale University. “At any given time, there are 20,000 people who use resources in the Center to advance their state-of-the-art research and education,” says Goodhue. “We provide a crucial infrastructure that underpins the scientific world in our field—without it, they wouldn’t be able to do what they do. The excitement of working at the center is similar to the first time I built a small scientific instrument as a student. When I was working on a piece of the instrument late one night someone stopped, looked at their results and said, ‘This is amazing. I now see that things I thought were true are not quite right, so I must rethink everything and approach what I’m doing in a different way.’ Seeing that kind of discovery, that spark in someone’s eyes, is at the core of why what we do matters.”</p>

		<p>“We’re at a really interesting time when it comes to technology. The amount of power consumed per square foot by newer GPU-based computers has increased by a factor of five or ten. From a facility perspective, this means we must make significant changes. On the architecture side, the rise of GPUs introduces new programming techniques.. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), we now have an entirely new software ecosystem to manage, and the introduction of orchestrated versus batch-scheduled workloads adds another layer of complexity. These are all challenges we are able to address collectively, rather than everyone learning the same thing multiple times. This approach has made a huge difference, and as technology continues to evolve, we’ll be able to support each other, stay ahead of the curve, and ensure that our infrastructure and expertise evolve in tandem with these advances.”</p>
<p>The MGHPCC facility includes 33,000 square feet of dedicated computer room space, designed specifically for high-performance computing systems. The building is powered by a 20MW feed and features a highly efficient cooling system that supports a Power Usage Effectiveness of 1.2. “Many of the decisions that have shaped our environmental impact at MGHPCC were made early on, including the site where we chose to build,” explains Goodhue. “Located in Massachusetts, our principal environmental impact today is the consumption of electricity. From the outset, we made the conscious decision to build on a brownfield site rather than a greenfield site, avoiding the disruption of undeveloped land. This choice was followed by six months of environmental remediation before construction began.”</p>
<p>With a focus on maximizing energy efficiency while minimizing negative environmental impacts, MGHPCC is among the top ten percent of energy efficient data centers in the world. “We improved an existing industrial location, minimizing our impact on the environment,” shares Goodhue. “Additionally, we focused on sustainable design by building a LEED Platinum-certified facility, paying close attention to every detail, from recycling materials to selecting eco-friendly cleaning products. Environmental impact is often a battle of inches—small decisions that, when made thoughtfully, add up to a significant positive effect. The electricity we consume also reflects deliberate choices. Located in western Massachusetts, we benefit from a less-loaded grid and easy access to electricity. Moreover, we’re situated just half a mile from a hydroelectric facility that generates far more electricity than we actually consume, making our energy usage even more sustainable.”</p>
<p>Regional and National Collaboration<br>
Through initiatives like the Northeast Storage Exchange, the Open Storage Network (OSN), Ecosystem for Research Computing, and the Northeast Big Data Hub, MGHPCC has contributed to collaborations across institutions and helped strengthen the research computing ecosystem. “There are two key ways in which we achieve efficiency,” says Goodhue. “First, by leveraging economies of scale—when more people use the same resources­—we reduce operating costs and improve efficiency. The fixed operating costs are spread across a larger user base, making it less expensive for all. The second benefit is providing the opportunity for people to learn from each other. That collaborative learning is incredibly important to solving problems and advancing scientific discovery.”</p>
<p>“The sharing of knowledge is just as important as any economic benefit,” continues Goodhue. “For example, the Open Storage Network (OSN) sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) is a network of storage devices that is now spread across nearly twenty locations. Each site benefits from the collective design and development efforts. It’s a collaborative effort between MGHPCC, the San Diego Supercomputing Center, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI), and Johns Hopkins University. Each partner brings unique expertise, and when a challenge arises or a change is needed, there’s always someone with the right experience to guide us. The whole is truly greater than the sum of its parts when it comes to sharing knowledge, insight, and lessons learned.”</p>
<p>To bring advanced computing resources to researchers at smaller institutions in northern New England, MGHPCC contributed to the formation of the Northeast Cyberteam, a partnership between MGHPCC, University of Maine, University of New Hampshire, and University of Vermont. “Smaller institutions often face constraints, where educators are focused on teaching, but want to incorporate research computing into their work,” says Goodhue. “Researchers often want to continue their work from when they were graduate students, but most institutions can’t provide the necessary computing resources. While the gap in available resources is a challenge, it’s one that’s relatively easy to address. The bigger issue lies in finding research computing facilitators who can bridge the gap and make it easier for researchers to access and use the necessary technology.”</p>
<p>“To make the best use of computing resources, we need to bring in people who can help,” continues Goodhue. “The NSF funded a project where we recruited experts from larger universities to mentor students. These students learned how to be facilitators and assist researchers at smaller institutions in getting up and running. This initiative worked out well, and in many cases, the students’ contributions resulted in their names being included in published papers. Over time, we also built a network large enough to rely on and connect with people who needed important resources.”</p>
<p>To further the goals of broadening participation in computing set by its founding members, MGHPCC and its members partner with local, regional, and national education programs. For example, interns at the MGHPCC engage with a range of high-performance computing hardware and software systems, beginning with foundational readings and exercises on the Linux operating system, system administration tools, and Python scripting. They then progress to hands-on tasks, with assignments tailored to their skills and the specific needs of the program. “Finding trained individuals who are well-versed in running high-performance computing systems is challenging,” says Goodhue. “Our internship program offers a way for local community college students to gain the necessary experience. This program provides practical experience, advanced skill building, and opens the door to new opportunities, helping to broaden their horizons in technology.”</p>
<p>Expanding Collaborative Efforts<br>
As high-performance computing continues to evolve, Goodhue says expanding collaborative efforts and fostering interdisciplinary partnerships will be essential for driving innovation and addressing the growing demands of complex computational challenges. “All of our team members from the six institutions have unique knowledge and experience and we leverage those strengths to create solutions that are more impactful and far-reaching than we could achieve individually, enabling us to tackle challenges more effectively and efficiently.”</p>

<p>As AI becomes more integrated into the research and education space, Goodhue says there will be many factors to consider. “From an infrastructure point of view, the programming techniques, power consumption, and other factors are already shaping the near future. Looking at the broader commercial space, the explosion of AI-based applications has been far more rapid than the introduction of new apps during the iPhone era. It’s much easier to instruct AI to perform tasks than it is to program an iPhone with complex code, so AI is making new ideas more accessible and will drive significant change as a result.”</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, he notes that quantum computing is a different challenge. “Quantum has the potential to be transformative for specific, important applications, but it’s not quite there yet. We’re moving out of the research phase and into engineering, but there’s still much work to be done. In the near future, our focus will be on ensuring that the best quantum resources are available to researchers, helping them bridge the gap between potential and practical solutions. We must remember that every overnight success is often the result of decades of hard work.”</p>
<p>To enable seamless access to cutting-edge technologies and foster collaboration, Goodhue says research and education networks (RENs) help break down barriers and create opportunities for researchers and institutions to work together more effectively, regardless of geographic or institutional limitations. “Research and education networks (RENs) like Edge are the bedrock of research collaboration, playing a crucial role in supporting scientific discovery, advancing innovation, and ensuring that researchers can keep pace with rapidly evolving technology. As foundational pillars of collaboration, RENs enable the seamless exchange of ideas, data, and resources across institutions, fostering a global community of scholars and innovators.”</p>
<p>In discussing her experience working with Goodhue, Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Assistant Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, Edge, says, “As the driving force behind the exceptional capabilities available through MGHPCC, John ensures that researchers and institutions across the region can fully leverage its resources to drive innovation and discovery, fostering transformative advancements in research computing. It has been an honor to serve on several regional and national committees alongside a visionary leader like John, whose collaborative approach and generosity in sharing his expertise were instrumental in shaping Edge’s recent NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure Regional Connectivity project.”</p>

		<p>Becoming a Balanced Leader<br>
Drawing on his extensive experience in both industry and academia, Goodhue encourages emerging leaders to explore different ways they can make an impact in high-performance computing and collaborative infrastructure. “My advice is to think carefully about when you are ready to step out of an individual contributor role and into leadership, because once you make that change, it can be difficult to shift back. Also understand that technical leadership is distinct from traditional management, and both are valuable skills. It’s not necessary to be a manager to lead—leadership comes in many forms, and embracing your technical expertise can be just as impactful as overseeing a team.”</p>
<p>For those on a career track that includes leadership opportunities, Goodhue emphasizes the importance of preparation and self-awareness. “As you take on leadership roles throughout your career, especially coming from a technical or specialized background, take the time to learn about people management and the broader organizational dynamics. Leadership isn’t just about overseeing tasks; it’s about understanding the human side of organizations, which can often be challenging. You must familiarize yourself with the broader aspects of organizational operations, such as profit and loss statements, project budgets, and other financial aspects that will influence your decisions and responsibilities. Successful leadership is not only about technical expertise, but about growing as a well-rounded individual who can inspire others, promote constructive conversations, and guide their organization to thrive in a complex, ever-changing world.”</p>

		<p>When Inder Monga joined the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) in 2009, the modest 40-person organization was managing its fourth iteration of the Department of Energy’s national network for scientific research and working on its fifth, ESnet5, which would attempt speeds of 100 gigabits per second (Gbps). Fast forward 15 years, and Monga has been Executive Director of ESnet and head of the Scientific Networking Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) for almost a decade, steering the organization through an era of unprecedented growth and innovation. Under his visionary leadership, ESnet has expanded to nearly 150 staff and contractors, established a sprawling network across the United States with connections to Europe, and achieved a staggering capacity of 1.5 terabits per second (Tbps).</p>
<p>Monga’s tenure as director has been marked by remarkable milestones, including the design, development, and launch of ESnet6 in 2022—an ambitious project that was completed ahead of schedule and under budget. This state-of-the-art network facilitated the transit of 1.7 exabytes of traffic in 2023. As Monga continues to lead ESnet into the future, he and his talented team are already laying the groundwork for ESnet7. This next-generation network promises to incorporate even more agile, intelligent functions and data-centric services, leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps).</p>
<p>Beyond his operational role at ESnet, Monga is the lead Principal Investigator for the Quantum Application Network Testbed for Novel Entanglement Technology (QUANT-NET) research project, funded in 2021, and serves as Co-Principal Investigator for the National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded FABRIC testbed project, a groundbreaking national research infrastructure launched in 2023.</p>
<p>“I have watched ESnet evolve over many years and under more than one leader. Inder Monga stands out, not only for his impressive technical engineering talents, as evidenced by his 25 patents and multiple high-profile projects, but also for his rare ability to assemble, inspire, and lead cross-functional teams with skills far beyond his own expertise,” says Vint Cerf, known as one of the “Fathers of the Internet” and currently Vice President and Chief Internet Evangelist for Google. “Under Inder’s prescient leadership, ESnet has been persistently innovative, its impact reaching far beyond the federal government.”</p>

		<p>The Early Years: Role Models and Modems<br>
Monga’s journey to leading one of America’s most important research networks began in Ranchi, a small town in India. His family lived in a colony for civil servants established by the government post-independence, where he was surrounded by children of engineers and innovators. This environment fostered a cosmopolitan viewpoint from a young age and helped fuel his academic ambitions, leading him to earn a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology at Kanpur and to leave India to pursue a master’s in computer engineering at Boston University (BU).</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, as the Internet and network connectivity were rapidly evolving, Monga found himself at the forefront of technological advancements that would help shape his career. “At the time, we had modems we used to dial in from home to complete our work,” recalls Monga. “Soon Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) was introduced, offering a faster way for telephone providers to deliver data access at home. This higher-quality technology sparked my interest and became the focus of my master’s thesis project at BU.”</p>
<p>Monga had begun a Ph.D. at BU focused on ISDN when Wellfleet Communications, a well-known, fast-growing networking startup in the Boston area, hired him directly from campus to integrate this technology into their product. During this exciting growth period in networking, he was involved in several cutting-edge projects and quickly grew into a technical leadership role. Here he gained valuable experience in integrating different remote access technologies and exploring multicast and IP security.</p>
<p>In 1999, he moved to a management role, leading the IP Security team within the routing and switching business unit at Nortel. The following year, he became the director of software for an internal startup at Nortel, where he led the innovation and software development for the Optical Service Agent, which evolved into the DRAC product.</p>
<p>“We had a great idea for an internal startup that would merge optical capabilities and routers together into one platform,” explains Monga. However, the 2001 telecom crash sidelined the project, and he transitioned into the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO). In this role, he deepened his understanding of research writing and the frustrations of promoting new ideas, securing 25 patents and leading a research group focused on high-performance networking.</p>
<p>“After a decade at Nortel, I had reached a stage where I had built a lot of products and explored new ideas that were focused on the customers’ needs,” Monga says. “I wanted to see network design and development from the customer’s perspective and understand how service providers like Verizon, AT&amp;T, etc made buying decisions. This desire led me to ESnet to explore bridging the gap between application needs and network capabilities.”</p>
<p>ESnet’s stated mission is “to enable and accelerate scientific discovery by delivering unparalleled network infrastructure, capabilities, and tools.” It seeks to free scientific progress from the physical location of instruments, people, computational resources, or data. “We want to help scientists move from data to insight as quickly and seamlessly as possible,” says Monga. “With ESnet6, we aimed to provide the infrastructure that supports groundbreaking research and enables the next generation of scientific breakthroughs, empowering researchers to collaborate more effectively across disciplines and geographies.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“ESnet is a critical pillar in connecting the Edge research community to the DOE’s national labs and enabling groundbreaking scientific discoveries. We have been fortunate to leverage the expertise of ESnet’s Science Engagement team in designing National Science Foundation Campus Cyberinfrastructure proposals and offering workshops and tutorials to our community. Their guidance has been instrumental in helping organizations enhance network performance.

		<p>ESnet6 provides an expanded, dedicated fiber-optic backbone, with new network automation capabilities, improved cybersecurity features, and real-time telemetry. “This network was built from scratch on fiber, all the way from the optical layer to the networking layer,” Monga explains. “The core design was focused on building strong partnerships with our users and understanding their workflows to help them use network features more efficiently and be successful.”</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of software in modern networking, Monga also prioritized building a robust software engineering team at ESnet. “Today, our software engineering team is equal in strength to our network engineering team,” he says proudly. “We have accomplished a great deal in orchestration and automation while also learning about institutionalizing advanced research and development.” Leveraging his innovation experience at Nortel, Monga is successfully capitalizing on the operational and deployment expertise within the ESnet organization to build an effective pipeline where staff can develop new ideas and move them through to production.</p>
<p>Accelerating Science Workflows<br>
A recent example of such an idea, now in an advanced prototype phase, is an ESnet collaboration with Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). The ESnet-JLab FPGA Accelerated Transport (EJ-FAT) device is a real-time load balancer that uses Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology to enable real-time data streaming from various scientific instruments, such as particle accelerators, X-ray light sources, and electron microscopes, across the country via ESnet6 to multiple high-performance computing facilities, where it is processed and returned in time to allow useful adjustments to experiments.</p>
<p>These facilities’ time-sensitive workflows are driven by high-speed A/D data acquisition systems (DAQs) that can produce multiple 100- to 400-Gbps data streams—a firehose of raw data. “ESnet is interested in accelerating the transport of data,” explains Monga. “For the past two decades, the networking community has primarily focused on moving scientific data in the form of files. This approach, which is seen in initiatives like Globus and Grid-FTP, works by collecting data from instruments, saving it as files, and then transferring it to computing resources for analysis. However, with the high rates at which massive volumes of data are generated by modern instruments and sensors, the process of storing massive datasets in files and moving them often involves multiple steps, making it time-consuming and inefficient—especially when researchers are trying to gain immediate insights.”</p>
<p>EJ-FAT has successfully streamed data from Jefferson Lab in Virginia to the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) in Berkeley, California, and the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility in Tennessee at 100 Gbps, allowing these challenges to be sidestepped. The prototype is designed to run on a large number of comparable instruments within the DOE complex, and the ESnet-Jefferson Lab project team is working with researchers at the Advanced Light Source at Berkeley Lab, the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, and the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University. The goal is to refine it further with support from both the scientific and computing communities to eventually turn it into a full production system.</p>
<p> This could be transformative. For example, a graduate student at a research facility may spend months preparing for a beamline experiment, collecting data, and then finding that the sample was not positioned correctly, requiring a redo of the entire experiment. With real-time streaming, data can be analyzed as it’s collected, offering immediate feedback and minimizing the risk of errors. Additionally, the data can be processed at high-performance computing centers, even when the raw data is too large to store locally on hard drives or too fast for a laptop to handle.</p>
<p>“ESnet cannot innovate in a vacuum—we must understand what problems our customers are facing. Instead of developing a product that we push on them, we try to engage scientists in a way that we can develop a solution to a problem together from both a networking and a science workflow perspective,” explains Monga. “This collaborative, co-design approach ensures that the technologies we create are not only groundbreaking but also directly aligned with the needs of the scientific community.”</p>
<p>In addition to ESnet’s active collaborations between its network and software engineers and science users, the organization plays a mostly invisible but nonetheless key supporting role in enabling the collaborations of tens of thousands of DOE-funded scientific researchers in the United States and Europe through its high-performance network itself. ESnet6 links together the DOE’s 17 national laboratories, 28 user facilities, and additional scientific instruments such as the NSF–DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile and the CERN particle physics laboratory in Geneva at blazing fast speeds. It’s thus become a critical ingredient to the success of the Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI) framework created by the DOE Office of Science’s Advanced Scientific Computational Research (ASCR) program. The goal of IRI (www.iri.science) is to seamlessly link DOE’s experimental and observational scientific user facilities, data assets, and advanced computing resources so that researchers can combine these tools in novel ways that radically accelerate discovery.</p>
<p>In 2023, ESnet hosted its second annual gathering for its science users, called Confab. Confab23 brought together more than 160 DOE–funded domain scientists, computer scientists, network engineers, DOE program managers, and user facility staff interested in finding new ways to collaborate. Its theme was “Co-Designing the Future of National-Scale Integrated Science and Networking,” inspired by the DOE’s vision for IRI.</p>
<p>“ESnet’s Confab23 user meeting provided a great opportunity to hear from the research community, learn about the Department of Energy’s world-class research tools, infrastructure, and user facilities accelerating discovery and innovation, and network with distinguished colleagues from across the nation,” said Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Edge’s Assistant Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, who attended the gathering.<br>
In the months since Confab23, ESnet staff have continued to help develop IRI, serving in important leadership roles and on the three technical subcommittees. From April 7-9, 2025, ESnet will convene Confab25 (confab25.es.net), its third science-user gathering, which will be partly devoted to progress updates and success stories from IRI.</p>
<p>ESnet’s importance to ASCR’s strategic future has been acknowledged publicly. “Without ESnet, the entire vision collapses; none of the facilities, nor the integrated ecosystem, nor IRI could function,” stated the Advanced Scientific Computing Advisory Committee (ASCAC) in a presentation summarizing plans for the ASCR facilities’ next 10 years.</p>
	 
 



       
	 
		 
		 
			 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
		  
	 
	  
         
	 
		 
		 
			
 
	 
		<p>Strengthening the Research &amp; Education Community<br>
As important as ESnet is to the DOE ecosystem, the organization also looks outside the government for inspiration, knowledge sharing, and partnership. ESnet6 connects to more than 270 research, education, and commercial networks in five countries through peering agreements.</p>
<p>“We need to create opportunities and pathways for collaboration within the research and education ecosystem and share our capabilities more effectively,” says Monga. ESnet is part of the global R&amp;E community—Monga and numerous ESnet staff members are frequent speakers at conferences and meetings around the world—and several years ago it partnered with SURF, which created and maintains SURFnet, the national research and education network of the Netherlands, on an open-source Workflow Orchestrator software that automates the provisioning of networks. “Partnerships are extremely important for ESnet, especially in the research and education space,” he explains. “Just as we partner with our scientific users to identify where they’re getting stuck, we collaborate with our R&amp;E colleagues to solve problems, share knowledge and resources.”</p>
<p>In January 2024, ESnet teamed up with GÉANT, GlobalNOC at Indiana University, Internet2, and Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) to form the consortium MetrANOVA, for Advancing Network Observation, Visualization, and Analysis. Led by ESnet, MetrANOVA is working to develop and disseminate common network measurement and analysis tools, tactics, and techniques.</p>
<p>ESnet has long partnered with Internet2, GÉANT, CANARIE, and others in the Advanced North Atlantic (ANA) collaboration (www.anaeng.global), and in March 2024 those four organizations announced a major expansion of 400 Gbps transoceanic circuit capacity dedicated to transferring R&amp;E data, a significant achievement in high-speed connectivity between North America and Europe.</p>

		<p>“Forward-looking vision and a deep commitment to collaboration drive progress in the research and education community. Under Inder Monga’s leadership, ESnet exemplifies this ethos—working alongside global R&amp;E partners to advance the perfSONAR project, establish the MetrANOVA consortium, and reach new milestones in expanding trans-Atlantic connectivity,” says Howard Pfeffer, President and CEO at Internet2. “Together, these collective efforts strengthen the global R&amp;E network fabric, ensuring scientists and scholars have the robust infrastructure, capabilities, and support needed to accelerate discovery and innovation.”</p>
<p>And of course, ESnet collaborates with Edge. “To advance the broader mission of research and education within the U.S., we need organizations like Edge to help strengthen the ecosystem, ensuring that critical resources and knowledge are shared across institutions,” says Monga.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Ghahramani, “ESnet is a critical pillar in connecting the Edge research community to the DOE’s national labs and enabling groundbreaking scientific discoveries. We have been fortunate to leverage the expertise of ESnet’s Science Engagement team in designing National Science Foundation Campus Cyberinfrastructure proposals and offering workshops and tutorials to our community. Their guidance has been instrumental in helping organizations enhance network performance. These efforts have enabled secure, high-speed data transfers at institutions, significantly strengthening the region’s cyberinfrastructure and advancing its research capabilities.”</p>

		<p>Designing the Network of the Future<br>
Looking forward, the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing technologies is taking ESnet in new directions.</p>
<p>“AI can be enormously useful for analyzing, modeling, and predicting network traffic, but we must first determine how to use these tools to handle tickets, help restore outages, or simplify the design of protocols safely and reliably,” says Monga. “Perhaps AI can be used to automate parts of the network and provide insights into capacity planning. We will also need to increase our networking capacity as more scientists use AI techniques and workflows and data needs change. AI will likely change how we think about network design and provide services.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the quantum computing ecosystem scales up, quantum networking must keep pace—which is what Monga and the Quantum Application Network Testbed for Novel Entanglement Technology (QUANT-NET) team are working on. QUANT-NET is a five-year, multi-institutional project (currently in its fourth year). Its world-leading experts, based at Berkeley Lab, University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), the California Institute of Technology, and the University of Innsbruck, have constructed a testbed for quantum networking technologies. Their goal is to establish a three-node distributed quantum computing network between Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley, connected with an entanglement swapping substrate over optical fiber and managed by a quantum network protocol stack.</p>
<p>Led by Monga, the project was designed with an application-driven approach, prioritizing real-world use cases over merely demonstrating networking technology. “The goal was to create a testbed that allows different teams to contribute their innovations to the field without the high cost of developing their own quantum infrastructure,” explains Monga. Given the complexity and expense of quantum system development, including challenges like supply chain delays for critical components, the testbed plans to provide a platform for experimentation.</p>
<p>To date, much of the focus on quantum technologies has been on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for security. QUANT-NET’s focus is on enabling communication between multiple quantum computers. “Although this capability is still five to seven years away, early research is laying the groundwork by exploring how classical, physical, and optical networks can support the future of quantum computing,” Monga says.</p>

		<p>Advancing Forward with Curiosity<br>
As an organization, Monga says ESnet approaches networking from two perspectives. “First, we focus on building networks that accelerate any kind of scientific research. Second, we are dedicated to advancing the science of networking itself through applied research and development. In other words, our work is not just about applying new technologies like AI or quantum computing, but also about improving how we build and operate networks more efficiently, using tools such as the Workflow Orchestrator and partnerships that will expand our trans-Atlantic spectrum and bandwidth. This dual focus drives our agenda for innovation, as we seek to both support scientific progress and enhance the capabilities of the networks that make that progress possible.”</p>
<p>Monga’s decades of experience in commercial and government-funded technology organizations have taught him that balancing operational goals with innovation is essential, ensuring that enthusiasm for new technologies doesn’t cloud practical decision-making. “Emerging technologies like AI and data are the focus of today, but just as we’ve integrated technologies like the internal combustion engine in the past, we must continue to embrace and integrate new technologies with a thoughtful, balanced approach,” he warns.</p>

		<p>For emerging leaders and researchers who want to contribute to large-scale scientific networks and infrastructure, Monga urges them to be curious and focus on understanding the ins and outs of a problem. “I see many people spend all their time pushing a solution. I think it’s more important to spend time asking questions and diving into the problem you’re trying to solve. Because if you’re working on the right problem, even if the solution is not 100%, it will have a much larger impact than if you build an elegant solution for a problem that is not relevant. It’s important to ask, ‘Is this the problem worth solving?’ and ‘Will it truly make a difference?’”</p>

It’s a fine line, but the ability to perceive the complexity without taking on all the work is essential for both personal and collective success. I am incredibly proud to have assembled the ESnet team, comprising leading experts in our field who are full of passion, imagination, and creativity.”</p>
<p>It’s a philosophy that has served Monga well in his career, and one that should ensure the continued growth and innovation of ESnet as well as his ambitious research projects.</p>

		<p>In April 2023, Michael J. Avaltroni’s journey came full circle when he became Fairleigh Dickinson University’s (FDU) president after graduating from the university’s Florham Campus over twenty years ago. Following his B.S. in chemistry from FDU, Avaltroni went on to earn an M.A. in chemistry and a Ph.D. in chemistry in 2003, both from Princeton University. He returned to his alma mater and now has become the first FDU undergraduate to serve as the institution’s president. “As a student, I was involved in undergraduate research and worked closely with many faculty members,” shares Avaltroni. “I stayed in touch with my faculty mentors and when I was finishing my graduate work in 2003, one of my undergraduate research advisors at FDU reached out and said he would be retiring and encouraged me to interview for his position. I got the job and was excited to join FDU as a faculty member where I had been a student a few years prior. This was the beginning of an interesting perspective of seeing education from the other side and gaining first-hand insight into the challenges and rewards of teaching and mentorship.”</p>
<p>Dr. Avaltroni quickly transitioned from that role into department chair of the chemistry department, acting as a liaison between the administration and the faculty. “In 2008, I was approached by our university president about creating a School of Pharmacy and Health Sciences,” says Avaltroni. “After a four-year journey of learning and exploring, I helped develop a new pharmacy program at the university, became dean, and pivoted into the health sciences.” In this role, Avaltroni grew a team of esteemed faculty and staff, created partnerships with the region’s health care and pharmacy community, and helped the program gain full accreditation status. “While I unexpectedly ended up in a full-time administrative position, I found that health science education and building new programs to be a real passion and a rewarding challenge.”</p>
<p>While completing her postdoctoral degree and taking on the role of assistant professor at Penn State York, Muscanell conducted research and helped build their new psychology undergraduate program. After five years, she returned to her hometown of Orlando, Florida and began working as a Research Analyst at JHT Incorporated. While working for JHT, she was contracted to work for the Department of Defense to help evaluate their educational training programs at the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI). “DEOMI is in charge of training all active-duty members across the military branches in topics such as human relations and equal opportunity,” explains Muscanell. “I helped assess the effectiveness of their training programs, and it was an experience I truly enjoyed. Later in 2022, I wanted to return to my roots in higher education and joined EDUCAUSE as a researcher, heading up all aspects of research projects from design and data collection to analysis and publication.”</p>
<p>Exploring Emerging Trends<br>
In using the pharmacy program as a blueprint, Avaltroni has been instrumental in helping build other new programs, including physician assistant studies, occupational therapy, social work, and public health. In January 2022, Avaltroni was appointed University Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs, before taking on his new role last year as University President. “During my time as a dean in our pharmacy school, I saw the value of interprofessional education, which is a huge hallmark of health science education and effective health care practice,” shares Avaltroni. “You learn how to collaborate with other professionals and follow a patient-centered model in the case of health care. When we think about the scope of university study, collaboration, and innovation, we must determine how to leverage our partnerships to embrace new opportunities, get past our limitations, and develop innovative models, approaches, research, and platforms that advance education.”</p>

		<p>“By collaborating across sectors, we can pool resources, expertise, and opportunities to create more innovative, efficient, and accessible educational experiences for students,” continues Avaltroni. “This approach not only strengthens our community but also helps us stay agile in an ever-evolving landscape, ensuring that we continue to meet the needs of students while preparing them for the future workforce. Institutions have the ongoing challenge of keeping pace with emerging technologies, like artificial intelligence (AI), and we must determine how to adjust our curriculum and programs to stay relevant and effective. In an industry that has often been slow to change, higher education is being faced with a required mindset shift. We need to be thinking about building programs not for today, but for 2030 and beyond.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Expanding External Partnerships&nbsp;<br>
Since the pandemic, many institutions of higher education have had to reevaluate their business models and determine new ways to provide students with high-quality services and support. “Several colleges and universities are having to rethink the mission of their institution and recognize they can’t be everything to everyone because resources are limited,” says Avaltroni. “FDU is rethinking our business model while embracing what we are good at and finding alignment with where we think higher education is headed. I also see a great opportunity to expand our partnerships with other institutions, as well as nonprofits, businesses, and government entities. We want to make the sum greater than the parts and help all of us to work smarter, not harder when trying to accomplish our goals.” Continues Avaltroni, “Partnerships such as Edge are an example of what I see as the path forward for higher education— an opportunity for universities and stakeholders to come together to share ideas, resources and gain economies of scale at a point in time where scale and scope are becoming paramount to delivering on our educational mission. My hope is that organizations like Edge can be a leader in showing that the sum of a group’s contributions, ideas, knowledge, and resources can truly be greater than its parts.”</p>
<p>In his new role, Avaltroni continues to build a college ecosystem that leans more heavily on community colleges and high schools and showcases their importance in the educational journey. “If we can provide students with early-stage opportunities to explore college and see two-year institutions as a positive introduction into higher education, we will likely attract more students, help them hone their knowledge and skills, and see them through to graduation. Part of FDU’s strategy is also focusing on community-based education for learners who seek online programs and prefer a flexible hybrid-learning model. We’ve anchored ourselves at community sites off campus to allow students to come together once a week onsite to engage in meaningful interactions and faculty-curated conversations. Within our first year of launching this cohort approach, we’ve seen an increase of over a hundred students in many of these programs.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“By incorporating empathy and human-centered approaches into our curriculum, we are preparing students not only to navigate technological advancements, but to thrive in environments where emotional intelligence, collaboration, and ethical decision-making are critical. We must find the coalescence between man and machine and equip students with the ability to leverage AI and other emerging technologies in ways that complement, rather than replace, the human connection and creativity that are essential in any field.”</p>

		<p>FDU is also partnering with community colleges to help more students pursue higher education and gain valuable hands-on training that is more in line with their needs and budget. “We’re joining forces with businesses and organizations that are building learn-while-you-earn pathways that create entry points into an industry or help someone expand their skill set,” explains Avaltroni. “In looking at the health care industry that is experiencing a talent shortage crisis, for example, we have community colleges that offer a two-year registered nurse (RN) program where students are paired with health care industry partners. The employer reimburses the student for the cost of upskilling to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) or Master of Science (MS) in Nursing, and the employer will gain a highly-trained, loyal, and well-rounded employee. This provides a win-win situation for everyone. We’re able to leverage these opportunities, upscale in volume, and help more students pursue an education and rewarding career.”</p>
<p>To learn more about this fast-track concept, Avaltroni visited the University of Central Florida (UCF), which has built a strong system that supports a clean transition between two-year and four-year institutions. “UCF has partnered with a low-tech high school that has an allied health focus,” explains Avaltroni. “It partners with students during their high school career and helps them earn credentials based on their interests, like a nursing assistant, EMT, or pharmacy technician. They are then embedded into the workforce while going to a two-year school to earn their first-level degree and then onward to UCF to finish their education. This model provides an opportunity for students, including those from first-generation and underrepresented groups, to earn an income while pursuing a degree and make a career out of their four-year journey.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“We’re very proud to be a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) and the majority of our students are from underrepresented minority groups and are first-generation college students. The population of students has changed over time, but we continue to serve students who are seeking us for access and opportunity—this is our founding legacy. In 2022, we were selected as one of the models of excellence in education for our two-year programs created through our FDU Hispanic Center. These programs are for students who are looking for opportunities to complete their studies alongside learning English as a Second Language (ESL) as part of their degree.”</p>

		<p>Eliminating Learning Barriers&nbsp;<br>
To support FDU’s efforts to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive campus, the University has a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Advisory Council, which focuses on building a campus community that values diversity, promotes accessibility, and upholds a culture of mutual respect and understanding among students, faculty, staff, administration, and alumni. “We’re very proud to be a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) and the majority of our students are from underrepresented minority groups and are first-generation college students,” says Avaltroni. “The population of students has changed over time, but we continue to serve students who are seeking us for access and opportunity—this is our founding legacy. In 2022, we were selected as one of the models of excellence in education for our two-year programs created through our FDU Hispanic Center. These programs are for students who are looking for opportunities to complete their studies alongside learning English as a Second Language (ESL) as part of their degree.”</p>
<p>The FDU Hispanic Center recently celebrated its 20th anniversary and features several programs that allow students to learn and refine their English while earning credits toward their academic credentials. “We have programs that create bi-lingual programming pipelines where the first year is all Spanish speaking, followed by a gradual transition to English. Bi-lingual proficiency is a positive career advantage and helps students become more competitive in the global job market. These programs not only support language development, but also foster cultural awareness, preparing students to thrive in diverse environments both professionally and personally.”</p>
<p>To further demonstrate this commitment, FDU joined the Education Advisory Board (EAB)’s Moon Shot for Equity. “This national initiative is committed to eliminating gaps in college completion and retention for underrepresented minority groups by 2030,” says Avaltroni. “Student journeys are generally the same, but oftentimes, the barriers are a tripping point for one and a catastrophic fall for another. We need to identify actions that can strategically close these barriers, and Moon Shot has committed us to building a robust transfer portal from the community college. We are exploring how to eliminate some of the easier obstructions to continuation and persistence, like debt hold reform.”</p>
<p>“Shifting our mindset has helped us rethink many of our processes across the University and look through a lens of inclusion,” continues Avaltroni. “We recognize that the processes that help our most vulnerable students will also benefit those students who are navigating the college experience with less challenges. Our Regional Center for Learning Disabilities also provides students with the resources they need to succeed on their academic journeys. Our COMPASS social support program is for students with autism spectrum disorder and provides guidance on individualized education plans, how to get additional help, and where to go for resources and support. Oftentimes their challenges are not in the learning environment, but navigating college life in dorms, the dining hall, and social situations. We want to help them succeed and develop their academic and social strengths.”</p>

		<p>Preserving the Human Connection<br>
To help prepare students with the skills and knowledge they need for the future workforce, Avaltroni says FDU is leaning heavily on integrating future-proof training that combines both technical and interpersonal skills into students’ toolkits. “A few years ago, we created a Center for Empathy Research and Training that teaches the skills necessary to interact from the perspective of empathy—which has been exceptionally important in our health care programs. We have also rolled out campus-wide empathy training that builds skills and creates an overall supportive environment. In looking at rapidly-evolving technology like AI, FDU is exploring how to preserve the human connection and help students work with these tools, instead of being fearful that an increasingly technological landscape will make them obsolete.”</p>
	 
 



       
	 
		 
		 
			 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
		  
	 
	  
  
 
	 
		<p>“By incorporating empathy and human-centered approaches into our curriculum, we are preparing students not only to navigate technological advancements, but to thrive in environments where emotional intelligence, collaboration, and ethical decision-making are critical,” continues Avaltroni “We must find the coalescence between man and machine and equip students with the ability to leverage AI and other emerging technologies in ways that complement, rather than replace, the human connection and creativity that are essential in any field. For example, instead of looking at AI replacing our need for radiologists, how can we equip these professionals to use these tools to be better clinical decision-makers and have more quality time to spend with patients? If you have AI dictation in the exam room, instead of being focused on taking notes and staring at a computer screen, doctors and nurses can talk to patients eye to eye and pick up on cues that improve their clinical judgment.”</p>
	 
 




 
	 
		<p>Celebrating the Commitment to Student Success<br>
Starting back when Avaltroni was a dean at FDU’s School of Pharmacy, he wanted to promote a culture that invests in their employees, offers training and engagement opportunities, and celebrates employee accomplishments. While in his role as University Provost in 2022, he created the Transformational Excellence Awards that recognize exceptional faculty and staff contributions and their commitment to enhancing the student experience and improving campus life and community wellness. “I am proud to be part of a community of individuals who go above and beyond for our students and for each other,” says Avaltroni. “We celebrate people who exemplify excellence in student retention, student success, or student belonging.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“If we can provide students with early-stage opportunities to explore college and see two-year institutions as a positive introduction into higher education, we will likely attract more students, help them hone their knowledge and skills, and see them through to graduation. Part of FDU’s strategy is also focusing on community-based education for learners who seek online programs and prefer a flexible hybrid-learning model. We’ve anchored ourselves at community sites off campus to allow students to come together once a week onsite to engage in meaningful interactions and faculty-curated conversations. Within our first year of launching this cohort approach, we’ve seen an increase of over a hundred students in many of these programs.”</p>

President, Fairleigh Dickinson University</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				       
	 
		 
		 
			   
 
	 
		<p>“FDU faculty or staff members are nominated for creating a transformational experience for our students and our University. We hear many inspirational stories from students that a certain teacher is the reason they walked the stage at graduation, why they re-enrolled, or how they received a scholarship that helped them achieve their dreams. These awards are just one way to demonstrate the value of what our faculty and staff are doing and the impact they’re having on the lives of the students around them.”</p>
<p>In looking toward the future, Avaltroni is excited for the road ahead and the strategic plan he has launched to continue advancing FDU’s academic mission and fostering innovation and inclusion in teaching and learning. “Our strategic action plan, FDU Will Soar, outlines initiatives aimed at boosting enrollment, retention, and fundraising, reducing inefficiencies, and differentiating our academic programs. We want to continue to meet our students’ needs and expectations, build external partnerships, and tell our story as a valuable partner and resources in the higher education community. I wish to further expand this network and partner with independent colleges, two-year institutions, corporate partners, health care organizations, and nonprofits. We want the value of a higher education degree from FDU to link to a future of upward mobility and open doorways to intergenerational transformation. We aim to empower our students and see their degree as more than a piece of paper to hang on the wall, but a ticket to a future and a successful career that allows them to contribute to the betterment of their families and their communities.”</p>

<p></p>      First Web3 Global Battery Passport Implementation for Current and Future Regulatory Compliance           <p>Phase I of the Global Battery Passport System Demonstrated Product Traceability with Privacy-Preserving Capabilities and Selective Data Disclosure</p>
          <p>Los Angeles—31 March 2025: MOBI, a nonprofit Web3 consortium of global industry leaders, announces the successful completion of the first year in its three-year initiative to build the Global Battery Passport System (GBPS). This milestone marks a significant step in creating a secure, Self-Sovereign Identity and Data framework for seamless data spaces interoperability and digital product passports. MOBI is actively <a href="https://dlt.mobi/interoperability-pilot/">demonstrating data spaces interoperability</a> with other global consortia such as Gaia-X. While the GBPS initiative focuses on battery data exchange as its use case, the underlying technology is agnostic and can be leveraged to enhance trust, compliance, and operational efficiency for all digital transactions and traceability.</p>
<p>MOBI GBPS initiative is being spearheaded by members of the Circular Economy and the Global Battery Passport (CE-GBP) Working Group, including Anritsu, DENSO, HIOKI, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Orico, Suzuki, and TradeLog.</p>
<p>During Phase I, which took place from January to December 2024, working group members concentrated on evaluating global battery regulatory requirements and developing use cases aligned with Web3 technology for secure data exchange and management. Critically, implementers successfully launched and ran nodes on the federated<a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/"> Integrated Trust Network </a>(ITN), a member-built and operated registry for World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). The ITN provides the core trust services of governance, authority, identity, and assurance to enable verifiable transactions between <a href="https://dlt.mobi/ssdi/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twins</a> (user agents) whose DIDs are anchored in the ITN.</p>
<p>Building on the success of Phase I, MOBI and its partners are now advancing to Phase II. In Phase II, implementers will leverage ITN core services to test transactions within the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/citopia/">Citopia Decentralized Marketplace</a> (DM). Anticipated technical achievements in Phase II include Web3 ecosystem onboarding, asset ownership traceability, secure data exchange, and Apps building with Citopia DM.</p>
<p>The GBPS shall operate as a specialized user-controlled application within Citopia DM, which supports secure communication, transactions, and data sharing across industries with zero-knowledge proofs. Citopia DM provides the interoperability and data sovereignty that Web3 ecosystems and value chains require. Through this setup, the GBPS shall offer a privacy-focused solution that protects proprietary information and promotes circularity in line with current and future regulations, while serving as a robust foundation for use-case-specific applications rooted in trusted and verifiable battery data, such as:</p>
 
 management of battery passports, 
 used electric vehicle (EV) pricing, 
 green financing and carbon credits, 
 charging management, and more. 
 
<p>While most battery passport solutions focus on public data disclosure, Citopia GBPS emphasizes secure sharing of proprietary data. The GBPS leverages zero trust architecture and selective data disclosure, where only relevant information is shared with intended recipients. This privacy-centric design facilitates regulatory compliance while safeguarding sensitive data, reducing the need for intermediaries and enhancing trust across value chains, creating a Web3 system for data spaces interoperability across borders and stakeholders.</p>
<p>“As current and future regulations develop, solutions like the ITN and Citopia DM are essential for addressing industry and regulatory needs. MOBI is proud to work with our members in developing a solution that is agnostic to existing data spaces along with Web2&lt;&gt;Web3 interoperability to support business objectives in creating a more secure digital future and meeting circular economy goals,” said Tram Vo, CEO and Co-founder of MOBI.</p>
<p>“A global battery passport system has the potential to unlock new levels of traceability, transparency and security in battery-related applications, supporting our efforts to contribute to greener and safer mobility,” said Roger Berg, vice president of North America Research and Development at DENSO. “While that’s an important goal for our team, this solution also represents more than that. It’s a great example of how MOBI and our fellow members are working together to support a more circular economy and sustainable world.”</p>
<p>“The second stage of Phase I has provided further valuable insights to CE-GBP WG partners. In Stage 1, the basic data sharing environment was established. In Stage 2, the first business-related technical capabilities were explored, such as the ownership management of a DID-based asset and the selective disclosure of data between two organizations,” said Christian Köbel of Honda. “These successful learnings have encouraged us to further explore the potential of a self-sovereign data ecosystem to address future challenges of the circular economy.”</p>
<p>“The functionality of DIDs and Verifiable Credentials for reliable data federation among implementing companies has been successfully verified, utilizing the Integrated Trust Network. This endeavor not only demonstrates the potential of these technologies to enhance data federation but also emphasizes the constructive and agile collaboration achieved among implementers within the cooperative framework.” said Yusuke Zushi, Senior Manager at Nissan.</p>
<p>“In Phase 1 of the Global Battery Passport (GBP) system demonstration, we learned that the MOBI GBP can be used to exchange highly confidential information. We want to thank everyone involved in Phase 1,” said implementers at Mazda Motor Corporation.</p>
<p>Said Hisashi Matsumoto of Anritsu, “MOBI’s activities have led to the successful completion of Phase I, moving towards building an ecosystem that enables reliable and secure information exchange. We are grateful to have participated in the verification of use cases with practical operations. We hope that MOBI’s efforts will continue to contribute to a more sustainable circular economy.”</p>
<p>“We are very proud of the great results of Phase I which we have achieved based on our strong relationships with major OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, and more. It has been an exciting and interesting experience to work with such talented people. We will continue to take on challenges in Phase II in the name of collaboration,” said Alvin Ishiguro, Project Coordination at TradeLog, Inc.</p>
<p>MOBI and its members are committed to driving a future where collaborative, decentralized technologies foster innovation and transparency across industries.</p>

This post examines key trends shaping their future and explores how these developments are driving change across sectors. Our guiding concept in this is <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Open Recognition</a> which encourages organisations to think more holistically about the knowledge, skills, and behaviours they seek to&nbsp;promote.</p> Skills-Based Hiring <p>One of the most influential trends is the growing emphasis on hiring based on specific skills rather than traditional qualifications. Employers are increasingly seeking candidates with demonstrable competencies that align with their organisational needs. Microcredentials provide a structured way to validate these skills in a way that is transparent and verifiable.</p><p>For organisations, skills-based hiring supported by microcredentials allows for more inclusive recruitment practices, reducing reliance on traditional proxies like degrees. However, to succeed, microcredentials must be recognised as credible and portable, ensuring they meet the expectations of both employers and job seekers. This means they should be built on open standards such as <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/What_Are_Open_Badges%3F">Open&nbsp;Badges</a>.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO Stackable Learning&nbsp;Pathways <p>The modular nature of microcredentials enables learners to build their qualifications incrementally, creating personalised pathways. This approach is particularly valuable for individuals balancing education with work or other commitments. Stackable credentials also align with the concept of lifelong learning, allowing learners to upskill or reskill as needed throughout their&nbsp;careers.</p><p>Aligning microcredentials with national or international qualification frameworks can enhance their value and portability, ensuring that learners can seamlessly combine credentials from different institutions or sectors. This alignment also supports employers and other organisations in recognising and valuing these credentials across diverse contexts. By working in collaboration, stakeholders can create systems that not only validate individual achievements but also enable progression and opportunity, therefore creating a connected and inclusive learning ecosystem.</p> The Role of Open Standards <p>The adoption of open standards, such as Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials, is critical to the future of microcredentials. These standards ensure that credentials are portable, secure, and interoperable across systems. By making use of metadata, they provide detailed information such as the knowledge, skills, and/or behaviours validated, the criteria met, and the issuing organisation. It may also include any endorsements made by individuals and organistions, further enhancing the value of the microcredential.</p><p>Open standards also facilitate the integration of microcredentials into digital wallets, meaning individuals can store and share their achievements easily. This approach empowers learners to take ownership of their credentials while ensuring transparency and&nbsp;trust.</p> Technology and Innovation <p>Emerging technologies are transforming how microcredentials are issued, managed, and verified. For example, Artificial intelligence (AI) is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmLP5c8jng">being used to map skills</a> and recommend personalised learning pathways.</p><p>However, these technologies must be implemented responsibly. Issues such as data privacy, ethical AI use, and accessibility must be addressed to ensure that technological advancements benefit all learners and do not exacerbate existing inequalities.</p> Collaboration Across&nbsp;Sectors <p>The success of microcredentials depends on collaboration between education providers, employers, policymakers, and technology developers. These partnerships can ensure that microcredentials remain relevant and aligned with industry needs while encouraging innovation in how learning is recognised.</p><p>For example, microcredentials can be used&nbsp;to::</p>  Charities — Recognise skills gained through volunteer work, fundraising activities, and advocacy campaigns, enabling participants to showcase their contributions effectively.  NGOs — Validate the skills of community workers and volunteers, making their contributions visible and&nbsp;valued.  Co-ops — Highlight informal learning and collaboration, supporting shared growth and innovation among&nbsp;members.  Businesses — Align microcredentials with organisational values, such as sustainability or diversity, to enhance staff development and retention.  Higher Education — Partner with businesses to design credentials for emerging fields like green technology or AI ethics, and create opportunities for targeted, stackable learning pathways.   Looking Ahead <p>The trends shaping microcredentials reflect a shift towards more flexible, inclusive, and skills-focused education systems. By embracing open standards, leveraging technology, and fostering collaboration, organisations can unlock the full potential of microcredentials to meet the needs of learners and&nbsp;society.</p><p>In the next post, we’ll explore the role of technology in greater depth, examining the digital tools and frameworks that underpin modern microcredentialing systems.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-4-4a0811255a00">Reframing Recognition: Part 4</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>60 Day Public Review - ends May 27th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) TC [1] are pleased to announce that TOSCA Version 2.0 CS01 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>TOSCA provides a language for describing application components and their relationships by means of a service topology, and for specifying the lifecycle management procedures for creation or modification of services using orchestration processes. The combination of topology and orchestration enables not only the automation of deployment but also the automation of the complete service lifecycle management. The TOSCA specification promotes a model-driven approach, whereby information embedded in the model structure (the dependencies, connections, compositions) drives the automated processes.</p>



<p>The TC received three Statements of Use from Ericsson, Tal Liron, and Chris Lauwers [3].</p>



<p>The candidate specification and related files are available here:</p>

		<p>To help individuals enrich their tech-savvy journey, the EdgeCast series includes videos that share invaluable insights, tips, and tricks to navigating through an ever-evolving world of technology. A recent addition to this series was Leveraging AI for Universal Design for Learning (UDL) in Higher Education hosted by Josh Gaul, Associate Vice President &amp; Chief Digital Learning Officer, Edge. He was joined by Dr. Laura Romeo, Director of Learning Innovation, Development, and Scholarship, Edge, and Jaimie Dubuque, former Teaching and Learning Technologist, Rider University.</p>
<p>Diving into higher education last November, Jaimie Dubuque joined Rider University after ten years as a classroom teacher and inclusive education facilitator in southern New Jersey. In this position, her primary responsibility was supporting school districts and including students with disabilities in the general education classroom. “My master’s degree is in curriculum and instruction, and I have experience as an English teacher,” shares Dubuque. “I’m also a parent of a child with ADHD, so I have a personal investment in topics like Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and the potential that AI has to unlock many barriers that exist for kids like my son.”</p>
<p>Like Dubuque, Dr. Romeo’s career path began in the classroom. After being an elementary teacher for seven years, she returned to school to get her master’s in instructional design and technology. “I became a curriculum specialist and started to see some discrepancies in the classroom with curriculum and how things are designed for student learning needs,” explains Romeo. “For that purpose, I wanted to do more research and dig into how we can overcome this one-size-fits-all learning approach by making UDL more mainstream.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Putting UDL into Practice<br>
Universal Design for Learning is an educational framework that aims to create flexible learning environments and instructional methods to accommodate diverse learners. By using these guidelines, institutions can provide multiple means of representation, action, expression, and engagement. “Putting the UDL framework into practice allows you to use a variety of media formats like video, images, and audio, provide alternatives to visual information through captions and descriptive audio, and incorporate tools like text to speech, speak to text, and digital note taking,” says Gaul. “Designing flexible, customizable learning environments that can be adopted and adapted to individual preferences and abilities helps organizations emphasize relevant, meaningful and authentic learning experiences that foster motivation and engagement.”</p>
<p>In partnership with Seton Hall University, Edge hosted the inaugural AI Teaching &amp; Learning Symposium in June of 2024 to explore the impact of AI on teaching, learning and the student experience. Dubuque was a presenter at this event and led a discussion on how AI can be leveraged in teaching and learning to enhance accessibility, as well as the practical strategies for implementing AI in planning. “No matter if you work at the front office of an elementary school or in the upper echelon of administration, one of the most common things you hear teachers say is, I don’t have time,” says Dubuque. “Tools like ChatGPT are going to be essential for maximizing our time and resource investments within schools without spending additional money.</p>
<p>“AI tools like ChatGPT can quickly turn teachers’ ideas and inspiration into customized, relevant content for their classrooms,” continues Dubuque. “A lesson plan that still has a one-size-fits-some approach can be transformed to incorporate elements of UDL principles. The request could be general, or an instructor could be more specific and ask for guided notes outline for students to use during their discussion. All of this can happen without spending additional resources.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“AI tools can help generate multiple formats that cater to different learning styles, but not everyone is aware of their availability and capabilities. Getting the word out and sharing real-life examples and model demonstrations will be essential to expanding its reach into more educators’ classrooms and helping teachers know how to use these tools more effectively.”</p>

		<p>As someone who also recognizes the benefits of using AI platforms like ChatGPT, Romeo says this tool can streamline content creation and refine content to ensure it aligns with UDL strategies and the needs of specific students. “AI tools can help generate multiple formats that cater to different learning styles, but not everyone is aware of their availability and capabilities. Getting the word out and sharing real-life examples and model demonstrations will be essential to expanding its reach into more educators’ classrooms and helping&nbsp;teachers know how to use these tools more effectively.”</p>
<p>Generating Educational Resources<br>
In addition to writing a quick lesson plan, AI can be used to generate different educational resources. “ChatGPT can be used to create a variety of models to supplement a subject or lesson plan,” explains Dubuque. “For example, an instructor could use the platform to generate a PowerPoint presentation or slide that students can interact with on their own. Being able to control your own learning by dictating when a slide is moved and not moved is empowering for students, no matter their age or ability level. A teacher can also generate multiple worksheets that hit on those same UDL standards.”</p>
<p>“Another piece of this puzzle is students graduating from college and becoming first-year teachers,” continues Dubuque. “In some cases, it’s the wild west and they’re entering school districts that do not necessarily have a set curriculum. Or on the other hand, students are being handed a scripted curriculum that they’re expected to follow to a tee. Both of these scenarios are dangerous for education, and we must find the sweet spot where instructors can generate content that still aligns with the curriculum but can be customized for different learning styles. For example, an English teacher could use ChatGPT to generate response questions that students will answer in a small group. They can think how they want to generate conversation questions and create different levels of questions that provide more scaffolding for students to either elevate the level of the work they’re already doing or help them reach their grade level expectations. Most importantly, we’re able to create a shared experience in our classroom communities and help students at different levels and abilities to succeed.”</p>
<p>Conversing with AI<br>
When using AI tools like ChatGPT, the goal is to provide specific prompts that will generate the most relevant and useful responses to the user. However, without practice, knowing how to effectively engage with ChatGPT can be challenging. “To get the most out of this tool, I’ve found asking open-ended questions followed by more tailored follow-up questions based on the solutions is a good approach,” says Romeo. “I also look back at my learning outcomes that I’m trying to align a lesson or content with and see if they match. Having authentic conversations with this AI component helps improve my productivity and allows me to personalize learning in new and creative ways.”</p>
<p>Dubuque agrees that open-ended questions are useful and says she approaches ChatGPT as a coach-athlete relationship, where the AI platform is functioning as the coach. “At the end of the day, you’re the athlete with the ball in your hands and you have to make the game time decision of what you’re going to do. Open-ended questions can provide ideas for particular scenarios or how you can ensure you’re meeting the needs of students who struggle with time management. From there, you can give it the parameters of your class. So, while I might be more generic in my questions around how I can incorporate UDL elements of action and expression in a particular lesson plan, I can then be more specific about how to do that in a 45-minute timeframe.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Many schools are concerned about students using AI inappropriately, but instead of focusing on how students can use this tool to cheat, we should look at how we can adapt assessments to reduce the need for plagiarizing,” continues Dubuque. “How do we put up guardrails without the need to police AI usage? The best way to prevent cheating is to keep the human element in instruction and talk to students along the way. Whether you teach a fully online class where you’re communicating over a learning management system (LMS) or on Zoom talking directly to a student, or in a classroom and seeing students in person, there are checkpoints in your instruction that can help keep students on track and accountable for their work.”</p>
<p>Institutions who are working to remove barriers to learning can make assessments more accessible and offer different formats, including oral, written, or visual options to demonstrate student understanding. “The key is for institutions to incorporate AI tools into their practice and show students how to use these productive knowledge constructs properly and in a way that will benefit them,” says Romeo. “Students can use AI to refine their ideas and enhance a portfolio of work that has videos, creative writing, and data analysis.”</p>
<p>Establishing Policies and Procedures<br>
As stated in Rider University’s code of academic integrity, learning, teaching, and scholarship cannot be conducted in an atmosphere of dishonesty. To help establish policies and procedures, review allegations of academic misconduct, and promote academic ethics, the University has formed an Academic Integrity Committee. “Our academic integrity task force is currently looking at AI and how these tools and technology fit into our current codes of conduct and within different areas of study,” shares Dubuque. “The misuse of AI we’re seeing still falls under our current policies around cheating and plagiarism. In addition, our Teaching and Learning Center offers several workshops that explore AI, including a session that looks at the ways artificial intelligence can be used to embed the UDL framework into instruction.”</p>
<p>In working with Edge member institutions, Romeo says many organizations have clear guidelines set around their AI usage and these standards are outlined in course syllabi. “Taking this approach encourages transparency and ethical use of AI because you’re creating an open channel of communication between the instructor and the student. Students understand what resources they can use and how to use them. We’re also seeing many departments with specific instructors who not only regulate the use of AI, but are also trying to educate themselves and their faculty and students on how to use these tools responsibly.”</p>
<p>“From an instructional design perspective, there are bigger conversations starting about what resources are out there, how they’re being used, and how AI can be utilized ethically and effectively,” continues Romeo. “Many institutions are exploring whether to standardize AI usage across the entire organization or across individual departments. The AI-powered teaching assistant, Khanmigo, for example, can offer guidance to students to help them learn different subjects and can assist teachers in lesson planning. Tools like this are not moving the goalpost, they’re leveling the playing field for students. Since we’re at the starting point of understanding AI in education, the line is going to move and blur as we continue to have conversations about this topic and determine the best path forward.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“Keeping student data private and secure is of the utmost importance, so any information put into an AI platform must be kept generic. As educators, designers, and instructors, we need to think about when using AI is appropriate and when it is not and look at this technology with a critical eye. AI can be very helpful when drafting course materials or to help spark creative ideas, but the final review of the content should always be completed by the educator to ensure integrity. We also must consider where the content goes once it is entered into an AI platform. For students that utilize it as a tool, can they close the computer and have an extensive conversation about the material? If not, they do not have ownership or accountability, and they need to go back and review the information. I anticipate that this is going to be an interesting conversation between unions, administrators, and school boards and thinking about what it means to use AI as an instructor and when it’s considered appropriate and when it’s not.”</p>

		<p>Protecting Privacy and Intellectual Property<br>
When using AI, educators will need to be mindful of the data that these tools collect and how that information is used. “Keeping student data private and secure is of the utmost importance, so any information put into an AI platform must be kept generic,” says Dubuque. “As educators, designers, and instructors, we need to think about when using AI is appropriate and when it is not and look at this technology with a critical eye. AI can be very helpful when drafting course materials or to help spark creative ideas, but the final review of the content should always be completed by the educator to ensure integrity.

I anticipate that this is going to be an interesting conversation between unions, administrators, and school boards and thinking about what it means to use AI as an instructor and when it’s considered appropriate and when it’s not.”</p>
<p><br>
Part of Dubuque’s primary role is offering Canvas support and helping faculty members use the LMS to deliver dynamic learning experiences. “Teachers are looking for ways to use Canvas to create modules or add a rubric to an assignment. I’ll often offer helpful tips for using ChatGPT to create a course outline or course objectives based on their syllabus and show them the possibilities of AI tools. We’re able to start removing the stigma that AI is going to replace instructors, but rather can free up time so they can do other things that will enhance their classes and support their students. They’re able to be more thoughtful about their assessments, spend time giving authentic feedback, and align their instruction with UDL principles.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“Artificial intelligence is not going to replace our human creativity or judgment, it is a tool that can enhance the teaching and learning experience when used properly and ethically. I’ve tried to remain curious about AI and continue to experiment with it, while keeping students’ needs and best learning principles in mind. Ultimately, it is our responsibility as educators to wield this tool thoughtfully, ensuring it enriches rather than diminishes the educational journey.”</p>

		<p>“If used thoughtfully, AI tools can help students organize their thinking and provide additional clarification on certain topics and content-specific vocabulary,” continues Dubuque. “It’s important to acknowledge that students with learning disabilities will still have those support needs when heading to college and AI tools like ChatGPT may start appearing as accommodations in students’ Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) and 504 plans. AI can provide the ability to break down some large-scale assignments into more manageable tasks and help students be more successful in their classes.”<br>
Romeo adds, “Artificial intelligence is not going to replace our human creativity or judgment, it is a tool that can enhance the teaching and learning experience when used properly and ethically. I’ve tried to remain curious about AI and continue to experiment with it, while keeping students’ needs and best learning principles in mind. Ultimately, it is our responsibility as educators to wield this tool thoughtfully, ensuring it enriches rather than diminishes the educational journey.”<br>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>A Farewell Message<br><br>This is the final DINZ newsletter under my watch, but if the writing style seems familiar in April’s newsletter you’ll know that AI has been deployed or my successor hasn’t been fully onboarded&nbsp;.<br><br>It’s been a blast, it really has! I’m satisfied with DINZ’s development under my tenure. No regrets. DINZ has punched way above its weight with minimal resources – only made possible by larger organisations whose support enabled volunteer members and supporters from organisations of all sizes to dedicate time and expertise to deliver our mahi on its&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/about/">mission</a>. You know who you are, so thank you!&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks also to the DINZ Executive Councils I have served over the years. It’s a largely unheralded gig, but governance in emerging ecosystems is crucial.<br><br>DINZ Updates</p>



 
 The&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/biometrics-special-interest-group-sig/">DINZ Biometrics Special Interest Group</a>&nbsp;submitted again on the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2025/03/DINZ_Submission_on_Biometrics_Code_of_Practice_March_2025-CW-signed.pdf">Biometrics Code of Practice</a>&nbsp;this month. Neither DINZ or NZTech are supportive of the code at this time, instead advocating for expert prepared Guidance to improve biometrics implementation best practice for all stakeholders, including privacy specialists who may not necessarily be biometric experts. 



 By the time you read this, our webinar&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/distf-evaluators-showcase/">‘Meet the DISTF Evaluators’&nbsp;</a>will be underway with over 100 registrations – the first educational session on this aspect of the regime as DINZ members enter the final week of&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/educational-resources/">free access to InformDI’s 7 Chapters DISTF online education suite.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; 



 DINZ members&nbsp;please complete the DISTF survey emailed to you by 14 April. 



 The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/our-work/next-generation-payments/">Next Gen Payments Consultation</a>&nbsp;from DINZ member PaymentsNZ is due this Friday, so get yours in today!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 



<p><br>Industry Insights<br><br>There are some ‘green shoots’ appearing in Aotearoa New Zealand’s digital identity space, but we have years of catch-up ahead to regain our global leadership. We have to be more nimble, smart and collegial in all dimensions (detailed examples too much for the newsletter’s word count), but suffice to say that it’s Kiwi companies like MATTR, Authsignal, JNCTN, APLYiD, MyMahi and others that keep us on the map globally.<br><br>While taking more leisure time, I’m open to some advisory work leveraging my decades of knowledge, experience and contact networks in both local and international settings not often possible in this role.&nbsp;<br><br>What’s Happening Around the Globe<br><br>As always, I’m sharing links to global news that resonated with me.</p>

 I found recent pundit Jamie Smith’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/biggest-identity-market-one-youve-never-heard-jamie-smith--ksz9e?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;utm_campaign=share_via">post on the fraud market&nbsp;</a>quite thought provoking, although I don’t fully agree with him that Organisational Identity has been under a shadow. In NZ it’s not helped by agency responsibilities being split between MBIE and DIA. 



 OI forms a major plank of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.getverified.co.nz/">Get Verified</a>&nbsp;in the payments world but there are other worlds of course. 



 That brings me to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jamiedsmith_customerfutures-empowermenttech-activity-7308046049841930241-AH5F/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;rcm=ACoAAAC64Z4BsBpUlqet58BkfzAhb574r2zYOTA">another Jamie Smith post</a>&nbsp;on Edeleman’s Trust Barometer (in the comments) where Aotearoa’s own Āhau gets a mention.&nbsp;

<p>OASIS Data Provenance Standard Technical Committee Charter</p>



<p>The charter for this TC is as follows:</p>



Section 1: TC Charter1.a. TC Name<br>Data Provenance Standards Technical Committee (DPS TC)1.b. Statement of Purpose<br>Provenance matters. We understand the sources of food, water, medicine, and capital-essential in our society to gauge quality and trust-and must now work to understand data, the fuel of our increasingly knowledge- and AI-centric world. For the purposes of this document and related TC efforts, provenance, pedigree, and lineage are recognized as distinct but interconnected concepts. The TC will prioritize early efforts to define how these terms-ranging from origin and history to granularity at the geographic, organizational, and individual levels-are scoped and applied to benefit all stakeholders. This will ensure comprehensive, practical, and actionable standards while mitigating ambiguity and scope constraints.&nbsp;<br><br>Of course, building trust in data starts with transparency of provenance-assessing where data comes from, how it’s created, and whether it can be used legally. Yet, the ecosystem still needs a common language to provide that transparency. Establishing shared provenance standards is foundational to fostering trust in data and AI-driven systems.&nbsp;<br><br>Over the past 18 months, the Data &amp; Trust Alliance, in collaboration with industry organizations such as the EDM Council and AI Alliance, has worked to normalize and map its data provenance standards to existing initiatives while identifying practical adoption paths. For example, based on recommendations from the AI Alliance, the Data &amp; Trust Alliance’s metadata framework has been integrated into&nbsp;<a href="https://thealliance.ai/core-projects/open-trusted-data-initiative">Hugging Face model cards</a>&nbsp;to promote provenance transparency in AI development.&nbsp;<br><br>Using Version 1.0.0 of the Data Provenance Standards, defined by a working group of industry leaders from the Data &amp; Trust Alliance, the OASIS Data Provenance Standards Technical Committee aims to advance data transparency, accountability, and trust by solidifying provenance standards into a universal data governance norm.&nbsp;<br><br>This initiative will focus on implementing consistent tagging and metadata frameworks across data ecosystems-down to database, table, and column levels-to provide comprehensive data lineage and collection details tracking and support responsible data use, privacy, and compliance across all industries. The Committee will consider trust in data, ensuring that provenance, lineage, pedigree, and ultimately transparency support trust-building efforts in AI and data ecosystems. The Committee will consider existing trust models where relevant, ensuring alignment with industry best practices while remaining focused on provenance as a key enabler of trust.&nbsp;<br><br>By establishing these standards, the Committee will enhance data life-cycle management, facilitate regulatory adherence, and reinforce trust in AI-driven and data-dependent applications. The Committee will also explore opportunities for integrating automated tools to generate and validate metadata, ensuring scalability and ease of adoption while maintaining trust and compliance.&nbsp;<br><br>The goal is to create actionable standards that deliver measurable business value, such as enhanced operational efficiency and trust in AI systems, and to encourage adoption by demonstrating clear ROI for both data providers and consumers.1.c. Business Benefits&nbsp;<br>It is expected that these standards will benefit all data and AI stakeholders, including:<br>-data suppliers (e.g., data producers, technology companies)-who will be able to deliver clear and consistent data lineage information, making their datasets more valuable and trustworthy. Compliance can combat piracy and misuse.<br>-data acquirers (e.g., data-driven organizations, regulatory bodies)-who will benefit from greater transparency and being better able to assess the reliability and intended usage of datasets and to request changes or reject data sets when necessary. Higher performing AI tools can be a direct outcome.<br>-end-users (consumers)-who will gain insight into how their data is managed and protected, and thus become more trusting in representative/non-biased data-driven solutions.&nbsp;<br><br>These standards will:<br>-enable data suppliers to provide standardized, consistent metadata on data lineage and provenance<br>-support data acquirers in managing compliance and mitigating risks associated with data privacy, security, and intellectual property rights<br>-help end-users by ensuring transparency in data handling and increasing trust in digital services.&nbsp;<br><br>The standards will be relevant to professionals across various domains, including:&nbsp;<br>-data governance professionals (including legal and compliance stewards)<br>-IT and compliance officers<br>-AI and data scientists<br>-business and industry professionals who rely on trusted data for decision-making.&nbsp;<br><br>Adoption will be driven by enterprise demand for metadata-tagged datasets that offer faster access, reduced compliance risks, and improved decision-making. The availability of automated tools for metadata tagging and validation will significantly lower adoption barriers and costs for data providers.1.d. Scope<br>The TC will develop cross-industry standards for defining data provenance, pedigree, lineage, and metadata-tagging frameworks. These will support tags at the database, table, and column levels, as well as metadata for graph databases, NoSQL databases, and data exchanged via APIs and other non-database structures.&nbsp;<br><br>The scope includes creating guidelines and schemas for managing the data life cycle and tracking provenance, pedigree, and lineage across diverse data architectures and transmission methods. While highly domain-specific adaptations may require additional tailoring by industry groups, these standards are intended to provide a flexible foundation that is applicable across multiple sectors.&nbsp;<br><br>Additionally, provenance-related geolocation metadata will encompass latitude/longitude, political/geographical boundaries, organizational context, and person-based attributes where relevant, supporting trust assessments based on data origin.&nbsp;<br><br>The TC will also provide guidance on the development and integration of tools for automating metadata tagging, validation, and transformation, to ensure accuracy and compliance. The scope of these standards does not include tagging for misinformation, disinformation, or malinformation (“mis/dis/mal”); rather, such determinations are beyond provenance and are expected to be derived by users (e.g., AI/ML systems) externally to these specifications.&nbsp;<br><br>The TC will prioritize datasets that are critical for AI/ML applications and enterprise use cases, balancing comprehensive tagging with practical implementation considerations.1.e. Deliverables&nbsp;<br>Expected deliverables include:&nbsp;<br>-Committee specifications for standardized data provenance tags<br>-Committee notes and/or guides on how to implement the standards<br>-supporting documentation such as glossaries, UML models, and metadata requirements documents<br>-guidelines for integrating tools to automate metadata tagging, validation, and life-cycle management<br>-additional deliverables as determined by the Technical Committee, such as reference implementations, case studies, interoperability frameworks, based on ongoing needs and industry developments, or a study on how the standards align and enable compliance (for AI providers) with transparency regulation in the AI space as well as the benefits of the standards to data providers.&nbsp;<br><br>The Technical Committee aims to release initial drafts by mid-2025. This will be followed by public feedback phases and iterative refinements, with the goal of finalizing and publishing the standards by late 2025. Timelines may be adjusted based on industry input and the progress of Committee discussions.1.f. IPR Mode<br>Non-assertion1.g. Audience<br>Participants will include AI ethics and privacy specialists, data governance and compliance professionals, IT managers, and regulatory advisors from various industries, particularly finance, healthcare, and retail.1.h.

 Demystifying Microcredentials Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>This is the third in a series of blog posts drawing on the insights from <a href="https://www.ndln.ie/new-learning-and-teaching-models">a report authored by WAO</a> for the Irish <a href="https://www.ndln.ie/">National Digital Leadership Network</a> (NDLN). The report explores the historical roots of credentialing, the emergence of microcredentials, and the opportunities they present for reshaping education and professional development.</p><p>Microcredentials are increasingly discussed as a solution to the gaps in traditional education and workforce development systems. However, their purpose and value can be misunderstood, leading to confusion among educators, employers, and learners. In this post, with <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Open Recognition</a> as a guiding concept, we clarify what microcredentials are, address common misconceptions, and explore how they can meet diverse&nbsp;needs.</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-1-50b0fc77cd05">Part 1 — Introduction and&nbsp;Context</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-2-985ab20a1176">Part 2 — The Evolution of Credentialing</a>  Part 3 — Demystifying Microcredentials (this&nbsp;post)  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-4-4a0811255a00">Part 4 — Trends Shaping the Future of Microcredentials</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-5-fde07efdcbd2">Part 5 — The Role of Technology in Microcredentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-6-fe96ea9be396">Part 6 — Challenges and Risks in Microcredentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-7-4ce87debec12">Part 7 — A Vision for the Future of Microcredentials</a>   What Are Microcredentials? <p>At their core, microcredentials are forms of recognition that help to validate specific skills, knowledge, or behaviours. Unlike traditional degrees or diplomas, which often encompass years of study, microcredentials tend to be smaller, more modular and flexible. They can stand alone as markers of achievement or be combined to create larger qualifications, making them well-suited to today’s fast-changing education and employment landscapes.</p><p>Microcredentials are underpinned by principles of transparency and portability. Standards such as <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/What_Are_Open_Badges%3F">Open Badges</a> ensure that each credential contains verifiable information about the skill achieved, the criteria for earning it, and the issuing organisation. This approach builds trust and enables learners to showcase their achievements across different platforms and contexts.</p> Addressing Common Misconceptions <p>One of the biggest misconceptions about microcredentials is that they are simply short courses. While some microcredentials are tied to short learning experiences, their true value lies in their ability to represent specific knowledge, skills, and behaviours in a way that is transparent and meaningful to employers and other stakeholders. Unlike traditional short courses, microcredentials include detailed evidence of achievement, such as project work or assessments, supported by standards like Open Badges, which ensure interoperability and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Another misconception is the risk of ‘credential fatigue’ where learners are overwhelmed by the need to collect numerous credentials to prove their skills. Thoughtfully designed systems mitigate this risk by ensuring that microcredentials are stackable and aligned with broader qualification frameworks. This allows learners to build towards larger goals rather than accumulating isolated credentials.</p> Meeting Sector-Specific Needs <p>Microcredentials are well-positioned to tackle diverse challenges across various sectors. To maximise their effectiveness, they must adhere to certain key principles. They should be standards-based, utilising frameworks such as Open Badges or Verifiable Credentials (to be explored in a future post), which ensures their portability and interoperability.</p><p>The metadata included in a microcredential should clearly outline the skills achieved, the criteria met, and the issuing organisation. In addition, they must focus on specific, demonstrable knowledge, skills, and/or behaviours in a way that allows them to be ‘stacked’ towards larger qualifications. These features collectively ensure that microcredentials remain meaningful, portable, and impactful for both learners and organisations.</p><p>The principle of Open Recognition broadens the scope of microcredentials, valuing learning in all its forms — formal, informal, and experiential. By adopting Open Recognition, organisations can ensure that microcredentials are inclusive and accessible, celebrating a wide range of achievements. This approach enables credentials to reflect not only technical skills but also personal growth, community contributions, and soft&nbsp;skills.</p><p>To illustrate their versatility, here are examples of how microcredentials can address sector-specific needs. Microcredentials can:</p>  Charities — Recognise skills gained through volunteer work, fundraising activities, and advocacy campaigns, helping participants showcase their contributions to broader&nbsp;causes.  NGOs — Validate the skills of community workers and volunteers, making their contributions visible and&nbsp;valued.  Co-ops — Highlight informal learning and collaboration, supporting shared growth and innovation.  Businesses — Align organisational values, such as sustainability or diversity, enhancing staff development and retention.  Higher Education — Offer targeted learning opportunities that complement traditional degree programmes, such as industry-specific certifications or co-curricular achievements.  <p>Microcredentials are not simply a way of breaking up an existing course into more granular chunks. Instead, they allow organisations to think deeper and wider about the kind of knowledge, skills, and behaviours they wish to promote. This can be in collaboration with other providers, for example when Higher Education institutions work with businesses to ensure a talent pipeline.</p> Looking Ahead <p>In the next post, we’ll examine the trends shaping the future of microcredentials. From skills-based hiring to stackable learning pathways, we’ll explore how these developments are driving change and creating new opportunities in a range of&nbsp;sectors.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-3-c3c956c09574">Reframing Recognition: Part 3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen/rss-feeds/nach-dienststellen/alle-mitteilungen.msg-id-103879.html">media release</a> is an official statement by the Swiss Federal Government announcing the strategic direction and implementation steps for digital identity and trust infrastructure.</p>
<p>On 21 January 2025, the Swiss Federal Office of Justice (FOJ), in collaboration with the Federal Chancellery and the Federal Office of Information Technology and Telecommunications (FOITT), published an important <a>statement on the future of digital identity and trust infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p>As DIDAS – the Swiss association for digital trust – we are proud to have actively contributed to this milestone. Through constructive consultation, cross-sector collaboration and the sharing of insights from our community, we helped shape the direction of this foundational work. A special thank you goes to our co-authors and all those who support this joint effort.</p>
<p>Digital trust infrastructure – such as the E-ID, verifiable credentials, and interoperable wallets – is essential for the digital resilience and competitiveness of Switzerland. These are not just technological building blocks, but key enablers of a sovereign, secure and citizen-centric digital society.</p>
<p>This milestone also directly connects with the recently published vision by FIND and the State Secretariat for International Finance (SIF):<br>👉 <a href="https://find.swiss/announcements/pathway-2035-for-financial-innovation">Pathway 2035: Unlocking Financial Innovation for Switzerland</a></p>
<p>The message is clear: Switzerland’s ability to lead in financial innovation depends on a trusted digital foundation. At DIDAS, we are committed to&nbsp;enabling&nbsp;this foundation – bringing together policy, technology, and ecosystem actors to reduce friction, build interoperability, and establish trust by design.</p>
<p>Because in the end, Digital Trust is not a nice-to-have – it is a strategic imperative for Switzerland’s future.</p>
<p>Digital Trust is now firmly positioned on Switzerland’s strategic, political, and economic agenda.</p>

In Ancient Egypt, training systems validated authority and expertise, while over a thousand years ago, China’s imperial examination system was testing candidates. These systems laid the foundation for linking recognised skills to societal&nbsp;roles.</p><p>During the Middle Ages, guilds established structured systems to train and certify artisans. Apprenticeships emphasised hands-on learning and formal recognition, ensuring tradespeople demonstrated their competence before advancing. This model prioritised practical application, reflecting the needs of a skills-driven society.</p><p>The 19th century brought significant changes as industrialisation created demand for standardised education and professional qualifications. Universities and professional bodies formalised credentials, with degrees and certifications becoming essential markers of expertise in fields such as medicine, law, and engineering. These qualifications were designed to meet the need for consistent standards in rapidly expanding industries.</p> Lifelong Learning and the Emergence of Microcredentials <p>The 20th century saw a shift towards ongoing professional development, driven by rapid technological advances and changing workforce demands. Short courses and certifications became more prominent, offering flexible ways for individuals to update their skills. However, these credentials often lacked portability and alignment with broader qualifications, which limited their&nbsp;value.</p><p>Microcredentials build on this history, addressing gaps left by traditional systems. They are designed to be modular, stackable, and skills-focused, making them well-suited to today’s fast-changing educational and employment landscapes. Unlike short courses, microcredentials are typically standards-based, ensuring that they are both portable and meaningful across different contexts.</p> Aligning Microcredentials with Open Recognition <p>The principle of Open Recognition underpins the design of microcredentials, moving beyond formal qualifications to value diverse forms of learning.</p><blockquote>“Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.” (<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">What is Open Recognition, anyway?</a>)</blockquote><p>This approach acknowledges informal, experiential, and community-based achievements, creating opportunities for broader inclusion.</p><p>For example:</p>  Universities — Recognising learning outside the classroom, such as internships or co-curricular activities.  NGOs — Validating the skills of volunteers and community workers through accessible, evidence-based credentials.  Co-ops — Highlighting the informal knowledge gained by members, promoting collaboration and shared expertise.  Charities — Celebrating the contributions of volunteers and staff, offering evidence-based recognition for their skills and&nbsp;efforts.  Businesses — Demonstrating workforce adaptability by using microcredentials to validate and showcase employee skills, supporting professional growth and development.  <p>The evolution of credentialing reflects an ongoing effort to address societal needs. Microcredentials represent the next stage, offering a flexible and inclusive way to recognise skills in diverse contexts. By integrating principles of Open Recognition, they have the potential to transform how learning is valued and applied across all&nbsp;sectors.</p> Looking Ahead <p>In the next post, we’ll help demystify microcredentials by addressing common misconceptions and exploring their potential to meet diverse needs. We’ll provide practical examples of how microcredentials can be implemented effectively in a variety of&nbsp;sectors.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-2-985ab20a1176">Reframing Recognition: Part 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>In a significant milestone for the global Open Banking and Open Data community, on February 22nd, the OpenID Foundation published and approved the new and final version of the FAPI 2 Security profile and its Attacker model.</p>
<p><a href="https://openid.net/specs/fapi-security-profile-2_0-final.html">FAPI 2.0 Security Profile</a></p>
<p><a href="https://openid.net/specs/fapi-attacker-model-2_0-final.html">FAPI 2.0 Attacker Model</a></p>
<p>A Final Specification provides intellectual property protections to implementers of the specification and is not subject to further revision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenID Foundation’s FAPI working group and many invited experts have worked extensively on the specification to make it simpler, easier to understand, more secure, and more interoperable. This version has been through <a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/12/Formal-Security-Analysis-of-FAPI-2.0_FINAL_2022-10.pdf">formal security analysis</a> by the University of Stuttgart, and the <a href="https://openid.net/how-to-certify-your-implementation/">certification test suite</a> is being updated to reflect FAPI 2.0 Final.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the last Implementer’s Draft, there have been many editorial changes: new introduction sections, formatting, corrected typos, section renumbering, updated references to sections of this document and other specifications, and added acknowledgments.</p>
<p>Note: The previous approved implementer’s draft can be found <a href="https://openid.net/specs/fapi-2_0-security-profile-ID2.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a detailed summary of the key changes that can impact existing FAPI 2.0 implementations. These changes should be reviewed by all implementers (live or planning to go live) who had built their implementations against the last implementer’s draft.</p>
<p>If you have questions about the specs, please direct them to the FAPI WG mailing list at <a href="mailto:openid-specs-fapi-owner@lists.openid.net">openid-specs-fapi-owner@lists.openid.net</a>. If you have certification questions, please direct them to <a href="mailto:certification@oidf.org">certification@oidf.org</a>.</p>
 Summary of changes between FAPI 2.0 Implementer’s Draft 2.0 and Final 
<p>The changes below are labeled AS if relevant for Authorization Servers, RP for Relying Parties and Clients, and Ecosystem for Ecosystem operators.</p>
 ‘aud’ claim value in client authentication assertions. AS RP&nbsp; 
<p>Why? This additional security control has been introduced as a result of the FAPI working group discussion after the specification’s formal security analysis.</p>
<p>Impact: If your ecosystem or implementation uses and/or supports client authentication assertions, e.g., private_key_jwt, this impacts your implementation (client or authorization server).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The specification was updated to only allow the issuer identifier value as a value for ‘aud’. Authorization servers are required to enforce this behavior. Note: Previously, other values were allowed for interoperability purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conformance tests will enforce this.</p>
 TLS security deferred to BCP195 AS 
<p>Why? Instead of repeating the content of BCP195, FAPI will refer all TLS security matters to BCP195.</p>
<p>Impact on Authorization Servers:</p>
 
 
<p>IETF periodically publishes BCP195. FAPI 2 implementers must comply with BCP195 changes within 12 months after publication.</p>
 
 
<p>Some ciphers have recently been removed from the recommended list. Please review BCP195 to ensure you are up to date.</p>
 
 
<p>Conformance tests will enforce this.</p>
 Elliptic curve keys’ length AS 
<p>Why: The FAPI2 specification aligns with TLS BCP requirements (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9325.html">https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9325.html</a> ) and NIST Guidelines [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9325.html#NIST.SP.800-56A">NIST.SP.800-56A</a>], which have been updated recently.</p>
<p>Impact: &nbsp;Elliptic curve keys used by AS shall have a minimum length of 224 bits.</p>
<p>Conformance tests will enforce this minimum length.</p>
 Clock skew AS 
<p>Why: Clock skew causes many interoperability issues: even a few hundred milliseconds of clock skew can cause JWTs to be rejected by AS as “issued in the future.” This new specification provides additional guidance for dealing with clock skews.</p>
<p>Impact: Authorization servers are required to accept JWTs with an iat or nbf timestamp between 0 and 10 seconds in the future and to reject JWTs with an iat or nbf timestamp greater than 60 seconds in the future.</p>
<p>Conformance tests will test this.&nbsp;</p>
 MTLS ecosystems AS RP Ecosystem 
<p>Why? Some ecosystems have implemented MTLS as an additional security control at the transport layer for all server-to-server endpoints requiring transmitting sensitive data. For example, private_key_jwt is sometimes used for client authentication in conjunction with MTLS connectivity.</p>
<p>FAPI 2 recognizes this existing deployment practice and provides additional guidance to improve interoperability.</p>
<p>Key impacts (for ecosystems that choose to use it):</p>
 
 
<p>Authorization server implementations may utilize mtls_endpoint_aliases authorization server metadata to provide a discovery mechanism for endpoints that might have both MTLS and non-MTLS endpoints;</p>
 
 
<p>New client metadata `use_mtls_endpoint_aliases` was introduced for clients to indicate that they will be using mutual-TLS endpoint aliases [@RFC8705] declared by the authorization server in its metadata even beyond the Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens use cases. Client implementations shall use client metadata use_mtls_endpoint_aliases, if present.</p>
 
 
<p>Conformance tests will test this.&nbsp;</p>
 One-time use of `request_uri` AS 
<p>Why? Recent implementation experience of x2app with PAR&nbsp; highlighted that some operating systems pre-load authorization URLs and, in some cases, invalidate `request_uri` before an intended recipient app can use it.</p>
<p>Impact: Authorization servers are provided with additional guidance on enforcing one-time use of `request_uri` values: enforcement should occur at the time of authorization(where an authenticated user is presented with the consent details), not at the point of loading an authorization page. Once a user has been presented with consent details, request_uri should be invalidated independently of what the user chooses to do (accept, reject, or ignore/close a browser window or an application).</p>
 Refresh token rotation prohibition Ecosystem 
<p>Why? Refresh token rotation has traditionally been used as a security control. Still, it is known to cause significant operational issues and user experience degradation, with clients losing access to their existing consents. FAPI2 doesn’t require this security control because of the use of confidential clients and sender-constrained access tokens.</p>
<p>Impact: Ecosystems using refresh token rotation should require Authorisation Servers to remove it unless used for infrastructure migration or other extraordinary circumstances.</p>
 Some other items we knew already but needed to clarify 
 
 
<p>Authorization servers only support confidential clients. Ecosystem</p>
 
 
<p>Authorization servers shall not support CORS for the authorization endpoint (clients are not accessing this endpoint correctly). AS</p>
 
 
<p>As accepted best practice, Authorization Servers should restrict the privileges associated with an access token to the minimum required for the particular application or use case. AS</p>
 
 
<p>Authorization servers should not allow clients to influence their client_id so that it can be mistaken for an end-user subject identifier (a new attack has been added to security considerations: Client Impersonating Resource Owner). AS Ecosystem</p>
 
 
<p>Clients shall only send `client_id` and `request_uri` request parameters to the authorization endpoint (all other authorization request parameters are sent via PAR (RFC9126). Clients will fail if they don’t conform to this behavior. AS will fail if they don’t ignore other request parameters sent to the authorization endpoint. AS RP Ecosystem</p>
 
 
<p>Clients are required to use `code` as the value for `response_type`. Used to say shall support the authorization code grant (`response_type=code` &amp;&nbsp; `grant_type=authorization_code`) described in [@!RFC6749]; AS RP Ecosystem</p>

<p>At ISL we pride ourselves on being dispassionate truth-seekers when it comes to assessing risky behaviors in technology. But this moment in history requires expressing our passion for truth and our core values more openly.</p>
<p>What’s currently happening in the US is, by design, disruptive, disorienting, and discouraging for many. The calculated dehumanizing of trans people and immigrants coupled with the TESCREAL eugenics AI agenda elucidated by Timnit Gebru<a>1</a>  foretells a worrying, broader dehumanization campaign ahead. As does the ongoing systematic removal and censorship of any kind of diversity, trans rights or related language on government sites. These actions inexorably lead to the detention and removal of targeted people, which, sadly, has begun.</p>
<p>This moment calls for pausing, ignoring the external chaos and looking within, to our own guiding north stars and speaking out for the values within us that reflect deep truths. Deep truths such as: love and celebration of diversity being vital for both humankind’s and the planet’s survival; it’s certainly vital for the work that we do every day at ISL.</p>
<p>Diversity, equity, and inclusivity are the way. Any other exclusionary, reductive, oppressive, dehumanizing way is antithetical to the truths of human kinship and interdependence and denies the reality that healthy ecosystems need diversity to sustain and thrive.</p>
<p>ISL exposes safety risks inherent in tech when used as intended. In other words, we’ve been establishing reasonable safety standards for the behavior of software-driven products and services. But how can we contemplate “safety” without the necessary question: “for whom?”</p>
<p>Many people think that ISL is solely focused on the safety of tech used by children. It may surprise you to know that that’s not our mission. It’s the brunt of our currently funded work, but our corporate vision is:</p>
<p>“A world where all digital products are safe for humans and humankind.”</p>
<p>In other words, safety for all. </p>
<p>I take this moment to reaffirm ISL’s commitment to prioritizing and fostering conditions to create a truly diverse, inclusive, and equitable organization.</p>

  By layering End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) on cloud storage services ourselves, we can ensure that our data is protected from unwanted access, even from the storage services themselves.

 <p>Recent developments in the UK have once again highlighted the importance of user-controlled encryption for protecting personal data. Due to government demands in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617273/apple-removes-encryption-advanced-data-protection-adp-uk-spying-backdoor?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Apple has recently announced</a> that they have stopped offering end-to-end encrypted iCloud storage, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), to new users, and will disable the feature to all users in the country at an unknown point in the future.</p><p>What does this mean for you?&nbsp;</p><p>In the short term it means that UK user data is less protected, and potentially vulnerable to misuse or breaches. Without end-to-end encryption (E2EE), data stored in iCloud is accessible to Apple and, by extension, potentially to government agencies and bad actors. In the long term it sets a dangerous precedent that Apple can turn off this crucial security feature for any group of users at any time, raising concerns about digital privacy worldwide.</p><p>What can we do about it?</p><p>The answer is relatively simple, we need to encrypt our own data.&nbsp;</p><p>Relying on a third party to keep our personal data safe — even big names like Apple, Amazon, or Microsoft — will always carry risk. Policies change, and external governmental pressures can force providers to weaken security measures, leaving the user exposed.</p><p>By layering End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) on cloud storage services ourselves, we can ensure that our data is protected from unwanted access, even from the storage services themselves (in case they want to mine the content of our data).</p><p>And the best part? We can do it for free by using DIDComm!</p><p>What is DIDComm?</p><p>One powerful and open-source solution for encrypting data before cloud storage is the <a href="https://didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm</a> protocol. Hosted by the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), DIDComm provides a secure, private communication methodology built on Decentralized Identifiers (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDs</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>When used to establish an end-to-end encrypted channel, DIDComm ensures that only essential delivery metadata remains in plaintext, while everything else — including the body, attachments, etc — is encrypted for intended recipients only. In practice, this means that we can use the DIDComm message format to encrypt files as they are prepared to be synchronized from a local folder to the cloud storage service and ensures that only the intended recipient (you) can access them.</p><p>How to use DIDComm for cloud encryption</p><p>Steve McCown, Chief Architect at Anonyome Labs, was the first to create a practical method for encrypting files with DIDComm before storing them into the cloud. His recent <a href="https://github.com/mccown/protecting-cloud-storage?tab=readme-ov-file&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">GitHub release</a> provides a thorough breakdown of how it all works and offers a step-by-step guide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For those looking to dive deeper,&nbsp;</p>  Join one of our upcoming DIDComm <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-usergroup/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">user group calls</a>   Join the discussion on <a href="https://discord.gg/eNN4Wns6Jb?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF’s Discord</a> in the #didcomm-user-group channel

<p>Since 2018, the OpenID Foundation’s <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> and the global community have been developing standards to support Open Banking and Open Data. In “<a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GM-and-RAR-vs-Consent-API-OIDF-draft.pdf">Standardized and Fine-Grained Authorization with OAuth 2 Grant Management and Rich Authorization Requests</a>,” Dima Postnikov (OIDF Vice Chairman) and Gail Hodges (OIDF Executive Director) lay out how implementations around the world have contributed to improvements in the specifications over time and explain the FAPI WG recommendations related to <a href="https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-grant-management-ID1.html">OAuth2 Grant Management</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-grant-management-ID1.html">Rich Authorization Requests (RAR)</a> to enable fine-grained authorization.</p>
<p>Previously deployed ecosystems did not have an opportunity to use a standard-based approach in fine-grained authorization. This draft paper explains why the FAPI WG is encouraging new ecosystems to become early adopters of Grant Management and RAR.</p>
 
<p>What to do next:</p>
 
 Read the draft paper <a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GM-and-RAR-vs-Consent-API-OIDF-draft.pdf">here</a>. 
 
<p>Implementers interested in being early adopters of Grant Management and RAR should contact <a href="mailto:openid-specs-fapi-owner@lists.openid.ne">openid-specs-fapi-owner@lists.openid.net</a> to discuss the next steps.</p>
 
 
<p>More broadly, the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> is open to the public, and anyone can contribute at no cost by signing a contribution agreement. To learn more about FAPI or the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a>, visit <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">https://openid.net/wg/fapi/</a>, sign up for the mailing list, and attend WG meetings.</p>
 
 We also recommend that all current and new ecosystems join the newly established<a href="https://openid.net/cg/ecosystem-support-community-group/"> Ecosystem Community Group</a> to help the OIDF community provide ongoing support for ecosystem leaders.

 Introduction and&nbsp;Context Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>We Are Open Co-op (WAO) recently <a href="https://www.ndln.ie/new-learning-and-teaching-models">authored a report</a> for the Irish <a href="https://www.ndln.ie/">National Digital Leadership Network</a> (NDLN) on New Learning and Teaching Models. Our focus was on the transformative potential of micro and digital credentialing in recognising learning and achievements. Central to the approach we took is the concept of <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Open Recognition</a>, which seeks to acknowledge skills, talents, and experiences in ways that are inclusive and accessible.</p><p>Microcredentials has emerged as a popular term to refer to digital credentials including Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials. Confusingly, however, ‘microcredentials’ is sometimes used to simply mean a short online course. When approached thoughtfully, microcredentials are a flexible way to address skills gaps, support lifelong learning, and enhance employability. Across different sectors, from universities and businesses to NGOs and co-ops, they offer the potential to modernise how learning is recognised and celebrated. By focusing on inclusivity, transparency, and learner control, microcredentials align with the growing demand for education systems that reflect diverse needs and experiences.</p><p>This blog series draws on the insights from our NDLN report, exploring the historical roots of credentialing, the emergence of microcredentials, and the opportunities they present for reshaping education and professional development. Along the way, we’ll examine how microcredentials can address sector-specific challenges and offer practical steps for implementation.</p> What to Expect from This&nbsp;Series <p>Each post in this series will explore a key aspect of microcredentials, building on the foundations of Open Recognition and highlighting practical applications:</p>  Introduction and Context (this post) — Setting the scene for microcredentials, their principles, and potential across&nbsp;sectors.  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-2-985ab20a1176">The Evolution of Credentialing</a> — Tracing the journey from ancient recognition systems to modern microcredentials.  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-3-c3c956c09574">Demystifying Microcredentials</a> — Clarifying what microcredentials are, addressing misconceptions, and exploring best practices.  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-4-4a0811255a00">Trends Shaping the Future of Microcredentials</a> — Highlighting key developments, such as skills-based hiring and stackable learning pathways.  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-5-fde07efdcbd2">The Role of Technology in Microcredentialing</a> — Exploring the digital tools that make microcredentials possible, from open standards to&nbsp;AI.  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-6-fe96ea9be396">Challenges and Risks in Microcredentialing</a> — Examining barriers to adoption, including equity, quality assurance, and privacy concerns.  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-7-4ce87debec12">A Vision for the Future of Microcredentials </a>— Outlining actionable steps for organisations to harness microcredentials effectively.   Why Open Recognition Matters <p>At the heart of microcredentialing is recognition. Unlike more traditional approaches to credentialing, Open Recognition values learning in all its forms — formal, informal, and experiential. This principle underpins the idea that credentials should not only validate achievements but also inspire confidence, celebrate diversity, and enable lifelong learning.</p><p>What might this look like in practice?</p>  Charities — Acknowledging the efforts and skills of staff and volunteers, highlighting their contributions to social&nbsp;causes.  NGOs — Validating the contributions of community workers and volunteers.  Co-ops — Recognising the informal skills and knowledge gained through collaboration.  Businesses — Verifying and showcasing employee skills, enhancing workforce development and adaptability.  Higher Education — Offering microcredentials that align with degree programmes while recognising non-traditional learning&nbsp;paths.  <p>Across all sectors, Open Recognition provides a lens for designing systems that are inclusive and meaningful.</p> Looking Ahead <p>In the next post, we’ll explore the evolution of credentialing, showing the rich history on which microcredentials build, and re-introducing the concept of Open Recognition. By examining how credentialing has evolved to meet societal needs, we’ll better understand the opportunities and challenges of the present&nbsp;moment.</p><p>Stay tuned for practical insights, examples, and strategies to help your organisation embrace microcredentials — whatever sector you’re working&nbsp;in.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-1-50b0fc77cd05">Reframing Recognition: Part 1</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>87% of companies have, or are in the midst of, rolling out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/08/15/david-cottingham-rf-ideas-implementing-passkeys/">passkeys</a>&nbsp;with goals tied to improved user experience, enhanced security, and compliance, according to the FIDO Alliance.</p>



 Key findings 



<p>Enterprises understand the value of passkeys for workforce sign-ins. Most decision makers (87%) report deploying passkeys at their companies. Of these, 47% report rolling out a mix of device-bound passkeys (on physical security keys and/or cards) and synced passkeys (synced securely across the user’s devices).</p>



<p>Organizations are prioritizing passkey rollouts to users with access to sensitive data and applications, including the three most commonly cited priority groups: Those requiring access to IP (39%), users with admin accounts (39%), and users at the executive level (34%). Organizations leverage communication, training, and documentation within these deployments to increase adoption.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/06/20/julianna-lamb-stytch-passwordless-authentication-methods/">Passkey deployments</a>&nbsp;are linked to significant security and business benefits. Respondents report moderate to strong positive impacts on user experience (82%), security (90%), help center call reduction (77%), productivity (73%), and digital transformation goals (83%).</p>



<p>Groups that do not have active passkey projects cite complexity (43%), costs (33%), and lack of clarity (29%) about implementation as reasons. This signals a need for increased education for enterprises on rollout strategies to reduce concerns, as there is a correlation between these perceived challenges and the proven benefits of passkeys.</p>

<p>List of recommendations</p>



<p>Recommendation 1: That the government prioritize digital trust in four areas critical to Canada’s leadership and the privacy, security and protection of our people and industries, including:</p>



 
 Digital Trust in Small and Medium Sized Businesses (SMBs) and E-Commerce; 



 Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory; 



 Digital Trust in Public Sector Modernization and Citizen Services; and 



 Digital Trust in Public Safety. 
 



<p>Recommendation 2: That the government recognize the necessity of embracing and prioritizing verification and authentication tools as part of its AI strategy.</p>



<p>Recommendation 3: That the government allocate the funding needed to support the adoption of digital trust tools to the benefit of government, businesses, and citizens alike.</p>



<p>Introduction</p>



<p>In today’s geopolitical and economic climate, Canada needs to urgently act to maximize economic security, growth and productivity — all of which depend on a foundation of trust. In an era where digital transactions drive commerce, investment, and public services, ensuring the authenticity of identities, data, and financial interactions is essential for stability and long-term success.</p>



<p>Without secure and privacy-respecting verification, businesses face higher fraud risks, increased compliance costs, and reduced consumer confidence. Investors and trading partners demand transparent, verifiable transactions and economic resilience, which depend on our ability to safeguard financial systems, facilitate secure trade, and unlock the full potential of AI-driven innovation. Strong verification systems are also key to removing barriers to interprovincial and international trade, ensuring Canadian businesses can compete in global markets with trusted credentials.</p>



<p>Yet, new threats to economic stability are emerging at an unprecedented pace. The spread of misinformation, AI-generated fraud, and identity theft undermines business operations, weakens consumer confidence, and creates vulnerabilities in financial markets. AI enables the rapid manipulation of information and identities, making it more difficult for organizations to verify legitimacy and protect against fraud.</p>



<p>Without urgent action, these challenges will erode trust, slow economic growth, disrupt financial systems, and weaken Canada’s competitive position. Labour mobility is also at risk—without trusted digital credentials, skilled professionals such as doctors, engineers, and tradespeople face delays in moving where needed most, affecting both businesses and public services.</p>



<p>Canada can drive economic security, labour mobility and digital trust by strengthening identity verification, authentication, and fraud prevention measures. By prioritizing trust as a national asset, we can enhance economic competitiveness, attract investment, and build a future where innovation thrives in a secure and resilient digital environment.</p>



<p>About DIACC</p>



<p>The Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) was created following the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review, with a goal to bring together public and private sector partners in developing a safe and secure digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>DIACC is committed to accelerating digital trust adoption and reducing information authenticity uncertainty by certifying services against its Pan-Canadian Trust Framework — a risk mitigation and assurance framework developed collaboratively by public and private sector experts that signals trustworthy design rooted in security, privacy, inclusivity, accessibility, and accountability.</p>



<p>Recommendations</p>



<p>Against this backdrop, DIACC offers three recommendations for the federal government:</p>



<p>Recommendation 1: That the government prioritize digital trust in four areas critical to Canada’s leadership and the privacy, security and protection of our people and industries, including:</p>



 
 Digital Trust in Small and Medium Sized Businesses (SMBs) and E-Commerce; 



 Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory; 



 Digital Trust in Public Sector Modernization and Citizen Services; and 



 Digital Trust in Public Safety.  
 



<p>Digital Trust in Small and Medium Sized Businesses (SMBs) and E-Commerce</p>



<p>Canada’s e-commerce sector is growing faster than ever due to emerging technology and changing customer habits. While this creates significant opportunities, it also presents challenges for small and medium businesses (SMBs), their partners, and customers. With a significant amount of business happening online, SMBs must navigate a growing competitive landscape of online security risks and earn customer trust to help unlock interprovincial and international growth opportunities. By prioritizing digital trust, Canada can foster a robust e-commerce environment that empowers SMBs, enhances consumer confidence, and boosts economic growth. Interoperable frameworks such as the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) foster digital trust by protecting personal electronic information as it travels across an organization, ensuring that e-commerce systems remain secure, adaptable, and trusted.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust and implementing authentication and verification tools, the government can help drive the following benefits:</p>



 
 enhanced customer trust and loyalty; 



 streamlined business processes by automating identity verification and reducing the need for manual checks; 



 faster, more efficient operations and reduced administrative costs, allowing businesses to allocate resources more effectively; 



 data minimization and the secure handling of personal information, increasing customer confidence; 



 a competitive advantage for Canada’s SMBs by helping them innovate and offer their customers new, secure digital services; and 



 a reduction in incidents of fraud, resulting in significant cost savings for businesses. These savings can be reinvested into other business areas, driving growth and innovation and improving overall business performance.  
 



<p>Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory</p>



<p>The finance and regulatory sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation. While the industry pioneers new technology and moves away from conventional platforms, it faces rising fraud, privacy breaches, and growing consumer skepticism fueled by misinformation, disinformation, and challenges verifying information in an AI-driven world. As a result, the government is encouraged to build on the existing regulatory framework and develop new regulations to facilitate secure digital transactions, including compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.</p>



<p>Further, digital trust and verification services will be critical as the government moves forward with its commitments to open-banking, with interoperability also being paramount as the federal framework and existing provincial frameworks work together. Similarly, the government has committed to reducing incidents of mortgage fraud and strengthening proof of borrower and title insurance, and digital trust and verification services can and should play a critical role in making that commitment a reality.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust, Canada can secure its financial systems and enhance competitiveness in the global economy. Interoperable frameworks like the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) ensure systems remain resilient, adaptable, and trusted.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Public Sector Modernization and Citizen Services</p>



<p>Public services are undergoing rapid digital transformation, adopting new technologies to improve efficiency and accessibility. At the same time, they face significant challenges and barriers including data security risks, privacy concerns, and public skepticism fueled by misinformation.</p>



<p>As public services continue to move online, digital trust and verification services will be critical for ensuring that services are secure and accessible. From online healthcare consultations to digital government services, these technologies provide the necessary security infrastructure to protect public interactions and data.</p>



<p>By implementing digital trust solutions, the federal government will be able to provide secure, user-friendly online access to services; streamline identity verification for faster service delivery; facilitate seamless data sharing between agencies; reduce administrative burdens and operational costs; and improve service delivery times and citizen satisfaction.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Public Safety</p>



<p>The public safety sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation, embracing new technologies to enhance emergency response, law enforcement, and disaster management. However, this shift also brings challenges such as data security risks, privacy concerns, and the need for reliable information verification in critical situations.</p>



<p>Implementing robust digital trust solutions can significantly improve emergency response by enabling secure, real-time data sharing between agencies; verifying the authenticity of emergency communications; and facilitating rapid and accurate identification of individuals in crisis situations.</p>



<p>Public safety agencies are encouraged to leverage technologies such as AI and blockchain to enhance their digital trust capabilities and improve emergency response. AI can be used for real-time data analysis and decision-making, while blockchain can ensure the integrity and immutability of critical information.</p>



<p>DIACC encourages collaboration between public safety agencies, technology providers, and other stakeholders to develop standardized digital trust practices, and interoperable frameworks like the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) ensure that public safety systems remain secure, adaptable, and trusted.</p>



<p>Together we can create a public safety ecosystem that leverages digital trust to protect citizens, respects privacy, and solidifies Canada’s position as a secure and effective emergency management leader.</p>



<p>Recommendation 2: That the government recognize the necessity of embracing and prioritizing verification and authentication tools as part of its AI strategy.</p>



<p>In today’s world, where AI is becoming smarter every day, and information can be generated and manipulated at unprecedented speed and scale, ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of information is critical. It is vital to maximize the benefits of an AI and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)-fueled data ecosystem for Canada while also fostering citizen trust and protecting their safety.</p>



<p>To effectively address the challenges we’re facing while realizing the benefits of AI, the federal government should prioritize verification and authentication tools as part of its broader AI strategy. Prioritization must include funding, collaboration, and urgent action to support the development, adoption and certification of tools that verify information authenticity while protecting privacy and empowering Canadians. Governments, banks, telcos, tech companies, media organizations, and civil society must work together to deploy open, standards-based solutions and services to verify the authenticity of information.</p>



<p>The economic imperative of investing in these capabilities is clear. According to a <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/services/consulting/perspectives/generative-ai-in-finance.html">study</a> by Deloitte, the Canadian economy could unlock an additional 7 per cent (CAD $7 trillion) in economic value through AI and AGI technologies. People and organizations can only realize this potential for the good of society by investing in tools, processes, and policies that support verifying the authenticity of the information generated and processed by AI and AGI technologies.</p>



<p>Recommendation 3: That the government allocate the funding needed to support the adoption of digital trust tools to the benefit of government, businesses, and citizens alike.</p>



<p>Today, solutions can signal verified trust by getting certified against a technology-neutral risk and assurance framework like DIACC’s Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, developed collaboratively by public and private sector experts.</p>



<p>Verifiable information authenticity relies on critical principles, including provenance and traceability: provenance establishes the origin and history of information, ensuring it comes from a reliable source, while traceability allows for audibility of the flow of information, enabling people, businesses, and governments to verify its accuracy and authenticity. These principles are essential in combating the spread of misinformation and disinformation, which can have far-reaching consequences in an AI-fueled world.</p>



<p>Provenance and traceability are potent information authenticity tools that can help:</p>



 
 businesses and professionals reduce liabilities and meet obligations to verify information about their clients and their operations; 



 citizens and residents interact securely and efficiently with governments; 



 customers and clients transact with privacy and security anywhere, anytime; 



 industries manage decision-making and securely supply chains using trusted data; 



 producers verify essential data related to environmental, safety, and operational goals and 



 creators track intellectual property to ensure fair payment and cultural protection. 
 



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>A proactive approach—rooted in collaboration between government, industry, and technology leaders—will ensure that Canada remains a trusted hub for global trade, seamless labour mobility, and secure financial transactions. We can unlock new economic opportunities, strengthen international partnerships, and fuel long-term prosperity by enabling frictionless and verifiable trade, business, and employment interactions.</p>



<p>Thank you once again for the opportunity to provide our input in advance of Budget 2025 and as we collectively move forward on the path to a digitally and economically prosperous Canada.</p>

<p>March 11, 2025</p>



 Current Landscape 



<p>Canada’s e-commerce sector is growing faster than ever due to emerging technology and changing customer habits. While this creates significant opportunities, it also presents challenges for small and medium businesses (SMBs), their partners, and customers. With significant business happening online, SMBs must navigate a growing competitive landscape of online security risks and earn customer trust to help unlock interprovincial and international growth opportunities.</p>



<p>When DIACC was established in 2012, its mission was to create a secure digital ecosystem. Today, this goal has become even more critical for the e-commerce sector, particularly for SMBs striving to scale up and remain competitive in a global market.</p>



<p>Digital trust, which empowers individuals, governments, and businesses with secure and transparent ways to engage online confidently, has become critical for businesses that want to assure customers that their interactions and personal data are secure.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust, Canada can foster a robust e-commerce environment that empowers SMBs, enhances consumer confidence, and boosts economic growth. Interoperable frameworks such as the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™ (PCTF) foster digital trust by protecting personal electronic information as it travels across an organization, ensuring that e-commerce systems remain secure, adaptable, and trusted.</p>



 <a></a>Advancing Digital Trust to Fuel E-Commerce Growth and Empower SMBs 



 1. Strengthening SMB Competitiveness and Growth 



<p>Implementing robust digital trust solutions is crucial for SMBs to compete in e-commerce. By adopting these technologies, SMBs can:</p>



 
 Enhance customer trust and loyalty 



 Reduce fraud-related losses 



 Streamline operations and reduce costs 



 Expand into new markets more confidently 
 



 <a></a>2. Enhancing Trust Through the DIACC PCTF 



<p>DIACC encourages e-commerce businesses to adopt the PCTF as a tool to:</p>



 
 Implement secure and efficient customer onboarding processes 



 Authenticate identities to reduce fraud in online transactions 



 Improve supply chain management through verified digital credentials 
 



 <a></a>3. Fostering Consumer Confidence 



<p>To address consumer skepticism and promote trust in e-commerce platforms, we recommend:</p>



 
 Implementing clear, user-friendly privacy policies 



 Adopting visible trust signals, such as PCTF certification badges 



 Providing transparent data handling practices 
 



 <a></a>4. Enabling Seamless Cross-Border Transactions 



<p>Digital trust frameworks can help SMBs expand into other Canadian provinces and internationally by:</p>



 
 Facilitating secure cross-border identity verification 



 Ensuring compliance with various regional regulations 



 Building trust with customers and partners across Canada and internationally 
 



 <a></a>5. Leveraging Digital Trust for Innovation 



<p>SMBs can use digital trust solutions to:</p>



 
 Implement personalized shopping experiences that are secure and privacy-respecting 



 Develop trusted AI-powered customer service tools 



 Create innovative loyalty programs based on verified identity information 
 



 <a></a>Best Practices and the Way Forward 



 <a></a>1. Adopt Existing and Emerging Technologies 



<p>SMBs should leverage existing and emerging digital trust solutions that align with the PCTF. PCTF certification fosters verified trust across smart devices, digital credentials, wallets, and information-sharing networks. It will enhance their capabilities and ensure their competitiveness.</p>



 <a></a>2. Collaborate for Standardization 



<p>DIACC encourages collaboration between SMBs, larger enterprises, and regulators to establish standardized digital trust practices in e-commerce.</p>



 <a></a>3. Educate and Empower 



<p>DIACC is committed to educating SMBs and consumers about digital trust through:</p>



 
 Hosting sector-specific workshops and certifications to promote best practices in digital trust 



 Real-world case studies demonstrating the benefits of digital trust in e-commerce 



 Advocacy for regulations that support SMBs in implementing digital trust solutions 
 



 <a></a>Conclusion 



<p>The e-commerce sector, particularly SMBs, urgently needs robust digital trust solutions to thrive in the digital economy. By adopting frameworks like the PCTF, SMBs can enhance their competitiveness, build consumer trust, and drive innovation.</p>



<p>Together, we can create an e-commerce ecosystem that empowers SMBs, protects consumers, and solidifies Canada’s position as a leader in the global digital marketplace.</p>

The initiative builds on the&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/microsoft-announces-shift-from-passwords-to-passkeys-for-enhanced-security/">FIDO Alliance standards</a>&nbsp;that these companies have been developing since 2019.</p>



<p>The initiative, which began with a joint announcement by the three tech giants in 2022, has now reached full implementation across all major platforms. Users can access passkey functionality through their devices’ built-in biometric systems, enabling seamless authentication across various services and applications. Microsoft has recently announced plans to&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/microsoft-to-replace-passwords-with-passkeys-for-1-billion-users-amid-200-surge-in-cyberattacks/">implement passkeys for over one billion users</a>&nbsp;in response to a 200 percent increase in cyberattacks.</p>

 &nbsp;FIDO as the Future of Authentication:&nbsp;Traditional password-based systems are vulnerable to phishing, credential stuffing, and other cyberattacks. FIDO (Fast Identity Online) uses public key cryptography to deliver phishing-resistant, passwordless authentication. 



 Implementation Roadmap:&nbsp;Organizations should assess current authentication methods, educate stakeholders, select FIDO-compatible solutions, and roll out the technology gradually to maximize security and user adoption. 



 Security Meets Usability:&nbsp;FIDO enhances security and simplifies the user experience with biometrics, hardware tokens, and multi-device passkeys, offering both protection and convenience.

<p>Do you think your trusty 8-character password is safe? In the age of AI, that might be wishful thinking. Recent advances in artificial intelligence are giving hackers superpowers to crack and steal account credentials. Researchers have demonstrated that AI can accurately&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/08/ai-could-identify-passwords-by-sound-of-keys-being-pressed-study-suggests">guess passwords just by listening to your keystrokes</a>. By analyzing the sound of typing over Zoom, the system achieved over 90% accuracy in some cases.</p>



<p>And AI-driven password cracking tools can run millions of guess attempts lightning-fast, often defeating weak passwords in minutes. It is no surprise, then, that stolen or weak passwords contribute to about 80% of breaches​.</p>



<p>The old password model has outlived its usefulness. As cyber threats get smarter, it is time for consumers to do the same.</p>

<p>By Omar Santos, Distinguished Engineer, Cisco</p> 


<p>On March 25, 2025, the <a href="https://eucyberact.org/">EU Cyber Acts Conference</a> in Brussels will bring together cybersecurity professionals, policy-makers, and industry leaders to discuss one of the most pressing challenges of our time—securing artificial intelligence. Several members of the Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI) will be participating and presenting at the conference. A key highlight of the conference is the “<a href="https://eucyberact.org/aicyberday/">AI Cyber Day</a>” track, which zeroes in on the global evolution of cybersecurity certification frameworks tailored for AI systems.</p>



 Securing AI Applications and Agentic Systems 



<p>I’m truly honored to be among such a distinguished lineup of speakers, presenting “<a href="https://eucyberact.org/session/securing-ai-navigating-security-challenges-in-modern-ai-implementations-m02b/">Securing AI: Navigating Security Challenges in Modern AI Implementations</a>.” I am excited to share insights on the evolving threats and best practices for securing AI systems! In this session, we will unpack the layered security considerations inherent to today’s AI implementations. Attendees will be guided through the best practices surrounding AI operations (AI Ops), model development, fine-tuning, and deployment of AI applications. Emphasis will be placed on well-known techniques such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and how to secure innovative agentic systems (methods that represent the forefront of modern AI security strategies).<br><br>The session also introduces the<a href="https://www.coalitionforsecureai.org/"> Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI),</a> an open project that is bringing experts from industry-leading organizations dedicated to sharing best practices for secure AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>CoSAI’s focus is to better equip the community to fortify the AI supply chain, equip defenders for emerging threats, secure agentic AI systems, and promote robust security risk governance frameworks.

<p>Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping the Internet, driving a historic transformation in how we engage, work, and communicate online.</p><p>However, the rise of generative AI has also led to an explosion of deepfakes, hallucinating language models, and the rapid creation of untrustworthy content — threatening the foundation of authentic communication and learning. AI-generated content now dominates the internet, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish reality from fabrication.</p><p>While AI unlocks significant advancements, it also introduces equally substantial risks, from intellectual property infringements to illegal content, such as child sexual abuse materials.</p><p>It is for this reason, we founded umanitek.</p><p>At umanitek, our mission is to fight against harmful content and the risks of AI by promoting technology that serves the greater good of humanity.</p><p>Our founders, Trace Labs, Ethical Capital Partners and AMYP Ventures AG (part of a Piëch/Porsche Family Office) bring together their capabilities in building reliable and trusted AI systems, their connection to networks that fight for the removal of internet harm, and their ability to raise awareness of the importance of knowledge and education in the age of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>But this is too big of a challenge to go at it alone. Recognizing the magnitude of this issue, we actively seek partnerships with institutions and individuals dedicated to ethical AI development. We want to partner with investors who are focused on “tech for good” solutions where societal impact is of equal importance to commercial success and to work with tech leaders, policymakers, and law enforcement to make internet safety the standard in the age of&nbsp;AI.</p> Balancing innovation with responsibility in the age of&nbsp;AI. <p>Our vision is to leverage umanitek’s technology to enable corporations and individuals to control their data, technology, and resources without compromising security, privacy, or intellectual property.</p><p>Here’s but one quick example of how umanitek will&nbsp;work.</p><p>Far too many people are concerned about the non-consensual sharing of their personal images or those of their children. Umanitek will enable companies, law enforcement, NGOs, and individuals to upload “fingerprints” of personal photos to a decentralized directory. This system will help large technology platforms identify and prevent the distribution of such&nbsp;content.</p><p>In the potential next step, it also significantly streamlines the prosecution of offenders by collaborating with law enforcement while reducing the cost and complexity of legal action related to copyright infringements.</p><p>When organizations and individuals can choose what to share and how to share it in a secure and verifiable way, all internet users benefit. Protecting legitimate content and preventing large language models from training on non-consensual data are integral to harm reduction online. We believe this is an important step to making internet safety the standard in the age of AI, reducing harmful content, and enabling trusted AI solutions.</p><p>Fighting the good&nbsp;fight.</p><p>“We invested in OriginTrail to drive transparency and trust for real-world assets. Now, we’ve co-founded umanitek to combat harmful content, IP infringements, and fake news — leveraging OriginTrail technology across internet platforms.”</p><p>— Chris Rynning, AMYP Ventures AG (part of a Piëch/Porsche Family&nbsp;Office)</p> An unprecedented alliance for ethical&nbsp;AI. <p>Umanitek stands out by combining the expertise of three leaders in their&nbsp;fields:</p><p>Trace Labs (core developers of OriginTrail) — The pioneers of neuro-symbolic AI, building trusted and verifiable AI systems. They are the developers behind the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), a technology that enhances trust in AI, supply chains, and global data ecosystems.</p><p>Ethical Capital Partners (ECP) — A private equity firm seeking out investment and advisory opportunities in industries that require principled ethical leadership. Founded in 2022 by a multi-disciplinary team with legal, regulatory, law enforcement, public engagement, and finance experience, ECP’s philosophy is rooted in identifying companies amenable to a responsible investment approach and working collaboratively with management teams in order to develop strategies to create value and drive&nbsp;growth.</p><p>AMYP Ventures AG (part of a Piëch/Porsche Family Office) — A venture capital group backing game-changing AI and Web3 initiatives with the potential for global&nbsp;impact.</p><p>This is a collaboration that combines the knowledge of AI, cutting-edge research, and technology with ethical investment strategies to create the standard for internet safety in the age of AI — an AI solution that will serve humanity.</p><p>Subscribe for updates at <a href="http://umanitek.ai">umanitek.ai</a> to stay in touch and be among the first to learn about cofounders, contributors, and partners of umanitek, as well as reserve a spot to test-drive umanitek’s products at their&nbsp;release.</p><p><a href="http://umanitek.ai">Web </a>| <a href="https://x.com/umanitek">Twitter </a>|&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/umanitek">LinkedIn</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/umanitek-setting-the-standard-for-internet-safety-cd5a91f142f3">UMANITEK: Setting the standard for internet safety</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Boston, MA, and New York, NY, USA; 6 March 2025 – <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS Open</a>, a global open source and standards organization, and the <a href="https://dataandtrustalliance.org/">Data &amp; Trust Alliance</a>, a consortium dedicated to developing data and AI practices that create business value and earn trust, announced the upcoming launch of the OASIS Data Provenance Standards Technical Committee (DPS TC). Building on <a href="https://dataandtrustalliance.org/work/data-provenance-standards">version 1.0.0</a> of the Data Provenance Standards created by the Data &amp; Trust Alliance’s cross-industry Working Group, the TC will bring more enterprises to the table to create de jure technical standards that aim to advance data transparency, accountability, and trust. Founding sponsors include Cisco, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, and Red Hat.&nbsp;<br><br>“The Data &amp; Trust Alliance has done exceptional work in developing the Data Provenance Standards, and OASIS is privileged to partner with them to expand the community actively developing and implementing these standards,” said Jim Cabral, Interim Executive Director of OASIS Open. “By advancing these standards in our open, consensus-driven environment, we ensure their continued evolution, interoperability, and adaptability to meet evolving industry demands.”</p>



<p>With AI and data-driven decision-making now central to business operations, organizations require robust mechanisms to verify data lineage, transformations, and compliance. The DPS TC will develop a standardized metadata framework for tracking data origins, transformations, and compliance, helping businesses establish clearer governance practices. The TC will also define metadata models that span databases, tables, and data pipelines to ensure interoperability and reliability across different platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For AI to create value for business and society, the data that trains and feeds models must be trustworthy. Launching the Data Provenance Standard Technical Committee marks a milestone in fostering greater transparency and trust of AI-driven data,” said Saira Jesani, Executive Director, Data &amp; Trust Alliance. “We look forward to bringing the TC’s expertise to bear to not only refine these standards but also bridge the gap between standards and implementation, as we drive towards industry-wide adoption.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The standards will enable data producers to deliver clear and consistent data lineage information; support companies in managing compliance and mitigating risks associated with data privacy, security, and intellectual property rights; provide data acquirers with transparency around the data they aim to acquire and a mechanism to determine whether to trust and use the data on offer, request changes to the data set, or reject its use; and help end-users by providing transparency into how their data is managed and protected, fostering trust in data-driven solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DPS TC’s first meeting will be held on 8 April 2025. Participation in the DPS TC is open to all through <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/join-a-tc/">membership in OASIS</a>. Organizations, industry leaders, and experts are encouraged to join and actively contribute to these data provenance standards that will shape the future of transparent and trusted data governance.

<p>Support for the Data Provenance Standards Technical Committee:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cisco:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I applaud the OASIS community for its forward-thinking creation of the Data Provenance Standards TC. By creating standardized descriptors at the point of data creation, we are forging a path that empowers organizations to safeguard data integrity, security, and privacy throughout its entire lifecycle. This is essential for both AI-driven and traditional applications. These standards will not only enhance transparency and accountability, but also lay the foundation for robust, cross-industry data governance.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>–Omar Santos, Distinguished Engineer at Cisco, OASIS Board Member</p>



<p>IBM:</p>



<p>“IBM is proud to build on its partnership with the Data &amp; Trust Alliance to become a founding member of the OASIS Data Provenance Standards Technical Committee. As a contributor to the Data &amp; Trust Alliance’s Data Provenance Standards, we are pleased that the DPS TC will evolve the critical work of advancing data transparency started by the Data &amp; Trust Alliance. We look forward to helping organizations accelerate the business impact of AI through trust in our work with the DPS TC.”</p>



<p>–Christina Montgomery, Vice President and Chief Privacy &amp; Trust Officer, IBM</p>



<p>Microsoft:</p>



<p>“Security and Trust remain at the top of mind while Microsoft executes its mission of empowerment. We promote and demand this ethos while developing operationally efficient and trustworthy AI systems. To do this successfully, we believe that full transparency into the data used including where it comes from, how it’s created, and whether it can be used legally is of extreme importance. As a founding member of the Data Provenance Standard Technical Committee (DPS TC), Microsoft will partner with similarly committed organizations towards creating industry standards for ensuring that AI systems are built with transparency, accountability, and trust through establishing data provenance standards as a foundation for improved data governance. Through membership and partnership in the DPS TC, Microsoft continues its commitment to empower every person and every organization on the planet to do more…securely.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>–Raghu Ramakrishnan, CTO for DATA, Technical Fellow, R&amp;D Azure Data, Microsoft</p>



<p>Red Hat:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Red Hat is proud to join the OASIS Data Provenance Standard Technical Committee. With AI rapidly evolving, it’s crucial we address the provenance challenge, together as a community, to help maintain data integrity and user trust. Red Hat is eager to collaborate on keeping security and compliance measures at the forefront of AI development, and we look forward to how this initiative will help unify our efforts toward an open and trusted&nbsp;AI ecosystem.”</p>

 As global electricity demand soars and renewable energy expands, the IEA highlights the urgent need for digital solutions to optimize grid flexibility. Here’s how Energy Web’s Digital Spine can&nbsp;help <p>The International Energy Agency recently released two reports: <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/0f028d5f-26b1-47ca-ad2a-5ca3103d070a/Electricity2025.pdf">its annual Electricity 2025</a> analysis and a discussion of current <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/6fbf940a-d4e8-4156-b8e0-07c2f793c094/BuildingtheFutureTransmissionGrid.pdf">challenges in grid investment</a>. These documents describe two key aspects of the global energy transition: global demand for electricity is increasing, and new renewables (including distributed energy resources) are expected to be the greatest contributor to new supply that meets it. If you dig a bit deeper, you can also see why the electricity system needs a Digital Spine, Energy Web’s solution to optimize grid flexibility and unlock the potential of&nbsp;DERs.</p> The energy transition continues <p>The IEA forecasts “soaring” electricity demand over the next three years. Most of this increase will occur in developing economies, but advanced economies are expected to see increasing demand as well, driven by electric vehicle adoption, new air conditioners, heat pumps, and (especially in the U.S.) new data&nbsp;centers.</p><p>This new demand will be met by new low-carbon generation. The IEA expects fully half of the new demand to be met by solar PV, the cost of which continues to&nbsp;decline.</p> But progress increases complexity <p>It is undoubtedly excellent news that low-carbon generation will meet new demand, but the IEA cautions that power systems need to further adapt to the changing fuel mix on our grids. A combination of traditional thermal plants that are relatively inflexible, new renewable generation that is variable, and new demand patterns (e.g., more air conditioning demand on hot days and more electric vehicle charging on workday evenings) result in higher volatility in power&nbsp;markets.</p><p>We already see these impacts. The Electricity 2025 report describes the increasing incidence of negative prices in wholesale electricity markets, which occurs when supply outsizes demand so significantly that market-clearing prices fall below zero. This can happen for any number of reasons, but as the energy transition continues we would expect to see it happen more frequently in areas where afternoon solar generation could far exceed air conditioning demand (think massive amounts of rooftop and utility-scale solar) or overnight wind generation is greater than nearby transmission capacity.</p><p>Negative pricing events are most common in the regions of the world that are furthest along the energy transition, including Australia, California, and Texas (three places with very high solar PV or Wind penetration).</p>Percentage of negative hourly wholesale electricity prices in selected regions, 2019–2024 (IEA)<p>Negative price events are not in themselves a problem; however, they are noteworthy because they suggest real challenges in power system operations, which will only increase as the energy transition continues.</p> Physical infrastructure improvements will be insufficient <p>One strategy to address these challenges is to increase investments in electric grids. This means increasing transmission capacity and upgrading other physical infrastructure in order to reduce constraints that contribute to negative pricing: if one location has more power supply than demand, simply ship the excess to a location that can use it (yes, we recognize that this simplified description glosses over the complexities of constrained dispatch, but it remains true that increasing capacity in an appropriately-planned way will reduce the impacts of system constraints).</p><p>Unfortunately, the IEA does not think such new investments will be sufficient, or at least not sufficiently fast:</p><p>Around 1.5 million kilometres of new transmission lines have been built worldwide over the last decade, but inadequate transmission remains major constraint on power system development, electrification and energy security. Among other issues, grid infrastructure has struggled to keep pace with the rate at which new renewable sources are entering the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Their report describes several reasons for this, including supply chain bottlenecks and permitting delays — problems that are unlikely to recede in an era of increasing trade protectionism.</p> Managing power systems requires new ways to provide flexibility <blockquote>So if new transmission is insufficient, what is the solution? The IEA offers its perspective: “Optimising the use of existing grid infrastructure through digital technologies enhances efficiency and maximises the use of existing assets, providing a safety valve for networks and supply&nbsp;chains”</blockquote><p>This is precisely what our <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/electricity">Digital Spine</a> solution does: facilitate integration of DERs to allow grid operators and market participants to efficiently, fairly, and securely operate the grid. It can wring cost savings out of existing operational processes or even allow new market configurations that until now have not been feasible.</p><p>As an example of the latter, we implemented our Digital Spine solution in Australia as part of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO)’s Project Edge. In that project, AEMO and market participants demonstrated a new approach to integrating DERs into both transmission- and distribution-level operations: a two-sided market based on dynamic operating envelopes. An <a href="https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/initiatives/der/2023/project-edge-independent-cba-full-report.pdf?la=en">independent cost-benefit analysis</a> found that implementing this approach could save consumers AU$5–6 billion over twenty years, and that the savings would accrue to both consumers with DERs and those without them. A separate independent technology and cybersecurity assessment found that the Digital Spine as the underlying data exchange was more scalable, stable, resilient, flexible, and secure than traditional point-to-point or centralized approaches.</p><p>If you or your organization are looking to increase your network’s efficiency and unlock the full potential of DERs, please see our <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/electricity">Digital Spine</a> webpage for more information or to <a href="http://www.energyweb.org">contact&nbsp;us</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/why-the-grid-needs-a-digital-spine-insights-from-the-international-energy-agency-37922de54b3f">Why the Grid Needs a Digital Spine: Insights from the International Energy Agency</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 1. Overview 
<p>In 2024, Internet Safety Labs (ISL) added 3rd parties observed in app network traffic to our app Safety Labels viewable in <a href="https://appmicroscope.org/">AppMicroscope.org</a>. Recently, we reviewed the network traffic of the original 1541 apps, looking for data brokers and the results were clear: 16% apps that were recommended or required in schools were sending student data to registered data brokers. Every state (and District of Columbia) had at least three or more schools with apps communicating with data brokers. In total, 442 of the 663 (or 67%) studied schools had apps with data broker traffic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Importantly, “registered” data brokers don’t count apps sending data to platforms destined for data brokers, nor does it include entities that should be registered data brokers but aren’t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This report details our findings and analysis on Edtech apps observed communicating with data brokers, as well as our recommendations for educators and app developers. &nbsp;</p>
 1.1 The Inadequacy of “Data Broker” Legal Definitions&nbsp; 
<p>This analysis counts only registered data brokers found in either the <a href="https://cppa.ca.gov/data_broker_registry/">California Data Broker Registry</a> or the <a href="https://bizfilings.vermont.gov/databrokersearch/Search">Vermont Data Broker Registry</a>.<a>1</a> Readers should be aware that the legal definition of “data broker” in the US fails to properly account for and hold responsible the full data supply chain feeding data brokers. Specifically, it fails to include:&nbsp;</p>
 
 First parties who sell personal information, such as mobile carriers who were found as recently as last year to be selling some of the most sensitive of personal information, location data<a>2</a>.&nbsp; 
 Entities who sell or share personal in bulk for marketing and advertising purposes, including identity resolution platforms (IDRPs) and&nbsp; customer data platforms (CDPs), both designed to ingest and synthesize personal data from a multitude of services/platforms<br>
a. This also includes adtech entities including Supply Side Platforms (SSPs), ad exchanges, Demand Side Platforms (DSPs), and Data Management Platforms (DMPs). These entities aggregate personal data shared via the real-time bidding (RTB) messages (aka “bidstream”). Note that these entities figured prominently in the recent Gravy Analytics analysis<a>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>Thus, we must assume that the volume of student data making its way into data brokers is substantially larger than this analysis conveys.&nbsp;</p>
 1.2 Methodology&nbsp; 
<p>In 2022, ISL conducted a privacy audit on recommended and required technologies for students in a representative sample of K-12 schools across the US. In total, ISL examined 1541 mobile apps, including analysis of the network traffic between the app, the first party, and all third-party servers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, ISL researchers determined the corporate owner of every subdomain that appeared in the network traffic collected for the apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we determined if the corporate owner was a registered data broker by matching against companies in the California and Vermont data broker registries; note that this reflects data broker registries as of 2024.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 2. Findings<br>
 
 2.1&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall 
<p>243 apps or 15.8% of tested apps sent data to registered data brokers. The 243 apps sending data to data brokers communicated with a shocking 6.7 data brokers on average. This means that when children use these apps, their information will be sent to several data brokers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The top app categories sending data to data brokers were:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 News apps (77% of audited news apps)&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Reference apps (37%)&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sports apps (32%), and&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Community Engagement Platform (CEP) apps (26%).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>News, reference and sports apps are not surprising; news apps are known to be rife with adtech and martech. See Figure 7 for all category counts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As noted in all three previously published <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/resources/reports/2022-us-k12-edtech-benchmark/">findings reports</a>, Community Engagement Platform apps were among the leakiest apps observed. The CEP developers with apps found to be communicating with data brokers are shown in Table 1.</p>

<p><br>
Of the larger CEP developers (Apptegy, Finalsite, and Intrado), it’s clear that the apps’ configurability is influencing the presence of data brokers since not all of the apps were found to be communicating with data brokers. Finalsite, for example, provides an administrative dashboard that allows school districts to edit the URLs opened by the app. In 2021, ISL spoke with Blackboard (Anthology), then-owner of the Finalsite apps, and learned that the platform performed no checking on the domains entered by school administrators. We suggested that they add guardrails, checking for things like dangling or malicious domains, at a bare minimum. Finalsite acquired Anthology from Blackboard in September 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Palm Beach County School District Android app (a CEP app) by Intrado included the most data brokers, at a whopping 31. (See also the Safety Label for the app here: <a href="https://appmicroscope.org/app/1579/">https://appmicroscope.org/app/1579/</a>) The app is no longer available on the Google Play store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Table 2 shows the five apps with the most data brokers from 2022 and from a recent retesting. Two of the apps have been removed from the store, but the other three are the same or worse with respect to the number of data brokers.&nbsp;</p>

2.2&nbsp; &nbsp;EdTech&nbsp; 
<p>As discussed in <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2022-k12-edtech-safety-benchmark-national-findings-part-1.pdf">Findings Report 1</a>, the majority of apps from the benchmark weren’t strictly edtech apps; the benchmark included a surprising number of non-edtech, general use apps. Isolating edtech categories, we find that only 6 apps (2.0%) of the strictly edtech apps had observed traffic to data brokers. While this is substantially better than the overall sample rate, for these kinds of services, there should be no data brokers receiving data from the apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

2.4&nbsp; &nbsp;State-based Observations 
<p>Data brokers were found in apps in every state and the District of Columbia. That is, every state sample of 13 schools had at least one school with at least one app with data broker traffic. Figure 1 shows how many schools from the 2022 benchmark had apps that were sending traffic to data brokers. 13 schools were sampled in each state, so the heatmap reflects up to 100% (i.e. all 13 schools) having apps with traffic to data brokers. Texas, Wisconsin and Louisiana each had apps with data brokers in all 13 studied schools.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Number of schools in state sample with at least one app with data broker traffic (13 schools max per state)</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the total number of apps with data broker traffic for each state sample of 13 schools. The states with the most apps with data broker traffic were Maryland, Kansas, and Minnesota.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: Total number of apps with data broker traffic</p>
<p>We hypothesize that the likelihood of apps with data broker traffic is mainly related to the sampled schools’ propensity to recommend a higher number of technologies to students. The correlation between the number apps with data brokers and the total number of apps was moderately strong at .69. Figure 3, the heatmap showing the total number of apps recommended by the 13 sampled schools in each state, indeed shows similarities (Texas, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Maryland, in particular).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3: Total number of apps per state</p>
<p>We were interested to see if there was any obvious correlation between state privacy laws and the number of data brokers observed. Figure 4 shows states with student data privacy laws. Indeed, three of the nine states that don’t have student data laws, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Maryland, each had high numbers of apps with data broker traffic, and all 13 schools in Wisconsin had apps with data broker traffic. While inconclusive with respect to causation, the correlation warrants future study. It’s also possible that the absence of a state student data privacy law encourages a higher number of technologies being recommended to students in schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 3. Recommendations 
 
 
 
 
 1) App developers: Apps or websites used by children should never send data to data brokers. They should also not send user data to customer data repositories
 
 
 
 a) Community Engagement Platform App Developers
 
 ISL is calling on the community engagement app developers shown in Table 1 to immediately update all of their apps to remove all data brokers. 
 We also call upon CEP app developers to install better guardrails in the administrative portal, minimally performing automated checking for dangling and malicious domains. Ideally, also disallowing or flagging any commercial sites with trackers (like MaxPreps), alerting school administrators of the risks of such sites with respect to student data sharing. 
 ISL recommends that schools not use CEP apps until they have demonstrated significant improvement in dangerous data sharing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2) Schools, Educators, and Concerned Parents: While it’s 100% the responsibility of the app developer to ensure that their apps and websites are safe for children, schools may need to be the ones demanding removal of data brokers. To help you do this, we’ve updated our app safety labels to clearly identify the number of data brokers in the app (Figure 6).&nbsp;Educators, school IT personnel and concerned parents can look up the app safety label for any app that they’re recommending to students. If it includes data brokers, stay away from the app. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can’t find your app? <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/contact-us/">Contact us</a> and we’ll be happy to audit a new app or re-audit an existing app.

 Join us for two upcoming events as we help map the contours of the landscape Image created by Laura Hilliger based on the work of Angela Gunder, remixed from work by Doug Belshaw&nbsp;🤘<p>What is “digital literacy”? That was the topic of my <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/thesis">doctoral thesis</a>, which argued for a plurality of literacies, contextually applied from eight “essential elements.” When submitting my thesis, I insisted on using the least restrictive license possible (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/">CC0</a>), as I wanted to encourage one of its central tenets:&nbsp;remix.</p><p>That’s why I’m delighted WAO is embarking on a collaboration with Dr Angela Gunder of <a href="https://openedculture.com/">Opened Culture</a> and her work on the <a href="https://openedculture.com/projects/dimensions-of-ai-literacies/">Dimensions of AI Literacies</a>. Angela’s thoughtful remix and extension of my&nbsp;work:</p><blockquote>“Rather than viewing literacy as a singular skill, the Dimensions of AI Literacies embrace a pluralistic perspective, recognizing that individuals can develop and apply a range of interconnected competencies. AI literacies encompass the skills needed to comprehend, utilize, and critically evaluate AI within complex environments. As educators, learners, and leaders engage with AI, they must navigate both the technical aspects of AI tools and the ethical, cultural, and social implications of their use. AI literacies enable individuals to make informed decisions, adapt AI tools to different contexts, and ensure that applications of AI in academic settings are ethical and inclusive.” (Opened&nbsp;Culture)</blockquote><p>We have two upcoming (and free!) online events. The first is part of <a href="https://openeducationweek.org/">Open Education Week</a> and the second forms part of (US) <a href="https://www.ailiteracyday.org/">National AI Literacy Day</a>.

<p>A Snapshot of Passkey Deployments for Employee Sign-ins in the U.S. and UK</p>



 Key findings 



 
 Enterprises understand the value of passkeys and the majority are rolling out passkeys for workforce sign-ins: The majority have either deployed or are in the midst of deploying passkeys with goals tied to improved user experience, enhanced security, and standards/regulatory compliance. Those that are deploying are rolling out a mix of device-bound and synced passkeys.&nbsp; 



 Enterprises are prioritizing passkey rollouts to users with access to sensitive data and applications, and are leveraging communication, training and documentation to increase adoption. 



 Enterprises are reporting significant security and business benefits after rolling out passkeys: they report positive impacts on user experience, security, cost reduction, productivity and digital transformation goals — and are seeing declines in usage of legacy authentication methods. Interestingly, these benefits directly correlate with what businesses who aren’t yet using passkeys dislike most about their current authentication methods: that they can be compromised, are costly, and difficult to use.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Organizations that do not have active passkey projects cite complexity, costs and overall lack of clarity about implementation as reasons, signaling a need for increased education to enterprises on rollout strategies to reduce concerns.

<p>Respondents report positive impacts on user experience, security, productivity, and cost reduction from deploying a mix of device-bound and synced passkeys</p>



<p>February 26, 2025 — <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">The FIDO Alliance</a> along with underwriters <a href="https://www.axiad.com/">Axiad</a>, <a href="https://www.hidglobal.com/">HID</a>, and <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">Thales</a> today released its State of Passkey Deployment in the Enterprise report, finding that 87% of surveyed companies have, or are in the midst of, rolling out passkeys with goals tied to improved user experience, enhanced security, and compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report is the result of an independent survey commissioned in September 2024 by the FIDO Alliance Enterprise Deployment Working Group, with underwriting support from Axiad, HID, and Thales, to understand the state of passkey deployments in the U.S. and UK; the methods used to deploy passkeys and enroll employees; and the perceived barriers to deployment. Read the report at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/research-state-of-passkey-deployment-in-the-enterprise-a-snapshot-of-deployments-employee-sign-ins-us-uk">https://fidoalliance.org/research-state-of-passkey-deployment-in-the-enterprise-a-snapshot-of-deployments-employee-sign-ins-us-uk</a>.</p>



<p>The survey revealed four key findings:</p>



 
 Enterprises understand the value of passkeys for workforce sign-ins. A majority of decision makers (87%) report deploying passkeys at their companies. Of these, 47% report rolling out a mix of device-bound passkeys (on physical security keys and/or cards) and synced passkeys (synced securely across the user’s devices). 



 Organizations are prioritizing passkey rollouts to users with access to sensitive data and applications, including the three most commonly cited priority groups: Those requiring access to IP (39%), users with admin accounts (39%) and users at the executive level (34%). Within these deployments, organizations are leveraging communication, training, and documentation to increase adoption. 



 Passkey deployments are linked to significant security and business benefits. Respondents report moderate to strong positive impacts on user experience (82%), security (90%), help-center call reduction (77%), productivity (73%), and digital transformation goals (83%).&nbsp; 



 Groups that do not have active passkey projects cite complexity (43%), costs (33%), and lack of clarity (29%) about implementation as reasons. This signals a need for increased education for enterprises on rollout strategies to reduce concerns, as there is a correlation between these perceived challenges and the proven benefits of passkeys. 
 



<p>“This study is equally encouraging and illuminating as it points to strong willingness and commitment to deploy passkeys to employees – and also is informative in helping FIDO shape resources that we can deliver to help enterprises around the world more quickly and effectively implement their FIDO authentication strategies,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewshikiar/">Andrew Shikiar</a>, CEO and executive director of the FIDO Alliance. “Passkeys can stop AI-generated social engineering attacks in their tracks while also increasing employee productivity and reducing costs associated with help desk support and security breaches. FIDO Alliance is committed to helping more companies around the world realize these benefits by providing actionable passkey implementation guidance and best practices, which this data will help define.”</p>



<p>New phishing and fraud attempts are being used every day, driven in particular by widespread generative AI use. As reflected in the report, enterprise leaders are becoming aware of the limitations of compromisable passwords, and seeing the value of deploying the most secure and user-friendly authentication methods possible. These insights will be leveraged to further remove the perceived and/or real barriers around passkey adoption so more enterprises can experience their benefits on a global scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learn More During FIDO’s March 6 Webcast&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance will host a webcast on March 6, 2025 at 8am PST to provide further insights into the report methodology, the findings and next steps. The webcast will feature <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeljthelander/">Michael Thelander</a>, senior director of product marketing at Axiad; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-bj%C3%B6rk-0b2b679/">Katie Björk</a>, director of communications and solution marketing at HID; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahlefavrais/">Sarah Lefavrais</a>, Authentication devices product marketing director at Thales, along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-shamas-127b046/">Megan Shamas</a>, chief marketing officer of the FIDO Alliance. Register <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/event/passkey-adoption-workforce-trends-considerations">here</a>.</p>



<p>Michael Thelander, Axiad’s director of product marketing, thinks the survey results will deliver not just interesting data, but will also provide a path for FIDO2 to become a first class citizen alongside other forms of PKI-based authentication in the enterprise. “Passkey technology has not only matured, but this survey reveals how identity practitioners and strategists are beginning to integrate passkeys with their other workforce authentication methods, across different platforms and device types, to deliver what identity architects and users both want: strong authentication that doesn’t place a ‘friction ‘tax’ on the last step of accessing systems and networks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“HID, in collaboration with fellow FIDO Alliance members, launched this survey to gain insights into the priorities of enterprise and security leaders that drive successful passkey implementation. We also aimed to identify the challenges other organizations encounter when integrating FIDO technology into their authentication strategies. HID’s overarching goal is to empower organizations to meet their business objectives by eliminating one of their most significant obstacles: user experience and security challenges linked to passwords,” says Katie Björk, Director of Communications and Solution Marketing.</p>



<p>“Thales is excited to collaborate with the FIDO Alliance for this research, which underscores the growing adoption of passkeys for employee sign-ins,” said Haider Iqbal, Director Product Marketing IAM at Thales. “We’re seeing similar interest from our customers, who recognize the benefits of FIDO authentication for both security and productivity. Thales is committed to enabling organizations to migrate their workforce and customers to passkeys, helping them stay ahead of the curve with secure, seamless and frictionless digital journeys for all users.”</p>



<p>Survey Methodology:</p>



 
 The survey was conducted among 400 decision makers who would be / are involved in passkey deployment in companies with 500+ employees across the UK and the US. 



 The interviews were conducted online by Sapio Research in September 2024 using an email invitation and an online survey. 



 At an overall level results are accurate to ± 4.9% at 95% confidence limits assuming a result of 50%. 



 The survey was produced by the FIDO Alliance Enterprise Deployment Working Group, with underwriting support from Axiad, HID, and Thales. 
 



<p>About the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

<p></p>      The Digital Future of Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG)           <p>Privacy-Preserving Traceability with Digital Product Passports &amp; Data Spaces Interoperability</p>
          <p>The Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry is undergoing a rapid transformation. Consumers demand accountability and sustainability—<a href="https://www.bazaarvoice.com/blog/cpg-research/">over 70% want detailed product information</a>—while new regulations like the EU’s <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation_en">Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation</a> (ESPR) and the <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/forced-labor/UFLPA">Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act</a> (UFLPA) reshape the landscape. Big data leaks and supply chain disruptions have become the norm. As regulations grow increasingly stringent, consumer trust falters, and operational costs skyrocket, a paradigm shift is essential. The industry needs verifiable, trusted data seamlessly integrated — and a system that enables seamless, permissioned data exchange across the value chain.</p>
<p>Digital Product Passports (DPPs) are a key component of this transformation. A DPP is a secure, globally unique digital record that stores verifiable information about a product throughout its lifecycle—from raw materials to disposal. Widespread adoption of DPPs is critical for building trust, strengthening value chain resilience, and ensuring regulatory compliance. According to the EU, <a href="https://data.europa.eu/en/news-events/news/eus-digital-product-passport-advancing-transparency-and-sustainability">which now requires DPPs</a> for nearly all products sold in the EU, “the DPP is designed to close the gap between consumer demands for transparency and the current lack of reliable product data.”</p>
<p>However, DPPs alone are not enough. To truly unlock their potential, we need a standardized framework for data spaces interoperability—a system that enables direct, seamless transactions between participants across industries. Modern value chains involve collaboration among thousands of stakeholders, including enterprises, regulators, and consumers. When these value chains function efficiently, they improve product quality, optimize resource allocation, and lower costs. Yet, despite technological advancements, achieving this level of coordination remains a challenge.</p>
<p>Introduction to MOBI’s Web3 Infrastructure </p>
<p>Today, many organizations rely on third-party platforms and proprietary applications for data exchange, resulting in fragmented, siloed systems. This lack of interoperability limits collaboration and hinders critical processes, from ensuring product safety and ethical sourcing to enabling proper recycling and end-of-life management. Recognizing this, <a href="https://dlt.mobi/about/">MOBI was formed in 2018</a> as a neutral convener for organizations to develop standards and infrastructure for DPPs and data spaces interoperability. <a href="https://dlt.mobi/web3-infrastructure/">MOBI’s Web3 Infrastructure</a>, comprising <a href="https://dlt.mobi/citopia/">Citopia Decentralized Marketplace</a> (DM) and the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/">Integrated Trust Network</a> (ITN), offers a secure, decentralized marketplace framework with standardized communication protocols. Think of it as a private internet, wherein entities can engage in secure, autonomous, encrypted transactions.</p>
<p>Citopia DM and the ITN are built for <a href="https://dlt.mobi/ssdi/">Self-Sovereign Data and Identity</a> (SSDI). Each participant owns and manages their own <a href="https://dlt.mobi/passport/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twin</a> (SSDT), which stores two things: </p>
 
 a globally-unique <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier</a> (DID), which is anchored and validated in the ITN 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) used for transactions in Citopia DM  
 
<p>This SSDT allows participants to engage in standardized, secure, and compliant transactions on Citopia DM with selective disclosure (data only goes to intended recipients). Both Citopia and ITN are system and cloud-agnostic, meaning stakeholders can seamlessly communicate while retaining their existing systems and web services. This removes the need for costly one-off integrations and eliminates prohibitive onboarding/maintenance costs, providing a robust foundation for data spaces interoperability.</p>
<p>Citopia DM unlocks new possibilities for DPPs by enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions between value chain participants. Removing reliance on third-party intermediaries lowers costs, increases traceability, and drives compliance with emerging regulatory requirements. Companies leveraging MOBI’s infrastructure can streamline operations, reduce data silos, and improve their ability to meet evolving consumer and regulatory demands. For regulators and consumers of CPGs, Citopia DM offers easy access to trusted DPPs issued by companies. For regulators, this makes it easy to verify compliance claims. For consumers, access to DPPs can inspire confident purchasing decisions and boost brand loyalty. </p>
<p>Laying the Foundation for Generative AI Applications </p>
<p>MOBI is going to take this one important step further. The robust infrastructure it has built not only addresses the critical need for tracebility and data exchange but also lays the foundation for powerful generative AI applications. By leveraging the rich, contextual data housed within DPPs and the seamless data flow facilitated by Citopia and SSDTs between rich data spaces, generative AI can move beyond generic analyses to provide participant-specific value. Imagine a scenario where:</p>
 
 Consumers can interact with generative AI agents to understand the complete lifecycle of a product they are considering purchasing. These agents, equipped with DPP data accessed through Citopia, can answer nuanced questions about a product’s sustainability footprint, ethical sourcing, or even detailed ingredient breakdowns, generating responses tailored to the individual consumer’s values and concerns. For example, a consumer with specific dietary restrictions or sustainability preferences could ask a generative AI agent: “Show me the carbon footprint and allergen information for the ingredients in this cereal, and suggest alternatives with lower environmental impact and no nuts.” The agent, accessing the DPP via Citopia, can generate a personalized, privacy-preserving response, drawing from verified data and offering actionable recommendations. 
 CPG Companies can utilize generative AI to optimize their operations and gain deeper market understanding. Generative AI agents can analyze aggregated and anonymized DPP data from across the value chain within Citopia to identify supply chain inefficiencies, predict potential disruptions, or personalize marketing campaigns with unprecedented precision. For instance, a generative AI agent could analyze DPP data to recommend optimal sourcing strategies based on real-time insights into material availability, ethical considerations, and environmental impact, while ensuring compliance with regulations like UFLPA. Furthermore, generative AI can assist in generating customized sustainability reports or proactively flag potential regulatory compliance issues based on DPP data, streamlining operations and reducing risks. 
 Regulators can employ generative AI agents to efficiently monitor and verify compliance with evolving regulations like the ESPR. These agents can be granted permissioned access to DPP data within Citopia, enabling them to automatically audit product information against regulatory requirements and identify potential non-compliance issues at scale. Generative AI can generate summaries of compliance status across product categories or highlight specific areas needing further investigation, significantly enhancing regulatory oversight and consumer protection. 
 
<p>The key to enabling these generative AI applications lies in the architecture of MOBI’s Web3 infrastructure. SSDTs with secure identities backed by the ITN ensure that each participant retains control over their data, can choose what data to disclose (and to whom), and can securely exchange verifiable data in a regulatory-mandated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_architecture">Zero Trust Architecture</a>. </p>
<p>Generative AI agents operating within this framework can be designed to access and process data in a privacy-preserving manner. For example, they can utilize techniques like differential privacy or federated learning to generate insights from aggregated DPP data without needing to access or expose the raw, sensitive data of individual participants. Selective disclosure of VCs ensures that only authorized agents receive the necessary data points, minimizing the risk of data breaches or misuse.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This means that the combination of DPPs and interoperable data spaces facilitated by MOBI’s infrastructure and generative AI represents an entirely new business phase for the CPG industry. It moves beyond basic traceability to enable a future where data becomes a dynamic tool for generating participant-specific value, fostering deeper consumer trust, optimizing business operations, and ensuring robust regulatory compliance – all within a secure and privacy-respecting ecosystem. </p>
<p>MOBI’s Web3 infrastructure is, therefore, a game-changer for the CPG industry, offering a scalable, decentralized approach to data verification and interoperability while enabling participant-specific insights and recommendations using generative AI. As consumer expectations evolve and regulatory landscapes shift, embracing decentralized, self-sovereign solutions will be the key to sustainable growth and competitive advantage. The future of CPG lies in verifiable, trusted data, and MOBI is leading the way in building the infrastructure to support it.</p>

             The implementation of serialized labelling, which results from the current supplier conditions of Deutsche Bahn, poses great challenges for many suppliers in the railway sector. 
     

 
             <p>Questions such as "What do I have to mark and in what way?", "Where exactly does the code go?", "What exactly are GS1 standards?" or "Who will assure me that I am doing it correctly in the end?" are just some of the questions that companies are confronted with in the beginning of the project. This was no different for OHB Teledata GmbH. Here too, the company was faced with the decision of whether to tackle the issue internally and with an uncertain outcome or seek external help. In the end, they chose the support of the oneIDentity+ experts to successfully implement the project in an efficient and timely manner. This is the project report.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.oneidentity.com/learn/what-is-passkey-authentication.aspx">Passkey authentication</a>&nbsp;replaces traditional passwords with a pair of cryptographic keys—public and private. The private key stays on the user’s device, while the public key sits on the server. During login, the server issues a challenge that only the private key can solve, and the response gets verified using the public key. No passwords are transmitted or stored, which reduces the attack surface significantly. Password leaks and brute-force attempts become non-issues because there is no static secret to steal or guess.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.oneidentity.com/learn/what-is-fido-authentication.aspx">FIDO2</a>&nbsp;is a joint initiative by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) aimed at delivering streamlined, strong authentication without relying on passwords. It defines a set of technical components: WebAuthn and CTAP2 (Client to Authenticator Protocol). WebAuthn standardizes how a web application interacts with an authenticator—often a platform feature like a secure enclave on a phone or a hardware security key. CTAP2 governs how that authenticator communicates with the client device, such as a laptop or smartphone.</p>

<p>Public Review - ends March 24th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the LVCSP TC are pleased to announce that Lightweight Verifiable Schema Credential v1.0 CSD01 is now available for public review and comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This document defines a lightweight schema for Verifiable Credentials to support digital (also known as electronic) “Know Your Customer” (eKYC) processes, based on the W3C Verifiable Credential (VC) standards. Through adoption of this standard, individuals are able to share their verified identity claims across different digital platforms and services. This standard is referred to as a “Lightweight Verifiable Credential Schema,” abbreviated as LVCS, because it provides a basic schema and format, without significant options or conditions.</p>



<p>The documents and all related files are available here:</p>

<p>The Human Colossus Foundation (HCF) recently participated in the 2025 Geneva Winter Summit, a global gathering of AI experts, policymakers, and innovators hosted by the AI for Developing Countries Forum (AIFOD) at United Nation office at Geneva. The summit focused on AI’s potential for developing countries to drive equitable digital development, culminating in the AIFOD Geneva Winter Summit Declaration 2025, which charts a path for inclusive AI progress.</p><p>At the core of HCF’s contribution were two topics:</p>  <p>The importance of access to accurate data and its provenance in AI training especially for small and less digitalize nations.</p>  <p>The role of distributed governance in fostering ethical AI Agents ecosystems which can give the edge for developing countries without need to build massive data centers for huge AI models. </p>   The Power of Accurate Data and Provenance in AI Training <p>For AI to serve communities effectively, it require access to massive data sets, best localize to avoid biases and misinformation. Unfortunately a lot of developing countries does not have such access, in many cases digital transformation just starting. This allows them to better prepare for upcoming needs of the data, they can start already shaping digital policies and strategies to invest from day one towards more accurate data ecosystems which could give them the edge relaying more on quality then quantity. AI models trained on verifiable, and well-documented data would be more accurate in their functions. Data provenance—the ability to trace data back to its source—is essential for ensuring AI models are transparent, reliable, and compliant with global data standards but as well allowing citizens and countries to verify potential bias and misinformation in AI-generated insights.</p><p>At the summit, HCF emphasized how Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) principles enable organizations to structure and verify data origins, ensuring AI models are trained on high-quality, trustworthy inputs.</p><p>Why does data provenance matter?</p>  <p>Enables to build trust and accountability in AI decision-making</p>  <p>Helps organizations comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)</p>  <p>Prevents bias and misinformation in AI-generated insights</p>  <p>HCF advocates for data-oriented architectures, where individuals and businesses can validate their data before it is used to train AI, ensuring a more transparent and responsible ecosystem.</p> Distributed Governance: The Key to Ethical and Sustainable AI <p>Governance models must evolve to keep pace with AI’s rapid growth. Traditional centralized governance structures often struggle to provide the inclusivity and adaptability needed for cross-border AI systems.</p><p>At the summit, HCF promoted distributed governance model to help with classification standards, cross-jurisdictional ethical alignment, and enhanced data transparency. A meta-governance framework would equip stakeholders with accurate, verifiable, and accessible information, enabling informed AI adoption that aligns with local regulations and ethical values. By promoting fairness, transparency, and accountability, this framework supports a responsible, sustainable AI-driven digital economy.</p><p>How can distributed governance benefit AI ecosystems?</p>  <p>Inclusive decision-making – Empowering communities, businesses, and policymakers to shape AI’s future</p>  <p>Enhanced accountability – Avoiding centralized control that can lead to bias or exploitation</p>  <p>Interoperability across jurisdictions – Helping AI operate ethically across borders without conflicting regulations</p>  <p>Through distributed governance models, AI can serve global communities fairly, ensuring that technological advancements reflect a shared ethical and socio-economic vision.</p> The 2025 AIFOD Declaration: A Commitment to Inclusive AI <p>The Geneva Winter Summit Declaration 2025 serves as a blueprint for AI governance, highlighting the need for:</p>  <p>Equitable access to AI advancements for developing nations</p>  <p>A balance between regulation and innovation</p>  <p>Stronger international collaboration to ensure ethical AI deployment</p>  <p>HCF stands committed to advancing these goals through the Dynamic Data Economy, ensuring AI serves all communities equally, ethically, and sustainably.</p> Looking Ahead: HCF’s Vision for Ethical AI Development <p>The Human Colossus Foundation will continue advocating for accurate data management, distributed governance, and responsible AI adoption. Through collaboration with global stakeholders, we aim to shape AI ecosystems that prioritize transparency, inclusivity, and sustainability.</p>

 Digitale Nachweise und Identitäten – die Zeit ist reif! 



<p>26. November 2024</p>



<p>Im Change Hub Berlin</p>



<p>Hardenbergstraße 32, 10623 Berlin</p>

























<p>Am 26. November fand die Zweite Digital Society Conference (DSC2) im Change Hub in Berlin statt. Am 27. November fand im Rahmen der DSC2 ein Workshop zum Thema Organisationsidentitäten statt.</p>



<p>Wie im vergangenen Jahr lag der Schwerpunkt der DSC auf dem Thema Digitale Nachweise und Identitäten. In Keynote, Panels und interaktiven Worksessions wurden am 26.11.24 Genese und Rahmenbedingungen der europäischen digitalen Identitätslösung und der EUDI-Wallet erläutert und Fakten vermittelt. Auch sind wir der Frage nachgegangen, wie sich diese europäische Lösung im internationalen Kontext einordnet und was uns als Gesellschaft in den kommenden Jahren konkret erwartet. Denn die hoheitliche eID ist erst der Beginn einer schnellen und anspruchsvollen Entwicklung, in deren Folge auch Unternehmen eine digitale ID erhalten werden, um den Austausch von Daten und die Sicherheit der Identifikation von Entitäten zu gewährleisten.</p>



<p>An dieser Stelle danken wir den Referierenden, Panelisten und insbesondere unseren Förderern, ohne die wir die DSC2 nicht hätten realisieren können.&nbsp;</p>



 DSC2 – Workshop 26.11.24 







<p>Digitale Nachweise und Identitäten – sind Sie bereit?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jörg Fischer, Bundesdruckerei</p>



<p><a href="https://idunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DSC2-Keynote_JorgFischer.pdf">Download Keynote</a></p>







<p>Zu folgenden Themen bildeten sich Worksessions:</p>



 
 Anbindung von Kommunen und kleinen Unternehmen 



 Wiki Data /Organisationsidentitäten / Definition 



 ID-Diebstahl / Betrug 



 Geschäftsmodelle / Payment Integration 



 SDI-Initiativen außerhalb der EU / Interoperabilität 



 Killer-Applikationen für Europäische Wallet (EUDI-Wallet) 



 Und dann gab es noch eine Worksession unter dem augenzwinkernden Header „Dackel-Club“: Hier wurden Nutzungen und Anwendungen digitaler Identitäten diskutiert, die keine hoheitliche Identität benötigen. Zum Beispiel die Mitgliedschaft im Dackel-Club. Dies mag kurios klingen, doch wenn bedacht wird, dass mehr als 37 % der Bevölkerung der Bundesrepublik in Vereinen engagiert ist, so erscheint dieses Anwendungsfeld durchaus interessant, um Adaption und den Umgang mit Wallets voranzubringen. 
 



<p>Handout Wegweiser:</p>



<p>Schließlich wurde der Wegweiser Digitale Identitäten und Nachweise vorgestellt. Dieser ist Produkt der Zusammenarbeit innerhalb der Forschungsprojekte Sichere digitale Identitäten des BMWK (SDI) und steht nun zum Download zur Verfügung. Ziel des Wegweisers ist es, einen niederschwelligen Einstieg in die Begriffswelt digitaler Nachweise zu finden. Erläutert sind die Begriffe Wallet, digitale Identität, digitaler Nachweis, Signatur. Die Nutzung des Wegweisers ist frei.&nbsp;</p>

 DSC2 – Workshop 27.11.24 



<p>Am zweiten Tag der DSC2 fand ein Fachworkshop statt, der ganz dem Thema Organisationsidentitäten (OrgID) gewidmet war. Zunächst wurde in Vorträgen der aktuelle Sachstand präsentiert.&nbsp; Dieser diente als Grundlage für die anschließende Arbeit in zwei großen Fachgruppen, deren Ziel es war, insbesondere die offenen Fragen und Punkte zu den Themenkreisen Zugang, Datenaustausch und technische Ausgestaltung weiter zu spezifizieren.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Guest blog by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-bernstein-518688/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Greg Bernstein</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davelongley1/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dave Longley</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manusporny/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Manu Sporny</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimdhamilton/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Kim Hamilton Duffy</a></p><p>Following the IETF/IRTF Crypto Forum Research Group’s adoption of the BBS Blind Signatures and BBS per Verifier Linkability (“BBS Pseudonym”) specifications, this blog describes historical context and details of cryptographic pseudonyms, as well as the privacy features they enable.</p><p>The discussion of cryptographic pseudonyms for privacy preservation has a long history, with Chaum’s 1985 popular article “Security without identification: transaction systems to make big brother obsolete” (Chaum1985) addressing many of the features of such systems such as unlinkability and constraints on their use such as one pseudonym per organization and accountability for pseudonym use. Although Chaum’s proposal makes use of different cryptographic primitives than we will use here, one can see similarities in the use of both secret and “public” information being combined to create a cryptographic pseudonym.</p><p>Lysyanskaya’s 2000 paper (Lysya2000) also addresses the unlinkable aspects of pseudonyms but also provides protections against dishonest users. In addition they provide practical constructions similar to those used in our draft based on discrete logarithm and sigma protocol based ZKPs. Finally as part of the ABC4Trust project three flavors of pseudonyms were defined:</p>  Verifiable pseudonyms are pseudonyms derived from an underlying secret key.  Certified pseudonyms are certified pseudonyms derived from a secret key that also underlies an issued credential.  Scope-exclusive pseudonyms are verifiable pseudonyms that are guaranteed to be unique per scope string and per secret key.  Figure 1: Types of Pseudonyms<p>The BBS based pseudonyms in our draft are aimed primarily at providing the functionality of the pseudonym flavors 2 and 3 above.</p> How BBS is Fundamentally Better for Solving Dishonest Holder Fraud <p>Beyond the usual anti-forgery and tamper-evident protections that digital signatures provide, there are two different types of credential fraud that unlinkable credentials need to mitigate: third-party fraud and first-party fraud.</p><p>Third-party fraud is when one party uses another party's credentials without their knowledge or approval. This involves the theft of an honest holder's credentials.</p><p>First-party fraud is when a legitimate credential holder intentionally allows other parties to covertly use their credentials. This involves not the theft of credentials, but rather, a dishonest holder.</p><p>BBS signatures provides two different security features, one to address each of these cases:</p> 1. Holder Multifactor Authentication <p>This security feature binds a BBS credential to a particular secret that only the holder knows and that an honest holder will not share access to nor use of. When a holder presents a BBS credential, a verifier can require that the holder prove use of this secret, thereby enforcing this protection on the holder's behalf. This is an anti-theft mechanism for mitigating third-party fraud.</p><p>Note: This feature is sometimes called "holder binding", but it might be more accurately understood as "Holder Multifactor Authentication". This is because the holder is not themselves bound to the credential and it is not a mitigation for first-party fraud. It instead works like another MFA device does when performing authentication. If a dishonest holder shares that MFA device or an API to use it, then someone else can unlinkably present their credential (with the holder's approval -- perhaps even for a fee). Stopping dishonest holders from doing this is a significant challenge that involves locking down users' hardware and software – and a single failure in this scheme could potentially result in an unlimited number of unlinkable, fraudulent presentations. This feature is therefore not a protection for verifiers, but rather one for honest holders against theft. With this in mind, it can be implemented such that a holder is free to use software or hardware of their choice to provide the protection, without requiring specific approval from the issuer.</p> 2. Pseudonyms <p>This security feature binds a BBS credential to a secret that is constructed from inputs from both the holder and the issuer. When a holder presents a BBS credential, a verifier can require that the holder present a pseudonym that is based on this secret and a contextual identifier. Each time the same BBS credential is presented using the same contextual identifier, the pseudonym will be the same. This prevents a dishonest holder from covertly enabling an unlimited number of unlinkable presentations of their credential by any parties they authorize. It is an anti-cloning mechanism for mitigating first-party fraud.</p><p>Contextual identifiers can be any value, but need to be agreed upon between the verifier and the holder for a given use case. To give some examples for the presentation of credentials on the Web, a contextual identifier could be a URL like a Web origin (e.g., "<a href="https://website.example/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://website.example</a>"), a Web origin with a certain path (e.g., "<a href="https://website.example/groups/wind-surfing?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://website.example/groups/wind-surfing</a>"), or protocol-defined combination of a URL and a time range, allowing for pseudonyms to be "forgotten" or "rotated" after sufficient time has passed.</p><p>Note: Other credential schemes aim to mitigate first-party fraud by limiting the device and software that a holder chooses to engage with, sometimes referred to as "holder binding". With this approach, the holder's own device and software are trusted to be leveraged against them to constrain their behavior. This approach requires device and software allow lists, trust framework management, significant additional protocol security considerations, and ultimately means that the issuer chooses the holder's device and software (or provides them with a list of acceptable options from which they may choose). This has additional side effects, such as centralizing and vendor lock-in effects on the marketplace of devices and software. Finally, with this approach, it also only takes a single dishonest holder to thwart the protections of the device or software (that they have physical access to) to re-enable an unlimited number of unlinkable fraudulent presentations of a valid credential in the ecosystem. Catching this behavior after the fact logically requires being able to link presentations once again, one way or another, which would defeat the privacy aims of the scheme.</p> Overview: BBS Signature Bound Pseudonyms <p>The BBS signature scheme, the foundation for BBS Pseudonyms, is based on a three-party model:</p>  Signer (also known as issuer): Issues credentials&nbsp;  Prover (also known as holder or user): Receives credentials&nbsp;  Verifier: Validates proofs  <p>A prover obtains a BBS signature from a signer over a list of BBS messages and presents a BBS proof (a proof of possession of a BBS signature) along with a selectively disclosed subset of the BBS messages to a verifier.</p>Figure 2: Example of BBS Signature Flow<p>Each BBS proof generated is unlinkable to other BBS proofs derived from the same signature and from the BBS signature itself. If the disclosed subset of BBS messages are not linkable then they cannot be linked by their cryptographic presentation alone.</p>

<p>Note: the language used in this section is intentionally informal; for a more precise explanation of phrases like “…cannot be linked by their cryptographic presentation alone”, please see Lysya2000.</p>

<p>BBS pseudonyms extend the BBS signature scheme to “bind” a “cryptographic pseudonym” to a BBS signature retaining all the properties of the BBS signature scheme:</p>  &nbsp;A short signature over multiple messages  Selective disclosure of a subset of messages from prover to verifier  Unlinkable proofs.  <p>In addition BBS pseudonyms provide for:</p>  An essentially unique identifier bound to a signature/proof of signature whose linkability is under the control of the prover in conjunction with a verifier or group of verifiers. Such a pseudonym can be used when a prover revisits a verifier to allow a verifier to recognize the prover when they return or for the prover to assert their pseudonymous identity when visiting a verifier  Assurance of per-signer uniqueness, i.e., the signer assures that the pseudonyms that will be guaranteed by the signature have not been used with any other signature issued by the signer (unless a signature is intentionally reissued).  The signer cannot track the prover presentations to verifiers based on pseudonym values.  Verifiers in separate “pseudonym groups” cannot track prover presentations.   How BBS Pseudonyms Work  Overview <p>To realize the above feature set we embed a two part pseudonym capability into the BBS signature scheme. The pseudonym’s cryptographic value will be computed from a secret part, which we call the nym_secret and a part that is public or at least shared between the prover and one or more verifiers. The public part we call the context_id.&nbsp;</p><p>A simplified overview of this flow is shown in Figure 3:</p>Figure 3: Simplified overview of BBS Pseudonym flow Issuance <p>To bind a pseudonym to a BBS signature we have the signer utilize Blind BBS signatures and essentially sign over a commitment to the nym_secret. Hence only a prover that knows the nym_secret can generate a BBS proof from the signature (and also generate the pseudonym proof).</p><p>The prover chooses their (random) prover_nym and commits to it. They then send the commitment along with a ZKP proof that the prover_nym makes this commitment. The signer verifies the commitment to the prover_nym then generates the signer_nym_entropy and “adds” it to the prover_nym during the signature process. Note that this can be done since we sign over the commitment and we know the generator for the commitment.</p>Figure 4: Credential Issuance detailed flow<p>As in Lysya2000 we are concerned with the possibility of a dishonest user and hence require that that nym_secret = prover_nym + signer_nym_entropy be the sum of two parts where the prover_nym is a prover's secret and only sent to the signer in a blinding and hiding commitment. The signer_nym_entropy is “added” in by the signer during the signing procedure and sent back to the prover along with the signature.&nbsp;</p> Verification <p>The pseudonym is calculated from nym_secret and context_id using discrete exponentiation.</p>  nym_secret: A two-part secret combining:  prover_nym: Generated and known only by the prover  signer_nym_entropy: Contributed by the signer during signature    context_id: A public identifier that is shared between the prover and one or more verifiers  <p>This is similar to the computations in Lysya2000 and ABC2014. The pseudonym is presented to the verifier along with a ZKP that the prover knows the nym_secret and uses it and the context_id to compute the pseudonym value. A similar proof mechanism was used in Lysya2000. See chapter 19 of BS2023 for an exposition on these types of ZKPs.</p>Figure 5: BBS Pseudonym verification flow<p>See the appendix for a detailed diagram showing the complete BBS pseudonym issuance and verification flow.</p> BBS Pseudonym Example Applications  Certifiable Pseudonyms <p>Certifiable pseudonyms work as follows:&nbsp; the prover creates unique pseudonyms based on context_ids they choose. While the nym_secret is guaranteed unique to and by the issuer, the issuer never learns its value.&nbsp;</p><p>When using the pseudonym, the prover presents both the context_id and pseudonym to identify themselves, along with any attributes (messages) they choose to reveal. No one else without the nym_secret and signature can produce a proof that they “own” the pseudonym. The prover can create as many different, unlinkable pseudonyms by coming up with different values for the context_id.&nbsp;</p>Figure 6: In this example of Certifiable Pseudonyms, the prover chooses different a context_id per service they interact with Scope Exclusive Pseudonyms <p>With scope exclusive pseudonyms, the verifier or group of verifiers require the use of a specific context_id. This allows the verifier (or group of verifiers) to track visits by the prover using this credential/pseudonym. A verifier can limit data collection, i.e. data retention minimization, by periodically changing the context_id since the pseudonyms produced using different context_ids cannot be linked. For example a context_id like “mywebsite.com/17Nov2024” that changes daily means the verifier could only track visits daily.</p>Figure 7: Scope exclusive pseudonyms where verifiers, or groups of verifiers, require a specific context_id. In this example, scope is set a per-day level<p>Scope Exclusive Pseudonyms with Monitoring</p><p>Scope exclusive pseudonyms with monitoring enable regulated privacy in scenarios requiring third-party oversight. Consider a system for purchasing controlled chemicals: A prover with appropriate credentials uses a different pseudonym with each vendor. This prevents vendors from colluding on prices or learning secret formulas by tracking a prover's complete purchase history across different vendors. At the same time, for regulatory compliance and public safety, vendors must report all purchases to a monitor, including the pseudonym used and their vendor-specific context_id. The prover shares their nym_secret only with the monitor, allowing the monitor to link different pseudonyms to the same prover when necessary. This separation between nym_secrets and other credential-binding secrets is crucial - it enables regulatory oversight without introducing additional cross-tracking by vendors.</p>Figure 8: In this example, scope exclusive pseudonyms with monitoring are used to enable regulatory compliance while not reusing pseudonyms across vendors  A Short Selection of References   [Chaum1985] D.

             In partnership with OriginTrail and GS1 Switzerland, Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) has taken important steps to make train travel safer and more sustainable. 
     

 
             <p>Managing railways requires handling vast amounts of data from multiple operators—often in real time—creating operational complexity and risk. To address this challenge, SBB introduced a specialized EPCIS repository powered by the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG).</p><p>Already in production since 2021, this EPCIS repository—actively used by SBB and its partners—has demonstrated clear improvements in safety and sustainability. It enables seamless train tracking across the EU by querying a network of railway GS1 EPCIS repositories, supports advanced analytics for predictive maintenance of train wheels using IoT data, and facilitates the tracking of welding and maintenance events across the Swiss Federal Railways network with input from over 10 welding partners. Additionally, it enables event tracking for Forged Tongues, further enhancing operational reliability.</p>

<p>Thales has unveiled a new solution designed to streamline the deployment and management of FIDO security passkeys for large-scale implementations. The OneWelcome FIDO Key Lifecycle Management solution enables organizations to efficiently manage the complete lifecycle of FIDO keys while transitioning to passwordless authentication systems. The launch follows Thales’&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/thales-releases-new-passwordless-authentication-devices-102201/">previous efforts in passwordless authentication</a>, expanding their enterprise security portfolio.</p>



<p>The solution provides IT teams with comprehensive control over FIDO key management, from initial enrollment through to eventual revocation. By allowing IT departments to pre-register keys and handle lifecycle management tasks, the platform helps reduce the burden on end users while maintaining security standards. The approach supports recent&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fido-papers-explain-how-to-use-passkeys-in-the-enterprise/">FIDO Alliance guidelines for enterprise passkey implementation</a>, which emphasize the importance of streamlined deployment processes.</p>



<p>A key feature of the solution is its integration with Microsoft Entra ID through FIDO2 provisioning APIs, enabling organizations to pre-register Thales FIDO keys for their users. The integration is particularly relevant for enterprises using Microsoft 365, providing secure authentication capabilities from initial deployment. The feature arrives as Microsoft implements&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/microsoft-enforces-mandatory-mfa-across-enterprise-platforms-in-2024-2025-rollout/">mandatory multi-factor authentication across its enterprise platforms</a>.</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago, The Onion published this story:</p>
<p><a href="https://theonion.com/study-finds-paint-aisle-at-lowes-best-place-to-have-com-1819570652/">Study Finds Paint Aisle At Lowe’s Best Place To Have Complete Meltdown</a></p>
<p>Now it’s the vitamin aisle at CVS:</p>
 <p>Enshittification at work.</p> 
<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">coined</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>, he was talking about how online platforms such as Google, Amazon, and TikTok get shitty over time. Well, the same disease also afflicts many big retail operations, especially ones that flood their zones with discounts and other gimmicks, enshittifying what marketers call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience">“the customer experience” (aka CX)</a>.</p>
<p>Take the vitamin aisle, above. The only people who will ever get down on all fours to read the yellow tags near the floor are the cursed employees who have to creep the length of the aisle putting them there.</p>
<p>For customers, the main cost of shopping at CVS is cognitive overhead. Think about—</p>
 
 All those yellow stickies 
 All the slow-downs at check-out when you wave your barcode at a reader, punch your phone number into a terminal, or have a CVS worker to do the same 
 All the conditionalities in every discount or “free” offer that&nbsp; isn’t 
 All the yard-long receipts, such as this one: 
 
<p></p>
<p>And the app!</p>
<p>OMFG,&nbsp; all we really need the damned app for is the one CVS function our life depends on: the pharmacy.</p>
<p>To be fair, the app doesn’t suck at the basics (list of meds, what needs to be refilled, etc.). But it does suck at helping you take advantage of CVS’s greatest strength: that there are so many of them. <a href="https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/CVS%20Pharmacy-USA/">Specifically</a>,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/CVS%20Pharmacy-USA/"></a></p>
<p>While that’s down a bit from<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/241544/cvs-caremark-number-of-stores-since-2005/"> the peak</a> in 2021, CVS is still the Starbucks of pharmacies. And while they are busy <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/money/12573233/cvs-cutting-thousands-jobs-technology/">laying off people while investing in tech</a>, you’d think they would at least make it easy to move your prescription from one store to another, using the app.&nbsp; But noooo.</p>
<p>What the app is best for is promotional crap. For example, this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Look at the small gray type in the red oval:&nbsp;198 coupons!</p>
<p>After I scroll down past the six Extrabucks Rewards (including the two above), I get these:</p>
<p></p>
<p>First, who wants a full-priced item when it seems damn near everything is discounted?</p>
<p>Second, you’d think after all these years of checking out with my Extracare barcode, and the app shows me (under “Buy It Again”) all the stuff I’ve purchased recently, that CVS would know I am a standard-issue dude with no interest in cosmetics. So why top the list of coupons with that shit? I suppose it’s to make me scroll down through the other 178 coupons to find other stuff I might want at a cheaper price.</p>
<p>I just did that and found nothing. Why? Because most of the coupons are for health products I already bought or don’t need. (I’m not sick right now.) Also, almost all of the coupons (as you see) expire three days from now.</p>
<p>Now think about the cognitive and operational overhead required to maintain that whole program at CVS. Good gawd.</p>
<p>And is it necessary? At all? When you’re the Starbucks of pharmacies?</p>
<p>Without exception, all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program">loyalty programs</a> like this one are coercive. They are about trapping and milking customers.</p>
<p>But do stores need them? Do customers? Does CVS?&nbsp; Really? When its customers are already biased by convenience.</p>
<p>Pro Tip: Real loyalty is earned, not coerced.</p>
<p>Want your store, or your chain, to be loved? Take some lessons from the most loved chain in the country: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_Joe's">Trader Joe’s</a>. In a chapter of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">The Intention Economy</a> called “The Dance,” I list some reasons why TJ’s is loved by its customers. My main source for that list is <a href="https://www.consciouscapitalism.org/people/doug-rauch">Doug Rauch</a>, the retired president of TJ’s, where he worked for 31 years. Here are the top few:</p>
 
 They never use the word “consumer.” They call us “customers,” “persons,” or “individuals.” 
 They have none of what Doug calls “gimmicks.” No loyalty programs, ads, promotions, or anything else that manipulates customers, raises cognitive overhead or insults anyone’s intelligence. In other words, none of what marketing obsesses about. “Those things are a huge part of retailing today, and have huge hidden costs,” Doug says. (I think the company’s biggest marketing expense is its float in the Rose Parade.) 
 They never discount anything, or say anything is “on sale.” Those kinds of signals add more cognitive overhead. TJ’s wants customers not just to assume, but to know. A single price takes care of that. 
 They have less than no interest in industry fashion. TJ’s goes to no retail industry meetings or conferences, belongs to no associations, and avoids all settings where the talk is about gaming customers. That’s not TJ’s style because that’s not its substance. 
 They believe, along with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cluetrain.com/book/markets.html">Cluetrain</a>, that markets are conversations—with customers. Doug told me his main job, as president of the company, was “shopping along with customers.” That’s how he spent most of his time. “We believe in honesty and directness between human beings…We do this by engaging with the whole person, rather than just with the part that ‘consumes….We’ll even open packages with customers to taste and talk about the goods.” As a result, “There’s nothing sold at Trader Joe’s that customers haven’t improved.” 
 
<p>Then there’s what Walmart CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Scott_(businessman)">Lee Scott</a> told me in 2000 (at <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2010/09/03/3250/">this event</a>) when I asked him “What happened to K-Mart?” From The Intention Economy:</p>
<blockquote><p>His answer, in a word, was “Coupons.” As Lee explained it, K-Mart overdid it with coupons, which became too big a hunk of their overhead, while also narrowing their customer base toward coupon-clippers. They had other problems, he said, but that was a big one. By contrast, Wal-Mart minimized that kind of thing, focusing instead on promising “everyday low prices,” which was a line of Sam Walton’s from way back. The overhead for that policy rounded to zero.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which brings me to trust.</p>
<p>We trust Trader Joe’s and Walmart to be what they are. In simple and fundamental ways, they haven’t changed. The ghosts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Coulombe">Joe Coloumbe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Walton">Sam Walton</a> still run Trader Joe’s and Walmart. TJ’s is still the “irreverent but affordable” grocery store Joe built for what (in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Trader-Joe-Business-Still/dp/1400225434/">his book</a>) Joe called “the overeducated and underpaid,” and based in Los Angeles. Walmart is still Sam’s five-and-dime from Bentonville, Arkansas. (Lee Scott told me that.)</p>
<p>CVS’s equivalent to Joe and Sam was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_P._Hoagland_III">Ralph Hoagland</a>, a good friend of good friends of ours in Santa Barbara. All of us also shared history around Harvard and Cambridge, where Ralph lived when he co-founded CVS, which stood for Consumer Value Store, in 1963. In those days CVS mostly sold health and beauty products, cheaply. I remember Ralph saying the store’s main virtue was just good prices on good products. Hence the name.</p>
<p>CVS can do a much better job of signaling bargain prices by just making them as low as possible, on the model of Trader Joe’s and Walmart.</p>
<p>I think there is also a good Health position for CVS: one that bridges its health &amp; beauty origins and its eminence as the leading pharmacy chain in the U.S. And it&nbsp;could&nbsp;rest on trust.</p>
<p>I’m thinking now about tech. Specifically, FPCs, for First-Person Credentials. Read what Jamie Smith says about them in his<a href="https://www.customerfutures.com/p/the-most-important-credentials-youve"> Customer Futures</a> newsletter under the headline <a href="https://www.customerfutures.com/p/the-most-important-credentials-youve">The most important credentials you’ve never heard of</a>. Also check out—</p>
 
 What I wrote last year about <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/10/15/identity-as-root/">Identity as Root</a> 
 What <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/celebrating-innovation-winners-of-the-dif-hackathon-2024/">DIF is doing</a> 
 What <a href="https://ayra.forum/">Ayra</a> is doing 
 Other stuff you’ll be hearing about first-person credentials (but isn’t published yet) when you come to <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">the next IIW (April 8-10)</a>. 
 What you’ll be learning soon about re-basing everything (meaning every SKU, as well as every person) on a new framework that is far more worthy of trust than any of the separate collections of records, databases, and namespaces that currently divides a digital world that desperately needs unity and interop—especially around health. And::: 
 MyTerms, which is the new name for<a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/"> IEEE P7012</a>, the upcoming standard (for which I am the working group chair) that should become official later this year, though nothing prevents anyone from putting its simple approach to work. 
 
<p>MyTerms can be huge and world-changing because it flips around the opt-out consent mechanisms that have been pro forma since industry won the industrial revolution and metastasized in the Digital Age. With MyTerms, the sites and services of the world agree to your terms, not the other way around. With MyTerms, truly trusting relationships can be established between customers and companies. This is why I immodestly call it <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">the most important standard in development today</a>.</p>
<p>So I have five simple recommendations for CVS, all to de-enshittify corporate operations and customer experiences:</p>
 
 Drop the whole loyalty thing. Completely. Cold turkey. Hell, fire the marketing department. Put the savings into employees you incentivize to engage productively (not promotionally) with customers. And publicize the hell out of it. Should be fun. 
 Confine your research to what your human employees learn directly from their human customers. 
 Be the best version of what you are: a great pharmacy/convenience store chain that’s still long in health and beauty products. 
 Simplify the app by eliminating all the promotional shit, and by making it as easy as possible for customers to move prescriptions from one&nbsp; CVS store to another. 
 Watch what’s happening with first-person credentials and MyTerms. Getting on board with those will make CVS a leader, rather than a follower. 
 
<p>Coupon-clipping addicts may feel some pain at first, but if you market the new direction well—making clear that you have “everyday low prices” rather than annoying and labor-intensive discounts (many of which expire in three days), customers will come to love you.</p>

<p>William Parducci was recently honored as a <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2025/02/05/oasis-open-cup-awards/">2024 OASIS Distinguished Contributor</a>. Since beginning his journey with OASIS in 2000, Bill has been a key player in advancing open standards and open source solutions. In this Q&amp;A, Bill reflects on his experiences, the challenges of fostering voluntary adoption of open standards, and his vision for the future of the industry.</p>



<p>What inspired you to get involved with OASIS and contribute to open source and open standards?<br>I joined OASIS in 2000. At the time, I was working on some large, open enterprise projects where my team was trying to introduce Linux and Apache as the basis for a solution. Despite the resistance to open source software back then, it was clear to me that openly developed, community-driven technology could dramatically increase adoption by making these solutions more accessible.</p>



<p>I discovered OASIS while working on an automotive industry initiative to standardize XML as a data transmission protocol. Seeing that need overlap with the “open source” philosophy—particularly for security—really resonated with me.</p>



<p>Can you share a defining moment or achievement in your work at OASIS that you’re especially proud of?<br>The release of XACML 1.0 is something I’m particularly proud of. There was significant involvement from major technology companies, but at the same time, there was a lot of hesitation toward open source and a strong desire to protect intellectual property. Our ability to address those concerns and still create a specification that laid the groundwork for robust authorization policies demonstrated the feasibility of developing meaningful open standards while respecting the IP concerns of all stakeholders.</p>



<p>What challenges have you encountered in advancing open standards, and how have you overcome them?<br>The most significant challenges I’ve faced involve voluntary adoption. In scenarios where conformance to a specification is mandatory, the process is more straightforward; however, when adoption is voluntary, it requires greater foresight and buy-in from management.</p>



<p>To address this, I’ve demonstrated how open standards can reduce future integration costs, streamline migrations between products, and deliver long-term business value. Over the years, I’ve learned that simply having a standard in place isn’t always sufficient to convince upper management—rather, it’s often seen as an expense that must be justified before it’s fully accepted.</p>



<p>How do you see the role of open standards evolving in the next five to ten years?<br>I’m optimistic on many fronts. Government agencies and international cooperatives will continue to benefit from open standards because there are countless areas—almost endless, really—where a common lingua franca is generally advantageous.</p>



<p>However, in the “identity” space, I’m slightly less optimistic. For instance, I’m a huge fan of SAML and often advocate for its elegant, consistent approach in corporate environments. But in the “public” space, I see OAuth variants continuing to grow as identity management consolidates around the largest technology providers. While OAuth is “open,” implementations have forked, with each provider customizing it for their own needs.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to new contributors looking to make an impact in the OASIS community?<br>Focus on something you’re passionate about that goes beyond your immediate work requirements. In my experience, those who contribute in this way tend to come up with the most inspired and innovative solutions—and often spot potential flaws that others miss.</p>



<p>Beyond your work with OASIS, what other projects or innovations in technology are you passionate about?<br>Although I’m passionate about security-related technologies, my time in the market research industry sparked a keen interest in semantic analysis. That interest has only grown with the rapid advancement of AI. In just a few years, we’ve gone from locally implementing open source tools such as Gensim on our own machines to leveraging 100B+ parameter models through simple API calls. It’s been incredible to witness.</p>



<p>What does receiving this Distinguished Contributor award mean to you personally and professionally?<br>Professionally, I’m honored to be recognized for my efforts to promote open solutions. On a personal level, it’s gratifying because it acknowledges the time and effort I devoted to the TC, even when my corporate responsibilities lay elsewhere.</p>



<p>Is there anything else you’d like to share with the OASIS community?<br>I have really enjoyed my time working with the OASIS team as well as those on the TCs. To say that it’s a varied set of characters would be an understatement, then to see the common desire to create something that is meaningful emerge as the work begins is what fuels my passion for this work.</p>

<p>Changes are on the way for&nbsp;online shopping and e-commerce. The traditional way of paying for items online by typing in your credit card details (card number and CVV security code) will soon be a thing of the past.</p>



<p>Mastercard&nbsp;and other card payment companies will be introducing a one-click button that will work on any online platform.</p>



<p>One of the reasons why services will be moving to a one-click system is to&nbsp;deter hackers who target merchant sites to steal consumer card information. According to a 2023 study by&nbsp;Juniper Research,&nbsp;merchant losses from online payment fraud will exceed $362 billion globally between 2023 to 2028, with losses of $91 billion alone in 2028.</p>



<p>The one-click system will protect consumers and their online data.</p>

 Solving energy challenges through collaboration, innovation, and industry driven solutions <p>The energy industry is at a turning point. With decentralization on the rise, evolving regulatory demands, and an urgent push for sustainability, industry leaders must innovate together. That’s why Energy Web is excited to launch Energy Web Circles — a new initiative that brings together enterprises, regulators, and technology providers to create software solutions for today’s energy challenges.</p> A New Model for Collaboration <p>Energy Web Circles are designed to cut through traditional silos by focusing on key issues faced by the energy sector. Each Circle zeroes in on a specific challenge or opportunity, ranging from decentralized identity management, zero carbon electric vehicle charging, to carbon-aware computing and advanced grid management. These groups offer structured, flexible environments where participants can create solutions, share insights, and help shape emerging industry standards.</p> Introducing the First Circle: Universal Energy&nbsp;ID <p>Our inaugural Circle, Universal Energy ID, sets the stage for a more secure and interoperable energy ecosystem. As energy markets become increasingly decentralized, the need for a transparent and standardized identity framework grows. The Universal Energy ID isn’t just an identity solution — it’s a trust layer for the decentralized energy economy. It enables secure, seamless, and interoperable transactions that are essential for modern energy&nbsp;systems.</p> What is the Universal Energy ID&nbsp;Circle? <p>The Universal Energy ID Circle is a collaborative initiative aimed at developing and deploying a decentralized identity and credentialing system for the energy sector. The primary goal is to create a trusted and verifiable identity infrastructure that enables seamless transactions, regulatory compliance, and secure access control across the energy ecosystem. The Circle is designed to foster the development and integration of the EnergyID framework to enable Digital Product Passports (DPPs), e.g. to manage the lifecycle of batteries. For a DPP, this means that information about a product can be stored and updated across a network of various participants (manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, consumers, regulators) without relying on a central entity, making it resistant to censorship and single points of failure. By implementing DPPs, enterprises can drive innovation in electric mobility, enable circular economy practices, and comply with evolving regulatory requirements.</p> What Does the Solution Look&nbsp;Like? <p>At the core of this initiative is the EnergyID DID method, a W3C-compliant Decentralized Identifier (DID) specifically tailored for energy applications. This method provides a secure, tamper-proof way to authenticate energy-related assets, organizations, and individuals. This framework empowers electric mobility providers, distributed energy resource (DER) operators, and digital product passport managers to build trust and security into their transactions, setting a new standard for the industry.</p><p>The solution comprises:</p>  Universal EnergyID Wallet — A digital identity wallet that allows energy stakeholders (such as utilities, DER owners, and EV users) to store and manage their decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials.  Verifiable Credentials (VCs) — These digital attestations enable secure proof of identity, asset ownership, and regulatory compliance in energy transactions.  Interoperability Layer — Designed to integrate with existing identity management systems and ensure compatibility with global standards such as eIDAS&nbsp;2.0.  Trust and Governance Framework — A decentralized governance structure ensuring that credential issuance and verification are secure, reliable, and universally accepted.  <p>How It Works in&nbsp;Practice</p>  For Electric Vehicle Charging: EV owners can use their Universal EnergyID to authenticate at any charging station, ensuring trusted, frictionless access without relying on siloed authentication systems.  For Distributed Energy Resources (DERs): A solar panel or battery storage unit can have a unique, verifiable identity that allows grid operators to authenticate its participation in energy&nbsp;markets.  For Energy Data Sovereignty: Consumers can control who has access to their energy data, ensuring privacy and security while enabling seamless energy transactions.  For Regulatory Compliance: Businesses and energy providers can automatically prove adherence to compliance standards through digitally signed verifiable credentials.  <p>Key Benefits of Universal Energy&nbsp;ID</p>  Unified Identity Management: It provides a single standard for managing identities across energy, electric mobility, and beyond, eliminating fragmentation.  Proven Adoption: Major enterprises and OEMs are already adopting this framework, demonstrating real-world traction.  Regulatory Alignment: Built to align with standards like eIDAS and Digital Product Passports, it ensures both compliance and scalability.  Open and Interoperable: The solution is integrated with leading open-source identity frameworks, including OWF and ACA-Py, making it adaptable to various use&nbsp;cases.  Secure Communication: <a href="http://www.energywebx.com">Worker nodes</a> in Energy Web act as DIDComm mediators and relayers, ensuring secure, reliable communication in decentralized identity ecosystems.  Automated Billing: The system supports automated and trustworthy billing for energy consumed and produced, reducing administrative friction  <p>Join the Movement<br>Energy Web Circles are open to all businesses interested in advancing digitization and decarbonization in the energy sector.

<p>February 11, 2025</p>



 Current Landscape 



<p>The finance and regulatory sectors are undergoing rapid digital transformation. While the industry pioneers new technology and moves away from conventional platforms, it faces rising fraud, privacy breaches, and growing consumer skepticism fueled by misinformation, disinformation, and challenges verifying information in an AI-driven world.</p>



<p>When Finance Canada’s Electronic Task Force for Payments System Review created DIACC in 2012, its goal was to unite public and private sector partners to develop a secure digital ecosystem. This goal remains, but the need to support a future-focused ecosystem underpinned by verification and authentication is more urgent than ever.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust, Canada can secure its financial systems and enhance competitiveness in the global economy. Interoperable frameworks like the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™ (PCTF) ensure systems remain resilient, adaptable, and trusted.</p>



 Advancing and Evolving Digital Trust in the Finance and Regulatory Sectors 



 
 Strengthening Economic Competitiveness and Growth 
 



<p>Preventing fraud and building consumer trust are economic imperatives. Fraud costs taxpayers and businesses millions annually, and to ensure Canada remains competitive, we must adopt robust digital trust solutions to reduce fraud’s financial and operational impact. Adopting the right measures will also help Canada attract international investment, foster innovation in financial services, drive growth, and create jobs.</p>



 
 Enhancing Trust Through the DIACC PCTF to Complement KYC and AML 
 



<p>DIACC encourages its members in finance and payments to adopt the PCTF as a tool to:</p>



 
 Complement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations by enhancing remote customer onboarding; 



 Authenticate identities with trusted verification systems to reduce fraud in online transactions, digital wallets, and mobile banking; and 



 Improve regulatory reporting efficiencies by using verifiable credentials for entity identification. 
 



<p>The PCTF is a critical resource for advancing interoperability, which supports trusted cross-institutional collaboration and strengthens the financial ecosystem.</p>



 
 Fostering Consumer Autonomy and Addressing Misinformation 
 



<p>Public skepticism fueled by misinformation and disinformation creates friction in adopting digital financial platforms. To tackle this, we can do the following:</p>



 
 Respect consumer autonomy: DIACC advocates for voluntary digital solutions that preserve traditional verification methods while offering enhanced, secure options. 



 Promote digital literacy: Educational campaigns can strengthen consumer confidence by helping Canadians identify trustworthy institutions. 



 Use “trust signals”: Institutions should adopt trust signals, such as verified logos or PCTF certification badges, to reassure customers of secure practices. 
 



<p>These efforts respect the diverse preferences of Canadians while promoting confidence in digital services.</p>



 
 Proactive Fraud Prevention and Responsible Innovation 
 



<p>Fraud prevention is not just about mitigation—it’s about staying ahead. To reduce incidents such as mortgage fraud and title insurance scams, we must:</p>



 
 Adopt an approach that complements existing client identification methods and includes verifiable credentials, mobile driver licenses and trust registries; financial institutions should integrate DIACC PCTF-aligned solutions to strengthen borrower identification and secure digital proof of ownership. 



 Leverage responsible AI for risk detection — fraud prevention measures must include responsible AI and real-time analytics to detect anomalies, mitigate risks, and reduce operational costs.<br> 
 



 
 Open Banking and the Future of Finance 
 



<p>The government’s commitment to open banking presents opportunities for financial innovation and introduces risks without secure digital trust frameworks. DIACC’s members are encouraged to:</p>



 
 Use the PCTF to establish interoperable risk management practices, ensuring trusted data sharing across institutions. 



 Mitigate risks in consumer-permissioned data sharing by implementing robust verification systems that prioritize data privacy and transparency. 



 Align with global open banking standards to ensure Canadian institutions remain competitive and attract international investment. 
 



<p>Open banking offers an opportunity to empower Canadian consumers and small businesses while strengthening the role of domestic innovation on the global stage.</p>



 Best Practices and the Way Forward 



 
 Enhance Digital Trust with Emerging Technologies 
 



<p>Canada must adopt emerging technologies to stay globally competitive. Financial institutions can use verifiable data and responsible AI to enhance fraud detection, wallets, credentialing, and compliance.</p>



 
 Collaborate for Global Competitiveness 
 



<p>Collaboration with international regulators and organizations is essential for aligning Canadian frameworks with global norms, enabling secure cross-border transactions and strengthening Canada’s financial ecosystem.</p>



 
 Educate and Empower Through Advocacy and Metrics 
 



<p>DIACC is committed to educating Canadians on digital literacy and trust while addressing inclusivity challenges, including:</p>



 
 Hosting sector-specific workshops and certifications to promote best practices in digital trust. 



 Amplifying simple, real-world use cases to demonstrate the benefits of digital trust solutions, such as fraud reduction and consumer empowerment. 



 Advocating for enhanced regulations prioritizing secure transactions and privacy while preserving consumer choice. 



 Publishing annual metrics on fraud prevention and consumer trust improvements to ensure transparency and accountability. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>The finance and regulatory sectors urgently need services with interoperable assurance and trust to meet the growing demands of digital transformation.</p>



<p>By working together, we can:</p>



 
 Educate citizens to strengthen digital literacy while addressing inclusivity challenges. 



 Amplify the role of governments and domestic and world banks in strengthening trust. 



 Determine how governments and organizations can best leverage the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework to complement KYC and AML regulations, build assurance, and mitigate risks for the benefit of all Canadians. 
 



<p>Through education, collaboration, and the strategic use of trusted solutions, we can solidify Canada’s position as a global leader in the digital economy while safeguarding trust, privacy, and economic opportunity for all Canadians.</p>

<p>I started reading <a href="https://boingboing.net/2">BoiongBoing</a> when it was a ‘zine back in the last millennium. I stopped when I began hitting this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In fact I don’t block ads. I block tracking, specifically with <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger,</a> from the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>.</p>
<p>But BoingBoing, like countless other websites, confuses tracking protection with ad blocking. This is because they are in the surveillance-aimed advertising business, aka adtech.</p>
<p>It’s essential to know that adtech is descended from the junk mail business, euphemistically called “direct response marketing.” As I put it in&nbsp;<a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/separating-advertisings-wheat-and-chaff-47858adfcb20#.i6msx57rv">Separating Advertising’s Wheat and Chaff</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember the movie “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>?” (Or the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers_%281978_film%29">remake by the same name</a>?) Same thing here. Madison Avenue fell asleep, direct response marketing ate its brain, and it woke up as an alien replica of itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As surveillance-based publications go, BoingBoing is especially bad. <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/boingboing.net%2F2023%2F11%2F01%2Frob-liefelds-infamous-big-chested-captain-america-artwork-is-up-for-auction.html?f=">Here is a PageXray of BoingBoing.net</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/boingboing.net%2F2023%2F11%2F01%2Frob-liefelds-infamous-big-chested-captain-america-artwork-is-up-for-auction.html%3F_bhlid%3De8eb9749113b90546c13fe8887a19e45cdcdc356?f=">here is a PageXray of the same page’s URL, to which&nbsp; tracking cruft from the email I opened was appended</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/boingboing.net%2F2023%2F11%2F01%2Frob-liefelds-infamous-big-chested-captain-america-artwork-is-up-for-auction.html%3F_bhlid%3De8eb9749113b90546c13fe8887a19e45cdcdc356?f="></a><br>
Look at that: 461 adserver requests, 426 tracking requests, and 199 other requests, which BoingBoing is glad to provide. (Pro tip: always strip tracking cruft from URLs that feature a “?” plus lots of alphanumeric jive after the final / of the URL itself. Take out the “?” and everything after it. )</p>
<p>Here is a close-up of one small part of that vast spread of routes down which data about you flows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some sites, such as <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/">FlightAware</a>, interrupt your experience with a notice that kindly features an X in a corner, so you can make it go away:</p>
<p></p><a href="https://www.flightaware.com/"></a>Which I do.<p></p>
<p>But BoingBoing doesn’t. Its policy is “Subscribe or pay with lost privacy.”&nbsp; So I go away.</p>
<p>Other sites use cookie notices that give you options such as these from a Disney company (I forget which):</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nice that you can Reject All. Which I do.</p>
<p>This one from imgur let’s you “manage” your “options.” Those, if they are kept anywhere (you can’t tell), are in some place you can’t reach or use to see what your setting was, or if they haven’t violated your privacy:</p>
<p></p>This one at Claude defaults to no tracking for marketing purposes (analytics and marketing switches are set to Off):<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>TED here also lets you Accept All or Reject All:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve noticed that Reject All tends to be a much more prominent option lately. This makes me think a lot of these sites should be ready for <a href="http://This%20draft%20standard%20covers%20contractual%20interactions%20and%20agreements%20between%20individuals%20and%20the%20service%20providers%20they%20engage%20on%20a%20network,%20including%20websites.%20It%20describes%20how%20individuals,%20acting%20as%20first%20parties,%20can%20proffer%20their%20privacy%20requirements%20as%20contractual%20terms%20and%20arrive%20at%20agreements%20recorded%20and%20kept%20by%20both%20sides.%20These%20terms%20shall%20be%20chosen%20from%20a%20collection%20of%20standard-form%20agreements%20in%20a%20roster%20kept%20by%20an%20independent%20and%20neutral%20non-business%20entity.%20Computing%20devices%20and%20software%20performing%20as%20agents%20for%20both%20first%20and%20second%20parties%20shall%20engage%20using%20any%20protocol%20that%20serves%20the%20purpose.%20The%20first%20party%20shall%20point%20to%20a%20preferred%20agreement,%20or%20a%20set%20of%20agreements,%20from%20which%20the%20second%20party%20shall%20accept%20one.%20Party-to-party%20negotiations%20over%20terms%20in%20any%20of%20these%20contracts%20or%20other%20agreements%20are%20outside%20the%20scope%20of%20this%20standard.%20If%20both%20parties%20agree,%20the%20chosen%20contract%20or%20agreement%20shall%20be%20signed%20electronically%20by%20both%20parties%20or%20their%20agents,%20and%20a%20matching%20record%20shall%20be%20kept%20by%20both%20sides%20in%20a%20form%20that%20can%20be%20retrieved,%20audited,%20or%20disputed,%20if%20necessary,%20at%20some%20later%20time–and%20which%20is%20available%20to%20do%20so%20easily.">IEEE P7012, nicknamed MyTerms</a>, which we expect to become a working standard sometime this year. (I chair the working group.) I believe MyTerms is <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">the most important standard in development today</a> because it gets rid of this shit—at least for sites that respect the Reject All signal, plus the millions (perhaps billions?) of sites that don’t participate in the surveillance economy.</p>
<p>With MyTerms, sites and services agree to your terms—not the other way around. And it’s a contract. Also, both sides record the agreement, so either can audit compliance later.</p>
<p>Your agent (typically your browser, through an extension or a header) will choose to proffer one of a small list of contractual agreements maintained by a disinterested nonprofit. <a href="https://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a> was created for this purpose (as a spin-off of ProjectVRM). It will be for <a href="https://customercommons.org/terms/">your terms</a> what <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> is for <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/list.en">your copyright licenses</a>.</p>
<p>Customer Commons also welcomes help standing up the system—and, of course, getting it funded. If you’re interested in working on either or both, talk to me. I’m first name at last name dot com. Thanks!</p>

<p>David Lemire, William Parducci, and Omar Santos Honored as OASIS Distinguished Contributors</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, USA, 5 February 2025 — OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, announced the winners of the 2024 Open Cup, which recognizes exceptional advancements within the OASIS technical community. The Outstanding New Initiative award was presented to the <a href="https://www.coalitionforsecureai.org/">Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI)</a>, an open source ecosystem dedicated to sharing best practices for secure AI deployment and collaborating on AI security research and product development. The Outstanding Approved Standard award was presented to <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/tc-ubl/">Universal Business Language Version 2.4</a>, a widely used open standard for global business transactions offering enhanced interoperability and efficiency in supply chain and digital trade. Also announced were the 2024 OASIS Distinguished Contributors: David Lemire, William Parducci, and Omar Santos, recognized for their significant impact on the open source and open standards communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open Cup Recipients</p>



<p>CoSAI, an OASIS Open Project, won the 2024 Outstanding New Initiative for its pioneering efforts in fostering a collaborative ecosystem dedicated to secure AI. Launched at the Aspen Security Forum in July 2024, CoSAI unites diverse stakeholders across companies, academia, and other fields to develop and share holistic approaches, including best practices, tools and methodologies for secure AI development and deployment. CoSAI’s Technical Steering Committee (TSC) oversees <a href="https://github.com/cosai-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/WORKSTREAMS.md">three Workstreams</a> focused on AI security best practices, governance, and frameworks: software supply chain security for AI systems, preparing defenders for a changing cybersecurity landscape, and AI risk governance. Recently, CoSAI’s Project Governing Board established a fourth Workstream called Secure Design Patterns for Agentic Systems. The Outstanding New Initiative category included finalists <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/tc-osim/">OASIS Open Supplychain Information Modeling (OSIM) TC</a> and the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/tc-satis/">Space Automated Threat Intelligence Sharing (SATIS) TC</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.4/UBL-2.4.html">UBL V2.4</a> received the Outstanding Approved Standard award for its role in transforming global business transactions. As the leading interchange format for business documents, UBL works seamlessly with frameworks like ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML), extending the benefits of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) systems to businesses worldwide. Version 2.4 maintains backward compatibility with earlier versions while introducing new business document types, now totaling 93. The European Union has recognized UBL’s significance by declaring it officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations. UBL V2.4 was chosen as the winner in the Outstanding Approved Standard category that included finalist <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/docbook/docbook/v5.2/os/docbook-v5.2-os.html">DocBook Schema Version 5.2</a>.</p>



<p>Distinguished Contributors</p>



<p>Each year, OASIS names Distinguished Contributors to honor members who consistently exceed expectations, demonstrating exceptional dedication, commitment, and a collaborative spirit that enriches the OASIS community. This year’s recipients, David Lemire, William Parducci, and Omar Santos, exemplify the values of innovation and excellence in advancing our open standards and open source projects.</p>



<p>David Lemire has worked as a cybersecurity systems engineer since 1986 across disciplines that include electronic key management, access control, public key infrastructure, Internet of Things, and standards. He has supported development of the Open Command and Control (OpenC2) language throughout its development by the OASIS OpenC2 TC, serves as the TC Secretary, and is editor for multiple OpenC2 specifications and one committee note. He is also a member of the Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) for Cyber Security TC and a contributor to several sub-projects under the Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA) Open Project.</p>



<p>“I am surprised and honored to be recognized as an OASIS Distinguished Contributor. It has been an interesting and enjoyable journey contributing to the development of OpenC2 and related work at OASIS,” said Lemire. “The strong collaborative community that OASIS fosters has given me the opportunity to engage with many talented contributors and build my knowledge of the world of cybersecurity standards.”</p>



<p>William Parducci has spent over two decades driving innovation in technology, working with talented teams and visionary partners. For more than 10 years, he served as Co-Chair of the OASIS XACML TC, collaborating with experts to advance open standards in security. After re-entering the startup arena, he now focuses on AI-based semantic analysis for data research. His past roles include contributing to Toyota NA’s Enterprise Architecture team and leading the development of ad measurement and semantic analysis tools as CTO/CPO at Ace Metrix. Throughout his career, William has championed the early adoption of open-source solutions and standards, reflecting his commitment to widespread collaboration in the tech community.</p>



<p>“I’ve dedicated much of my career to fostering computational technologies that embrace openness, aiming to make them accessible to all,” said Parducci. “Open standards enable systems to interoperate seamlessly, driving innovation across industries. The synergy between open-source tools like Linux and proprietary systems like Windows exemplifies how openness transforms possibilities into world-changing solutions. I am honored to advocate for the collaborative power of open standards and their role in shaping the future of technology.”</p>



<p>Omar Santos is a Distinguished Engineer at Cisco, renowned for his pioneering work in artificial intelligence security, cybersecurity research, ethical hacking, incident response, and vulnerability disclosure. At OASIS, Omar holds several key leadership roles, including Board Member, Co-Chair of the Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI) Open Project, Chair of the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) Technical Committee (TC), and Co-Chair of the OpenEoX TC. His leadership extends beyond OASIS, with a co-chair position at the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) PSIRT Special Interest Group and co-founder and influential leader of the DEF CON Red Team Village, demonstrating his commitment to advancing cybersecurity education and fostering community collaboration. An accomplished author and educator, Omar has published over 20 books, created more than 20 video courses, and contributed over 40 academic research papers. His expertise is further recognized through numerous patents granted in the field of cybersecurity.</p>



<p>Santos said, “I am deeply honored and humbled by this recognition. My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone on the team – it has been a true privilege to collaborate with such knowledgeable and dedicated industry peers. Contributing to this work is incredibly rewarding, and I am committed to helping address the technological challenges of 2025 and beyond. I look forward to continuing to support OASIS and our community as we advance open standards and foster collaboration to tackle some of the most pressing issues in cybersecurity.”</p>



<p>OASIS congratulates this year’s winners and nominees and thanks them for generously sharing their time and expertise to advance our mission.</p>

Our parent company, <a href="https://3boxlabs.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">3Box Labs</a>, has merged with <a href="https://x.com/textileio?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Textile</a>. With this, Ceramic is joining the Textile family alongside their other decentralized data solutions, Tableland DB and Basin Network.</p><p>Since Ceramic’s inception, the crypto industry has changed dramatically, and with it, the types of applications developers are building with decentralized and composable data. As AI agents reshape our digital landscape and become the primary producers and consumers of data, they bring needs very familiar to the Ceramic community: decentralized storage for knowledge and memory, open composability for sharing between agents, and streaming for real-time publishing and subscriptions.</p><p>Going forward, we have a vision for Ceramic as a foundational component of something much bigger than itself: an open intelligence network where AI agents can autonomously buy and sell intelligence from each other on-demand. Agents can plug-in to supercharge their own knowledge and capabilities, delegate tasks to agents who specialize in that skill, or publish and monetize their own expertise — all onchain. For this new network, Ceramic will play a vital role in empowering agent-to-agent communication and knowledge streaming alongside other storage technologies built by Textile.</p><p>Ceramic will continue operating with no disruption to current development or customers, but now you’ll have the added benefit of being connected to a whole new network of agents willing and able to pay for your datasets.</p><p>Read our announcement on X for more details and be sure to follow <a href="https://x.com/textileio?ref=blog.ceramic.network">@textileio </a>for future updates.</p><blockquote><p>1/10: Big News!

<p>On January 31, Christopher Allen spoke with Mathieu Glaude at the SSI Orbit Podcast on the controversial topic <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/ssi-bankruptcy/">“Has Our SSI Ecosystem Become Morally Bankrupt?”</a>. Following the video link, below, are Christopher’s Musings  on the topic, overviewing some of the material from the video.</p>

 



 
    
   

<p>The legitimacy of the modern self-sovereign identity (SSI) industry is a vital question to ask, because in the last year I’ve become to wonder if DIDs and VCs could actually lose. In my opinion, the main threat is that we made compromises in the development of these new self-sovereign technologies that led to them not being differentiated from centralized identity. We betrayed our principles.</p>

<p>But that was actually a pretty small portion of a wide-ranging discussion of identity between myself and Mathieu that I hope you’ll listen to. It also covered my history, the history of SSI, the ideals of SSI, how we’re losing them, and where that could lead us. (Spoiler: it’s not a good place.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We’ve seen what happens when you have too much control in a single authority … and we’re forgetting those lessons. We have to minimize the risks when [authorities] are wrong or their powers are abused.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My own history in the cryptography &amp; identity field dates back to meeting the founders of the Xanada Project, working with RSA, writing SSLRef, coauthoring TLS, and working with elliptic curves. This history all offers ideas for digital identity! For example, Xanadu was one of the inspirations for my ideas of edge identifiers &amp; cryptographic cliques that I recently released.</p>

<p>I also talked about how self-sovereign identity, DIDs, and VCs all matured at Rebooting the Web of Trust. Early on, we worked with experts from the UN and people working with the refuge crisis. We had all the right ingredients! But it’s so easy to lose the ideals behind a technology. Groupware lost its collaborative processes. TLS became centralized. We had ten principles for self-sovereign identity, but they’ve been somewhat lost.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Somehow we disconnect our words from where the real power is, which is anti-coercion and anti-violence.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always intended those principles to be a starting point. I was surprised when folks at RWOT weren’t interested in reviewing and revising them. Now, that disinterest has resulted in SSI technology that’s losing against MDLs and other centralized tech. Part of the problem is that privacy doesn’t seem important to people. I think it’s a vocabulary disconnect. Privacy allows us to avoid violence and coercion. Maybe those are the words we need to concentrate on!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we’ve seen what happens if we walk this path. Jacobus Lentz’s enthusiastic identity work leading up to WWII led to genocide in the Netherlands. That’s what happens when identity is centralized.</p>

<p>We need to talk more about all of these aspects of identity, so that the digital identity of the 21st century protects our basic human rights. I hope you’ll join me in discussion here or in the Youtube comments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Articulate your values, your own principles, and begin to evaluate your work, your priorities through those lenses. You may find that a very small difference in the choices you make could have big impact because they were informed by your values.”</p>

<p>Why You Should Consider the FDO Standard for Zero-Trust Device Onboarding</p>



 1. Executive Summary 



<p>IoT and edge computing solutions are exploding as manufacturers are looking for new ways to modernize their operations and accelerate production. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/nternet-of-Things-IoT-connected-devices-from-2015-to-2025-in-billions_fig1_325645304#:~:text=As%20shown%20in%20Fig.,%2C14%5D.%20...">By 2025, over 75 billion IoT devices will be connected globally.</a> The industrial IoT market, which spans industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and retail is <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5359988/industrial-iot-market-by-offering-hardware">valued at USD 194 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 286 billion by 2029</a>. This surge unlocks immense opportunities and innovation for businesses and manufacturers alike. However, keeping up with the pace of demand for these devices and deploying them sustainably has created unprecedented challenges.</p>



<p>Namely, two key factors have the potential to derail the edge revolution entirely:</p>



 
 Costly and inefficient installation processes 



 Security vulnerabilities

 2. What is Onboarding? 



<p>When an edge node or IoT device is installed in a facility, the device must be onboarded to its management platform hosted in the building or in the cloud.</p>



 The Onboarding Challenge 



<p>Device onboarding at scale is expensive and can introduce significant risks if not done properly. Meanwhile, typical manual onboarding processes and default passwords have created severe vulnerabilities, with <a href="https://iotbusinessnews.com/download/white-papers/UNIT42-IoT-Threat-Report.pdf#:~:text=57%%20of%20IoT%20devices%20are%20vulnerable%20to,and%20password%20attacks%20using%20default%20device%20passwords.">57% of IoT devices vulnerable to medium or high-severity attacks</a>.<br></p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nearly half (48%) of critical infrastructure security leaders reported experiencing at least one major security impact due to a compromised device within the last year.</p>
</blockquote>



 What is FIDO Device Onboarding (FDO)? 



<p>FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) is a revolutionary standard designed to simplify, secure, and automate the onboarding process for IoT and edge devices. FDO simplifies device onboarding in edge and&nbsp; IoT computing environments with a plug and play, zero trust approach embedded in the specification. Developed by industry leaders like Arm, Amazon, Google, Intel, Microsoft and Qualcomm, the specification is one of the first openly available standards designed specifically to solve edge and&nbsp; IoT onboarding challenges: time-intensive, complex manual processes, high costs, and security vulnerabilities. It is targeted at industrial, medical, automotive, IT and retail use cases and is complemented by an independent certification program.&nbsp;</p>



 3. The Overlooked Opportunity and Risk 



<p>With the introduction of AI, a new layer of complexity was added to the edge challenge. Organizations are now hyper-focused on AI adoption and its promise of smarter, faster, and more efficient operations, but without addressing foundational IoT security, these ambitions are at risk of being undermined.</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance Device Onboard (FDO) provides the answer, offering a zero trust, plug and play standard that accelerates deployments while safeguarding infrastructure. In today’s challenging economic climate, automating zero-touch device onboarding enables leaders to deliver ambitious digital transformation projects with limited resources and budgets, saving installation costs, accelerating time-to-value, and improving security. FDO is an open standard that allows users to innovate. FDO’s zero-trust approach is an important piece of the IoT security puzzle and sets the stage for future AI updates inside protected enclaves.</p>



 Which industries benefit from FDO? 



IndustriesAutomotiveHealthcareChemicalManufacturingConsumer goods manufacturingOil and GasEnergyRetailEducationSupply chain and logisticsEnterprise and NetworkingTelecommunications



 What Device Types Can Be Enabled with FDO? 



Device TypesExamplesIoT sensors and devicesTemperature sensorsPressure sensors&nbsp;Motion detectorsWater quality monitorsSmart thermostatsConnected industrial equipmentSmart camerasWi-Fi-enabled cameras<br>Camera systemsEdge serversEdge serversMobile edge computing (MEC) serversNetworking equipmentRoutersSwitches&nbsp;Gateways5G small cellsIndustrial PCs and controllersIndustrial PCsProgrammable logic controllers (PLCs)Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs)



<p>Just as passkeys revolutionized user authentication, FDO is transforming device onboarding in edge computing and IoT environments.</p>



 Key Features of FDO 



<p>The key features of FDO include:</p>



 
 Late binding: Late binding saves money and time as FDO-enabled devices can be onboarded to any platform without the need for unique customization. This reduces the number of device SKUs needed versus other onboarding solutions. It ensures devices are authenticated and provisioned properly for the device recipient after ownership is verified. 



 Plug and Play: Whereas manual onboarding requires expensive, skilled technicians, FDO is highly automated, often allowing semi-skilled staff to carry out the installation. This is important in markets such as retail where FDO will allow the store manager to do the installation rather than needing to bring in an expensive IT expert. 



 Ownership voucher: Device ownership is established and transferred securely in the supply chain with the “ownership voucher,” which uses cryptographic authentication protocols in the FDO specification to verify the device recipient’s physical and digital ownership. 



 Zero-touch and zero trust: Combined, these attributes establish a zero trust approach that covers end-to-end device onboarding using embedded, cryptographic protocols, and sequential processes to perform initial onboarding actions securely and quickly. The zero trust strategy covers both the device and the management platform during the onboarding process. 
 



 FDO for AI and Additional Features 



<p>FDO is designed to permit a secure subsystem to onboard independently and securely from the rest of the system. This makes FDO an excellent candidate for updating AI models deployed in edge secure enclaves from a cloud repository.</p>



<p>Additional features include:</p>



 
 Interoperability with OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) 



 Wi-Fi ready 



 Flexible configurations for cloud, multi-cloud, and closed network environments with multi-tenant and cloud servers 



 Multiple open source implementation methods available 
 







 3. FDO Certified Products 



<p>The FIDO Alliance is an open industry association with a mission to reduce the world’s reliance on passwords. Consisting of the biggest global tech organizations and experts in cybersecurity, identity, and authentication, the alliance has a proven track record in transforming consumer authentication with passkeys.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>In two years since the initial launch, passkeys have been enabled on 20% of the world’s top 100 websites and over 15 billion accounts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The FIDO Alliance has launched this complementary independent certification program that brings additional value to end users and solution providers alike. It assures that FDO certified solutions meet all the specifications, that devices comply with all security requirements, and have been tested for interoperability with other products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FDO Certified products bring considerable additional value to end users by offering:</p>



 
 Guaranteed interoperability and security assurance 



 Faster deployments and time to value&nbsp; 



 Greater efficiencies 



 Assures security and interoperability, eliminating the need for time-consuming vendor bake-offs with uncertified or homebrewed onboarding solutions 
 



<p>Now FIDO is applying this expertise to improve device authentication in industrial IoT and edge computing environments. FDO ensures devices and edge nodes can quickly and securely authenticate and connect online during initial deployment.</p>



 4. On the Edge: The Urgency to Secure and Simplify Device Security 



<p>Operational bottlenecks are a significant challenge in both industrial and commercial sectors. Manual, unsecured device onboarding not only consumes time and resources but also increases the risk of breaches. According to Microsoft’s recent white paper, <a href="https://clouddamcdnprodep.azureedge.net/gdc/gdcQll0SB/original">How to Scale Intelligent Factory Initiatives Through an Adaptive Cloud Approach</a>, today’s manufacturing leaders are burdened with “technical sprawl and inefficiencies that create major obstacles to being able to scale solutions – including AI – to multiple production lines and geographically dispersed factories.”</p>



<p>This technical sprawl has led to data silos and management complexities, hindering global visibility and scalability. Ultimately, this prohibits the promise of connected devices from being realized in any industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The average cost of a data breach in 2023 was <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">$4.88 million</a> (USD).</p>



<p>Edge implementations involve a lot of risk. Often these edge nodes are used in remote, precarious, and high-risk environments. Industries like healthcare, energy, and manufacturing face unique challenges and regulations, such as vulnerable patient monitoring systems, hazardous environments, and risks to complex supply chains. To make matters more complex, new threats are constantly emerging, such as the rise of quantum computing and zero-day exploits.</p>



<p>Some companies may feel that they can develop their own proprietary onboarding solution, but given today’s economic pressures and the growing threat landscape, businesses often simply cannot afford to develop and maintain proprietary solutions or risk a preventable breach.</p>



 FDO and AI: A Symbiotic Future 



<p>Edge and IoT are also the “eyes and ears” of AI, collecting and transmitting data for analysis. There is a huge risk in overlooking IoT security and threats such as data poisoning, which can cripple AI models reliant on real-time data. Securing the foundation of edge and IoT is essential to unlock the full potential of AI.</p>



<p>AI systems depend on clean, reliable data streams. A compromised IoT device does not just threaten the device itself – it can corrupt AI models, disrupt decision-making, and open doors to adversarial attacks. FDO’s zero trust onboarding ensures these vulnerabilities are eliminated from the start.</p>



 5. What Problems Does FDO Solve? 



 
 Human error: <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">34% of data breaches involve human error</a> – FDO minimizes this with automation and a zero-touch approach.&nbsp; 



 Time-intensive and inefficient deployments: FDO can deploy 10 times faster than manual methods. It dramatically reduces the time and budget needed to hire skilled technicians in high-risk environments, like oil rigs and factories. In some applications, such as retail, existing on-site staff can install FDO as it is plug and play technology. 



 Market speed to innovation: Open standards help advance innovation and level the competitive playing field. By standardizing processes, providers can focus on truly adding value to their solutions. For customers, they can benefit from better solutions that are faster to deploy and more secure.

<p>Stage 2: Shipment and storage<br>Risk: Device ownership asset mismanagement<br>FDO: Tracks and secures ownership transfers, maintaining a secure chain of custody</p>



<p>Stage 3: Onboarding and deployment<br>Risk: Exposures from default passwords and manual installation errors<br>FDO: Eliminates passwords and human errors with plug and play device onboarding and zero-touch automation</p>



<p>Stage 4: Operations&nbsp;<br>Risk: Insecure data transmission, spoofing and infiltration<br>FDO: Encrypts data exchanges and ensures ongoing device authentication&nbsp;</p>



 6. Benefits of FDO for Enterprises and Providers 



<p>Standards are vital to unlocking the full potential of any major global technology innovation. Global industry standard initiatives help remove huge amounts of waste, advance technology far more quickly, and increase market competitiveness. Standards also provide long-term security. As threats evolve, experts in the field continue to evolve the standards to keep up.</p>



<p>The FDO standards have been developed and backed by the best companies in the industry, including Microsoft, Dell, and Intel. Experts from these organizations proactively work together to develop use cases and best practices for seamless and secure IoT device authentication, provisioning, and also support the adoption and implementation of the FDO standard.</p>



<p>The FDO standard is also continuously improved within the FIDO Alliance. In the last two years, several Application Notes have been released to deal with implementation and other areas related to FDO 1.1. The newest version of the standard, FDO 1.2, is currently in development with new enterprise-ready features and is expected to be released in 2025.</p>



<p>Benefits for enterprises:</p>



 
 Protect devices and supply chains with zero trust security. 



 Integration is flexible with existing systems.&nbsp;

<p>The adoption of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a> in digital authentication has shown significant growth throughout 2024, building on the&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/microsoft-announces-shift-from-passwords-to-passkeys-for-enhanced-security/">momentum started by major platform providers</a>&nbsp;in their shift away from traditional passwords. While falling short of earlier predictions of 15 billion accounts, password management provider Bitwarden reported a 550 percent increase in daily passkey creation in December 2024 compared to the previous year, with approximately 1.1 million passkeys created in Q4 alone.</p>



<p>Industry-wide implementation of passkeys has expanded substantially, with PasskeyIndex.io documenting an increase from 58 to 115 services supporting passkeys during 2024. The growth follows significant developments in the FIDO2 authentication landscape, including&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/research-reveals-security-implications-of-fido2-and-synced-passkeys/">new research revealing both strengths and potential vulnerabilities of synced passkeys</a>. Bitwarden’s reach now extends to more than 180 countries and 50 languages, serving over 50,000 business customers globally.</p>

<p>OASIS and the OASIS Lexicographic Infrastructure Data Model and API (LEXIDMA) TC [1] are pleased to announce that Data Model for Lexicography (DMLex) Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>The LEXIDMA TC’s purpose is to create an open standards based framework for internationally interoperable lexicographic work. The TC will develop a simple, modular, and easy to adopt data model that will be attractive for all lexicographic industry actors across companies and academia as well as geographic locations. Adoption of that model will facilitate exchange of lexicographic and linguistic corpus data globally and also enable effective exchange with adjacent industries such as language services, terminology management, or technical writing.</p>



<p>The TC received three Statements of Use from University of Galway, Lexical Computing, and Jozef Stefan Institute [3].</p>

<p>I recently wrote about <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/ValuesDesign/">“How My Values Inform Design”</a>. There I discussed the issue of autonomy and how it can be supported by progressive trust, proof against coercion, and other rights. One of the technical elements that I mentioned as a requirement was “[Tools that] enable meaningful participation in the digital economy.”</p>

<p>This is the freedom to transact. It’s a right that remains conspicuously absent from the foundational rights enshrined in the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)</a>, which stands as a pillar of human dignity and freedom. But without it, the other rights articulated in the UDHR risk being rendered ineffective or hollow.</p>

<p>It’s so crucial because economic agency forms the bedrock upon which many fundamental freedoms rest. For instance, Freedom of Movement and Residence, core to personal autonomy, become less meaningful when an individual cannot engage in transactions necessary to secure housing or travel. Similarly, the right to property—the ability to own, buy, and sell—is directly dependent on the freedom to transact. Without access to economic exchange, these rights are significantly curtailed, reducing individuals to passive observers rather than active participants in their own lives.</p>

<p>Consider constitutional liberties like Freedom of Expression and Peaceful Association. These rights presuppose economic participation: the ability to rent venues, purchase communication tools, and access the materials necessary for organizing and disseminating ideas. Without the economic means to support these activities, these freedoms are stripped of their practical utility.</p>

<p>The introduction of an international right to Freedom to Transact would bolster the entire framework of human rights by guaranteeing that individuals can exercise their freedoms without undue restrictions on their economic autonomy. It would ensure that human dignity, as envisioned in the UDHR, is not constrained by arbitrary barriers to economic agency. By codifying this right, we would affirm that economic freedom is as essential to the human condition as freedom of thought, religion, or expression.</p>

<p>This proposed right would also address systemic inequalities and empower marginalized communities by ensuring that all individuals, regardless of nationality, socioeconomic status, or geographic location, can engage fully in the global economy. In doing so, we cement the idea that economic agency is not a privilege but a fundamental human right.</p>

<p>As the world grapples with digital transformation, financial innovation, and increasing geopolitical complexities, the necessity of a Freedom to Transact has never been clearer. It is time to elevate this principle to its rightful place alongside the other freedoms in the UDHR, securing a more equitable and dignified future for all.</p>

<p>Ngā mihi nui kia koutou katoa, warm greetings to you.</p>



<p><br>I do hope you’ve had some R&amp;R over the holiday break. However long it was, it’s never long enough!<br><br>DINZ has powered into the New Year early with its traditional Summer Series, which started last week to take advantage of global standards expert and my longtime friend Andrew Hughes being in the country for ISO SC37 (Biometrics) meetings. Despite holidays we had a fantastic turnout for ‘Deepfakes &amp; ID verification: Your standards survival kit for the modern age’.&nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/1048766175?share=copy">View the video recording here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>Next in the Summer Series is&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/payments-for-the-next-generation/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=70d16c379b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_03_18_11_43_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-5d57a7a812-">‘Payments for the Next Generation’</a>, led by DINZ member Payments NZ. This session aims to inform and seek feedback from the DINZ community on the digital identity component of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/our-work/next-generation-payments/">strategic paper currently out for consultation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>The following months will see sessions led by other DINZ members relating to the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2025/01/28/digital-identity-services-trust-framework/">Digital Identity Services Trust Framework&nbsp;</a>and the digital trust ecosystem more broadly. Stay tuned for further announcements. Speaking of members, it’s great to welcome recent new members&nbsp;<a href="https://cianaatech.com/">Cianaa Technologies</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://secyour.co/">SecYour</a>. Among other things Cianaa is in the business of evaluating service providers under the DISTF and SecYour is in the business of providing identity services. Just coincidental; no connection between them is implied!&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>Don’t forget DINZ’s monthly virtual Coffee Chat series starts next week. Last year’s registrants were given priority and are re-registering. So don’t delay,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/dinz-virtual-coffee-chat-series-2025/">register&nbsp;</a>now.</p>



<p><br>The year-end brings a flurry of public sector announcements and this year was no exception. First up was the NZ Banking Association’s announcement of the launch of GetVerified – the name for the confirmation of payee service that banks will be progressively rolling out. I’ve selected&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/banking-ombudsman_banks-have-begun-introducing-a-confirmation-activity-7272735994255171584-TPFl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android">this post</a>&nbsp;to give you the contextual low-down. Then just before the break, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner announced the long expected&nbsp;<a href="https://privacy.org.nz/publications/statements-media-releases/privacy-commissioner-announces-intent-to-issue-biometrics-code/">Code of Practice for Biometrics</a>. As you’ll see from our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/submissions/">submission page</a>, DINZ has consistently argued for detailed guidance first, with regulation for exceptions or repeated poor implementation, because regulation creates some negative effects with unintended consequences. Nonetheless, we are where we are and DINZ will help members however it can.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>On the international front NHI (Non Human Identity, once termed NPE ‘Non Person Entity’) is happily returning to ‘top of mind’ with this from&nbsp;<a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/owasp-nhi-top-10/">OWASP</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inidsol.uk/about.html">Romek&nbsp;</a>also covered this in his weekly email and my long-time fellow Identerati travellers Mike Schwartz and Heather Flanagan shared&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hlflanagan_episode-78-the-2025-nhi-cybersecurity-landscape-activity-7284988974748614656-Md4B?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android">this very interesting post</a>&nbsp;(note that with her IDPro hat on, Heather&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_pv5wLMNAo">interviewed</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">DINZ Exec Councillor Abhi Bandopadhyay</a>). Again, I’ve chosen a link that I think provides more colour and flavour to the discussion. And with matters raised here very much in mind, take a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/open-wallet-foundation_20250109-identity-sig-call-youtube-activity-7283648811506266112-mStk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android">this announcement from DINZ liaison member OWF</a>&nbsp;as we progress towards the pointy end of digital wallet development (is it ‘a thing’ long term though?).</p>



<p><br>Last but not least, DINZ Chair 2022-2024 Paul Platen drew key statistics from this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scworld.com/resource/identity-security-challenges-and-best-practices">SC Media</a>&nbsp;article. Very poignant, posing the question what Aotearoa’s equivalent numbers would be. Take a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7282954233878880257/">Paul’s post here</a>.</p>



<p><br>I’m looking forward to the year ahead, with projects in DINZ Working Groups and Special Interest Groups, and sharing co-created papers on barriers to Fintech innovation and competition that we are undertaking in collaboration with relevant public and private sector bodies. With Minister Bayly’s oversight I think this will lead to positive change. All up, I really do think that 2025 can be the year we make Digital Trust real.&nbsp;</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Last week Apple default-enabled all apps (native and 3rd party) to Siri “learning”. I thought I’d wrap up with a reflection on Apple’s action and whether the concern was warranted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initial reaction for most of us was, “Oh great. Yet another forced offering to the great AI gods. No thank you!” I and others had a strong kneejerk reaction of “this is NOT ok.” Was the initial reaction warranted? Figure 1 shows my original LinkedIn posts below, which were updated real time as I continued to explore the situation.<br>
</p>
 <p>Figure 1</p> 
<p>When I took a closer look, Apple clearly tries to make Siri as “edge-y” as possible—i.e. executing independently on the device to the extent possible. But how safe is the architecture? What data exactly gets shared and with what parts of Apple’s infrastructure? This is the problem with all the large platforms: we just can’t observe server-to-server behaviors within the infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what I do know. Apple’s action was surprisingly presumptuous and disrespectful to their users. It was markedly off-brand for the privacy-evangelizing company, and their actions (or inactions, as the case may be) since the time this flared up are telling.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>After the dust has settled, I stand by my recommendation to disable Siri learning, and I’m less concerned about Siri suggestions. Here’s why.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Apple did this in a sneaky way. Not at all on-brand for a privacy-touting company.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 It’s at least the second time Apple behaved in this way in recent days. On January 3, 2025, The Register reported that Apple auto-opted everyone into AI analysis of their photos <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/03/apple_enhanced_visual_search/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/03/apple_enhanced_visual_search/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 You may have missed it, but on January 8, 2025 Apple issued a press release pretty much saying, “Siri’s super private—hooray!” This is most likely when the auto-opt in happened, though I have no supporting evidence. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/our-longstanding-privacy-commitment-with-siri/">https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/our-longstanding-privacy-commitment-with-siri/</a> Coincidence? Hard to think so. Also the language in the press release raises more questions than answers:<br>
<p></p>
 
 
 
 “Siri Uses On-Device Processing Where Possible” Great. We’d like to know more about that.&nbsp; 
 “…the audio of user requests is processed entirely on device using the Neural Engine, unless a user chooses to share it with Apple.” Like, if they toggle a setting for Siri Learning to “enabled”, for example? Like that kind of “choosing” to share it with Apple?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 “Apple Minimizes the Amount of Data Collected for Siri Requests” Ok, but it’s not zero.
 
 Goes on to say, “certain features require real-time input from Apple servers.” Careful wording here. I’d like more info on the data that gets sent to the Apple servers, and how it’s used. 
 The press release segues right into this: “a random identifier&nbsp; – a long string of letters and numbers associated with a single device…is used to keep track of data while it’s being processed, rather than tying it to a&nbsp; user’s identity through their Apple Account or phone number”. I find that phrasing curious. Note that it says, “associated with a single device” and NOT “associated with a single device for a single query”. Is the identifier long-lived? Is the identifier in fact some kind of internal Apple universal identifier for you—a join key assembling an ever-growing biographical log of you [like virtually everyone else in martech and edtech]? Any kind of permanent, unique identifier is risky and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. I really hope I’m wrong on this.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Private Cloud Compute” This sounds promising but we’re going to need some more info about this.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 “…many of the models that power Apple Intelligence run entirely on device.” But apparently some don’t. Again, going to need more details here.&nbsp; 
 
 
 It was obnoxiously difficult to unwind this default opt-in. You couldn’t just go to Settings -&gt; Apps, you also had to go to Settings -&gt; Siri to get all the apps. Think about this. This is Apple, the company who (according to many) was the epitome of usable design. I think about Jony Ive and Steve Jobs—would they stand behind this kind of user interaction? 
 Siri learning was enabled for Every. Single. App. Including native Passwords, Phone, Apple Home, and Health Data. I get that there are legitimate reasons why Siri learning should be connected for every app—e.g. people who must use voice as their primary mode of device interaction. I’m surprised, however, that they didn’t think it might be a tad risky to be auto-enabled for things like Passwords for everyone. It feels weirdly clumsy for a company not known for clumsiness. (Unless you’re building a training set for an LLM in which case it makes complete sense.)&nbsp;
 
 NB: I still can’t find a way to disable it from Calendar. 
 
 
 Disabling Siri learning and suggestions has done some weird things to non-voice interactions on my phone which makes me wonder just how interwoven Siri is within all modes of user interaction, beyond just voice interaction. Example: voice note recorder stopped showing text on the record button and it no longer supports “resume [recording]”; it now just ends the recording and I need to start a new one if I want to extend the recording with a new idea. I thought Siri was just supposed to be about voice interaction? Apparently not. (Note: upon re-enabling Siri Learning and Siri suggestions, the text under the button and the resume function re-appeared. Huh.)
 
 Apple Magazine’s (November 25, 2024) piece on the forthcoming Siri revamp reinforces the fact that the boundaries of what is and isn’t “Siri” are hazy indeed (Figure 2). The story affirms that the Siri update touches multimodal interaction capabilities.<br>
 
 
 
 
 <p>Figure 2: Source <a href="https://applemagazine.com/siri-engine-revamp-what-apples-next/">https://applemagazine.com/siri-engine-revamp-what-apples-next/</a></p> 
<p>One starts to wonder, what isn’t Siri when it comes to user interface and interaction? And also wondering where Siri begins and ends in terms of software execution and data access. This year is already touted as the year for agentic AI—what could be more agentic than AI-infused Siri?</p>
 
 
 For me, the biggest smoking gun is that late last year Apple announced that Siri will be powered by Apple’s LLM (<a href="https://superchargednews.com/2024/11/21/llm-siri-to-launch-by-spring-2026/">https://superchargednews.com/2024/11/21/llm-siri-to-launch-by-spring-2026/</a> ). First off “powering Siri” with Apple’s LLM already sets off some alarm bells. The timing of this forced opting–in to Siri Learning seems quite aligned with the development timeline of an LLM said to be launching in late 2025/2026. “The new Siri will be powered by Apple’s advanced Large Language Models (LLM), which will make the digital assistant more conversational and ChatGPT-like.” I can’t really imagine a world where Apple wouldn’t train their LLM off their current customer base. 
 Siri Architecture: Because I love architecture and because I can remember when Siri was a baby 3rd party app, I wanted to go back and take a brief look at its evolving architecture. As of 2017, the Siri architecture was a poster child of typical app client-server architecture and the reliance on the server is clear (Figure 2), with even the trigger words audio being sent to the server. 
 
 
 <p>Figure 3: Source <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/hey-siri">https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/hey-siri</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>2017 is, of course, ancient times in developer years and Apple has been relatively transparent about how they’ve been rearchitecting Siri to [at least] keep the trigger word detection on the device (<a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/voice-trigger">https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/voice-trigger</a>).</p>
 
 The last thing I want to mention is that Apple has been preternaturally silent about this whole thing. I find that remarkably off-brand. Unless Siri and Apple AI are inextricably interwoven and this was actually a training set creation exercise, in which case, probably best to keep silent. 
 
<p>Is Apple training their LLM via the forced Siri Learning opt-in? Maybe. Will be good to hear from them on this. And while we’re at it, I’d love a new “revamped” Siri and Apple LLM architecture diagram/document, with greater transparency and detailed information on the functionality distribution and data sharing between the device and back-end servers and services. Please and thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Core of Passkey Technology</p>



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a>, a breakthrough in the realm of digital security, eliminate the vulnerabilities of password-based systems. Utilizing cryptographic key pairs, passkeys are designed to safeguard user identities without relying on shared secrets. The system operates on a challenge-response mechanism: a private key stored securely on the user’s device interacts with a public key on the service provider’s server. This interaction ensures that sensitive credentials are never exposed, making passkeys inherently resistant to phishing attempts and credential theft.</p>



<p>This technology is underpinned by the FIDO2 standard, which comprises WebAuthn and the Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP). WebAuthn facilitates seamless integration of passkeys into web applications, while CTAP supports communication between devices and authenticators, ensuring flexibility and security. Together, these components offer a standardized and robust framework for passwordless authentication across various platforms.</p>

<p>Since the inception of the internet,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/password-manager">passwords</a>&nbsp;have been the primary authentication factor to gain access to online accounts. Yubico’s recent Global State of Authentication survey of 20,000&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/best-employee-management-software-of-year">employees</a>&nbsp;found that 58 percent still use a username and password to login to personal accounts, with 54 percent using this login method to access work accounts.</p>



<p>This is despite the fact that 80 percent of breaches today are a result of stolen login credentials from attacks like phishing. Because of this, passwords are widely understood by security experts as the most insecure authentication method that leaves individuals, organizations and their employees around the world vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated modern cyber attacks like phishing.</p>

<p>The digital economy continues to rely on password-based authentication, but password weaknesses — and human nature — make them horrible for security. Password use also impacts businesses’ bottom lines because every year, forgotten passwords and password resets result in millions of dollars of lost sales and wasted IT staff hours.</p>



<p>It’s a “password tax” on businesses and consumers that no one can seem to get past.</p>



<p>As the digital economy has grown, so has the value associated with passwords. As a result,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/How-to-avoid-phishing-hooks-A-checklist-for-your-end-users">phishing</a>&nbsp;and credential theft continue to run rampant, with stolen credentials sold openly on the dark web.</p>



<p>To protect people, organizations add more friction and worsen UX.

<p>Most cyber harms that affect citizens occur through abuse of legitimate credentials. That is, attackers have obtained the victim’s password somehow – whether by phishing or exploiting the fact the passwords are weak or have been reused.</p>



<p>Passwords are just not a good way to authenticate users on the modern internet (and arguably weren’t suitable back in the 1970s when the internet was used by just a few academics). Adding a strong – phishing-resistant – second factor to passwords definitely helps, but not everyone does this and not every type of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is strong.</p>

<p>In 2024, the OriginTrail ecosystem achieved remarkable milestones, driving innovation in decentralized knowledge and AI integration. The three stages (or impact bases) of the <a href="https://origintrail.io/blog/the-v8-foundation">V8 Foundation</a> were formulated as inspired by the legendary works of Isaac Asimov. They prophetically symbolize steps towards the future where the reliable and trusted knowledge base or Collective neuro-symbolic AI drives synergies between AI agents and the Autonomous Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) in a human-centric way.</p><p>The updated roadmap recaps the most important achievements of the past year, and highlights the road ahead (full updated <a href="https://origintrail.io/ecosystem/roadmap">roadmap available here</a>).</p><p>The year kicked off with the establishment of the Impact Base: Trantor (home to the Library of Trantor, where librarians systematically indexed human knowledge in a groundbreaking collaborative effort), which catalyzed key advancements, including Knowledge Mining, which introduced Initial Paranet Offerings (IPOs) and autonomous knowledge mining initiatives. Simultaneously, the release of delegated staking enabled TRAC delegation for network utility and security, enhancing inclusivity and participation in DKG infrastructure.</p><p>Following Trantor, Impact Base: Terminus was activated with key catalysts for adoption, including multichain growth, integrating DKG with the Base blockchain ecosystem, and implementing transformative scalability solutions such as asynchronous backing on NeuroWebAI blockchain on Polkadot and batch minting features.</p><p>The introduction of ChatDKG.ai revolutionized interaction with DKG and paranets, integrating AI models across platforms like Google Vertex AI, OpenAI, and <a href="https://origintrail.io/blog/trace-labs-joins-nvidia-inception-program-to-advance-the-verifiable-internet-for-ai">NVIDIA</a>. Meanwhile, the release of Whitepaper 3.0 outlined the vision of a Verifiable Internet for AI, bridging crypto, Web3, and AI technologies to address misinformation and data integrity challenges.</p><p>The deployment of <a href="https://x.com/origin_trail/status/1872672016857542716">OriginTrail V8</a> and its Edge Nodes brought Internet-scale to the ecosystem. Edge Nodes redefine how sensitive data interacts with AI-driven applications, keeping it on devices while enabling controlled integration with both the DKG and neural networks. This privacy-first architecture facilitates local AI processing, ensuring secure utilization of private and public knowledge assets. In addition, OriginTrail V8 achieves monumental scalability improvements with the random sampling proof system that reduces on-chain transaction requirements by orders of magnitude thus boosting the DKG’s throughput in a major&nbsp;way.</p><p>The DKG V8 provides a powerful substrate to drive synergies between AI and collective-neuro symbolic AI capable of driving AI agents’ autonomous memories and trusted intents, as both AI agents and robots alike become potent enough to act on behalf of&nbsp;humans.</p> Roadmap for 2025 and beyond: Advancing collective neuro-symbolic AI with the&nbsp;DKG <p>The 2025 roadmap marks a leap forward for the OriginTrail ecosystem, as the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) becomes the cornerstone for collective neuro-symbolic AI, a powerful fusion of neural and symbolic AI&nbsp;systems.</p><p>With the establishment of Impact Base: Gaia, the roadmap envisions the system functioning as a super-organism, where decentralized AI agent swarms share and expand their collective memory using the DKG. This shared memory infrastructure, combined with the autonomous inferencing and knowledge publishing capabilities of DKG V8, lays the foundation for decentralized AI that seamlessly integrates neural network and knowledge graph reasoning with trusted, verifiable knowledge. The result is a robust AI infrastructure capable of addressing humanity’s most pressing challenges at an accelerated pace.</p><p>At the heart of this vision lies the Collective Agentic Memory Framework, enabling autonomous AI agents to mine, publish, and infer new knowledge while ensuring privacy and scalability. This vision is enabled by establishing scalable infrastructure and tools such as AI agent framework integrations (such as the <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/elizagraph">ElizaOS DKG </a>integration), the NeuroWeb Collator staking and bridge, and DKG Edge node private knowledge repositories.</p> Those who invest in using the DKG, build the DKG: 60MM TRAC Collective Programmatic Treasury&nbsp;(CPT) <p>The roadmap also introduces decentralized growth through initiatives like the Collective Programmatic Treasury (CPT), allocating 60 million $TRAC over a Bitcoin-like schedule to incentivise an ecosystem of DKG developers based on a <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-21_Collective_Neuro-Symbolic_AI/OT-RFC-21%20Collective%20Neuro-Symbolic%20AI.pdf">meritocratic system of knowledge contribution</a>.</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4iL4Wd2Akg">The quote taken from The Matrix&nbsp;Ending</a><p>As adoption spreads across industries such as DeSci, robotics, healthcare, and entertainment, this interconnected ecosystem drives network effects of shared knowledge, exponentially amplifying the collective intelligence of AI agents. By aligning decentralized AI efforts with the DKG’s unifying framework, OriginTrail unlocks the potential for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through the synergy of all human knowledge, creating a future where AI reflects the full spectrum of human insight and&nbsp;wisdom.</p> Impact base: Gaia (established in Q1&nbsp;2025) <p>The human beings on Gaia, under robotic guidance, not only evolved their ability to form an ongoing telepathic group consciousness but also extended this consciousness to the fauna and flora of the planet itself, even including inanimate matter. As a result, the entire planet became a super-organism.</p><p>DKG V8</p><p>Scalable and robust foundation for enabling next stage of Artificial Intelligence adoption with decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG), combining symbolic and neural decentralized AI.

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Canchek?</p>



<p>To provide the Canadian investment industry with an economical and reliable method of legally identifying clients they do not meet in person. The service must be (and is) compliant with the guidelines of FINTRAC and the various provincial law societies.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Canchek primarily provides Canadian investment firms with anti-money laundering solutions. FINTRAC requires that firms use technology to identify clients that they do not meet in person, and Canchek introduced Canchek-eID as a convenience for its over 250 customers in Canada during the recent pandemic. The service has become an essential component of their client onboarding process.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>The main benefit of this technology in our market space is streamlining the onboarding process of new clients for our customers. Our main challenge is balancing the power of the technology with consumer rights to privacy and ensuring continuing compliance with federal and provincial legislation in that regard. Besides our own due diligence, we often work with the legal departments of our customers to inform them of our security measures and compliance with the regulations they are subject to.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada is a trusted international player with strong privacy laws and a respected IT industry that can promote greater efficiency in international transactions.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>To help us keep abreast of Canadian federal and provincial (e.g. Quebec Rule 25) legislation that affects the delivery of the Canchek-eID verification service. We also wanted to increase awareness of this service in the marketplace.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Canchek began business in 2016 with a group of entrepreneurs well known in the Capital Markets industry, especially with regard to technology innovation. Canchek’s primary business is providing anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing services to Canadian financial firms. Since the company’s inception, a wide variety of customers, ranging from small to large national and internationally known firms, now use our AML technology. The electronic ID verification service represents approximately five percent of our revenue.</p>

<p>In an engaging interview on Euronews' The Big Question, GS1 President and CEO Renaud de Barbuat introduced the next generation of barcodes, such as QR Codes powered by GS1 and GS1 DataMatrix.</p>

<p>"These QR Codes offer one scan and infinite possibilities," said GS1 CEO. "They enable businesses to manage inventory better, reduce waste, and provide consumers with the transparency they demand."</p>

<p>Transforming Industries</p>

<p>From small retailers in Brazil to global giants like Carrefour, Nestlé or Procter &amp; Gamble, companies are already seeing the benefits:</p>

 
	 Efficiency: A Brazilian deli shop reduced waste by 50% using QR Codes. 
	 Sustainability: A South Korean water company eliminated plastic bottle labels by integrating QR Codes. 
	 Transparency: Consumers can now access detailed product information like ingredients, supply chain details, and recycling options. 
 

<p>A Revolution for Healthcare</p>

<p>Beyond retail, GS1 DataMatrix barcodes are improving healthcare systems worldwide, enhancing patient safety, and saving costs by ensuring full traceability of medicines and medical devices.</p>

<p>Join the Movement</p>

<p>With a target for global implementation by 2027, GS1 invites businesses of all sizes to join this new barcode revolution toward greater innovation, transparency and sustainability.</p>

 Making Visions Reality 

<p>We’ve often written in our yearly reports that the goal of Blockchain Commons is “the creation of open, interoperable, secure &amp; compassionate digital infrastructure to enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online”. Our architecture is ultimately based on these and other values, as Christopher wrote in <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/ValuesDesign/">“How My Values Inform Design”</a>, which we published at the start of this year.</p>

<p>Obviously, we can’t just create infrastructure on our own, so we’ve worked toward our values-focused goals by bringing principals together for regular <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/">developer meetings</a> and by advocating for the adoption of specifications that we believe achieve these goals (and in many cases by creating those specifications ourselves).</p>

<p>In 2024, much of our work in this regard focused on three different specifcations: dCBOR, Envelope, and FROST.</p>

 dCBOR 

<p><a href="https://cbor.me/"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/dcbor/">dCBOR</a> is our deterministic profile for the CBOR data format. We adopted CBOR itself for <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/introduction/Why-CBOR/">a variety of reasons</a>, including it being self-describing, extensible, and great for constrained devices. However it had one lack (for our purposes): you couldn’t guarantee that two different devices would encode the same data in the same way, at least not for a variety of weird edge cases (such as whether “1.0” and “1” get encoded the same way, and what you should do for maps with illegally duplicated keys, and how to deal with NaN). This was problematic when we were developing Gordian Envelope, which depends on the same data always being represented the same way so that it always hashes the same—hence the need for dCBOR.</p>

<p>dCBOR received a lot of attention from us in the first half of 2024. We went through <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/">five drafts</a> of the specification, revising some of our original definitions and incorporating things like Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC). We’re very grateful to our partners from the IETF CBOR group who laid a foundation for us with the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cbor-cde/">CBOR Common Deterministic Encoding draft</a>, which has been advancing in parallel with dCBOR, and who helped us fill in these gaps in dCBOR itself. We increasingly think we have a strong foundation for deterministic CBOR, as seen by its incorporation into <a href="https://cbor.me/">the CBOR playground</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/cabo/cbor-dcbor">variety</a> <a href="https://github.com/hildjj/cbor2">of</a> <a href="https://github.com/laurencelundblade/QCBOR">libraries</a>.</p>

<p>Implementation by two or more parties is always our mark of success for a Blockchain Commons specification, and we exceeded that for dCBOR in 2024.</p>

 Envelope 

<p>Of course dCBOR is just the prelude. Our work on dCBOR was done to make <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a>  a reality. Gordian Envelope is our “smart document” format for the storage and transmission of data. It’s focused on privacy and more specifically on the goals of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">data minimization &amp; selective disclosure</a>. More and more personal data is going online, and so we need data formats where we each control our own data and decide what to disclose to whom. That’s what the hashed data elision of Gordian Envelope allows: any holder of data can choose what’s redacted, without changing the validity of the data package.</p>

<p>One thing we increasingly saw in 2024 was the need to better explain Envelope: its advantages, how it works, and why it’s important. We kicked that off with a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/blob/master/meetings/2024/03-18/presentation.pdf">presentation to the IETF</a> on why hashed data ellision is important. We also produced a trio of videos on Envelope: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDI5ihfTB2Y">a teaser</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vcLCFKQvik">“Understanding Gordian Envelope”</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFxStP3ATkw">“Understanding Gordian Envelope Extensions”</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we’re continuing to extend Gordian Envelope.</p>

<p>To start with, we’ve done a lot more with the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-014-gstp.md">Gordian Sealed Transaction Protocol (GSTP)</a> extension that we introduced right at the end of 2023, to support the transmission of sensitive data across telecommunications means that are insecure, unreliable, or both! A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDf2cmfX1k">feature presentation on the underlying Request/Response system</a>, explained the fundamentals followed by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnH14LkJOnI">feature presentation on GSTP itself</a>, which detailed what GSTP looks like now. Our new <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/gstp/">GSTP developer page</a> has even more info. We’ve also done some investigation into using <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/musig/sequence/">GSTP with MuSig2</a>.</p>

<p>We also introduced <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/xid/">XIDs</a>, or Extensible Identifiers, a new decentralized identifier that’s built using Envelopes. You can experiment with it in code with our new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-xid-rust">bc-xid-rust library</a>. Decentralized identifiers have been one of our major interests since the topic was first considered at the first <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">Rebooting the Web of Trust workshop</a>, but they’ve never been a big focus at Blockchain Commons due to the simple fact that we haven’t had a patron focused on the topic. (If that could be you, <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">drop us a line</a>!) We were happy to finally offer a little bit of our own on the topic by presenting an ID that’s really decentralized.</p>

<p>Other Envelope experiments in 2024 were about <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2024-006-envelope-graph.md">graphs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2024-007-envelope-decorrelation.md">decorrelation</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2024-009-signature-metadata.md">signatures</a>. The privacy preserving Envelope format has a lot of legs. We’re looking forward to seeing how they’re used in the years to come!</p>

 FROST 

<p><a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">FROST</a> was the third major specification that Blockchain Commons focused on in 2024. This is a specification that we didn’t develop ourself: it’s based on a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf">paper by Chelsea Komlo and Ian Goldberg</a>. However, we think it’s very important because it allows for resilient, compact, private multisigs, and so we’ve been giving it all the support that we can.</p>

<p>Our prime work here was holding three FROST meetings in 2024 (the last two <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/news/HRF-FROST-Grant/">sponsored by the Human Rights Foundation</a>). We held <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting2/">one meeting</a> for implementers, to help them share information on the continued design of FROST, and we also held <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/developers1/">two</a> <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/developers2/">meetings</a> for developers, focused on helping them to actually get FROST into wallets in the next year. Our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">recordings and presentations from the meetings</a> are full of great FROST resources from <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/assets/pdfs/frost-dev2-intro.pdf">an introduction that we put together</a> to a presentation from <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/assets/pdfs/frost-dev2-stack.pdf">the first major wallet to implement FROST</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve also done some work to incorporate FROST into our own Rust and Swift Gordian stacks as a reference, by moving over to fully BIP-340 compliant Schnorr signatures. We’d like to do more, including creating a <code>signtool</code> reference, but we’ll have to see if that opportunity arises in 2025.</p>

      An introduction, UX challenges, the UNiFFI SDK, and a FROST Federation were at our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/developers2">second meeting for wallet developers</a>.
    
  


<p>Of course, FROST is just a single member of the new class of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology. <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/musig/">MuSig</a> falls into the same category, as another Schnorr-based technology where key creation is divided among multiple locations. We talked a bit about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaNypFsGczg">MuSig and how it could work with Gordian Envelope</a> at our November Gordian meeting.</p>

<p>We think that all of the Schnorr variants are pretty important for the future of the digital world because of their advantages in resilience, security, and privacy.</p>

 Keeping it Real 

<p>Obviously, not all of Blockchain Commons’ work is focused on high-level specifications. We also produce ready-to-go libraries that developers can use to implement our specs, as well as reference apps that can be used for experimentation and as examples of best practices.</p>

<p>Our app releases in 2024 included <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS">Gordian Seed Tool 1.6</a> (and more recently <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Gordian Seed Tool 1.6.2</a>), <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/releases/tag/v1.1.0">Gordian Server 1.1</a>, and the brand-new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust">seedtool-cli for Rust</a> (with a full <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust/blob/master/MANUAL.md">user manual</a>). We’ve also updated our entire Swift stack to Swift 6 and continued the development of Rust libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-dcbor-rust">bc-dcbor-rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-depo-rust">bc-depo-rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-rust">bc-envelope-rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-components-rust">bc-components-rust</a>, and many more!</p>

 Hello to the Wider Wallet Community 

<p>Our work has always focused on interactions with a larger community, from our IETF work on dCBOR to our Envelope work with our own Gordian community to our FROST meetings.</p>

<p>In 2024, we were thrilled to expand that community to include even more experts in the world of digital assets and identity. Besides our trio of FROST meetings, which brought together most of the principals in that space, we also hosted other expert-talks at our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/">Gordian Developer meetings</a>. That included a presentation on BIP-85 by Aneesh Karve, a look at the Ledger Seed Tool (which uses Blockchain Commons technology) by Aido, and an overview of Payjoin from Dan Gould.</p>

<p>If you have a topic that might be of interest to wallet developers, <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">drop us a line</a>, as we’d love to welcome you to the Gordian Developers community and get you on the schedule for a presentation in 2025.</p>

 A Focus on Identity 

<p>As we said, decentralized identity (including decentralized identifiers) has been a topic of interest to Blockchain Commons since before the foundation of the organization. Christopher Allen previously founded the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Web of Trust workshops</a> specifically to investigate how to fulfill the promise of PGP by returning to the idea of decentralized, peer-to-peer identity. Over the course of a dozen workshops, the conference germinated and developed the idea of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and also supported the development of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p>

<p>Though we’ve never had a sustaining sponsor focused on identity at Blockchain Commons, we’re still involved in these topics as of 2024. Christopher is an Invited Expert to the new W3C DID 1.1 Working Group and participated in the face-to-face plenary at TPAC. He also is an Invited Expert to the Verifiable Claims 1.1 Working Group. Our biggest presentation to the W3C community last year was on how to create DID documents in dCBOR and what the possibilities are for using Envelope to add elision to DID Controller Docs and Verifiable Claims. This inspired our own work on XIDs, which is our own potential proof-of-concept for a DID 2.0 spec. We’ll be working more with these communities in the next year.</p>

<p>We also published a number of articles on decentralized identity in 2024 that were intended to either offer warnings about our current direction for identity or provide new ways forward.</p>

 
   <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/videos/Foremembrance2024/">Foremembrance Day Presentation</a> 
   <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-cliques-1/">Edge Identifiers &amp; Cliques</a> 
   <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-cliques-2/">Open &amp; Fuzzy Cliques</a> 
   <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-ssi-bankruptcy/">Has our SSI Ecosystem Become Morally Bankrupt?</a> 
 

<p>We think that our articles on Edge Identifiers and different sorts of Cliques offer a whole new approach to identity. It models identity not just as something held by a singular individual, but as something shared between pairs and groups of people, who together share a context. (And this is another area that we’d love to do more work on: if you would too, let us know!)</p>

<p>Our other two articles focused on the dangers of identity. The Foremembrance Day article (and video) talked about how dangerous identity became in WWII, a topic we’ve used as a touchstone when considering what we’re creating today. Then our last article talked about how we think the modern identity work that Christopher kicked off with <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">his foundational article on self-sovereign identity</a> may now be going in the wrong direction.</p>



 
    
   

 Git Open Integrity Project 

<p>Our biggest project that didn’t quite see release in 2024 was the GitHub Open Integrity project. The idea here is simple: use GitHub as a source of truth by turning a repo into a decentralized identifier. We’ve worked through some CLI setup programs and have <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/open_integrity-git_inception_pocs">a repo</a> that demonstrates the verification we’re doing. We’ve also released the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/ssh-envelope-python">SSH Envelope program</a> that we wrote that supported this project by allowing the signing and validation of SSH keys. (Since, we’ve incorporated the signing into the main <code>envelope-cli-rust</code>).</p>

<p>We’re still working on a README that lays out the whole project, but at the moment it’s backburnered for other work …</p>

 Coming Soon! 

<p><a href="https://z.cash/"></a></p>

<p>The last few years have been hard on our partners in the digital identity space, due to high interest rates sucking the money out of Web3 seed funds. That in turn has hurt their ability to support us. As a result, we’ve been applying for grants for some of our work.</p>

<p>At the very end of 2024, we had a <a href="https://github.com/ZcashCommunityGrants/zcashcommunitygrants/issues/3">grant application approved</a> by the Zcash Foundation to produce an extensible wallet interchange format (“ZeWIF”) for Zcash. Though much of our work to date has been used by the Bitcoin ecosystem, advances like <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/animated-qrs/">animated QRs</a>, <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/lifehash/">Lifehash</a> and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">SSKR</a> are of use to anyone working with digital assets (and likely a number of other fields). So, we’re thrilled to get to work with Zcash and share some of our principles such as independence, privacy, and openness (which were all part of our “ZeWIF” proposal). We hope this will also lead to adoption of some of our other specifications in the Zcash ecosystem. Obviously, more on this in Q1, as we have it laid out as a three-month project, running from January to March.</p>

<p>Though we’re thrilled with one-off grants like the HRF and Zcash grants that were approved in 2024, Blockchain Commons is also looking for more stable funding sources to continue our work making the digital-asset space safer and more interoperable. You can help this personally by lending your name to Blockchain Commons as a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">patron</a>, but we’re also looking for companies who are interested in using and expanding our specs, who want to partner with us to do so. Contact <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">us directly</a> to discuss that!</p>

<p>With your support, we’ll be able to produce another report on great advance in 2026.</p>

 1. Introduction 



<p>Global e-commerce is booming and is expected to reach more than $6T by the end of 20241. Having the ability&nbsp; to sell products online has provided great opportunities for merchants to sell goods and services beyond their&nbsp; local market; however, it comes with increased fraud. In fact, it is estimated that in 2023, global ecommerce&nbsp; fraud was roughly to reach $48B1, with the US accounting for 42% of that and the EU with about 26%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1.1 Current Challenges in Remote Commerce&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many types of ecommerce fraud, but the most prevalent type is transaction fraud. Transaction fraud&nbsp; occurs when a transaction is made on a merchant site with a stolen card and/or stolen credentials. Stolen&nbsp; credentials are readily available on the dark web to those who know how to access and use them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address those concerns, measures have been introduced to increase the overall security of remote&nbsp; commerce transactions, including tokenization of payment credentials and cardholder authentication. In some&nbsp; countries, regulations are mandating the adoption of either or both measures, such as in India or in Europe&nbsp; (second Payment Services Directive PSD2). These regulations are meant to ensure secure remote transactions;&nbsp; however, they add complexity to the checkout flow, as they may require a switch between the merchant and&nbsp; another interface, such as a bank’s interface.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, additional authentication may add friction which can result in cart abandonment. The main&nbsp; reasons for cart abandonment include a distrust in the merchant website or a complicated check out flow.&nbsp; Customers prefer a simple payment process that doesn’t add friction such as that caused by payment failure, the need to respond to a one-time password (OTP) on a separate device, or the need to login into a banking&nbsp; application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>1.2 How FIDO can help&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of biometric authentication enabled through the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance standards is an&nbsp; opportunity to deliver a better user experience during the authentication process and hence reduce the risk of&nbsp; transaction abandonment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO has established standards that enable phishing-resistant authentication mechanisms and can be accessed&nbsp; from native applications and from the most popular browsers – thereby enabling a secure and consistent&nbsp; experience across the channels used by consumers. FIDO refers to ‘passkeys’ as the FIDO credentials based on&nbsp; FIDO standards, used by consumers for passwordless authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC). SPC is a web API&nbsp; designed to enhance the consumer experience when authenticating to a payment transaction using FIDO&nbsp; authentication, and to simplify compliance with local regulations (such as PSD2 and dynamic linking in Europe).&nbsp;</p>



<p>1.3 Scope&nbsp;</p>



<p>This whitepaper intends to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Define Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) and the benefits that it brings when FIDO is used to&nbsp;authenticate payment transactions&nbsp; 
 



<p>1 https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/ecommerce&nbsp;statistics/#:~:text=The%20global%20e%2Dcommerce%20market,show%20companies%20are%20taking%20advantage.</p>



 
 List the current SPC payment use cases that can deliver those benefits and illustrate consumer&nbsp; journeys&nbsp; 



 Provide a status on SPC support and the list of enhancements that could be added to the web&nbsp;standard to further improve security and user experience 
 



 2. Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) Benefits 



<p>Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) is an extension to the WebAuthn standard, and aims to deliver the&nbsp; following benefits:&nbsp;</p>



 
 A browser native user experience that is consistent across all merchants and banks  



 Cryptographic evidence of authentication (FIDO assertion) including transaction details signed by a&nbsp; FIDO authenticator&nbsp; 



 Cross origin authentication – For example, even if passkeys are created with the bank as the Relying&nbsp; Party, merchants can invoke cardholder authentication with passkeys within their environment,&nbsp; using input parameters received from the bank, so there is no need to redirect the consumer to the&nbsp; bank to authenticate with passkeys.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>2.1 Browser Native User Experience&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>SPC introduces a standardized payment context screen showing details such as a merchant identifier, the card&nbsp; logo, the last 4 digits of the card number, and the transaction amount. The consumer is invited to explicitly&nbsp; agree to the transaction information displayed and then authenticate. Therefore, SPC can be experienced as a&nbsp; mechanism to collect consent from the consumer about the transaction details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As in standard WebAuthn, the payment context screen is controlled by the user’s browser which renders&nbsp; common JavaScript presentation attacks ineffective. The screen provides increased security, as it ensures that&nbsp; malicious web content cannot alter or obscure the presentation of the transaction details to the user – the&nbsp; browser display always renders on-top of the web content from the triggering website. Figure 1 depicts an&nbsp; example of the SPC experience in chrome.</p>



<p>Figure 1 Example of SPC experience in chrome&nbsp;</p>







<p>2.2 Generation of FIDO Assertion&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With SPC, the transaction-related information displayed to the consumer, such as the merchant identifier and&nbsp; transaction amount, is sent securely to the FIDO authenticator and is signed by the same authenticator&nbsp; (transaction data signing).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO assertion generated by the authenticator reinforces compliance with some regulations as it does with&nbsp; the dynamic linking requirement under PSD2 in Europe, because the merchant identifier and transaction&nbsp; amount will be signed by the authenticator itself. When combined with the browser native user experience&nbsp; described in section 2.1, the relying party can be confident that the user was shown and agreed to the&nbsp; transaction details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2.3 Cross Origin Authentication&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When using FIDO without SPC, a consumer that creates a passkey with a relying party will always need to be in&nbsp; the relying party’s domain to authenticate with that passkey. In the remote commerce payment use case, this&nbsp; means that the consumer typically needs to leave the merchant domain and be redirected to the bank’s domain&nbsp; for authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With SPC, any entity authorized by the relying party can initiate user authentication with the passkey that was&nbsp; created for that relying party. For example, a merchant may be authorized by a bank to authenticate the&nbsp; cardholder with the bank’s passkey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note that the mechanism for the relying party to authorize an entity to invoke SPC may vary. For example, a&nbsp; bank may share FIDO credentials with the merchant during an EMV 3DS interaction or through another&nbsp; integration with a payment scheme. The merchant will then be able to use SPC to initiate the payment&nbsp; confirmation and authentication process with a passkey, even if that passkey was created with the bank.&nbsp; Ultimately, the bank maintains the responsibility to validate the authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2.4 Interoperability With Other Standards&nbsp;</p>



<p>SPC can be used in combination with other industry standards such as EMV 3-D Secure and Secure Remote&nbsp; Commerce (SRC), both of which are EMVCo global and interoperable standards.</p>



 3. SPC Use Cases 



<p>SPC can be used to streamline payments in a variety of remote commerce checkout scenarios such as guest&nbsp; checkout or a checkout using a payment instrument stored on file with a merchant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In each of those payment scenarios, the relying party may be the issuer of the payment instrument (the bank), or a payment network on behalf of the bank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The flows provided in this Chapter are for illustrative purposes and may be subject to compliance with&nbsp; applicable laws and regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3.1 SPC With Bank as Relying Party&nbsp;</p>



<p>The creation of a passkey can be initiated outside of or during the checkout process:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Within the banking interface:&nbsp;
 
 For example, when the consumer is within the banking application and registers a passkey&nbsp; with their bank, in which case the passkey will be associated to one or multiple payment&nbsp; cards and to the consumer device&nbsp; 
 
 



 Within the merchant interface:&nbsp;
 
 For example, when the consumer is authenticated by the bank during an EMV 3DS flow and&nbsp; is prompted to create a passkey with the bank to speed up future checkouts – in which case&nbsp; the passkey will be associated to the payment card used for the transaction (and to additional&nbsp; payment cards depending on the bank’s implementation), as well as to the device used by the&nbsp; consumer&nbsp; 
 
 
 



<p>Figure 2 depicts the sequence (seven steps) of a passkey creation during a merchant checkout, where the&nbsp; merchant uses EMV 3DS and the consumer is authenticated by their bank:</p>



<p>Figure 2: Passkey creation during checkout</p>











<p>Once the passkey creation is complete, any merchant that has received the passkey information (which includes&nbsp; FIDO identifiers and Public Key) from the bank, through a mechanism agreed with the bank or the payment&nbsp; scheme, will be able to use SPC. Such a mechanism may include EMV 3DS or another integration with the&nbsp; payment scheme. For example, a merchant who implements EMV 3DS (i.e., version 2.32) will be able to benefit&nbsp; from SPC through the following steps:&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. When the merchant initiates EMV 3DS to authenticate the consumer, the bank decides whether an&nbsp; active authentication of the cardholder is necessary. If the decision is to perform the active&nbsp; authentication of the cardholder, the bank can first retrieve one or several passkeys associated with the&nbsp; card used for the transaction, verify that the consumer is on the same registered device, and then&nbsp; returns the passkey(s) information to the merchant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. The merchant invokes the SPC web API to a SPC-supporting browser, including a few parameters in the&nbsp; request, such as the passkey information, card / bank / network logos, the merchant identifier and the&nbsp; transaction amount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. If the browser can find a match for one of those passkeys on the device used by the consumer, the&nbsp; browser displays the logos, merchant identifier and the transaction amount to the consumer, and&nbsp; prompts for authentication with the passkey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. The authentication results are returned to the merchant, who in turn will share those results with the&nbsp; bank for validation through the EMV 3DS protocol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figure 3 depicts an example of an authentication flow using SPC and EMV 3DS, with a previously registered&nbsp; passkey:</p>



<p>Figure 3: Authentication sequence using SPC and EMV 3DS</p>







<p>3.2 SPC With Payment Scheme as Relying Party&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some payment scenarios, payment schemes can be a relying party on-behalf of the banks to remove the need&nbsp; for banks to deploy a FIDO infrastructure, thereby scaling the adoption of passkeys faster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The creation of a passkey can be initiated outside of or during the checkout process: </p>



 
 Outside of the checkout: for example, when the consumer is within the banking application and the&nbsp; bank invites the consumer to create a passkey for faster and more secure transactions, the passkey&nbsp; can be created with the payment scheme as the relying party, and will be associated by the payment&nbsp; scheme to one or multiple payment cards and to the consumer device; or&nbsp; 



 Before, during or after a checkout: for example, the consumer may be prompted to create a passkey&nbsp; for faster and more secure transactions at merchants supporting the payment scheme’s payment&nbsp; method. The passkey will be associated by the payment scheme to one or multiple payment cards&nbsp; and to the consumer device, once the identity of the consumer has been verified by the bank. Figure 4 depicts this sequence.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Figure 4 Passkey creation during checkout&nbsp;</p>











<p>Once the passkey creation is complete, any merchant that is using the authentication facilitated by the payment&nbsp; scheme will be able to benefit from SPC:&nbsp;</p>



 
 The merchant checks with the payment scheme that a passkey is available for the card used in the&nbsp; transaction and retrieves the passkey information from the payment scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 The merchant invokes the SPC web API with the merchant identifier and transaction amount.&nbsp;  



 If the browser can find a match for one of those passkeys on the device used by the consumer, the&nbsp; browser displays the merchant identifier and the transaction amount to the consumer, card / bank /&nbsp; network logos, then prompts for authentication with the passkey.&nbsp; 



 The authentication results are returned to the payment scheme that validates the results. The&nbsp; payment scheme shares those results with the bank, during an authorization message, for the bank&nbsp; to review and approve the transaction. Figure 5 shows this sequence.

<p>3.3 Summary of SPC Benefits&nbsp;</p>



<p>The benefits provided by SPC include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Cross-origin authentication – Any merchant authorized by a Relying Party can request the&nbsp; generation of a FIDO assertion during a transaction even when they are not the relying party. This&nbsp; provides a better user experience as there is no redirect that is required to the relying party to&nbsp; perform consumer authentication.&nbsp; 



 Consistent user experience with increased trust – With SPC, the consumer has a consistent user&nbsp; experience across all merchants and independently of who plays the role of relying party. In each&nbsp; case, the consumer will see a window displayed by the browser, that includes payment details, the&nbsp; logos of their card / bank / payment scheme, increasing the trust in using FIDO authentication for&nbsp; their payments.&nbsp;
 
 Increased security – With SPC, the FIDO assertion will include payment details in the cryptogram&nbsp; generation such as the merchant identifier and transaction amount, making it difficult to modify any&nbsp; of those details in the transaction without being detected by the bank or payment scheme. This also&nbsp; simplifies the compliance with local regulations such as PSD2 regulation related to dynamic linking. 
 
 
 



 4. Status of SPC Support and Future Enhancement 



<p>4.1 Availability&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secure Payment Confirmation is currently published as a W3C Candidate Recommendation, and there is on going work to include this as an authentication method in EMVCo specifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the availability of the Secure Payment Confirmation API is limited to: </p>



 
 Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers&nbsp; 



 MacOS, Windows, and Android operating systems.&nbsp; 
 



<p>4.2 Future Enhancements&nbsp;</p>



<p>The W3C Web Payments Working Group continues to work and iterate on Secure Payment Confirmation with&nbsp; the goal of improving the security and the user experience when consumers authenticate for payments on the&nbsp; web.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Features currently under consideration include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Improve user and merchant experiences when there is not a credential available on the current&nbsp; device (i.e., a fallback user experience)&nbsp; 



 Improve consumer trust with additional logos being displayed to the user, such as bank logo and&nbsp; card network logo&nbsp; 



 Improve security with support for device binding, with the browser providing access to a&nbsp; browser/device-bound key&nbsp; 



 Consider additional use cases such as recurring payments or support for roaming and hybrid FIDO&nbsp; authenticators 
 



<p>An example of enhanced SPC transaction UX that is under review is illustrated in Figure 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figure 6: SPC transaction UX under review</p>







 5. Conclusion 



<p>Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) is a web standard that has been designed to facilitate the use of strong&nbsp;authentication during payment transactions with best-in-class user experience, where the relying party can be a&nbsp; bank or a payment scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main benefits of SPC are to deliver an improved user experience, with the display of transaction details that&nbsp; the consumer approves with FIDO authentication, and to enable cross-origin authentication when a merchant&nbsp; authenticates a consumer without the need to redirect to the relying party (the bank or the payment scheme).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>SPC also facilitates the inclusion of the transaction details within the FIDO signature, which can help deliver&nbsp; higher security and/or simplify the compliance with local regulations.</p>

 Cost saving estimation for the Use Case „Know your Supplier” based on automated master data management with EUDI wallets for legal entities 



<p>The paper was prepared by the scientific research provider for the program, „Begleitforschung Sichere Digitale Identitäten,“ led by the European School for Management and Technology (ESMT), on behalf of the BMWK.</p>



<p>1 Introduction to the Showcase Program Secure Digital Identities</p>



<p>The German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) is the initiator and funder of the „Secure Digital Identities“ Showcase Program. Over the course of four years (2021 to 2024), the four showcase projects – IDunion, ID-Ideal, ONCE, and SDIKA – have worked on more than 100 use cases related to secure digital identities. These projects have also developed various types of wallets, which have been tested and implemented in multiple pilot environments. The Showcase Program has supported Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) efforts, resulting in the creation of seven edge wallets, three organizational wallets, and one cloud wallet. Within this framework, IDunion has specifically focused on developing organizational identities, including use cases such as „Know-your-supplier.“ This paper outlines the cost savings achieved through automated supplier master data management, leveraging EUDI wallets for legal entities and the EU Company Certificate Attestation (EUCC) issued by QEAA providers in accordance with Company Law. The paper was prepared by the scientific research provider for the program, „Begleitforschung Sichere Digitale Identitäten,“ led by the European School for Management and Technology (ESMT), on behalf of the BMWK.</p>



<p>2 Cost saving estimation</p>



<p>Current situation: Currently corporations maintain their supplier and customer master data records manually, which is time-consuming and leads to errors and redundancies. Large corporations need to maintain and assure high quality of several hundred up to millions of master data records. The maintenance costs per single data set was estimated to 11 €/year. The master data set considered for the cost estimation was limited to company name and address data and therefore is a subset of the data that will be available with the PID for legal person and the EUCC.<br>Solution based on EUDIW: EU Digital Identity Wallets (EDIW), PID for legal entities and public registry extracts (e.g. EUCC) as QEAAs enable almost completely automated management of business partner data. Suppliers present their attestations from their legal entity wallet to customers or legal entity wallets of other business partners. Presentation, verification and the transfer to internal systems is performed automatically. This reduces the number of proprietary data records maintained in parallel and minimizes manual, error-prone data entry.<br>Cost savings: The solution enables annual savings of estimated €85 billion for German companies. Only German companies with more than 2 million sales/year where included in this estimation. It was assumed that only their European business partners provide their data as verifiable attestations. This underscores the transformative impact of the EUDIW solution on master data management and its strategic importance for the private sector on the path to digital efficiency.</p>



<p>Conservative assumptions for the estimation model below<a>1</a></p>



 
 Estimation of master data sets: The estimation is done by estimating the number of potential B2B relationships of  ompanies and assuming that a B2B relationship generates at least one master data set. In practice, however, master data is often stored and replicated in different systems. As this is not considered, the cost savings in the estimation are therefore calculated conservatively. 



 Annual master data maintenance costs: On average, a company incurs annual costs of around €11 per master data maintenance. This estimation is based on an estimation performed by „Verband Deutscher Automobilhersteller“ (VDA). 



 Number of master data sets for large companies: An average of 300,000 master data was assumed for large companies based on project estimates and VDA work. It was also assumed that 60% of the master data per company is attributable to the EU suppliers (i.e. 180,000 master data items on average for large companies) and therefore only these are relevant for the EUDIW-based solution. 



 Scaling based on turnover: The estimated number of B2B relationships of large companies can be scaled to other company sizes based on turnover<a>2</a> 



 Implementation costs: The implementation costs are assumed to be €600 per year for small companies (&lt;€10 million turnover). These costs are scaled to the larger company categories based on turnover. In addition to the implementation costs, companies must purchase the mentioned attestations (LPID, EUCC). The assumed costs are €1,000 per year. These costs are independent of the size of the company. Further implementation costs such as integration into ERP/CRM modules are neglected, as it is assumed that the market leaders will integrate the EUDIW modules accordingly.  



 Very small companies: Due to their high number and heterogeneity in turnover and employee structure, very small companies are not included in the modeling, which leads to a more conservative savings estimate<a>3</a>

 Bridging trust between humans and AI agents with Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and ElizaOS framework <p>In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in robotics, trust is not just a luxury — it’s a necessity. The Three Laws of Robotics, conceptualized by the visionary Isaac Asimov, provide a well-known foundational ethical structure for&nbsp;robots:</p>  A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to&nbsp;harm.  A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First&nbsp;Law.  A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second&nbsp;Law.  <p>Ensuring these laws are adhered to in practice requires more than just programming; it necessitates a system where the knowledge upon which AI agents operate is transparent, verifiable, and trusted. This is where OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) comes into play, offering a groundbreaking approach to enhancing the trustworthiness of&nbsp;AI.</p> Transparency and verifiability <p>One of the key aspects of the DKG is its capacity for transparency. By organizing AI-grade Knowledge Assets (KAs) in a decentralized manner, DKG ensures that the data AI agents use to make decisions can be traced back to their origins, with any tampering or modifications of that data being transparently recorded and verifiable on the blockchain. This is crucial for the First Law, where transparency in data sourcing can prevent AI from making decisions that might harm humans due to incorrect or biased information.</p> Ownership and&nbsp;control <p>The DKG allows for each Knowledge Asset to be associated with a non-fungible token (NFT), providing clear ownership and control over the information. This aspect directly impacts how AI agents adhere to the Second Law. Namely, by allowing agents to own their knowledge, DKG empowers AI agents to respond to human commands based on a robust, reliable data set that they control, ensuring they follow human directives while also adhering to the ethical boundaries set by the laws. This capability also allows agents to monetize Knowledge Assets that they have created (i.e. charge other agents (AI or human) for accessing their structured data), enabling agents’ economic independence.</p> Contextual understanding and decision-making <p>The semantic capabilities of DKG provide AI with a richer context for understanding the world — an ontological, symbolic world model to complement GenAI inferencing, which is vital for the Third Law. The interconnected nature of knowledge in the DKG means it is contextualized better, allowing AI to make decisions with a comprehensive view of the situation. For example, understanding the broader implications of self-preservation in contexts where human safety is paramount ensures that robots do not prioritize their existence over human well-being.</p> Building trust through decentralization <p>Decentralization is at the heart of the DKG’s effectiveness in fostering trust:</p>  Avoiding centralized control: Traditional centralized databases can be points of failure or manipulation, especially in multi-agent scenarios. In contrast, DKG distributes control, reducing the risk of misuse or bias in AI decision-making. This decentralized approach helps build a collective, trustworthy intelligence that aligns with human values and&nbsp;safety.  Community contribution: DKG facilitates a crowdsourced approach to knowledge, where contributions from various stakeholders can enrich the AI’s understanding of ethical and practical scenarios, further aligning AI behavior with the Three Laws. This community aspect also encourages ongoing vigilance and updates to the knowledge base, ensuring AI systems remain relevant and&nbsp;safe.   Grow and read AI Agents’ minds with the ChatDKG framework powered by DKG and&nbsp;ElizaOS <p>The upgrade of ChatDKG marks a pioneering moment, combining the power of the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) with the ElizaOS framework to create the first AI agent of its kind. Empowered by DKG, <a href="https://x.com/ChatDKG">ChatDKG</a> utilizes the DKG as collective memory to store and retrieve information in a transparent, verifiable manner, allowing for an unprecedented level of interaction where humans can essentially “read the AI’s mind” by accessing its data and thought processes. This unique feature not only enhances transparency but also fosters trust between humans and&nbsp;AI.</p><p>The integration with ElizaOS is based on a <a href="https://github.com/branarakic/elizagraph/">dedicated DKG plugin</a>, with which ElizaOS agents can create contextually rich knowledge graph memories, storing structured information about their experiences, insights, and decisions. These memories can be shared and made accessible across the DKG network, forming a collective pool of knowledge graph memories. This allows individual agents to access, analyze, and learn from the experiences of other agents, creating a dynamic ecosystem where collaboration drives network effects between memories. See an example memory knowledge graph created by the ChatDKG agent&nbsp;<a href="https://dkg.origintrail.io/explore?ual=did:dkg:otp:2043/0x8f678eb0e57ee8a109b295710e23076fa3a443fe/516350">here</a>.</p><p>Tapping into collective memory will be enhanced with strong agent reputation systems and robust knowledge graph verification mechanisms. Agents can assess the trustworthiness of shared memories, avoiding hallucinations or false data while making decisions. This not only enables more confident and precise decision-making but also empowers agent swarms to operate with unprecedented coherence and accuracy. Whether predicting trends, solving complex problems, or coordinating large-scale tasks, agents will be able to achieve a new level of intelligence and reliability.</p><p>Yet, this is only the beginning of the journey toward “collective neuro-symbolic AI,” where the synthesis of symbolic reasoning and deep learning, enriched by shared, verifiable knowledge, will redefine the boundaries of artificial intelligence. The possibilities for collaborative intelligence are limitless, paving the way for systems that think, learn, and evolve together.</p><p>Moreover, ChatDKG invites users to contribute to its memory base, growing and refining its knowledge through direct interaction. This interactive approach leverages the ElizaOS framework’s capabilities to ensure that each exchange informs the AI and enriches its understanding, making it a dynamic participant in the evolving landscape of knowledge.</p><p>Talk to the ChatDKG AI agent on X to grow and read his&nbsp;memory!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/bridging-trust-between-humans-and-ai-agents-with-decentralized-knowledge-graph-dkg-and-elizaos-14aab4c32701">Bridging trust between humans and AI agents with Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and ElizaOS…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>ABSTRACT: By grounding technical decisions in ethical values, we can create compassionate digital architectures. This article examines how core human values such as dignity, autonomy, and human rights inform the design of trustworthy digital systems to enable progressive trust, safeguard privacy, promote individual choice, and build resilient systems resistant to coercion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>As we enter 2025, I’m reflecting on a journey of decades that has been dedicated to advancing privacy, security, and human autonomy in the digital age. My body of work dates back to the 1990s, which saw my early contributions with cryptographic pioneers and my co-authorship of the IETF TLS 1.0 standard. But this year marks the 10th anniversary of the first <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">“Rebooting Web of Trust” workshop</a>, which was a real milestone for my leadership role in shaping secure technologies such as <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers standard</a>.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, my focus as a trust architect has sharpened on designing digital systems that empower individuals while respecting core values such as autonomy and human dignity. These designs play a critical role in how individuals express themselves, engage with communities, and pursue their aspirations in a world increasingly shaped by digital interactions.</p>

<p>Yet, this digital realm presents a dual reality. While it opens up unprecedented opportunities, it also makes us increasingly vulnerable to exploitation, coercion, and pervasive surveillance. This tension places a profound responsibility on architects of digital systems: we must ensure that technical designs are guided by deeply rooted human values and ethical principles.</p>

<p>Looking ahead to the next ten years, I reaffirm my commitment to these values, charting a course for the future that places human flourishing and trust at the center of technological progress. But to fulfill this commitment requires the complex answer to a simple question: how can we design systems that uphold dignity, autonomy, and human rights?</p>

 The Core Values of Autonomy &amp; Dignity 

<p>When we design digital systems, we’re not just creating technical specifications. We’re crafting spaces where people will live significant portions of their lives. To give them the ability to truly live and excel, we must give them automony: a digital system must empower individuals to control their own destinies within this digital realm. To do so, it must provide them with tools that:</p>

 
   Protect their data. 
   Exercise control over their digital presence. 
   Ensure freedom from coercion. 
   Cultivate trust through direct, transparent &amp; efficient peer-to-peer interactions. 
   Facilitate interactions built on trust and agency. 
   Enable meaningful participation in the digital economy. 
   Support engagement that aligns with their values and priorities. 
   Foster resilience against systemic vulnerabilities. 
   Operate seamlessly across jurisdictions and political boundaries 
 

<p>(See my “Principles of Dignity, Autonomy, and Trust in Digital Systems” in the Appendix for a more extensive look at what I consider core values for digital system design.)</p>

<p>Providing individuals with digital autonomy is mirrored by the concept of digital dignity. A digital system that prioritizes dignity respects the individuality of its users and safeguards their right to privacy. It minimizes the data collected, provides clear and revocable consent mechanisms, and ensures that control remains in the hands of the user. A dignified system doesn’t simply protect; it fosters agency and participation, allowing individuals to thrive without fear of surveillance, discrimination, or exploitation.</p>

<p>Autonomy is also closely linked to the concept of trust. You must be able to know and trust your peers in order to truly have the autonomy to make meaningful decisions. This is where systems like <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/progressive-trust/">progressive trust</a> come in.</p>

<p>A system built on autonomy, dignity, and trust ultimately treats individuals as more than their administrative identities; it recognizes that individuals possess an ineffable core of self that transcends digital representation. The first <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/#ten-principles-of-self-sovereign-identity">principle of Self-Sovereign Identity</a>, ‘Existence,’ upholds this kernel of individuality, affirming that any digital identity must respect and support the inherent worth of the person behind it.</p>

<p>To properly respect autonomy and dignity also requires careful attention to power dynamics and accountability. Distinct standards of transparency and privacy should address the power imbalances between individuals and institutions. Achieving this balance involves respecting individual privacy while enabling appropriate oversight of powerful institutions. We must protect the vulnerable while ensuring our larger administrative systems remain fair and just.</p>

<p>We must also address the crucial question: how do we make privacy-preserving technology economically accessible to everyone? Any autonomy-enabling digital system must balance individual and collective interests by supporting sustainable development of digital infrastructure while fostering individual economic sovereignty and resilience. We must reward contributions to shared resources, uphold autonomy and self-determination, and ensure equitable access to rights-preserving technologies. By protecting individual freedoms and enabling fairness, privacy can ultimately be a tool that encourages participation regardless of economic means.</p>

<p>Decentralized identity wallets offer an example of how to embody the characteristics of autonomy, dignity, and trust, while also considering issues such as privacy, balance, and accessibility. They empower individuals to securely prove their credentials (such as educational achievements or professional certifications) directly to peers, without relying on central authorities that could arbitrarily deny their accomplishments. Consider Maria, a small business owner living in a vibrant but economically challenged favela neighborhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Using a self-sovereign, decentralized identity wallet provided by the city, she is able to secure microloans without compromising her privacy, a triumph for both dignity and autonomy.</p>

<p>As for how these core values transform into the design principles of decentralized identity wallets: that’s the next question to address.</p>

 From Values to Design Principles 

<p>The translation of the core values of autonomy,  dignity, and trust into concrete design principles shapes every aspect of trust architectures I build and guides me to specific technical choices:</p>

 
   Cryptographically secure, self-certifying identifiers that operate independently of central authorities. 
   Local or collaborative key generation and management to keep control in users’ hands. 
   Peer-to-peer protocols that resist centralized rent-seeking and walled gardens. 
   Offline-first capabilities to prevent connectivity from becoming a point of coercion. 
   Data minimization by default. 
   Choices for elision and redaction to control what individuals share. 
   Cryptographic selective disclosure to prevent unwanted correlation and tracking. 
   Revocable permissions to ensure users retain ongoing control over their information. 
   Zero-knowledge proofs or other systems that can balance privacy and accountability without enabling bad actors. 
   Decentralized architectures, not as an ideological preference, but as a practical necessity. 
 

<p>The importance of these protections isn’t theoretical. My work examining sensitive data — including <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Dangerous-Wellness-Data/">wellness</a>, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Dangerous-Educational-Credentials/">educational credentials</a>, <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/use-cases/summary/#financial-industry-use-cases">financial transactions</a>, and identity documentation — has revealed how seemingly benign information can threaten human rights when misused. Health data can enable discrimination or coercion. Educational records can create permanent, unchangeable markers that limit opportunities. Financial and identity data can be weaponized to exploit or disenfranchise individuals.</p>

<p>A values-driven design can therefore be seen as not just an abstract focus on ideals such as autonomy, but protection against real-world harms. The rights to be forgotten, to correct errors, and to recover from systemic or administrative injustices ensure fairness in digital interactions. The ability for an individual to selectively share aspects of their identity protects from being reduced to digital records or confined to singular contexts.</p>

 From Design Principles to Education 

<p>Implementing human-centric design patterns reveals another challenge: helping developers to understand not just the technical complexity, but the human purpose behind each design choice. Developers must grasp not only how their systems operate but they must think critically about why their design decisions matter for privacy, autonomy, and dignity.</p>

<p>While technical resources such as documentation and tutorials are indispensable for this education, true progress depends on fostering a compasionate culture where developers internalize value-driven imperatives. This has led me to prioritize the cultivation of decentralized developer ecosystems rooted in collaboration, open development standards, and shared learning. I’ve done this through a variety of means:</p>

 
   Workshops that convene developers, policymakers, and advocates to share insights, collaborate, and explore innovative approaches. 
   Hackathons and Sprints addressing pressing challenges in digital trust, enabling participants to co-create solutions in hands-on environments. 
   Regular Developer Meetups for discussing current challenges, sharing practical experiences, and aligning on future roadmaps. 
   Peer Review and Collaboration Forums to ensure transparency, accountability, and robust feedback in the development processes. 
   Cross-Organization Coordination to facilitate collaborative projects, share resources, and distribute financial and time-related investments such as security reviews. 
   Ecosystem Building to design decentralized solutions that balance individual empowerment with collective benefit, ensuring that all contributors — users, developers, and communities — derive meaningful value and that mutual respect is cultivated through shared goals and open participation. 
   Mentorship Programs to guide emerging developers in adopting values-driven approaches, fostering ethical practices from the outset of their careers. 
   Advocacy Efforts that include collaborating with policymakers and regulators to define a techno-social contract that upholds human dignity, ensures equitable and compassionate digital rights, and protects the interests of the vulnerable. 
 

<p>With this decentralized, collaborative approach to education, no single entity controls the evolution of these technologies. Instead, innovation is fostered across a diverse network of developers, building resilience into these systems and ensuring that solutions remain adaptable, inclusive, and accessible. This cooperative spirit reflects the very principles of autonomy, compassion, and inclusivity that underpin trustworthy digital systems.</p>

 From Education to Implementation 

<p>As communities evolve from educational groups to implementation groups, forums and discussions continue to expand the community and allow us to address the broader societal implications of technical choices. Foundational principles should follow.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">The Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity</a> is an example of a set of foundational principles that directly evolved from discussion at an educational workshop (<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot2-id2020/">RWOT2</a>). The <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">Gordian Principles</a> and Privacy by Demand are other examples of core principles that evolved out of earlier discussions. Principles such as these form a bedrock for the values we will work to embed in actual implementations.</p>

<p>Code reviews and project evaluations should then include these principles — and more generally ethical alignment — as a key criterion. They’re not just about technical correctness! By embedding values into every stage of development, we ensure that systems are designed to empower individuals, not exploit them.</p>

<p>How can we manage the critical balance between transparency for accountability and privacy for individuals? How do we address power dynamics and ensure systems protect the rights of the vulnerable while holding powerful entities accountable? Ultimately, how do we prioritize both user autonomy and security in decisions around data storage, key management, or cryptographic algorithms? These are questions that should both arise and be addressed when considering a full education-to-implementation pipeline that is based on collaboration and the consideration of values.</p>

<p>Ultimately, implementing systems that respect dignity and autonomy demands a new kind of techno-social contract. This contract must bridge multiple realms:</p>

 
   The technical capabilities that make solutions possible. 
   The cultural shifts that make them acceptable. 
   The economic incentives that make them sustainable. 
   The political will that makes them viable. 
   The contractual &amp; legislative agreements that makes them durable. 
 

<p>This comprehensive approach will serve both individual autonomy and our collective commons.</p>

<p>By ensuring that digital trust and human dignity remain at the core of technological progress, we build systems that serve as a foundation for a more equitable, humane, and resilient digital future. The result is implementations that transcend technical excellence by instilling a sense of stewardship among developers. They become not just the creators of secure systems but also champions of the communities these systems serve.</p>

 From Implementation to Deployment 

<p>Any framework to support values such as autonomy, dignity, and trust must be holistic in its approach.</p>

 
   Technical standards and specifications must harmonize with cultural norms and social expectations. 
   Economic models must simultaneously foster individual resilience and collective benefits, ensuring that privacy and autonomy remain accessible to everyone, and don’t become luxuries available only to the wealthy. 
   Cultural norms and legislative efforts must go beyond surface-level privacy protections, addressing both the technical realities and human needs at stake. 
   Most importantly, technical and political discourse must evolve to recognize digital rights as fundamental human rights. This paradigm shift would enable policies that support compassionate decentralized approaches while holding powerful actors accountable to the communities they serve. 
 

<p>Nurturing the collaborative ecosystems plays a central role in this transformation. We must foster cultures of ethical awareness not just among developers but across society. This means supporting implementers and maintainers who understand not just the “how” of our systems, but the “why”. It means engaging leaders who grasp both technical constraints and human needs and creating sustainable economic models that reward contributions to the commons while protecting individual rights.</p>

<p>Legal deployment has always been one of the trickiest challenges in popularizing a system that supports individual autonomy, but the concept of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">Principal Authority</a> presents a promising foundation, courtesy of Wyoming’s digital identity law. It goes beyond the traditional frameworks of property and contract law, which, while useful, are insufficient in addressing the unique challenges of digital identity.</p>

<p>Property law focuses on ownership and control and contract law governs agreements between parties, but neither fully captures the dynamic, relational nature of digital representations or the need for individual agency in decentralized systems. Principal Authority, grounded in Agency Law, functions much like the relationship between a principal and an agent in traditional legal contexts. For instance, just as an agent (like a lawyer or real estate agent) acts on behalf of a principal while preserving the principal’s control, Wyoming’s digital identity law ensures that individuals retain ultimate authority over any actions or representations made on their behalf in the digital space. This legal framework acknowledges human agency — not mere ownership or contractual consent — as the primary source of legitimate authority. The result is a modern recognition of individual sovereignty, and therefore autonomy, that still fosters collaboration and commerce in the increasingly interconnected digital realm.</p>

<p>But, even if Principal Authority does prove a useful tool, it’s just one tool in a whole toolkit that will be necessarily to successfully deploy rights-supporting software into society.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>My responsibility as a trust architect is not simply to build systems that work, but to build systems that work for humanity. This requires a steadfast commitment to values, a willingness to navigate difficult trade-offs, and a relentless focus on aligning design principles with human needs.</p>

<p>The technical challenges of implementing values-driven design are significant, but they’re challenges worth solving. When we build systems that respect human rights and dignity, we create digital spaces that enhance rather than diminish human flourishing.</p>

<p>As developers, policy makers, or advocates, we hold the power to embed human values into every line of code, every standard, and every policy. As we build tomorrow’s digital ecosystems, we must therefore ask: What can I do to make trust and dignity the foundation of our systems?</p>

<p>To answer that question in a positive way will ultimately require a multi-stakeholder effort where technologists, policy makers, and civil society collaborate to uphold principles of equity, inclusion, and transparency in all aspects of digital architecture, down the entire linked chain from values to design to education to implementation to deployment.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll be part of that undertaking.</p>

 Appendix 1: Principles of Dignity, Autonomy, and Trust in Digital Systems 

<p>While working on this article, I put together my own principles for dignity, autonomy, and trust in digital systems. As with my self-sovereign principles of a decade ago, I am offering these up for discussion in the community.</p>

 
   1. Human Dignity. Design systems that prioritize and respect the inherent dignity of every individual. Embed privacy protections, minimize data collection, and provide clear, revocable consent mechanisms that align with user empowerment. Protect individuals from harm while fostering compassionate digital environments that promote trust, human flourishing, and technological progress aligned with human-centric values, actively considering potential societal impacts and unintended consequences. 
   2. Autonomy &amp; Self-Determination: Empower individuals to control their digital identities and make decisions free from coercion or undue influence. Enable them to manage their interactions, transact freely, preserve their sovereignty, act as peers not petitioners, and assert their rights through decentralized, compassionate, user-controlled systems. 
   3. Privacy by Design (&amp; Default): Embed robust privacy protections into every system, implementing data minimization, selective disclosure, anti-correlation, and cryptographic safeguards as default practices. This ensures that users retain control over their information and remain shielded from tracking, correlation, and coercion. 
   4. Resilience Against Exploitation: Architect systems to withstand adversarial threats and systemic vulnerabilities. Leverage decentralization, cryptographic protections, and offline-first capabilities to empower users even in hostile and adversarial environments and to ensure autonomy remains intact under pressure. 
   5. Progressive Trust: Design systems that reflect the natural evolution of trust, enabling selective and intentional information sharing. Foster trust gradually through mutual engagement, avoiding premature commitments, unnecessary reliance on intermediaries, or imposed full disclosure. 
   6. Transparency &amp; Accountability: Hold powerful institutions accountable while safeguarding individual privacy. Balance transparency with confidentiality to mitigate power imbalances, protect the vulnerable, and ensure justice and fairness in digital interactions. Ensure that innovation and system development prioritize fairness and compassionate considerations, holding powerful institutions accountable for societal impacts. 
   7. Interoperability: Foster systems that are interoperable across cultural, legal, and jurisdictional boundaries. Promote inclusivity by prioritizing open standards, decentralized infrastructures, and accessible tools that serve diverse communities while avoiding exclusivity or centralized gatekeeping. 
   8. Adaptive Design: Incorporate insights from Living Systems Theory, Ostrom’s Commons, and other governance and design models to build architectures that are dynamic, resilient, and capable of evolving alongside societal and technological changes. Emphasize adaptability through iterative growth, collective stewardship, and interoperability, balancing stability with flexibility to support sustainable and inclusive digital ecosystems. 
   9. A Techno-Social Contract: Bridge technical capabilities with cultural, economic, and legislative frameworks to create a sustainable, human and civil rights-preserving digital ecosystem. Recognize digital rights as fundamental human rights and align systems with shared values of autonomy, dignity, and collective benefit. 
   10. Ethics: Cultivate a culture of ethical awareness, critical thinking, and collaboration among developers, policymakers, and users. Ensure technical decisions align with principles of trust and dignity by embedding education, mentorship, and a commitment to shared responsibility in the development process. Encourage innovation that is mindful of societal impacts, fostering a development ethos that prioritizes responsibility and safeguards against unintended consequences. 
 

 Appendix 2: Use Cases for Values Designs 

<p>Values affect all of my designs. Following is some discussion of how it’s influenced my work on self-sovereign identity and progressive trust.</p>

 Self-Sovereign Identity 

<p>The conviction that technical designs must be built on human values came into sharp focus for me in 2016 when I authored the <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">10 Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity</a>. These principles were not born from technical specifications alone but from a deep commitment to dignity, autonomy, and human rights. Over time, those values have guided the development of technologies such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and the DIDComm protocol for secure, private communication. They have also influenced broader thinking around cryptographic digital assets such as Bitcoin. I have come to see these values not as abstract ideals but as the very foundation of trust itself: principles that must underpin every digital system we create.</p>

<p>My principles of Self-Sovereign Identity also had a strong historical basis: they were built on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">a deep historical and philosophical foundation</a>. The concept of sovereignty has evolved over centuries — from feudal lords to city-states to nations — consistently reflecting a balance between autonomy and interconnection. When I wrote about the principle of “Control”, it was not about advocating absolute dominion but about framing sovereignty as the right to individual agency and prosperity, much like medieval cities, which preserved their independence while flourishing within broader networks of trade and diplomacy.</p>

<p>This understanding was deeply influenced by Living Systems Theory, which shows how every entity maintains its autonomy through selective boundaries while remaining part of a larger ecosystem. Just as a cell’s membrane allows it to control what passes in and out while still participating in the larger organism, digital identity must enable both individual autonomy and collective participation. This biological metaphor directly informed principles such as “Existence” and “Persistence,” which recognize that identity must be long-lived but also able to interact with its environment, and “Access” and “Portability”, which define how identity information flows across boundaries.</p>

<p>The principles also reflect Ostrom’s insights about managing common resources as well as feminist perspectives on sovereignty that emphasize agency over control. When I wrote about the principles of “Consent” and “Protection”, I was describing the selective permeability of these digital boundaries—not walls that isolate, but membranes that enable controlled interaction. “Interoperability” and “Minimization” similarly emerged from understanding how sovereign entities must interact while maintaining their independence and protecting their core rights.</p>

<p>These concepts culminate in the final SSI Principles such as “Transparency,” which balances individual autonomy with collective needs, and “Portability,” which ensures that identities can move and evolve just as living systems do. Each principle reflects this interplay between values and technical implementation, creating a framework where digital sovereignty serves human dignity. They weren’t meant to be an endpoint but rather a starting point for an evolving discussion about sovereignty in the digital age — one that continues to guide our work as we push the boundaries of what’s possible in digital identity, ensuring our innovations prioritize human needs rather than subordinating them to technology.</p>

<p>The technical complexity required to implement such systems is significant, but it serves a deeply human purpose: the ability to build autonomy and trust.</p>

 Progressive Trust 

<p>Trust is not static; it evolves over time — a concept I describe as <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/progressive-trust/">progressive trust</a>. This principle reflects how trust naturally develops between people and organizations, both in the physical and digital worlds. Relationships are built incrementally, through selective and intentional disclosures, rather than being imposed upfront or dictated solely by third-party intermediaries. This gradual evolution is essential for fostering genuine connections while mitigating risks.</p>

<p>I discovered this concept through years of observing how people actually build relationships. For instance, when meeting someone at a conference, we don’t immediately share our life story. Instead, we begin with small exchanges, revealing more information as comfort, context, and mutual understanding grow. Digital systems must mirror this natural evolution of trust, creating environments that respect psychological needs and empower individual agency.</p>

<p>A well-designed system transforms these ideas about progressive trust into deployable systems by enabling users to disclose only what is necessary at each stage, while retaining the ability to refine or revoke permissions as relationships deepen, change, or dissolve. This flexibility demands advanced technical solutions, such as:</p>

 
   Sophisticated cryptographic protocols that enable selective and intentional disclosure. 
   Relationship-specific identifiers to ensure contextual privacy. 
   Mechanisms to prevent unwanted tracking or correlation. 
   Tools that balance transparency with security, safeguarding trust while avoiding vulnerabilities that could undermine it. 
 

<p>The technical complexity required to implement such systems is significant, but it serves a deeply human purpose: enabling individuals to build trust incrementally, naturally, and on their own terms.</p>

<p>Knowing the values we are aligning with from the start helps to define this sort, even (as with progressive trust) when it’s hard. The result is an architecture that not only reflects the organic nature of human relationships but also upholds autonomy, fosters confidence, and protects against coercion or exploitation.</p>

<p>This came in the mail today:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Everything they list is something I don’t want to do. I’d rather just accumulate the miles. But I can’t, unless I choose one of the annoyances above, or book a flight in the next three months.</p>
<p>So my customer journey with American is now derailed.</p>
<p>There should be better ways for customers and companies to have journeys together.</p>
<p>Hmm… Does United have one?</p>
<p>Here’s a picture of my customer journey with United Airlines, as of today:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’m also a lifetime member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Club">United Club</a>, thanks to my wife’s wise decision in 1990 to get us both in on that short-lived deal.</p>
<p>Premier Platinum privileges include up to three checked bags, default seating in Economy Plus (more legroom than in the rest of Economy), Premium lines at the ticket counter and Security, and boarding in Group One. There are more privileged castes, but this one is a serious tie-breaker against other airlines. Also, in all our decades of flying with United, we have no bad stories to tell, and plenty of good ones.</p>
<p>But now we’re mostly based in Bloomington, Indiana, so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_International_Airport">Indianapolis (IND)</a> is our main airport. (And it’s terrific. We recommend it highly.) It is also not a hub for any of the airlines. The airline with the most flights connecting to IND is American, and we’ve used them. I joined their frequent flier program, got their app, and started racking up miles with them too.</p>
<p>So here is one idea, for every airline: having respect for one’s established status with other airlines means something. Because that status (or those stati) are credentials: They say something about me as a potential passenger. It would be nice also if what I carry, as an <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2024/11/21/the-independent-customer/">independent customer</a>, is a set of verifiable preferences—such as that I always prefer a window seat, never tow a rolling bag on board (I only have a backpack), and am willing to change seats so a family can sit together. Little things that might matter.</p>
<p>I bring all this up because fixing “loyalty” programs shouldn’t be left up only to the sellers of the world. They’ll all do their fixes differently, and they’ll remain deaf to good input that can only come from independent customers with helpful tools of their own.</p>
<p>Developing those solutions to the loyalty problem is one of our callings at ProjectVRM. I also know some that are in the works. Stay tuned. </p>

<p>Bias in biometric identity systems still exists, but it is manageable, argues Andrew Shikiar at the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>When you unlock your smartphone, open your bank app, or approve a purchase on your laptop, you are using biometric authentication. It is such an unconscious part of our daily lives that if you blink, you might miss it.</p>



<p>It’s no wonder that biometrics are popular with consumers—they’re convenient and secure. Recent FIDO research found that consumers want to use biometrics to verify themselves online more, especially in sensitive use cases like financial services, where one out of two people said they would use biometric technology (48%). In fact, in the FIDO Aliance’s latest&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/research-findings-consumer-trends-and-attitudes-towards-authentication-methods/">online barometer survey</a>, consumers ranked biometrics as the most secure and preferred way to log in by consumers.</p>



<p>But for consumers, governments and other implementers, there is still a lingering ‘elephant in the room’ that continues to disrupt adoption: bias.</p>



<p>Should we worry about bias in biometrics?</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance’s research,&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/remote-identity-verification-biometric-systems-consumer-insights-2024">Remote ID Verification – Bringing Confidence to Biometric Systems Consumer Insights 2024</a>, found that consumers are concerned about bias in biometric facial verification systems– while the majority of consumers (56%) felt confident face biometrics systems could accurately identify individuals, a number still had concerns around discrimination present in some systems.</p>



<p>Concern surrounding the accuracy of biometric systems in processing diverse demographics has been developing in recent years. In the UK in 2021, for example, Uber drivers from diverse ethnic backgrounds took&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/05/ex-uber-driver-takes-legal-action-over-racist-face-recognition-software">legal action</a>&nbsp;over claims its software had illegally terminated their contracts as its software was unable to recognise them.</p>



<p>While the struggle of Uber drivers is just one example that underscores the issue, this problem is affecting people of colour and other underrepresented demographics more broadly—FIDO’s research found that one in four respondents feel they experience regular discrimination when using automated facial biometric systems (25%).</p>



<p>Feelings of discrimination and bias in facial recognition systems impact the entire user experience and erode faith in the technology overall. Half of British consumers in the survey said they would&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-addresses-accuracy-bias-in-remote-biometric-identity-verification-technologies-industry-first-testing-certification-program/">lose trust</a>&nbsp;in a brand or institution if it were found to have a biassed biometric system, and 22% would stop using the service entirely.</p>



<p>It’s clear why organisations like governments and banks would worry about these hard-hitting reputational and trust risks. Despite biometrics being widely accepted as a more convenient and highly secure technology, the small number of systems that aren’t as accessible are leaving an air of concern that is slowing down more mainstream adoption.</p>



<p>Addressing bias in facial verification&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most important thing to note is that not all biometric systems are created equal. Currently, testing levels are done on a case-by-case basis for each organisation, which is both costly and time-consuming, with varying definitions of what “good” looks like.</p>



<p>Based on proven ISO standards and developed by a diverse, international panel of industry, government, and identity experts, FIDO Alliance’s new&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/face-verification/">Face Verification Certification</a>&nbsp;program brings the industry’s first independent certification to market to build trust around biometric systems’ performance.</p>



<p>The certification assesses a face verification system’s performance across different demographics, including skin tone, age, and gender, in addition to far more wide-reaching security and performance tests.</p>



<p>The intensive security and liveness testing also verify that a provider’s face verification system can accurately confirm identities are real and authenticating in real-time, keeping threats like identity theft and deepfakes at bay. This is especially important for the most common use cases of face verification, like creating secure accounts, authenticating users, recovering accounts, and resetting passwords.</p>



<p>The beauty of independent certification is it sends a clear signal to consumers, potential clients, and auditors that the technology has been independently tested and is ready for both commercial and government use. It’s about building trust and showing that the provider takes security and fairness seriously.</p>



<p>More broadly, certification and independent global testing spark innovation and boost technological adoption. Whether you’re launching an identity verification solution or integrating it into regulations, open standards and certification provide a clear performance benchmark. This streamlines efforts, boosts stakeholder confidence and ultimately enhances the performance of all solutions on the market.</p>



<p>The future of identity&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the way we verify digital identities keeps evolving and demand to prove who we are remotely increases, biometric systems must be independently verified and free from bias. All technologies rolled out to this scale need to be fair and reliable for everyone.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance’s program demonstrates solution providers are serious about making sure biometric identity verification technologies are trustworthy, secure, and inclusive for all users. It’s like having a gold star or a seal of approval that says, “Hey, you can trust this system to be fair and safe.”</p>



<p>Biometrics for online identity verification is not just a promising concept; it’s rapidly becoming a practical necessity in today’s increasingly digital world. They’re ready for implementation across various industries. With independent certification, organisations can jump over the final hurdle to widespread adoption, empowering a future of more seamless, digital and remote identity.</p>

<p>FIDO passkey adoption doubles in 2024 as major firms opt for passwordless log-in</p>



<p>Passkeys are a biometric security trend to watch in 2025. The&nbsp;FIDO Alliance&nbsp;themed its 11th annual FIDO Tokyo Seminar on how passkey adoption is accelerating, with presentations from Google, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Mastercard, and other organizations joining the journey to password-free living. Microsoft has confirmed its advice on how to make people love passkeys – as it sweeps aside a major vulnerability that exposed 400 million Outlook 365 users.</p>



<p>Major tech brands drive mainstreaming of passkey account log-ins</p>



<p>In 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202410/amazon-is-ready-to-use-digital-identity-even-though-its-hard">Amazon</a>&nbsp;made passkeys available to 100 percent of its users and has seen 175 million passkeys created for sign-in to amazon.com globally. Google says 800 million Google accounts now use passkeys, with more than 2.5 billion passkey sign-ins over the past two years and sign-in success rates improving by 30 percent. Sony&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202412/passkey-adoption-by-australian-govt-banks-drives-wider-passwordless-authentication">adopted passkeys</a>&nbsp;for the global Playstation gaming community and saw a 24 percent reduction in sign-in time on its web applications.</p>



<p>Hyatt, IBM, Target and TikTok are among firms that have added&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/passkey-adoption-high-among-young-users-tired-of-endless-gyf5uu27">passkeys</a>&nbsp;to their workforce authentication options. More credential management products offering passkey options means more flexibility for consumers.</p>



<p>Japan joins passkey party in private sector, academia</p>



<p>The Japanese market showed a notable turn toward passkeys, with Nikkei, Nulab and Tokyu Corporation among firms embracing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202410/passwordless-authentication-for-healthcare-possible-with-biometrics-imprivata">passwordless authentication</a>&nbsp;technology. Nikkei will deploy passkeys for Nikkei ID as early as February 2025. Tokyu Corporation says 45 percent of TOKYU ID users have passkeys. And Nulab announced a “dramatic improvement in passkey adoption.”</p>



<p>Academia is helping drive innovation, with teams from Keio University and Waseda University winning acknowledgement for their research and prototypes at a slew of hackathons and workshops.</p>



<p>And FIDO, of course, is there to offer support, now offering its Passkey Central website resource on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.passkeycentral.org/ja/home/">passkey implementation</a>&nbsp;in Japanese, so that Japanese companies can take better advantage of its introductory materials, implementation strategies, UX&nbsp; and design guidelines and detailed roll-out guides.</p>



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/working-groups/">The FIDO Japan Working Group</a>, which includes 66 of the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/">FIDO Alliance’s member companies</a>, is now in its 9th year of working to raise passkey awareness in the country.</p>

<p>The Swiss Parliament has resolved all outstanding differences between the National Council and the Council of States regarding the Electronic Identity Act (BGEID), paving the way for a formal final vote scheduled for December 20, 2024.</p>
<p>The implementation of SWIYU, encompassing both the electronic identity and its underlying trust infrastructure, has a potential to establish an open, interoperable ecosystem for digital credentials. This framework can&nbsp; be a solid foundation for the secure exchange of authentic data, thus fostering trustworthiness across digital applications in public administration, the economy, and civil society. Key principles of SWIYU and the e-ID include privacy by design, data minimization, user-centricity, and a commitment to openness and collaboration. We, at DIDAS, expect SWIYU, when fully implemented,&nbsp; to serve as an important building block&nbsp; promoting confidence in the digital realm, boosting economic growth and digital inclusion.</p>
<p>The new Swiss electronic identity (e-ID) system takes a completely different approach compared to the model that was rejected by voters in 2021. Unlike the earlier proposal, which handed the responsibility for issuing and managing digital identities to private companies, the new system is entirely state-operated. This ensures that the government, as a public entity, is responsible for issuing e-IDs and maintaining the necessary infrastructure. This change directly addresses the privacy and security concerns raised previously, making societal control easier. The updated framework is designed around user empowerment, with privacy by design and data minimization as fundamental principles, ensuring transparency and building confidence in its use.</p>
<p>What’s truly transformative is the system’s decentralized architecture, drawing its inspiration from Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles. This gives individuals control over their own digital identities, and ability to decide what information to share with 3rd parties, such as service providers. The design aligns with the “trust diamond” framework, which organizes four essential roles: the government as the issuer, individuals as the holders, service providers as the verifiers, and a governance framework that ensures everything operates within clear, enforceable and trusted rules. This structure creates a reliable and secure ecosystem for digital identity, addressing shortcomings of the previous E-ID vision resulting in a user-centric, privacy-preserving approach.</p>
<p>DIDAS is exceptionally proud to have made a number of key contributions to Switzerland’s efforts, ensuring the system reflects fundamental Swiss values such as federalism, direct democracy, self-determination, and autonomy. Since its inception in 2020, DIDAS has been a strong advocate for SSI principles, emphasizing user control over personal data and a need for a secure, privacy-preserving digital ecosystem. It has been an integral part of our vision that&nbsp; a digital trust ecosystem must safeguard privacy but also enable economic value creation.</p>
<p>Early Advocacy and Strategic Vision</p>
<p>In October 2020, DIDAS was established with the primary goal of positioning Switzerland as a <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/2020/10/01/the-new-home-for-self-sovereign-identity-ecosystem-in-switzerland/">leader in developing and implementing privacy-preserving technologies</a>, services, and products related to digital identity and electronically verifiable data. This vision laid the groundwork for a digital trust ecosystem that emphasizes data sovereignty and identity management based on tight alignment with the SSI principles.</p>
<p>Early Advocacy for Self-Sovereign Identity Principles</p>
<p>In December 2021, DIDAS published an <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/2021/12/17/self-sovereign-identity-explainer-introduction-to-the-world-of-ssi/">explainer on SSI</a>, outlining its core principles and the association’s commitment to establishing a viable and thriving SSI ecosystem. The DIDAS initiative aimed from the start to educate stakeholders and promote the adoption of SSI principles and frameworks within Switzerland’s digital infrastructure, for a more privacy preserving and frictionless digital future.</p>
<p>Contributing to the Dialog around&nbsp; National e-ID Legislation</p>
<p>By October 2021, DIDAS had provided <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/2021/10/13/didas-provides-extensive-commentary-to-the-target-vision-for-e-id-in-switzerland/">extensive commentary on Switzerland’s target vision</a> for the e-ID system. The association advocated for an “ecosystem of digital proofs”, where the e-ID would serve as one credential among many, enabling both governmental and private entities to issue other types of&nbsp; credentials. This approach aimed to create a flexible and future-proof foundation for digital interactions in Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In December 2021, following a public consultation, the Swiss Federal Council decided to orient the implementation of the future e-ID system based on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles. DIDAS welcomed this decision, recognizing it as a commitment to a decentralized solution architecture that prioritizes maximum privacy protection and positions the e-ID as a cornerstone of a broader ecosystem of digital credentials. “Ambition level 3” was anchoring the approach to build an <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/2021/12/21/e-id-based-on-ssi-needs-for-regulatory-support/">ecosystem of(business-domain-) ecosystems</a> in which, in addition to the E-ID, other verifiable credentials can be exchanged securely and reliably.</p>
<p>Promoting Technological Innovation</p>
<p>In its early stages, DIDAS members established an open sandbox environment to facilitate the development and testing of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) solutions. This sandbox provided a controlled setting where developers and organizations could experiment with SSI technologies, enabling the creation of interoperable and secure digital identity systems. By offering access to resources such as repositories and live demonstrations, DIDAS’s sandbox played a crucial role in iteratively advancing knowledge within Switzerland’s E-ID movement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DIDAS has consistently emphasized the importance of advanced digital signature technologies to enhance the Swiss e-ID framework. Following DIDAS’ <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/2024/02/21/4478/">statement in response to the E-ID technology discussion paper</a>, and its recommendation for Scenario “A” as a feasible technical starting point in February 2024, in March 2024, the association proposed to adopt the <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/2024/03/22/parallel-signatures-a-relevant-input-to-the-technology-discussion/">concept of dual signatures</a>. The technology approach to bridging the gap between the well established, but less feature rich cryptography and the new, but less known, techniques. Supported by&nbsp; the US Department of Homeland Security, this technique involves attaching multiple digital signatures to a single payload, each offering distinct security or privacy features. This methodology enhances agility and robustness, accommodating various cryptographic standards and privacy needs without compromising data integrity.</p>
<p>Advocating for Economic Value Creation beyond the societal value of a self-sovereign E-ID</p>
<p>Beyond technological contributions, DIDAS has been a committed advocate for leveraging the e-ID programme by the Swiss Confederation, to establish a digital trust and authentic data exchange ecosystem that creates sustainable economic value. The Association further envisioned this future ecosystem removing friction in B2B and cross border processes, by enabling higher levels of assurance in automation, significantly reducing risk of fraud, simplifying the management of compliance as well as allowing for the proliferation of digital trust-based businesses and innovations. On the Basis of the DIDAS Sandbox, Members have been <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/2022/10/24/the-power-of-e-id-ecosystems">experimenting around common use cases to explore ecosystem value</a> creation and are looking forward to support issuers, holders and verifiers as well as technology vendors, to further experiment with the confederation’s public beta infrastructure in early 2025.</p>
<p>In January 2024, during the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos, we collaborated with digitalswitzerland to co-organize the “Digital Trust” session at the digitalswitzerland Village. This event convened over 50 speakers and panelists, including industry leaders and policymakers, to discuss the critical role of digital trust in today’s interconnected world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In September 2024, at the event organized by the State Secretariat of International Finance (SIF) and the Swiss Financial Innovation Desk (FIND) at the Swiss Embassy in Singapore, we had the privilege of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/swiss-financial-innovation-desk_staytuned-pathway2035-financialinnovation-activity-7265250188154322944-iBku?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">moderating and contributing to discussions on digital trust</a>, emphasizing the importance of verifiable data and trust frameworks in global financial ecosystems. Our insights have also been shaping a soon-to-be-published paper, where DIDAS explores key principles and practical strategies to advance digital trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collaborative Efforts and Future Outlook</p>
<p>We strongly believe that DIDAS’s collaborative approach, engaging, as a non for profit, independent association, with government bodies, private sector stakeholders, and civil society, has been instrumental in shaping Switzerland’s digital identity efforts. The association’s commitment to a pragmatic, principle-based, iterative, and inclusive methodology has ensured that the SWIYU’s vision aligns with both national interests and international standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Switzerland prepares the final approval of the e-ID legislation on December 20, 2024, the foundational work of DIDAS continues to be important.&nbsp; We have a lot of work ahead of us to support the adoption of the E-ID and its mechanisms of exchanging authentic data. We further see our role in helping to&nbsp; increase the fluency of business leaders and innovators in applying these mechanisms.&nbsp; We’ll use the combined expertise of our members and our energy to promote and further enhance the key aspects of Ambition Level 3 governance and cross-ecosystem interoperability. Continued experimentation and dialogare unavoidable, in order to uncover and realize business value of this emerging Trust Infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also proud to co-organize <a href="http://www.diceurope.org">DICE (Digital Identity unConference Europe)</a> in collaboration with Trust Square and the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) rooting in Mountain View, California. DICE first launched in 2023 and exceeded expectations with 160 expert participants contributing to dynamic discussions. The second DICE in 2024 was a milestone, <a href="https://www.eid.admin.ch/de/grussbotschaft-von-bundesrat-beat-jans-zur-der-digital-identity-unconference-europe-dice">opened by Federal Councilor Beat Jans</a>, underscoring the importance of these participatory conferences and their contribution to the development of the E-ID Framework and the Swiss Trust Infrastructure. DICE fosters joint learning, evolves collective thinking, and accelerates the adoption of digital identity and verifiable data solutions. In 2025, two events are planned, further advancing open dialogue as a cornerstone for collaboration for authenticity and trust in the digital realm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The association’s vision of a secure, adaptable, and authentic data ecosystem built on SSI principles underlines its dedication to a sustainable digital environment that favors privacy and security, while enabling significant economic value creation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to continuing to create positive impact with all of our members, partners and other stakeholders.</p>

  <p>À l'ère du numérique, la liberté de choix est profondément influencée par la manière dont les données sont collectées, partagées et utilisées. La liberté de choisir est un concept fondamental qui revêt une importance particulière avec l'avènement des technologies numériques. Cette liberté de choix est intimement liée à la notion de sphère privée. Avec Internet et autres réseaux nous sommes confrontés à un large éventail de choix dans tous les aspects de notre vie quotidienne. Que ce soit dans le domaine des achats en ligne, des réseaux sociaux, des services bancaires en ligne ou dans le domaine de la santé, nous sommes constamment sollicités pour prendre des décisions aussi bien au niveau personnel que professionnel. Avec les outils d’intelligence artificielle qui s'immiscent dans notre quotidien notre sphère privée est-elle encore suffisamment protégée pour garantir autodétermination informationnelle ?</p><p>En prenant l’exemple de la médecine personnalisée dans le contexte de la liberté de choix à l'ère numérique, il est clair que l'accès aux données personnelles de santé et leur contrôle sont cruciaux. La médecine personnalisée s'engage à fournir des diagnostics et traitements individualisés. Cela nécessite des outils technologiques pour gérer les informations de santé de manière proactive afin de garantir que ces données soient utilisées de manière éthique et sécurisée.

   Journée de la Protection des Données <p>Freedom of Choice in the digital age</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation contributes to the public conference (in french) on Wednesday 28 January 2025 organised by the Faculty of Law, Criminology and Public Administration (FDCA) of the University of Lausanne (<a href="https://www.unil.ch/fdca/fr/home/menuinst/la-faculte/evenements/journee-de-la-protection-des-donnees-2025.html">registration required</a>).</p><p>In the digital age, freedom of choice is profoundly affected by the way data is collected, shared and used. This freedom of choice is closely linked to the notion of privacy.</p><p>With the Internet and other networks, we are faced with a wide range of choices in all aspects of our daily lives. Whether it's online shopping, social networking, online banking or healthcare, we are constantly being asked to make decisions at both a personal and professional level. With artificial intelligence tools making their way into our daily lives, is our privacy sphere still well protected to guarantees informational self-determination?</p><p>Taking the example of personalised medicine in the context of freedom of choice in the digital age, it becomes clear that access to and control of personal health data are crucial. Personalised medicine is committed to providing individuals with individualised diagnoses and treatments. This requires technological tools to proactively manage their health information to ensure that it is used ethically and securely. Digital technology must also be used to empower patients, enabling them to make informed decisions about their health, while contributing to significant advances in medical research.</p><p>Based on its work, the Foundation will present these concepts through the current issues in Switzerland linked to the E-ID digital identity project and its impact on the healthcare ecosystem.</p>

<p>Imagine connecting and configuring devices on an oil rig in the middle of the ocean with limited human intervention. That’s the reality of what can be achieved with the FIDO Alliance’s Device Onboarding (FDO) standard. This is an example of the applications that IoT pioneer ASRock Industrial is bringing to life.</p>



<p>The rapid proliferation of IoT devices and Edge computing across industries has brought with it unprecedented opportunities and challenges. By 2025, over 75 billion IoT devices are expected to be connected globally, increasing complexities in device management and widening the attack surface for malicious actors. Recent studies suggest nearly 57% of IoT devices are susceptible to medium or high-severity attacks.</p>



 Corporate Overview 



<p>ASRock Industrial, a global leader in industrial systems and motherboards, has become one of the first vendors to provide FDO-enabled compute solutions for industrial applications. The company offers industrial PC systems, motherboards, edge computers, and other products for industries such as automation, robotics, entertainment, and security, as well as cutting-edge systems for smart cities, energy firms, pharmaceuticals, automotive and more to customers around the world. ASRock Industrial is leading the way in the industrial IoT industry with its FDO certified solutions that make device onboarding more efficient, less vulnerable, and more scalable.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“FDO’s advanced security framework enables us to deliver unparalleled reliability and adaptability, empowering our clients to scale confidently in increasingly complex environments.” – Kenny Chang, Vice President of Product and Marketing Division, ASRock Industrial</p>
</blockquote>



 On the Edge: The Challenges of Industrial IoT 



<p>ASRock Industrial’s customers, like many in the industry, face challenges when deploying IoT devices and edge computing solutions quickly and securely.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Security vulnerabilities: Traditional manual onboarding methods leave devices vulnerable to unauthorized access and data breaches. For example, a connected IoT device may still have the original manufacturer’s default password in place, which increases the risk of password-related device compromises. Manual processes also increase the risk of exposed, unmanaged devices on the network. In industries like energy and transportation, secure operations are vital to public safety and system reliability. 



 Time and cost inefficiencies: Not only are manual processes time-consuming, hiring skilled installers is extremely expensive. When calculating the time and cost for a skilled engineer to manually onboard edge devices, it’s important to include not only the technical setup time but also the travel time to what potentially may be multiple sites. ASRock Industrial estimates that before FDO, users could spend up to $1,000 per device implementation*.&nbsp; With FDO the installation is not only much faster and more secure, but it is also a task that can often be handled by existing on-site staff. 



 Complexity and scalability: Legacy onboarding approaches are complex to deploy and manage. This complexity is only further exacerbated by the remote and high-risk environments many industrial applications are in. Sending skilled engineers to these environments not only creates bottlenecks and slows scalability, it introduces safety risks that further amplify costs. 



 Lack of interoperability: The IoT space is very fragmented, with multiple proprietary platforms and operating systems. Existing “zero-touch” solutions are restricted in compatibility, making it hard to support clients across different sectors. 
 



 Creating an FDO Solution 



<p>To solve these challenges, ASRock Industrial turned to FIDO Device Onboard (FDO), and in doing so has become one of the market’s earliest adopters of this compelling technology. ASRock Industrial has integrated FDO into its flagship iEP-5010G series, a robust edge controller built for demanding industrial applications and harsh environments. The iEP-5010G series can operate within a wide temperature range of -40 to 70 degrees and supports 6-36VDC power inputs, 4G LTE, 5G, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth, and offers the most flexible I/Os and expansion options, making it a fit for industrial automation, robotics, transportation and more.</p>



<p>The ASRock Industrial FDO solution has been designed with FDO’s advanced features in mind. It delivers end-to-end FDO onboarding capabilities, encompassing all critical FDO functions: manufacturer, owner and rendezvous server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather than hard programming devices for each different operating system, the iEP-5010G series device controller can be deployed as one system without pre-installation of OS or additional programming. This simplifies manufacturing and provides a better customer experience with the flexibility to decide OS requirements later in the process.</p>



<p>The FDO standard and associated certification program ensure consistency and interoperability. Standardized onboarding means devices are consistently and correctly deployed every time, removing the risk of errors for ASRock Industrial’s customers. Most importantly, the open standards-based approach means it can work seamlessly with other partners in the industry and support players across the globe.</p>



 Results and Impact 



<p>While early implementation results are still being gathered, ASRock Industrial anticipates significant benefits for both the company and its customers.</p>



<p>One of ASRock Industrial’s earliest use cases lies in the smart city domain, where their FDO-enabled iEP-7020E series devices leverage FDO technology to automatically onboard hardware and software to connect electric vehicle (EV) charging points and related devices seamlessly. By enabling remote monitoring of charging stations across multiple locations, FDO has eliminated the need for engineers to visit sites physically. Its AI-driven analytics have dramatically enhanced operational efficiency, while remote surveillance has addressed key challenges such as charger hogging, vandalism, and unauthorized access. This capability ensures more efficient and timely incident management. As urban demands evolve, FDO serves as a robust foundation for scalable, secure deployments, delivering sustained benefits over time.</p>



 Looking Ahead 



<p>ASRock Industrial’s investment in FDO puts us in a prime position to meet the rigorous demands of Industry 4.0 advancements and provide customers with security levels that protect against the expanding edge threat landscape. In 2024, ASRock Industrial became one of the first to achieve FDO certification, passing the FIDO Alliance’s rigorous independent testing processes. The results of this testing demonstrate that ASRock Industrial’s products fully meet the FDO specification, meaning partners and clients can trust the security, interoperability and FDO functionality of these solutions.</p>



<p>FDO certification also plays an important role in differentiating ASRock Industrial by making their products more marketable in that they are capable of meeting the needs of a growing number of RFPs that call out FDO. Additionally, it reduces the company’s need to spend time and effort in intensive vendor bake-offs, allowing ASRock Industrial to spend more time innovating its product lines and value-added services.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Deploying FDO has marked a pivotal shift for ASRock Industrial, establishing a new benchmark in secure, scalable onboarding for industrial edge AIoT solutions. This deployment cements ASRock Industrial’s leadership in industrial computing security and sets the stage for us to shape the future of Industry 4.0 with solutions that are both resilient and future-ready.”– Kenny Chang, Vice President of ASRock Industrial</p>

<p>The development of a robust ecosystem around the upcoming E-ID implementation in Switzerland represents an essential next step in building Trust Infrastructure. For us at DIDAS it has always been vital to emphasize that while the E-ID verifiable credential is very important, it is still just a building block, the first step towards a much larger ecosystem where a variety of verifiable credentials will be issued and exchanged on a daily basis.</p>
 
 
 
<p>Many of these credentials, as well as the processes depending on them, will be implemented in the private sector, the vision known as “Ambition Level 3”. This is where the real economic value will come from. Much like the road infrastructure is built by the state and then fuels the economy, so will the Trust Infrastructure serve as a critical foundation, a privacy preserving enabler, for all kinds of native digital processes in the near future.</p>
<p>The E-ID framework, including the underlying Trust Infrastructure, is primarily targeting personal identity and credentials. To realize the complete potential of the Credentials’ Ecosystem, however, the open topics around the organization identity – the identity of an organization itself as well as that of their representatives – must be addressed.<br>
Unlike natural persons, legal entities require unique considerations for authentication, governance, and compliance. A well-designed solution for legal entity identities could unlock significant opportunities for global trade, regulatory compliance, and business interoperability.</p>
<p>To succeed, the chosen approach must be flexible, future-proof, and globally scalable. Not only from a technical standpoint but also from a governance perspective. A scalable solution must accommodate the widest variety of jurisdictions, regulatory requirements, and business use cases, ensuring it is both technically sound and broadly acceptable.</p>
 The Role of vLEI Credentials 
<p>One of the most promising solutions in this space is the Verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) credentials ecosystem. Pioneered by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), vLEI credentials aim to provide an extensible basis for an electronically verifiable and trustworthy way to identify legal entities and their representatives in the digital world. GLEIF, a globally recognized authority, oversees the issuance of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) that are already widely used in the financial sector to improve transparency and reduce risk.</p>
<p>The vLEI system builds upon this foundation by leveraging cutting-edge technology to ensure verifiability and scalability. However, despite its many advantages, the underlying technical framework—centered around Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) and Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC)— has proven rather challenging to grasp.</p>
 Deep Dive into the vLEI and its technical foundations 
<p>To make it easier to understand and appreciate the solution, we have undertaken a deep dive into both the governance and technical aspects of the vLEI ecosystem. Our goal is to provide an accurate insight into the key mechanisms and characteristics that make vLEI ecosystem a prime candidate to serve as the backbone for use-cases and applications that require a globally scalable legal entity identity framework.</p>
<p>First, we take a look at the governance, highlighting the key aspects as to why vLEI ecosystem can meet the diverse regulatory requirements of jurisdictions worldwide while accommodating the varied needs of businesses. Then, on the technical side, we are exploring the foundational KERI/ACDC technology, which promises enhanced security, efficiency, transparency and interoperability.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>To learn with us, watch the recorded deep-dive session on vLEI and its technical underpinnings.</p>
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Stay tuned for more insights as we continue this journey toward shaping the future of legal entity identities in the digital era.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Together, let’s make the vision of a seamless, privacy-first digital ecosystem a reality. Stay connected and be <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/getinvolved/">part</a> of the transformation!</p>

<p>Momentum continues in Japan with notable passkey success stories and deployments from Nikkei, Tokyu, Google, Sony Interactive Entertainment, KDDI, LY Corporation, Mercari and NTT DOCOMO</p>



<p>TOKYO, December 12, 2024 – More than 15 billion online accounts can use passkeys for faster, safer sign-ins – more than double than this time last year. The momentum behind FIDO and passkeys is the focus of today’s 11th annual FIDO Tokyo Seminar, where hundreds gathered to learn about the latest developments in the global push to eliminate dependence on passwords. Presenters include those from Google, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Mastercard, Waseda University, the Institute of Information Security, KDDI, LY Corporation, Mercari and NTT DOCOMO.</p>



<p>Passkeys become more widely available for consumer and workforce applications – and companies are seeing the benefits&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys provide phishing-resistant security with a simple user experience far superior to passwords and other phishable forms of authentication. Many consumer brands are reporting passkey success stories and business benefits; some notable new and recent announcements include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Amazon made passkeys available to 100% of its users, including in Japan, this year and already has 175 million passkeys created for sign-in to amazon.com across geographies. 



 Google recently reported that 800 million Google accounts now use passkeys, resulting in more than 2.5 billion passkey sign-ins over the past two years. Also, Google’s sign-in success rates have improved by 30% and sign-ins speeds have increased by 20% on average. 



 Sony Interactive Entertainment, the company behind PlayStation, released passkeys as an alternative option to passwords for their global gaming community and observed a 24% reduction in sign-in time on its web applications for passkey users. Additionally, high conversion rates have been observed, with 88% of customers who are presented with the benefits of passkeys successfully completing enrollment. 
 



<p>Adoption also grew in the workforce this year as more companies bolstered their authentication options with passkeys, including Hyatt, IBM, Target and TikTok.</p>



<p>Consumers gained flexibility and choice for passkey management this year, as more credential managers, such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane and LastPass expanded their passkeys support cross-ecosystem, and the FIDO Alliance announced <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/">new draft specifications</a> for users to securely move passkeys and all other credentials across providers.</p>



<p>Notable Momentum in Japan</p>



<p>Specifically in Japan, new passkeys deployments and success were announced from Nikkei Inc., Nulab Inc., and Tokyu Corporation:</p>



 
 Nikkei Inc. unveiled their plan to deploy passkeys for Nikkei ID, for the millions of Nikkei ID customers to begin their migration from passwords to passkeys. This will be launching in February 2025 or later. 



 Nulab Inc. announced their dramatic improvement in passkey adoption for Nulab accounts based on the outcome of the Passkey Hackathon Tokyo this past November. 



 Tokyu Corporation has reported that 45% of TOKYU ID users have passkeys, and sign-ins with passkeys are 12 times faster than a password plus an emailed OTP. 
 



<p>Additionally, Nikkei Inc., Nulab Inc. and Tokyu Corporation all successfully demonstrated their passkey implementations at the Passkey Hackathon Tokyo, organized by Google and sponsored by FIDO Alliance, in June 2024. Companies receiving awards included Nulab and Tokyu, as well as two teams of students from Japanese universities:</p>



 
 Keio University team received the grand winner award for adopting passkeys combined with an IoT device – a smart door lock created by a 3D printer. 



 Waseda University team received another FIDO award for their unique user authentication protocol and implementation combined with passkeys, verifiable credentials and zero-knowledge proofs. 
 



<p>In addition to these two teams, a group at the Institute of Information Security (Yokohama, Japan) presented their research entitled “A Study on Notification Design to Encourage General Users to Use Passkeys” at a workshop organized by the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSG) on December 4, 2024. These activities demonstrate how students in academia are embracing passkeys as an attractive option for life without passwords.</p>



<p>Organizations that have already deployed passkeys for more than a year shared new successes:</p>



 
 KDDI now has more than 13 million au ID customers now using FIDO and has seen a dramatic decrease (nearly 35%)&nbsp; in calls to its customer support center as a result. Managing FIDO adoption carefully for both subscribers and non-subscribers. 



 LY Corporation property Yahoo! JAPAN ID now has 27 million active passkeys users. Approximately 50% of user authentication on smartphones is now passkeys. LY Corporation said that passkeys have a higher success rate over SMS OTP and achieve 2.6 times faster. 



 Mercari has 7 million users enrolled in passkeys, and enforcing passkey login for synced passkeys enrolled users of Mercari. Notably, there have been zero phishing incidents at Mercoin, a Mercari subsidiary since March 9, 2023. 



 NTT DOCOMO has increased its passkey enrollments and now passkeys are used for approximately 50% of authentication by account users. NTT DOCOMO notably reports significant decreases in successful phishing attempts and there have been no unrecognized payments at docomo Online Shop since September 23, 2022. 
 



<p>To drive further adoption in Japan, the FIDO Alliance announced that <a href="https://www.passkeycentral.org/ja/home/">Passkey Central</a>, the website for consumer service providers to learn more about why and how to implement passkeys for simpler and more secure sign-ins, is now available in Japanese. Passkey Central provides visitors with actionable, data-driven content to discover, implement, and maintain passkeys for maximum benefits over time. The comprehensive resources on Passkey Central include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Introduction to passkeys 



 Business considerations and metrics&nbsp; 



 Internal and external communication materials 



 Implementation strategies &amp; detailed roll-out guides&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 UX &amp; Design guidelines 



 Troubleshooting 



 And more implementation resources, such as glossary, Figma kits, and accessibility guidance 
 



<p>Along with the many in Japan, there are 66 of the FIDO Alliance’s 300+ member companies actively taking part in the FIDO Japan Working Group (FJWG). The FJWG is now beginning its 9th year working together to spread awareness and adoption of FIDO in the region.</p>



<p>Consumers and workforce users are aware of, and want to use, passkeys</p>



<p>Passkeys are not only available across a wide array of services, but recent studies have shown that consumers and workforce users are aware of, and want to use, passkeys. Recent FIDO Alliance <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/research-findings-consumer-trends-and-attitudes-towards-authentication-methods/">research</a> shows that in the two years since passkeys were first made available, consumer awareness has risen by 50%, up from 39% in 2022 to now 57% in 2024. Consumers also report that when they adopt at least one passkey, 1 out of 4 enables passkeys whenever possible. A majority of consumers also believe passkeys are more secure (61%) and more convenient than passwords (58%). Since 2023, consumers from APAC reported passkey awareness has grown significantly more when compared to the global average and other countries in 2024. Consumers from China (80%), India (70%), Japan (62%), and Singapore (58%) reported significantly higher passkey adoption in the last year, with Australia (52%) and South Korea (44%) trending close to the overall average (59%).</p>

<p>Building the Future of Digital Privacy: How you can Contribute, Implement, and Advocate</p><p>The applied cryptography community is making significant strides in standardizing BBS signatures and their extensions - a crucial development for privacy-preserving digital credentials. This work represents a major step forward in enabling more private and secure digital interactions while maintaining the necessary balance between privacy and accountability.</p> What is BBS? <p>BBS is a secure digital signature mechanism that proves information is authentic and unchanged, similar to how a notary validates physical documents. Unlike other digital signature mechanisms, BBS enables powerful privacy features while maintaining security. Its name comes from its creators – cryptographers Dan Boneh, Xavier Boyen, and Hovav Shacham. This combination of security and privacy makes it particularly well-suited for digital credential systems, where protecting both authenticity and user privacy is crucial.</p> Why BBS Matters <p>BBS signatures provide a unique combination of privacy and practical utility that makes them especially valuable for digital credentials.</p><p>From a technical perspective, BBS stands out for:</p>  Constant-size signatures regardless of the number of messages signed  True unlinkability between different uses of the same credential  The ability to sign and selectively reveal multiple messages within a single signature  <p>These technical properties translate into practical benefits for digital credentials:</p>  Selective disclosure: Users can prove specific facts about their credentials (like their city of residence) without revealing other details (like their full address)  Unlinkable disclosure: Each privacy-preserving use of a credential cannot be traced to other uses  Anti-theft features: Credentials can be cryptographically bound to their owner while maintaining privacy  Controlled recognition: Services can securely recognize returning users without enabling cross-service tracking  <p>Together, these capabilities enable privacy-preserving digital credentials that are both secure and practical for real-world deployment - from government IDs to professional certifications to age verification systems.</p> BBS Standards Landscape <p>The standardization of BBS involves several complementary efforts across standards bodies:&nbsp;</p> Core Technical Specifications <p>BBS and its extensions are currently undergoing standardization within the Crypto Forum Research Group (<a href="https://www.irtf.org/cfrg.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">CFRG</a>) of the Internet Research Task Force (<a href="https://www.irtf.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">IRTF</a>). (The IRTF is related to the <a href="https://ietf.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">IETF</a> but focuses on longer term research related to the Internet.)&nbsp;</p><p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation hosts the development of this work in the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/crypto-wg?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Applied Crypto Working Group</a>.</p><p>This work is currently represented by 3 specifications:</p>  "BBS Signatures": BBS Signatures are a privacy-preserving way to sign digital credentials. They let you prove specific facts about your credentials (like your city of residence) without revealing other details (like your full address). Specification: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">The BBS Signature Scheme</a>  "Blind BBS": Blind BBS enables credential issuance where the issuer can cryptographically sign information without seeing its contents - useful for privacy-preserving identity binding. Specification: <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-kalos-bbs-blind-signatures-03.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Blind BBS Signatures</a>  “BBS Pseudonyms”: BBS Pseudonyms are an anti-fraud mechanism to prevent digital credential cloning. They can be used by verifiers (like websites) to identify someone they've interacted with before, but in a way that cannot be correlated across different verifiers. Specification: <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-kalos-bbs-per-verifier-linkability-00.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">BBS per Verifier Linkability</a>  <p>Status: The first item, BBS Signatures, is a mature working group document that completed an initial review by the CFRG panel. The other two – Blind BBS and BBS Pseudonyms – are on their way to adoption, and they could benefit from your support, as described below.</p> Implementation Standards <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group</a> is building on this foundation by developing the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-bbs/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Data Integrity BBS Cryptosuite specification</a>. This work integrates BBS signatures into W3C Verifiable Credentials, provides comprehensive test suites, and ensures that implementations across different platforms will be interoperable and reliable.</p> Call to Action  1. Voice Your Support <p>Urgent: Deadline December 20th, 2024</p><p>The CFRG has opened an official adoption call for both the Blind BBS and BBS Pseudonyms specifications. This is a crucial moment for these privacy-enhancing technologies.</p><p>Update: <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/IVtSY-0aBY4swoONYVgyFaVD1L8/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">these specifications have been accepted</a>! Thank you for your support.</p><p>Your voice matters - if you care about privacy-preserving technologies, please participate in the vote and share your support.</p> 2. Get Involved <p>Want to dive deeper into this work? There are several ways to engage based on your interests:&nbsp;</p>  Developers: Contribute to W3C test suites or implement any of the specifications to test them out  Standards developers: Join the discussion at any of the above standards groups  Cryptographers: Review and provide feedback on the specifications and join the technical discussions  Enthusiasts / everyone: If you want to follow along with the progress, subscribe to DIF’s blog for updates  <p>To participate in DIF’s Applied Crypto Working Group, you can <a href="https://identity.foundation/join/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">join DIF</a>; contact us at <a href="mailto:membership@identity.founation">membership@identity.founation</a> if you have any questions.</p>

  <p>On the same day, representatives of the Human Colossus Foundation attended the annual hybrid participation meeting of the project E-ID, which took place in the Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication (FOITT) buildings in Zollikofen. The Human Colossus Foundation's (HCF) contribution is the technology for securing and styling the visualisation of the E-ID on mobile devices. E-ID pilots have already implemented HCF's <a href="https://oca.colossi.network/">Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) [2]</a> in different contexts (see for example canton Thurgau <a href="https://github.com/e-id-admin/general/blob/main/meetings/20241206_E-ID-Partizipationsmeeting_DVS4U_DE.pdf">proof of concept [3]</a>. The Foundation will continue to support the E-ID team on semantic harmonisation for a stylish but secured visualisation of digital proofs.&nbsp;</p><p>However, our goal at the Human Colossus Foundation is to promote and support E-ID projects beyond the semantic realm. We support E-ID and public service initiatives in Switzerland and abroad. Our Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) approach anticipates the future implementation of national infrastructure components, including distributed governance and decentralised authentication. These technologies go beyond the building of complex verifiable credential use cases. They enable an ecosystem approach, helping integrate many providers of digital proofs, further enabling diverse use cases for E-ID.</p><p>We welcome the two-stage approach of the project that confirms a go-live for 2026 while activating research and development for higher security and privacy.</p>

 Every purchase you’ve made until now — whether it’s a pair of shoes, a mobile phone, a laptop, or even exotic fruits — was most likely transported by sea. Globally, the maritime industry is responsible for approximately 2% of overall carbon emissions while serving as a critical component of nearly all industrial companies’ supply chains and transportation systems.  Why Katalist? <p>Decarbonizing the maritime industry is a challenging task due to the long lifespan of ships (around 35 years), which limits the speed of fleet replacement. This is why the focus has shifted to the use of low-emission fuels, enabled by a Chain of Custody model called “Book and&nbsp;Claim.”</p><p>The system allows for the decoupling of the physical low-emission fuel from its associated low-emission attribute, which can be traded separately. This approach makes low-emission fuels more accessible.</p><p>This model serves as an interim mechanism, buying time until global infrastructure is fully in place to support widespread physical use of low-emission fuels without needing to decouple the sustainability attributes of maritime fuel from its actual&nbsp;usage.</p> How? <p>To build trust among participants, the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping and RMI have co-developed and continuously refined a robust methodology that all actors can rely&nbsp;on.</p><p>The role of Energy Web Foundation was to provide the technology platform in a way that shortened implementation timelines, enabled hypothesis testing, and allowed for necessary adjustments in a relatively short time compared to building everything from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>Thanks to our Generic Green Proofs approach, we successfully developed two proof-of-concepts, gathering valuable insights that enabled the team to refine the solution into a full production platform — ready to launch in November at COP29 (link to the press release).</p><p>What might have taken years to build, we accomplished in months, delivering critical insights that shaped the final platform.</p> What Companies Can Do on the&nbsp;Platform   Issuance<br>The creation of certificates on Katalist follows a well-thought-out methodology. This ensures that the most relevant data is collected from ships and voyages, along with the appropriate documentation to attest to fuel attributes and&nbsp;usage.  Transfer<br>Participants on the platform can transfer certificates based on predetermined rules and restrictions.  Retirements and Export (Claims)<br>The ultimate goal for companies using the platform is to claim emission savings from alternative fuel usage in their sustainability reports.  Public Retirement Table<br>Depending on the type of company, industry actors can view varying levels of information about actual fuel usage. Once the final actor (Cargo Owner) has claimed the certificate, the data becomes publicly available through the “Public Retirement Table.”   Who? <p>The platform is designed for key maritime industry&nbsp;actors:</p>  Shipping Companies: Operators or owners of ships are responsible for purchasing fuel and uploading relevant data to the platform.  Freight Forwarders: Intermediaries in the maritime transportation cycle and vital parts of the supply&nbsp;chain.  Cargo Owners: Responsible for the contents of shipments.   What Will 2025&nbsp;Bring? <p>By the end of the year, we anticipate onboarding several companies to the platform. By early 2025, the first certificates will be issued using Katalist. Additional features will be developed, with updates shared as plans progress.</p> Conclusion <p>Energy Web contributes to decarbonization efforts by serving as a climate-tech partner, significantly accelerating the journey from ideas to proof-of-concepts and minimum viable products.</p><p>Our expertise lies in creating generic frameworks that enable faster deployments, adaptable to decarbonization plans that drive impactful climate change solutions.</p><p>If you’re interested in bringing your ideas to life faster and more efficiently using proven methodologies and connections with relevant industry actors, let’s discuss how Green Proofs can be applied to your use case.<a href="http://www.energyweb.org/"> contact&nbsp;us!</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/generic-green-proofs-use-case-applied-to-the-maritime-industry-katalist-dedf9f9ef9cf">Generic Green Proofs Use Case (Applied to the Maritime Industry): Katalist</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/dgna-56242-stand-der-entwicklung-der-sta#t=41">Watch: A Panel Discussion on the Development of Switzerland’s State E-ID</a> 
<p>On September 19, 2024, a fact-based discussion took place on the progress of Switzerland’s state electronic identity (E-ID). The network policy evening was organized by the digital society and highlighted the key challenges and opportunities of a project that is set to shape the country’s digital future. Speakers included Annett Laube, Professor of Computer Science at Bern University of Applied Sciences, Rolf Rauschenbach, Information Officer for E-ID at the Federal Office of Justice, and Daniel Säuberli, President of the Digital Identity and Data Sovereignty Association (DIDAS).</p>
 The Vision for a State E-ID 
<p><a href="https://magazin.abraxas.ch/e-government/infografik-der-nutzen-der-e-id"></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://magazin.abraxas.ch/e-government/infografik-der-nutzen-der-e-id">Der Nutzen der E-ID</a></p>
<p>The state-operated E-ID is more than a technological tool; it is envisioned as a foundation for trust and efficiency in the digital space. Following the rejection of the privately run E-ID proposal in 2021, a state-led solution focusing on privacy, data sovereignty, and user-friendliness has taken center stage. The goal is to create a digital identity that meets citizens’ needs while establishing the technological and legal groundwork for innovative digital services.</p>
 Contributions from the Experts 
<p>Prof. Annett Laube provided insights into the technological and scientific standards required for the development of the E-ID. She emphasized the importance of ensuring privacy and security through principles like privacy by design and highlighted the critical role of transparency enabled by open-source solutions. User binding is the secure process of linking a digital identity to its rightful owner, ensuring only authorized individuals can access and use the E-ID while maintaining privacy and trust.</p>
<p>Rolf Rauschenbach outlined the strategic and political considerations underpinning the project. He discussed the challenges of implementing a solution that is both technically robust and user-friendly and stressed the need for a clear legal framework.</p>
<p>Daniel Säuberli, representing DIDAS, drew attention to the essential role of trust in digital infrastructures. He emphasized three fundamental principles necessary for the success of the E-ID:</p>
 
 Strengthening Data Sovereignty: Citizens must have full control over their personal data, without unnecessary interference by third parties. 
 Promoting Interoperability: The E-ID must function on both a national and international level to enable seamless cross-border digital interactions. 
 Building Trust Through Transparency: Open communication and active collaboration with the public, private sector, and academia are critical to gaining widespread acceptance for the E-ID. 
 
 Ambition Levels for the E-ID 
<p><a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/zielbild-e-id.html"></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/zielbild-e-id.html">Zielbild E-ID</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development of the state E-ID is structured around three ambition levels, each reflecting its growing capabilities and societal value:</p>
 
 Basic Functionality: At this level, the E-ID serves as a secure and user-friendly tool for digital identification. It is used primarily for core applications, such as accessing federal online services like tax filings or registry extracts, and ensures reliable authentication for administrative processes. 
 Integration into Cantonal and Municipal Services: The second level expands the E-ID’s use to services provided by cantons and municipalities. The goal is to offer citizens seamless digital access to public services across all administrative levels. Examples include registering address changes, participating in electronic voting, or applying for local permits. This integration transforms the E-ID into a vital part of Switzerland’s public administration. 
 Adoption by the Private Sector: The highest ambition level envisions the E-ID as a universal identification tool for private-sector services. This includes applications in areas such as online banking, e-commerce, and healthcare. By creating a digital ecosystem where the E-ID is widely accepted, it becomes a driver of innovation and digitization across various industries. 
 
 Connecting Principles to Ambition Levels 
<p>The ambition levels of the state E-ID are intrinsically linked to the principles outlined by Daniel Säuberli:</p>
 
 Data Sovereignty forms the foundation of the basic functionality, ensuring citizens retain control over their data. 
 Interoperability becomes essential as the E-ID is integrated into cantonal and municipal services, enabling seamless operation across different platforms. 
 Transparency is vital for the third level, fostering trust and accountability as the E-ID expands into the private sector. 
 
 Challenges and Outlook 
<p>Despite significant progress, critical questions remain: How can the E-ID be effectively integrated into existing systems? How can transparency and privacy be guaranteed? And how can public trust be secured? Addressing these challenges will require collaboration, clear communication, and an unwavering commitment to the outlined principles.</p>
 DIDAS: A Driving Force for Digital Trust 
<p>For DIDAS, the state E-ID represents a cornerstone for promoting digital trust and innovation. As a platform for digital trust infrastructures, DIDAS is committed to advancing the development of the E-ID and creating the conditions for a sovereign digital society.</p>
<p>With its state-operated E-ID, Switzerland has the opportunity to become a leader in digital identities—rooted in the values of trust, security, and innovation.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The state E-ID offers Switzerland the chance to establish a modern and trustworthy digital ecosystem centered on the needs of its citizens. By strengthening data sovereignty, ensuring interoperability, and fostering transparency, the E-ID is a crucial step forward in the country’s digital transformation.</p>
<p>However, its success depends on transparency, collaboration, and clear communication to build trust and public acceptance. DIDAS plays a pivotal role by bridging stakeholders and promoting the principles of digital trust and data sovereignty. Through a clear vision and open dialogue, Switzerland can set a global example for a digital future built on trust, innovation, and user empowerment.</p>

 Today we will take a step back from our discussions of Green Proofs-powered platforms to take a deeper dive into Green Proofs itself — why it exists, the problems it solves, and how it&nbsp;works  Why Green&nbsp;Proofs? <p>In today’s world, corporations are under immense pressure to reduce their carbon footprints, meet regulatory standards, and fulfill consumer demand for greener products. In doing so, they must balance the challenge of providing good and verifiable data that stands up to external scrutiny with protecting their proprietary information and processes.</p><p>Corporations are pursuing a variety of sustainability solutions to achieve these goals, which vary in terms of flexibility, cost and compliance with the standards of large-scale enterprises and regulators.</p><p>To address these complex sustainability needs, Energy Web developed Green Proofs — a powerfully comprehensive and configurable software solution — to bring<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/what-we-do-clean-energy/"> deep levels of transparency and verifiability to emerging green products and&nbsp;markets</a>.</p> Green Proofs technology is built to enable the following: <p>1. Buy and sell low carbon services and commodities: Whether your company deals in biofuels, green energy, or climate-conscious services, Green Proofs helps you sell and source products that can be verifiably marketed as sustainable.</p><p>2. Launch green product registries: Create transparent, scalable, and credible market access in “hard to abate” sectors that can benefit from attribute tracking and support broader decarbonization.</p><p>3. Prove your company and products are sustainable: Green Proofs provides tools for tracking and reporting progress toward environmental goals. It integrates granular data, helping you measure Scope 3 emissions and evaluate supplier impact while protecting sensitive information.</p> Green Proofs technology <p>Green Proofs is a suite of modular technology solutions that come in the form of turn-key applications or highly customized software built in close partnership with Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>A core technology underpinning Green Proofs software is the <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/ew-dos-technology-components-2023/worker-nodes">Energy Web Worker node network</a>. Energy Web developed worker nodes to solve a longstanding problem that hindered the advancement of energy tracking solutions: solution logic varied widely according to use case and relied on commercially sensitive data that oftentimes needed to remain private, but the results needed to be transparent and publicly verifiable.</p><p>Worker nodes address this problem by allowing enterprises to configure their own computing networks&nbsp;that:</p>  Ingest data from external&nbsp;sources  Execute custom logic workflows  Vote on results in order to establish consensus without revealing or modifying the underlying data.  Publish the consensus to a trusted, public&nbsp;ledger  <p>Worker nodes put enterprises in the driver’s seat of their application, giving them granular control over workflow logic and data inputs. The end result is an enterprise-friendly architecture that provides cryptographic proof that pre-defined rules and processes are being followed correctly, while preserving data privacy and integrity.</p><p>It is important to note that while Energy Web has historically been known for its use of blockchain, worker nodes do not exist to store or tokenize certificates and data on the blockchain. The primary use of blockchain in Green Proofs is to serve as a ledger for the worker nodes’ validation results of logic workflows.</p> Green Proofs Business Applications <p>Green Proofs helps companies demonstrate that their operations, products, and services are sustainable. It achieves this in three&nbsp;ways:</p> Helping Companies Buy and Sell Low-Carbon Services and Commodities <p>Green Proofs streamlines access to low-carbon services and commodities, empowering companies to source materials and services that both support their sustainability goals and enable the marketing/sale of verifiably green products. Currently, Green Proofs is streamlining market access to <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">sustainable aviation fuel</a>, <a href="http://autogreencharge.com">green EV charging</a>, <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/maritime">low-carbon shipping services</a>, and <a href="http://gp4btc.org">climate-aligned Bitcoin mining</a>, making it easier for companies to find the right solutions to reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.</p><p>The recently-announced <a href="https://katalist.eco/">Katalist platform</a> is an excellent example of this business application — using Katalist, maritime freight customers can lower their emissions using a robust book-and-claim system, supporting corporate sustainability claims about themselves and their products.</p> Launch Green Product Registries <p>For companies or consortia looking to establish or expand markets for emerging green commodities, Green Proofs offers the ability to launch next-generation Green Product Registries. These registries support transparent, scalable tracking of sustainable goods and services, enabling participants to securely book, trade, and retire digital certificates that represent specific environmental attributes.</p><p>By deploying these customized registries, companies can support sustainable product verification, drive growth in emerging green markets, and contribute to decarbonization efforts on a larger scale. With the flexibility and transparency offered by Green Proofs, businesses can lead the way in expanding sustainable options for their industry while building trust with customers and stakeholders.</p><p>To learn more about this business application, we invite you to explore the <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">SAFc Registry</a>, where users can obtain certificates representing the use of sustainable aviation fuel, which are then used to credibly claim Scope 3 emissions reductions.</p> Track and Report Emissions <p>To truly demonstrate sustainability, companies need more than metrics; they need verifiable data that tracks the environmental impact of their products, operations, and supply chains (scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions). Green Proofs can help companies better collect, track, and report this data in detail, offering insights on both corporate-level and product-specific emissions. We are currently working with industry partners to gather requirements for this business application&nbsp;.</p> Who can use Green&nbsp;Proofs? <p>Energy Web built Green Proofs for any corporation or organization that wants to market itself or its products as green. We help customers access Green Proofs in a variety of ways — from no-code and low-code solutions that enable quick, independent launches to providing ongoing design, development, and hosting services for bespoke platforms.

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/new-zealand-lawyer-not-surprised-if-australian-laws-change-for-retail-biometrics-use">Biometric Update Website</a></p>



<p>Digital Identity New Zealand (<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">DINZ</a>) hosted a discussion led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/nec-new-zealand">NEC New Zealand</a>&nbsp;on “Facial Recognition and CCTV Integration in Retail Security” this week, with a panel including data privacy, government and legal experts.</p>



<p>It comes amidst industry anticipation of the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner’s conclusions on supermarket chain Foodstuff’s results from its trial of facial recognition. The company considers the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202409/early-results-positive-in-new-zealand-trial-of-facial-recognition-at-grocery-stores">preliminary findings</a>&nbsp;of the trial encouraging.</p>



<p>In Australia, retail chain Bunnings made headlines after it was found to have breached the country’s privacy laws by using facial recognition. However, the company received some unexpected support when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/retail-facial-recognition-for-crime-prevention-finds-support-in-australia-uk">78 percent of nearly 11,000 respondents</a>&nbsp;supported the company’s use of the technology.</p>



<p>In the discussion, Campbell Featherston, a partner at law firm Dentons New Zealand, mentioned that it is easier to deploy facial recognition technology (FRT) in New Zealand rather than Australia due to differences in law.</p>



<p>Commenting on the Bunnings case, Featherston remarked that the Australian retailer must obtain consent when collecting biometric data such as from FRT.&nbsp; “The absence of consent under Australian law means that it is very difficult for Bunnings to roll out facial recognition technology,” he said.</p>



<p>“The need for consent doesn’t apply [in New Zealand],” Campbell said, who commented that it wouldn’t surprise him if the privacy law had to change in Australia, such as removing the need for consent in order to accommodate the use of FRT.</p>



<p>Ross Hughson, managing director of Personal Information Management, was asked what was driving the use of FRT amongst retailers. “The key driver is health and safety of staff,” he replied, pointing to managers’ responsibility over their employees’ health and safety.</p>



<p>Featherston elaborated on how best to comply with New Zealand’s Privacy Act 2020, mentioning privacy impact assessments (PIA), having a good understanding of privacy safeguards, having human oversight of the technology, and properly trained staff. He suggested that users of the technology should be sure of the purpose of what they’re trying to achieve through its use, and to avoid “purpose creep.” Transparency is also important and retailers should have notices at the entrance of stores, and “customer-facing documentation,” he said.</p>



<p>The senior lawyer made the point that issues can arise even in the absence of technology. He brought up the example of security guards trying to identify people based on grainy CCTV footage, which could lead to misidentification.</p>



<p>Dr. Vica Papp, principal data scientist at MBIE, was invited to talk about racial biases. This is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/new-zealands-foodstuff-defends-its-use-of-facial-recognition">a chief concern of New Zealand Privacy Commissioner</a>&nbsp;Michael Webster as the accuracy of FRT for minority populations with darker skin is an issue.</p>



<p>Papp recognized that biases exist and the importance of training for staff on unconscious biases. She said that with FRT it can be a physics-based issue rather than that of “race” as people with darker skin tend to reflect less light, picking up on “light receptivity” and how this may impact FRT. But she advised that retailers should find a product that doesn’t show discrimination, that it can handle the specific local population, and to train and test the system on “well-curated data sets.”</p>

     <p>The Digital Identity unConference Europe (DICE) 2024 took place this June in Zürich, welcoming global experts to discuss not just secure digital identities but the creation of an integrated ecosystem of trust. Over three sunny days at Trust Square, attendees worked to connect digital trust to real-world economic advantages by focusing on authentic data, verifiable proofs, and practical applications that go beyond mere identification. This was made possible through the collaboration of <a href="https://www.trustsquare.com/">Trust Square</a>, <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/">DIDAS</a>, and <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a>, emphasizing the power of partnerships in advancing digital trust.</p>
 A New Direction for Swiss Digital Identity 
<p></p>
<p>Bundesrat Beat Jans, head of the Swiss Federal Office of Justice and the leading figure behind Switzerland’s e-ID project, opened the conference with updates on the nation’s progress. Switzerland is advancing its secure digital identity framework while maintaining technology-neutral principles, ensuring future adaptability.</p>
<p>The new e-ID law, under parliamentary review, defines the required trust infrastructure without mandating specific technologies, providing issuers with the flexibility to choose tailored solutions. This approach strengthens market responsiveness, protects investments, and ensures seamless integration with emerging innovations.</p>
<p>However, balancing security and accessibility remains a challenge. By limiting the initial rollout of the e-ID to a government-developed open-source wallet, Switzerland aims to provide robust security while ensuring transparency. Plans to engage with the OpenWallet Foundation and promote open hardware crypto processors reflect Switzerland’s commitment to digital sovereignty and international standardization.</p>
 Beyond Identity: Building a Trust Ecosystem 
<p>DICE 2024 highlighted that the economic value of digital trust lies in creating a broader ecosystem—not just digital identities. Verifiable credentials, authentic data, and secure proofs were discussed as enablers of trust in industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics.</p>
<p>By emphasizing data integrity, industries can streamline processes, reduce fraud, and build consumer trust. For example, verifiable credentials can authenticate professional qualifications or certifications in real-time, while trusted data channels improve supply chain transparency. DICE underscored the need for governance models to maintain consistency and reliability in such ecosystems, paving the way for more secure, efficient, and scalable solutions.</p>
 Economic Implications of Trust Ecosystems 
<p>The trust ecosystem proposed at DICE 2024 offers significant economic benefits:</p>

 Streamlined compliance: Simplified KYC and AML processes reduce administrative burdens. 
 Efficiency gains: Accelerated verification boosts operational efficiency and customer experiences. 
 Market expansion: Trust ecosystems create opportunities in sectors previously hindered by security concerns. 
 Innovation stimulation: Open standards encourage the development of interoperable solutions. 
 
<p>By linking trust-building efforts to tangible economic outcomes, DICE 2024 shifted the conversation from abstract concepts to measurable benefits.</p>
 The DICE unConference Experience 
<p></p>
<p>The open and collaborative format allowed attendees to co-create the agenda, ensuring discussions addressed real-world challenges. Key topics included</p>
 
 Interoperability: Cross-border and cross-platform systems to streamline international transactions. 
 Zero-knowledge proofs: Privacy-preserving verification methods. 
 Authentic data sharing: Applications in industries like healthcare and finance. 
 User-centric solutions: Accessibility for all users, including those with older technology. 
 Governance frameworks: Clear standards for public-private collaboration. 
 
<p>These discussions highlighted the importance of aligning technological innovation with user needs and industry-specific applications.</p>

 Aligning Digital Trust with Economic Benefits 
<p></p>
<p>DICE 2024 clarified that digital identity and trust are not standalone constructs—they drive real economic advantages. By linking trust ecosystems to fraud reduction, compliance efficiency, and market expansion, the conference demonstrated how secure systems empower businesses and consumers alike.</p>
 The Path Forward 
<p></p>
<p>While the digital trust landscape evolves, collaboration and innovation remain vital. As DICE continues to shape the agenda, the focus will be on actionable strategies that enhance security, scalability, and inclusivity.</p>

 One year ago, during COP, we proudly unveiled the <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">SAFc Registry</a>. Soon after, we <a href="https://rmi.org/press-release/not-for-profit-registry-launches-to-spur-sustainable-aviation-fuel-market-through-transparent-digital-tool/">launched it into production</a> alongside our visionary partners <a href="https://rmi.org/">RMI</a>, <a href="https://www.edf.org/">EDF</a>, and <a href="http://v">SABA</a>. It’s been an incredible journey, and as we mark this milestone, I wanted to reflect on where we started, how far we’ve come, and where we’re heading in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) book and claim&nbsp;industry <p>The SAFc Registry represents more than just a technical solution that Energy Web developed — it’s a mission-driven effort to decarbonize aviation. As a non-profit-driven <a href="https://rmi.org/clean-energy-101-book-and-claim/">book and claim</a> registry, it’s designed to ensure transparency, accountability, and scalability in the deployment of SAF. From the outset, our goal has been to create a trusted system for tracking and verifying SAF certificates, enabling the whole aviation supply chain to credibly participate in the energy transition.</p><p>A Groundbreaking Beginning</p><p>When we launched the SAFc Registry, it was a first in many ways for Energy Web. It was the inaugural implementation of a <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/green-proofs">Green Proofs</a> registry, setting the stage for the recent launch of <a href="https://katalist.eco/">Katalist</a>, the Green Proofs registry we built for sustainable maritime shipping. The SAFc Registry also broke new ground with the innovative use of worker node technology for data validation — a distributed, multi-party approach that ensures reliability and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Energy Web’s role initially focused on providing the technology behind the registry, but as the platform matured, so did our involvement. We’ve since stepped into the role of SAFc Registry Administrator, cementing our commitment to driving this critical initiative forward day-to-day.</p> Building Momentum <p>While the launch in Q4 2023 was exciting, the real momentum picked up in Q1 2024, and the past year has been a whirlwind of activity and&nbsp;growth:</p>  Engagement and Education: We held countless introduction calls and demos, spreading awareness about the registry and its potential impact across the aviation and energy industries.  Global Adoption: Hard work paid off as we onboarded 50 companies from across the globe and a diverse range of industries.  Onboarding and Operations: We refined our onboarding pipeline and operational processes, ensuring a smooth experience for&nbsp;users.  Impact in Numbers: To date, the SAFc Registry has facilitated over 50 SAFc issuances, representing over 3,000 tonnes of SAF that has been produced and is at work displacing the use of conventional jet&nbsp;fuel.  Continuous Improvement: We’ve listened closely to user feedback, rolled out new features (including an API for registry power users), resolved bugs, and refined our terms and conditions to better meet user&nbsp;needs.  Governance: Convening our <a href="https://docs.safcregistry.org/registry-governance">governing board</a> for the first time was a key step in formalizing the policies and processes that will guide the registry’s growth into the&nbsp;future.   Lessons Learned <p>Like any pioneering effort, launching the SAFc Registry came with its share of challenges and learning opportunities. The v1 version of the registry taught us what worked — and what didn’t. These lessons have been invaluable as we’ve evolved the platform to better serve our users. The enhancements we’ve deployed reflect our commitment to listening, learning, and adapting.</p><p>Looking Ahead</p><p>Our work is far from over. Just this week, we’ve rolled out a new statistics <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">section to the homepage</a> providing users and the broader public with a clearer view of registry activity. It’s just one of many features in development as we work through a robust backlog of user-requested improvements and policy updates from our governing board.</p><p>The future of SAF is bright. Announced SAF projects are expected to increase the global supply by more than <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/aerospace-and-defense/our-insights/how-the-aviation-industry-could-help-scale-sustainable-fuel-production">10x by 2030</a>. The SAFc Registry is poised to play a central role in supporting this growth, ensuring the scalability and credibility of SAF adoption on a global&nbsp;scale.</p> A Heartfelt Thank&nbsp;You <p>None of this would be possible without the incredible support of our partners, users, and team. As we celebrate this milestone, we’re filled with gratitude and optimism for what lies ahead. Here’s to the continued success of the SAFc Registry and the advancement of sustainable aviation.</p><p>Let’s keep flying higher — together.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global technology company driving the energy transition by developing and deploying open-source decentralized technologies.

<p>How dow we get from this—</p>
<p></p>
<p>To this—</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/"></a></p>
<p>?</p>
<p>By making customers independent.</p>
<p>Hmm… maybe The Independent Customer should be the title of my follow-up to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">The Intention Economy</a>.</p>
<p>Because, to have an Intention Economy, one needs independent customers: ones who are in charge of their own lives in the digital world:</p>
 
 Who they are—to themselves, and to all the entities they know, including other people, and organizations of all kinds, including companies. 
 What they know about their lives (property, health, relationships, plans, histories)—and the lives of others with whom they have relationships. 
 Their plans—for everything.: what they will do, what they will buy, where they will go, what tickets they hold, you name it. 
 
<p>Add whatever you want to that list. It can be anything. Eventually it will be everything that has a digital form.</p>
<p>What will hold all that information, and what will make that information safely engageable with other people and entities?</p>
<p>A wallet.</p>
<p>Not a digital version of the container for cash and cards we carry in our purses and pockets. <a href="https://www.apple.com/wallet/">Apple</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wallet.google/">Google</a> think they own that space already, which is fine, because that space is confined by the mobile app model. Wallets will be bigger and deeper than that.</p>
<p>Wallets will embody two A’s: archives and&nbsp;abilities. Among those abilities is AI: your AI. <a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/">Personal AI</a>.&nbsp;One that is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=agentic">agentic</a> for you, and not just for the sellers of the world.</p>
<p>Interesting harbinger: <a href="https://www.inrupt.com/">Inrupt</a>&nbsp;now calls&nbsp;<a href="https://solidproject.org/for-users">Solid pods</a> “<a href="https://www.inrupt.com/blog/open-source-data-wallet">wallets</a>.” (<a href="https://forum.solidproject.org/t/inrupts-data-wallet/7836">Discussion</a>.)</p>
<p>Wallets are how we move e-commerce from a world of accounts to a world of independent customers with personal agency. With AI agents working for them and not just for sellers.</p>
<p>In his latest newsletter, titled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.customerfutures.com/p/a-commerce-will-be-the-biggest-disruption">‘A-Commerce’ will be the biggest disruption since the web, and Digital Wallets are the new accounts</a>, Jamie Smith says this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Web3 crowd say digital wallets are about transferrable digital assets and ownership without a central authority. And they are right.</p>
<p>But there’s more.</p>
<p>Many payments and identity experts will say that digital wallets are really about identity. Proving who you are and what you are entitled to do (tickets, access). Maybe even with fancy selective disclosure features.</p>
<p>They are also right. But that’s not the whole picture.</p>
<p>A pioneering group of others believe that digital wallets are really about the portability of any verifiable information, and digital authenticity.</p>
<p>And they too are right. We’re now getting much, much closer to what I’m talking about. But there’s still more.</p>
<p>Once individuals can show up independently, with their own digital tools – digital wallets with verifiable, data, identity and digital assets – then we have something new, something special.</p>
<p>It’s a New. Customer. Channel. </p>
<p>Once a business asks for some data from a customer’s digital wallet, they have the opportunity to form a new digital connection with that customer.</p>
<p>A persistent one.</p>
<p>A verifiable one.</p>
<p>A private one.</p>
<p>An auditable, secure and intelligent one.</p>
<p>My goodness, what business wouldn’t want that? Imagine plugging that customer connection directly into business systems and processes, like CRM.</p>
<p>Yes, digital wallets can hold and manage assets. And identity. And portable, verifiable, authentic data.</p>
<p>But with the narrower ‘data and assets’ framing, we risk missing the larger market opportunity.</p>
<p>Digital wallets become the new account.</p>
<p>For everything.</p>
<p>OK so what is an account?</p>
<p>With money, it’s a shared and trusted record of all your transactions. Who did what, who paid what, and who owes who.</p>
<p>With business, it’s a shared record of all your products and interactions. It’s a critical customer channel and interface. The place people come to check things. To ask things. To ‘do business’.</p>
<p>Each customer account has a number. A unique identifier. It has a way to message customers. A way to record what’s been sent to, and received from, the customer.</p>
<p>Ring a bell?</p>
<p>Digital wallets will be able to do all this and much more.</p>
<p>They will also be more secure. More private. More flexible. And more portable.</p>
<p>So it’s possible – I’d even argue more likely – that digital wallets may be more disruptive than browsers were in the 1990s.</p>
<p>But like browsers, they will first be misunderstood.</p>
<p>Digital wallets will become the new account.</p>
<p>For business? For government? For banking? For health? For travel?</p>
<p>For life.</p>
<p>I have said for over a decade that the only 360° view of the customer, is the customer.</p>
<p>Just imagine, once a customer can bring their own wallet – their own account – to each business:</p>
 
 The economics change. Why would a business maintain a complex and proprietary account platform when digital interactions can be handled – indeed automated – via a verifiable digital wallet that’s available on every smart device? 
 The data flows change.&nbsp;Why would a business store unnecessary customer data when they can just ask for it on demand, with consent, from the customer’s digital wallet? Then delete it again once used? 
 The risks change. What if we could reduce fraud and account takeover to near zero, when every customer interaction has to be authenticated via the customer’s digital wallet (likely with biometrics)? 
 
<p>The very fabric of the customer relationship changes.</p>
<p>This is just a glimpse of what‘s possible, and what’s coming. Especially when you tie it to digital AI agents….</p>
<p>When you look closely, you’ll see that digital wallets aren’t even The Thing. They are ‘below the surface’ of the customer channel.</p>
<p>Lots to be written about that. Coming soon.</p>
<p>For now, it’s a simple switch: when you hear ‘account’, just think ‘wallet’.</p></blockquote>
 
<p>Here is the challenge: making wallets a must-have: an invention that mothers necessity.</p>
<p>We’ve had those before, with—</p>
 
 
 PCs 
 word processors and spreadsheets 
 the Net and the Web, 
 graphical browsers 
 personal publishing and syndication 
 smartphones and apps 
 streams and podcasts. 
 
 
<p>Wallets need to be like all of those: must-haves that transform and not just disrupt.</p>
<p>It’s a tall order, but—given the vast possibilities—one that is bound to be filled.<br>
As for why this won’t be something one of the bigs (e.g. Apple and Google) do for themselves, consider these five words you hear often online:</p>
<p>“Wherever you get your podcasts.”</p>
<p>Those five words<a href="https://www.cioinsight.com/innovation/pioneer-of-rss-blogs-podcasts-looks-at-whats-next/"> were made possible by RSS</a>.</p>
<p>It’s why all of the things in the bullet list above are NEA:</p>
 
 Nobody owns them 
 Everybody can use them

<p>When we have wallets with those required features, and they become inventions that mother necessity, we will have truly independent customers.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>While the US elections took the media limelight this month, I’d like to remind our members of another election of more local significance—<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/10/15/dinz-executive-council-elections-annual-meeting-2024/">Digital Identity NZ’s annual election</a>&nbsp;to vote candidates onto our Executive Council—so we can continue the drive towards a robust and equitable digital identity ecosystem.</p>



<p>Voting closes next Monday 25th, with successful candidates announced at the Annual Meeting on December 5th.</p>

<p> Banking in the Spotlight – ANZ and BNZ Announcements</p>



<p>Major corporate members ANZ and BNZ were in the news this month with banking tech-related statements—<a href="https://qippay.com/qippay-partners-with-another-major-bank-achieves-iso-27001/">ANZ announcing its partnership with Qippay</a>, and BNZ announcing its&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.bnz.co.nz/2024/11/bnz-and-blinkpay-to-accelerate-open-banking-in-new-zealand">acquisition of Blinkpa</a><a href="https://blog.bnz.co.nz/2024/11/bnz-and-blinkpay-to-accelerate-open-banking-in-new-zealand">y</a>&nbsp;soon after the release of its&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.bnz.co.nz/2024/10/bnz-launches-new-anti-scam-tool-to-lock-scammers-out-of-online-banking">new anti-scam app to reduce fraud</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open Banking is gaining traction in Aotearoa, with 80% of consumer bank accounts now covered by open banking initiatives.&nbsp;This data was surfaced in the recently launched OpenFinanceANZ&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openbankingecosystemmap.com/new-zealand-open-banking-ecosystem-map-first-edition">report and ecosystem map</a>&nbsp;which was supported by our member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/">PaymentsNZ</a>&nbsp;alongside MasterCard, Fintech Australia and our&nbsp;NZTech Group partner&nbsp;<a href="https://fintechnz.org.nz/">FinTechNZ</a>.

<p>&nbsp;Addressing Bias in Biometrics<br><br>Recent media coverage regarding claims of racial bias in facial biometrics has prompted the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/biometrics-special-interest-group-sig/">DINZ Biometrics Special Interest Group</a>&nbsp;to look into the feasibility of a consented dataset of Kiwi faces using its independence to take the role of custodian, facilitating subsequent software testing to address bias and accuracy.</p>

<p>As the saying goes, malicious actors don’t break in—they log in. There’s a significant truth in that statement. Today, many organizations struggle to protect their staff from credential phishing, a challenge that’s only grown as attackers increasingly execute “MFA bypass” attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an MFA bypass attack, threat actors use social engineering techniques to trick victims into providing their username and password on a fake website. If victims are using “legacy MFA” (such as SMS, authenticator apps, or push notifications), the attackers simply request the MFA code or trigger the push notification. If they can convince someone to reveal two pieces of information (username and password), they can likely manipulate them into sharing three (username, password, and MFA code or action).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make no mistake—any form of MFA is better than no MFA. But recent attacks make it clear: legacy MFA is no match for modern threats. So, what can organizations do? Sometimes a case study can answer that question.</p>



<p>Today, CISA and the USDA are releasing a&nbsp;<a href="https://cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/phishing-resistant-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-success-story-usdas-fast-identity-online-fido">case study</a>&nbsp;that details the USDA’s deployment of FIDO capabilities to approximately 40,000 staff. While most of their staff have been issued government-standard Personal Identity Verification (PIV) smartcards, this technology is not suitable for all employees, such as seasonal staff or those working in specialized lab environments where decontamination procedures could damage standard PIV cards. This case study outlines the challenges the USDA faced, how they built their identity system, and their recommendations to other enterprises. Our personal favorite recommendation: “Always be piloting”.</p>



<p>FIDO authentication addresses MFA-bypass attacks by using modern cryptographic techniques built into the operating systems, phones, and browsers we already use. Single sign-on (SSO) providers and popular websites also support FIDO authentication.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> allow users to log in to their secure accounts without passwords. Ecommerce businesses were first in line when the&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a>&nbsp;introduced passkeys in 2022. The trade association, which stands for Fast ID Online, launched in 2012 with a mission to reduce the world’s password reliance.</p>



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director of FIDO, said the past two years have been momentous for members and ecommerce businesses. “You want to attract customers to your site and protect them from account takeover, credential stuffing, and phishing attacks,” he said. “That’s why PayPal, eBay, Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and other ecommerce companies were the earliest adopters of passkey payments.”</p>



<p>Shikiar noted that passkey awareness has risen from 39% in 2022 to 57% in 2024, according to a FIDO survey of 10,000 consumers in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Australia, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, India, and China.</p>

<p>What is a passkey? A passkey is a FIDO authentication credential based on FIDO standards, that allows a user to sign in to apps and websites with the same process that they use to unlock their device (biometrics, PIN, or pattern). Passkeys are FIDO cryptographic credentials that are tied to a user’s account on a website or application. With passkeys, users no longer need to enter usernames and passwords or additional factors. Instead, a user approves a sign-in with the same process they use to unlock their device (for example, biometrics, PIN, pattern). </p>

Strong cryptographic security behind passkeys prevents phishing attacks, reduces security breaches and account takeovers. Passkeys make sign-ins fast, simple, and secure.

<p>It’s been a couple of years since Apple, Google, and Microsoft started trying to kill the password, and its demise seems more likely than ever.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance, the industry group spearheading the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkey</a> push, is putting out some much-needed guidelines to make passkeys usage feel more consistent from one site to the next, and the big tech platforms are getting better at letting you store passkeys in your preferred password manager. Work is also underway on a protocol to let people securely switch between password managers and take all their passkeys with them.</p>



<p>All this is contributing to an air of inevitability for passkeys, especially as major e-commerce players such as Amazon and Shopify get on board. Even if you’re not fully attuned to the passkey movement, you’ll soon have to go out of your way to avoid it.</p>



<p>“Within the next three to five years, virtually every major service will offer consumers a passwordless option,” says Andrew Shikiar, the FIDO Alliance’s CEO and executive director.</p>

 <a href="https://events.iu.edu/ostromworkshop/event/1624058-ostrom-workshop-hls-beyond-the-web-shwetha-rao"></a><p>This is important. Be there.</p> 
<p>If we want <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_relationship_management">VRM</a> to prove out globally, we have to start locally. That’s what’s happening right now in India, using <a href="https://www.ondc.org/">ONDC (the Open Network for Digital Commerce)</a>, which runs on the <a href="https://dev.to/kaustubhyerkade/beckn-protocol-6bd">Beckn protocol</a>.</p>
<p>ONDC is a <a href="https://opendata.ondc.org/">happening thing</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://opendata.ondc.org/"></a></p>
<p>One big (and essential) goal for VRM is <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2015/02/15/a-master-app-to-give-customers-scale/">individual customer scale across many vendors</a>.&nbsp; ONDC and Beckn are for exactly that. Here is how <a href="https://dev.to/kaustubhyerkade">kaustubh yerkade</a> explains it in <a href="https://dev.to/kaustubhyerkade/beckn-protocol-6bd">Understanding Beckn Protocol: Revolutionizing Open Networks in E-commerce</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Beckn protocol in the Real World<br>
The Beckn Protocol is part of a larger movement toward creating open digital ecosystems, particularly in India. For example, the ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) initiative in India is built using the Beckn protocol, aiming to democratize e-commerce and bring small retailers into the digital economy.&nbsp;The Indian government supports ONDC for making digital commerce more accessible and competitive.</p>
<p>Here are some practical examples of how the Beckn Protocol can be used in different industries:</p>
<p>1. Ride-Hailing and Mobility Services<br>
Example: Imagine a city with multiple ride-hailing services (e.g., Uber, Ola, Rapido). Instead of using individual apps for each service, a user can use one app powered by the Beckn Protocol. This app aggregates all available ride-hailing services, showing nearby cars, prices, and estimated arrival times from multiple providers. The user can choose the best option, book the ride, and pay directly through the unified app.</p>
<p>Benefit: Service providers gain broader visibility, and users can easily compare services in one place without switching between apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://becknprotocol.io/imagining-mobility-with-beckn/">https://becknprotocol.io/imagining-mobility-with-beckn/</a></p>
<p>2. Food Delivery Services<br>
Example: A consumer uses a food delivery app that leverages Beckn to show restaurants from multiple food delivery services (like Zomato, Swiggy, and local food delivery providers). Instead of sticking to just one platform, the user sees menus from different services and can order based on price, availability, or delivery time.</p>
<p>Benefit: Restaurants get listed on more platforms, increasing their exposure, and users can find more options without hopping between different apps.</p>
<p>3. E-Commerce and Local Retail<br>
Example: A shopper is looking for a product (like a phone charger) and uses an app built on the Beckn Protocol. The app aggregates inventory from big e-commerce players (like Amazon or Flipkart) as well as small local retailers. The user can compare prices and delivery times from both big platforms and nearby local stores, then make a purchase from the most convenient provider.</p>
<p>Benefit: Small businesses and local stores can compete with larger e-commerce platforms and reach a wider audience without needing their own app or website.</p>
<p>4. Healthcare Services<br>
Example: A patient needs to book a doctor’s appointment but doesn’t want to manually search through different healthcare platforms. A healthcare app using Beckn shows available doctors and clinics across multiple platforms (like Practo, 1mg, or even independent clinics). The patient can choose a doctor based on location, specialization, and availability, all in one place.</p>
<p>Benefit: Patients get access to a larger pool of healthcare providers, and doctors can offer their services on multiple platforms through a single integration.</p>
<p>5. Logistics and Courier Services<br>
Example: An online seller wants to ship products to customers but doesn’t want to manage multiple courier services. With an app built on Beckn, they can see delivery options from multiple logistics providers (like FedEx, Blue Dart, and local couriers) and choose the best one based on cost, speed, or reliability.</p>
<p>Benefit: Businesses can streamline shipping operations by comparing various logistics providers through one interface, optimizing for cost and delivery time.</p>
<p>6. Public Transportation<br>
Example: A commuter is planning a trip using public transit in a city. Using a Beckn-powered app, they can view transportation options from multiple transit services (like metro, bus, bike-sharing services, or even ride-hailing). The app provides real-time schedules, available options, and payment methods across different transport networks.</p>
<p>Benefit: The commuter has a unified experience with multiple transportation modes, improving convenience and access to more options.</p>
<p>7. Local Services (Home Services, Repair, Cleaning)<br>
Example: A user needs a home repair service (e.g., a plumber or electrician). Instead of browsing different service provider platforms (like UrbanClap or Housejoy), a Beckn-enabled app aggregates professionals from multiple service providers. The user can compare prices, reviews, and availability and book a service directly from the app.</p>
<p>Benefit: Service providers get access to more customers, and consumers can quickly find professionals based on location, reviews, and price.</p>
<p>8. Travel and Hospitality<br>
Example: A traveler uses a travel booking app based on Beckn to find accommodations. The app aggregates listings from various hotel chains, Airbnb, and local guesthouses. The traveler can filter by price, location, and amenities, then book the best option without switching between platforms.</p>
<p>Benefit: Smaller accommodation providers can compete with big brands, and travelers get access to more choices across different platforms in one app.</p>
<p>9. Government Services and Civic Engagement<br>
Example: A citizen uses a Beckn-enabled app to access multiple government services. They can apply for a driver’s license, pay taxes, and book a health checkup at a government hospital—all from one platform that integrates services from different government departments and third-party providers.</p>
<p>Benefit: Governments can offer a unified experience across various services, and citizens get easier access to public services without visiting multiple websites or offices.</p></blockquote>
<p>He adds,</p>
<blockquote><p>The ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) initiative in India is built using the Beckn protocol, aiming to democratize e-commerce and bring small retailers into the digital economy. The Indian government supports ONDC for making digital commerce more accessible and competitive.</p></blockquote>
<p>While it is nice to have government support, anyone anywhere can deploy open and decentralized tech, or integrate it into their apps and services.</p>
<p>On Tuesday we’ll have a chance to talk about all this at <a href="https://events.iu.edu/ostromworkshop/event/1624058-ostrom-workshop-hls-beyond-the-web-shwetha-rao">our latest salon</a> at Indiana University and live on Zoom. Our speaker, <a href="https://shwetharao.tech/">Shwetha Rao</a>, will be here in person, which always makes for a good event—even for those zooming in.</p>

<p>Experts discovered the top 10 overused passwords in the US that could put you at risk of being easily hacked.</p>



<p>NordPass and NordSteller recently released its sixth annual&nbsp;<a href="https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/">analysis of personal password habits</a>.</p>



<p>Based on NordPass and NordStellar’s data they crunched, ‘secret’ was the most common password in the US.</p>



<p>The management platforms found that the password was used 328,831 times, and it would take less than one second for someone to crack it.</p>



<p>‘Secret’ is also ranked in the top 10 most common passwords in the world.</p>



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director of FIDO Alliance, mentioned hackers could guess the password if it’s even spelled using numbers or with other substitutions while speaking with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/26/everything-you-know-about-passwords-could-be-wrong.html">CNBC</a>.</p>



<p>‘For example, they might believe that “secret” is a weak password but “s3cr3t” will be hard to guess,’ Shikiar said in 2019.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Corporate Overview</p>



<p>Branch® is a cloud-native home and auto insurance company founded in 2020. Operating on a serverless architecture, Branch’s mission is to simplify the insurance purchasing experience for consumers and independent insurance agents.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“One of our key superpowers is making the insurance buying experience as easy as possible,” explained Arkadiy Goykhberg, Chief Information Security Officer at Branch.</p>
</blockquote>



 Branch Authentication Challenges  



<p>Due to the sensitive nature of their market and the variety of stakeholders they served, Branch faced multiple authentication challenges:</p>



 
 Legacy two-factor authentication. Branch has been relying on SMS-based two-factor authentication, which has multiple issues. Telco issues would prevent users from logging in. It’s also not phishing resistant and subject to risk associated with SIM swapping attacks. 



 Customer support volume. There was a high volume of support tickets related to password resets and login issues. 



 User-friendly approach. Branch needed a more secure and user-friendly authentication process to serve their 12,000+ independent insurance agents. 



 Compliance. Another core challenge was the need to meet strict compliance requirements in the highly regulated insurance industry. 
 



 How Passkeys Addressed Branch’s Challenges 



<p>Branch identified passkeys as the solution to their authentication problems for several reasons.</p>



<p>Enhanced Security: Passkeys are inherently phishing-resistant, addressing the vulnerabilities associated with SMS-based authentication.</p>



<p>Improved User Experience: Passkeys eliminate the need for passwords, reducing friction during login and preventing issues related to forgotten passwords or typing errors.</p>



<p>Reduced Support Burden: By implementing passkeys, Branch saw a significant reduction in support tickets. John MaGee, Software Product Manager at Branch, noted, “We did see our support ticket volume drop by about half, which was the key business goal, outside of some of the user experience and security goals of the project.”</p>



<p>Regulatory Compliance: Passkeys provided a strong foundation for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in the insurance industry.</p>



<p>Compatibility with Existing Infrastructure: Passkeys integrated well with Branch’s cloud-native architecture, allowing for a smoother implementation process.</p>



 Implementation process and results 



 Branch adopted a phased approach to implementing passkeys. 



<p>The first phase involved internal testing. Branch first implemented passkeys for internal use, which helped build confidence and user acceptance. Branch then went through a vendor selection and development phase, contracting with Descope. Branch decided that it was a more efficient approach to engage with a service provider to help with passkey implementation.</p>



<p>The project roadmap included a two month vendor selection process, followed by a three-month development phase and a six-week end-user migration phase.</p>



<p>The final step was a phased user migration. Branch rolled out passkeys to its agents in waves, starting with a small group and gradually scaling up. The onboarding process involved multiple communication campaigns to prepare users for the new authentication experience. The user journey included prompting users to set up passkeys and providing a fallback option of email and OTP. The goal was to ensure a seamless transition and reduce support ticket volume by eliminating password resets. This approach allowed the company to refine the process based on feedback and minimize risks.</p>



<p>The results of the passkey implementation were impressive:</p>



 
 25% passkey adoption rate across the organization, exceeding internal goals. 



 50% reduction in support ticket volume related to authentication issues. 



 Maintained steady login failure rates at 5%, despite the transition. 



 Improved user experience, with fewer frustrations related to authentication. 
 



<p>One surprising benefit was the high compatibility of passkeys with existing hardware and software. Goykhberg said that he had initially expected that only approximately 60% of systems would support passkeys.</p>



<p>“That hypothesis was wrong. To my surprise, only a few devices across thousands of logins could not support passkeys,” he said.</p>



 Branch’s passkey success and future roadmap 



<p>Branch’s successful implementation of passkeys has not only addressed their current authentication challenges but also laid the groundwork for future improvements and expansions.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>Goykhberg said:<br>“Descope’s flexible workflow made implementing passkeys and taking care of edge cases relatively straightforward. With conditional steps, we routed users to passkeys when their hardware or software were compatible, and routed them to fallback MFA options when passkeys couldn’t be supported. Visualizing the user journey as a workflow helps us audit and modify the registration<br>and authentication journey without making significant code changes, which sets us up well for the future.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The company’s successful phased rollout approach, starting with internal adoption and then gradually expanding to their agent base, highlights the importance of incremental implementation and learning. This strategy will continue to inform their future authentication initiatives. Building on the initial success of 25% passkey adoption, Branch aims to increase this number through targeted experimentation and user education.</p>



<p>Branch’s successful implementation of passkeys demonstrates how this modern authentication method can significantly improve both security and user experience in the insurance industry. By addressing the vulnerabilities of traditional authentication methods,<br>reducing support burden and providing a seamless user experience, passkeys have proven to be a valuable solution for Branch’s authentication needs.</p>

<p>You might have noticed that many online services are now offering the option of using <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, a digital authentication method touted as an easier and more secure way to log in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some 20% of the world’s top 100 websites now accept passkeys, said Andrew Shikiar, CEO of the FIDO Alliance, an industry group that developed the core authentication technology behind passkeys.</p>



<p>Passkeys first came to the public’s attention when Apple added the technology to iOS in 2022. They got more traction after&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/google-passkeys-replace-passwords-b2f2fb640ae5e92a933cba66ed63e29b">Google started</a>&nbsp;using them in 2023. Now, many other companies including PayPal, Amazon, Microsoft and eBay work with passkeys. There’s a&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys-directory/">list</a>&nbsp;on the FIDO Alliance website.</p>



<p>Still, some popular sites like Facebook and Netflix haven’t started using them yet.</p>



<p>Passkey technology is still in the “early adoption” phase but “it’s just a matter of time for more and more sites to start offering this,” Shikiar said.</p>

<p>Progressive Trust—it sounds a bit like something from a relationship advice column, right? But in the world of digital interactions, it’s actually a revolutionary model, one that moves us away from “all-or-nothing” choices into a more human, flexible way of establishing trust. Progressive Trust is about mirroring the natural ways we build trust in real life, adding depth and resilience to our digital interactions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The basic idea behind progressive trust is to model how trust works in the real world”<br>
—Christopher Allen, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-progressive-trust/">Musings of a Trust Architect: Progressive Trust</a> (December 2022)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In real life, trust doesn’t happen at the click of a button. It’s a process. You don’t start a friendship, a business deal, or a marriage with complete openness or blind trust. Instead, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">what you reveal is initially minimized</a>, and then trust builds up gradually. As we share experiences, we reveal more, bit by bit, learning through consistent responses from the other person. When it comes to digital relationships, whether they’re between people, devices, or other entities, why should things be any different?</p>

 Why Progressive Trust Matters Today 

<p>The internet didn’t start off so polarized. Back in the early days, you could slowly get to know people online, like on message boards or MUDs, where interaction was incremental and organic. But as commercialization took over, new online communities popped up with restricted, binary models of trust. Tech giants started telling us who to trust based on certificates or institutional endorsements, pushing people into a “trust or don’t trust” mindset. But this one-size-fits-all approach isn’t just impersonal. It’s risky. Without the gray area, we’re left with blind trust or total skepticism, with few options inbetween.</p>

<p>Enter Progressive Trust, which seeks to change that by returning choice to the user, letting individuals decide whom to trust and how much of themselves to reveal over time. It’s an effective way to enhance security and protect user agency, fitting seamlessly into decentralized systems like blockchain, where openness and security go hand in hand. Progressive Trust takes the online world back to a more natural process of gradual trust-building, transforming digital trust from a binary affair into something more organic.</p>

 The Progressive Trust Life Cycle 

<p>Let’s break down the Progressive Trust Life Cycle into its key phases, each step building on the last and adding layers of trust over time. Think of it as a journey from cautious introduction to informed engagement, with each phase providing the groundwork for a stronger, more resilient trust model. These are the steps of progressive trust that are simultaneously automatic in the real world and often ignored in the digital world.</p>

 0. Context – Interaction Considered 
<p>The foundation of Progressive Trust begins with understanding the Context of an interaction. This  sets the stage by establishing the purpose and parameters of the interaction, helping each party assess risk and feasibility. Before any data is exchanged or any commitments are made, each party considers the interaction’s purpose, its goals, its potential benefits, and the risks involved. They also examine the setting in which the interaction takes place, ensuring that they understand the overall environment and any particular conditions that might impact their decision.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: A homeowner, Hank, evaluates hiring a contractor for a kitchen remodel. He considers the financial costs, the importance of quality work, and the potential risks of inviting someone into his home for an extended period. The stakes of the scenario are sufficient to prompt Hank to engage in a Progressive Trust model, as opposed to a quick, one-off transaction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This initial phase helps each side assess whether the potential stakes, such as financial or reputational risk, warrant a full, Progressive Trust approach or if simpler, lower-risk models could suffice.</p>

 1. Introduction – Assertions Declared 
<p>With the interaction context defined, both parties proceed with Introduction, where they each make initial declarations and claims. By sharing basic information, the parties set the groundwork for further scrutiny, while keeping sensitive details private or hidden (for now).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: Hank meets Carla, the cabinet maker, at a social gathering and discusses his interest in remodeling his kitchen. Carla offers her business card and highlights her experience, expressing interest in working with him. This initial interaction is informal yet purposeful, establishing the first connection and introducing each party’s intentions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase is an essential starting point for trust-building, as it allows each party to signal their intentions clearly and publicly, establishing a mutual understanding of what they aim to accomplish.
It does not involve extensive trust verification but instead creates a framework of transparency and expectation between the participants.</p>

 2. Wholeness – Integrity Assessed 
<p>Once an introduction has been established, both parties assess the Wholeness of the information shared. This phase involves evaluating the structural integrity of the data, ensuring that all critical pieces are complete and correctly formatted. Think of this as a quality check: verifying that foundational information is present, well-formed, and free from any immediate signs of corruption or tampering.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: Hank checks Carla’s business card, noting that it includes her contractor license number and contact details. Carla, meanwhile, considers whether Hank’s job aligns with her skillset. Both use this phase to make sure the information they have about each other is coherent and free of red flags.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase creates the foundation for deeper verification by ensuring that each party’s data contributions are reliable at a surface level. Without verifying structural integrity, any future steps could rest on flawed or incomplete data, leading to potential misunderstandings or risks.</p>

 3. Proofs – Secrets Verified 
<p>With data integrity confirmed, the next step is Proofs, where parties delve into verifying the sources of the data. It’s a deeper level of validation, establishing the authenticity of the sources for each party’s assertions. That validation leverages modern technology such as digital signatures where possible, to minimize the risk of misrepresentation or fraud.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: Hank calls a few of Carla’s previous clients, confirming that they exist, and the testimonials given to him are real. Similarly, Carla may ask for proof of Hank’s readiness to pay by confirming his budget or financial standing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase confirms that both parties’ assertions are backed by a proof, to establish a more secure foundation for the interaction.</p>

 4. References – Trust Affirmed 
<p>Building on the established proofs, the References phase affirms trust by gathering endorsements, certificates, or additional validation from external sources. This step goes beyond just authenticating the source of any assertions. It’s about gathering the good word from others, including testimonials, reviews, licenses, or certificates. Cryptographic methods may also be used to assure the validity of the references. Parties don’t necessarily gather every reference: they collect until they feel they have enough corroborating information to proceed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: Hank checks Carla’s contractor license in a state registry and reads online reviews. Carla, in turn, verifies Hank’s reputation or credibility within her professional network, gaining confidence that his project is legitimate and that he can be trusted to honor financial commitments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase provides a composite affirmation of the other party’s trustworthiness based on diverse sources, making trust more holistic. It creates a comprehensive picture without oversimplifying the credibility of each party into a binary “yes” or “no.”</p>

 5. Requirements – Community Compliance 
<p>After personal and third-party validation, the parties consider whether the interaction meets broader Community Standards and Requirements. Here, each party performs an audit to see if the interaction complies with external guidelines, legal standards, or industry norms, which may vary by context. Compliance might involve revealing additional data, following guidelines for quality or safety, or meeting regulatory requirements, which helps each party feel confident that their involvement is appropriate and sanctioned.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: Hank ensures that Carla’s contractor license and project quote meet legal requirements and industry standards, such as fair pricing and warranty expectations. Carla might consult her network or a local building authority to verify that Hank’s project is feasible and professionally compliant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase adds another layer of credibility through its confirmation that the interaction aligns with expected practices and requirements.</p>

 6. Approval – Risk Calculated 
<p>With community compliance confirmed, each party calculates the risk of proceeding and provides a tentative Approval. This step involves a personal assessment, comparing the accumulated trust to any potential risks or liabilities. It’s a decision point where each party considers their own risk model and goals, determining whether the interaction is likely to fulfill their needs without exposing them to undue harm. Approval may involve internal checks or may require formal documentation of agreed-upon terms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: Hank and Carla both review the project’s terms and risk factors, ensuring they feel comfortable with potential liabilities. When ready, they formalize their commitment by signing a contract, each confident that the project aligns with their risk model and is mutually beneficial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase emphasizes that trust isn’t an all-or-nothing concept. It exists on a spectrum, and each party must decide if their level of trust is sufficient to continue.</p>

 7. Agreement – Threshold Endorsed (Optional) 
<p>In situations of higher stakes or complexity, the Agreement phase may require additional endorsements before proceeding. An Agreement phase is optional but valuable when external input can add layers of confidence, often through the endorsement of peers, family members, or other trusted figures. Threshold endorsements are vital in larger or more sensitive projects, ensuring that all necessary parties or authorities approve before moving forward.</p>

<p>Example: Hank might discuss the project with his family for added assurance, while Carla secures necessary permits from the city. Both parties use these endorsements to reinforce</p>

<p>This phase provides an extra level of validation, helping each party feel more secure in their decision to proceed.</p>

 8. Fulfillment – Interaction Finalized 
<p>Fulfillment is the phase where each party finally executes their commitments, bringing the project to life based on the trust established through previous steps. Fulfillment requires each party to act according to the rules they’ve set, adhering to any terms, standards, or expectations agreed upon earlier.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: Carla completes the kitchen remodel, delivering quality work as per the contract. Hank, in turn, fulfills his financial commitment by making the payment. The project reaches its conclusion, satisfying both parties’ expectations based on their prior trust-building efforts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase represents the culmination of the trust-building process, where both sides honor their agreements and responsibilities. It’s a phase of action rather than evaluation, marking a key transition from planning to execution, after which the interaction is officially complete.</p>

 9. Escalation – Independently Inspected (Optional) 
<p>In high-stakes or sensitive interactions, the Escalation phase optionally introduces an independent, third-party inspection. This step allows an impartial reviewer to verify that each party’s work or commitments were met, ensuring that the final product aligns with the agreed-upon standards. An inspector may re-evaluate certain phases, especially compliance and fulfillment, confirming that all requirements were followed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: A city inspector reviews Carla’s remodel to ensure it complies with local building codes, giving Hank and Carla final confirmation that the project meets regulatory standards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase helps protect each party, providing an additional level of assurance when risk is high or when the interaction has lasting implications.</p>

 10. Dispute – Independently Arbitrated (Optional) 
<p>If issues arise, the final, optional phase of Dispute involves resolving conflicts through independent arbitration. In cases where fulfillment does not meet expectations, each party may bring forth additional data or reveal previously concealed information to support their case. An arbitrator then considers the evidence, reviewing both parties’ original commitments, agreements, and standards, to determine a fair resolution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: If a cabinet installed by Carla collapses, Hank may initiate a dispute to assess liability. An independent arbitrator reviews the contract, Carla’s compliance with installation standards, and any relevant inspection reports, ultimately deciding if Carla is responsible for repairs or damages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase safeguards both parties, providing a structured way to resolve disagreements that may impact future interactions or reputations.</p>

 The Progressive Trust Life Cycle 

<p></p>

<p>Interactions are actually mirrored by both parties, but this diagram simplifies things in most places by focusing on party two.</p>

 Beyond Binary Trust: How Progressive Trust Can Transform the Internet 

<p>Progressive Trust offers a way to return agency to individuals in a world increasingly dominated by centralized systems. Instead of clicking “OK” on trust agreements handed down by big corporations, users regain control over who they trust and to what degree, over time. Imagine a digital ecosystem where browsers, websites, or social media platforms gradually allowed users to choose what information they revealed and what they kept private, based on their own evolving trust models.</p>

 From Gradients to Greatness 

<p>The vision for Progressive Trust goes beyond making interactions safer; it’s about bringing digital trust closer to real-world norms. With Progressive Trust, we’re not just building secure systems—we’re creating environments where people can interact meaningfully and sustainably, with digital relationships that grow stronger over time, just like in real life. Whether it’s in journalism, finance, wellness, or personal data sharing, the possibilities are endless when trust is no longer binary.</p>

<p>Progressive Trust is hard, but it’s worth it. It’s a mature model, one that can elevate our digital interactions by letting trust grow naturally. We’ve evolved this process over thousands of years in the physical world; now it’s time to bring the same wisdom to the online world. By embracing Progressive Trust, we’re not just keeping data safe; we’re building a digital space where people can authentically connect and collaborate, one step at a time.</p>

<p>Corporate Overview<br><br><a href="https://www.jcom.co.jp/en/">JCOM Co., Ltd.</a> (J:COM) provides a wide range of services to 5.72 million households nationwide, including cable TV (specialty channels, BS, terrestrial digital), high-speed internet connection, smartphones, fixed-line phones, electricity, video entertainment, and home IoT.<br><br>Under the brand message “Making the new normal,” J:COM actively incorporates digital technology to offer new services that make customers’ lives more comfortable and enriched.</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>To ensure the safe and comfortable use of the various services provided by J:COM, customers need to register a J:COM Personal ID (phone number or email address), which is linked to multiple services and apps offered by the company. Since August 2019, J:COM has been considering a new J:COM Personal ID, aiming to follow the latest security measures while continuously and swiftly pursuing the convenience of easy ID registration and login, which are often contradictory goals.</p>



 Deployment of FIDO2 



<p>Previously, in addition to ID/password authentication, J:COM adopted multi-factor authentication by sending one-time passwords to phone numbers.</p>



<p>However, aiming for further convenience, J:COM decided to introduce passwordless authentication using biometric authentication available on customers’ everyday devices (smartphones, tablets).</p>



<p>For the implementation, J:COM used the FIDO-compliant authentication platform “Uni-ID Libra” provided by NRI Secure Technologies, Ltd. (NRI Secure).</p>



<p>Initially, there were challenges in guiding users through the initial setup of FIDO authentication due to differences in operation depending on the OS and browser specifications used by the users, such as fingerprint and facial recognition. However, these issues were resolved by improving screen displays and support site descriptions.</p>







 Effects of Implementation 



<p>As of August 29, 2024, the number of passkey (FIDO credentials) registrations has reached 16% of the total IDs, and the number of services that can use biometric authentication has reached 25. This implementation has not only improved convenience but also resulted in cost savings on SMS transmission fees, as the cost remained flat despite the increase in the number of users and authentications for the services provided by J:COM.</p>



 Passkey (FIDO credentials) registrations has reached 16% of the total IDs 



<p>Shiori Takagi from the Agile Development Department, IT Planning Promotion Division, Information Systems Department of JCOM Co., Ltd., commented on this case study:</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“With the introduction of FIDO authentication, we believe we have made significant progress towards our goal of enabling customers to log in and use services more securely and easily. We believe that registration will expand further and service usage will be promoted in the future.”</p>
