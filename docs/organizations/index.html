<p>To implement any new technology like Blockchain, you need to follow a skills acquisition path so that you don’t make missteps and create cathedrals in the desert that embarrass your company and waste its resources.<br>
We’ve identified five areas of expertise divided into five phases of implementation<br>
Most companies cannot develop competencies in all of these areas, but they can partner with outside firms for specific aspects of these phases.</p>
<p>A network of Italian companies has developed a Blockchain training path called <a href="http://blockchainworkshop.it">BlockchainWorkshop.it </a>that allows them to quickly acquire all the necessary knowledge.<br>
Knowing the fundamentals of Blockchain is an essential skill as important as developing applications.</p>
<p>Step 1 Education: learn the basic features of the Blockchain technology, what classes of problems it can generically solve and the opportunities that the Blockchain offers<br>
Step 2 Problem/Solution Fit: identifying areas of business problems that current technology does not solve and analyzing if and where Blockchain can be the solution.<br>
Step 3 App Design: what functional solutions will we need to address the problem we discovered in the previous step? How will it affect what we are doing, including business processes, contractual and legal requirements?<br>
Step 4 Software Development: technology selection, vendor selection, integration and implementation of the Blockchain in the enterprise, and security audits</p>

<p>By Joni Brennan, DIACC and Antoine Normand, In-Sec-M<br>Originally published by <a href="https://www.hilltimes.com/2021/04/21/digital-id?i=e2a651476f984d378ed43975666ffcc9">The Hill Times</a></p>



 There is no clear policy directive in Bill C-11 that allows Canadians to understand what they can expect in terms of accessing the data the federal public service has regarding them. 



<p>If the global pandemic has shown us anything, it’s that the need for reliable and secure data is paramount as businesses, governments, and Canadians from Vancouver to Quebec City to Charlottetown and everywhere in between move online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From receiving emergency pandemic benefits to ensuring health records are correct and helping children and youth with online education, the pandemic has put a renewed spotlight on the need for governments to move with urgency to invest in digital infrastructure. In fact, it’s critical to ensuring Canadians receive the services they need and that businesses can participate fully and securely in the global digital economy.</p>



<p>At the core of this infrastructure is a secure digital identity, which is essential to the function of daily life during a pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The majority of Canadians believe it is important for federal and provincial governments to move quickly on enabling digital ID in a safe and secure manner, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canadian-Digital-Identity-Research-2020_Report_ENG_VF.pdf">a recent survey</a>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada. Investing in digital ID makes economic sense, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises. For SMEs, the impact of digital identity can be used to improve processes that are difficult today, resulting in a potential&nbsp;<a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Economic-Impact-of-Digital-Identity-DIACC-v2.pdf">$4.5-billion of added value</a>&nbsp;to SMEs and reinvestments in the Canadian economy.</p>



<p>In Canada, the DIACC and its participating banks have identified potential net savings per institution at or above $100-million per year, through operational efficiencies created by reducing manual processing costs and curbing fraud.</p>



<blockquote><p>While retail sales fell by almost 18 per cent from February to May 2020, the Canadian&nbsp;<a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/45-28-0001/2020001/article/00064-eng.htm">e-commerce market doubled</a>. Data from J.P. Morgan also shows that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/merchant-services/insights/reports/canada-2020">e-commerce sales are growing</a>&nbsp;faster in Canada than in many other Western countries. From e-commerce to the sharing economy a robust, digital ID establishes trust, provides security, mitigates fraud and enables continued growth for the sector. This is a win for citizens/consumers and businesses.</p></blockquote>



<p>Additionally, an estimated $482-million is lost each year on the manual setup of user accounts within federal and provincial government services because of the need to prove identity with paper credentials. Issuing digital ID credentials is essential to a modern government operating in the digital age.</p>



<p>These are just a few of the myriad ways in which digital ID can help contribute to our post-pandemic economic recovery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contrary to several misconceptions, digital ID is not about surveillance or tracking Canadians’ online activity. It’s about using the identification Canadians already have offline (e.g.: passports, driver’s licences, health cards, citizenship cards); having those credentials securely issued digitally; and being able to use them for digital transactions—from opening a bank account from the comfort of home to accessing medical records to receiving government benefits quickly and easily.</p>



<p>There are technology solutions and services that already exist today to easily adopt a digital ID ecosystem. In fact, in Quebec, the government has&nbsp;<a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/dont-waste-a-good-crisis-experts-push-governments-to-create-digital-id-programs-as-covid-19-pushes-digital-transformation">committed to issuing a strong digital I</a>D to residents in the province in 2021. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel—changes can be made through regulations and policy setting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, in order for a safe and secure digital ID ecosystem to be successful, a trust framework that instills confidence for Canadians is paramount. The DIACC spearheaded the&nbsp;<a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>, an international collaborative approach to modernizing digital service delivery that’s recognized by the World Economic Forum and others.. This made-for-Canada framework enables the development of an adaptable infrastructure that will make the Canadian digital ID ecosystem more resilient to future crises.</p>



<p>But there is so much more work to be done. Our digital future rests on getting the digital ID right. This means ensuring the federal government’s Digital Charter Implementation Act, Bill C-11, enacts a 360-degree rights regime and includes public-sector data subject to the legislation. There is no clear policy directive in C-11 that allows Canadians to understand what they can expect in terms of accessing the data the federal public service has regarding them. The federal government must empower Canadians to access their own data and be able to use the credentials associated with it in a modern digital economy.</p>



<p>In the province of Quebec, the proposed Bill 64 to protect personal data introduces new concepts of consent, disclosure obligations in case of a breach, the transfer of personal information to other jurisdictions and very strong penalties for contravening the act (up to four per cent of the worldwide sales).</p>



<p>Digital ID means decreased costs for governments, consumers, and businesses while improving service delivery and driving GDP growth. Not adopting digital ID in a meaningful way or not getting it right means more privacy and security breaches, loss of revenue for Canadian businesses and inefficiencies in government service delivery. There’s never been a better time to invest in digital ID. Our economic recovery depends on it.</p>



<p>Joni Brennan is president of the Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada. Antoine Normand is president of IN-SEC-M, a Canadian cybersecurity cluster.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>There are so many things about my job that gets me out of bed in th morning. First, I love that I have the opportunity to solve for a trustworthy, informed and transparent way to control our personal information. We need a simple digital identity in so many facets of our digital lives and it’s sorely lacking. Second, I love knowing that I’m contributing to a safer digital future for my children and the next generation. Finally, and most importantly, I love the people I get to share the experience with – the team at IDENTOS, our customers and the identity community continues to humble me.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Hmm. Hard to say. Where am I today? I am a daughter, a sister, a mom, a tech professional and very grateful for it all. I don’t know how I got here since most of this was likely already planned before my time… but for the moments I had the opportunity to make a choice, I would say that I’ve arrived here thanks to having trust in myself and others who wanted the best for me.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The most important lesson is to really take stock of the people we interact with, especially the people who share in the same vision and are doing their best to create a better future. The more human and connected we are, the better our solutions will be.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>Keeping this focused on identity, I’d say:</p>
 
 START joining other innovators in your community and offer to work on identity projects you’re working on.rin 
 STOP asking for input from the same groups or people. Surround yourself with different voices and perspectives. 
 CONTINUE bringing your best in identity solutions to build a privacy respecting, sustainable digital future for citizens, patients, students, parents, children, et al. 
 
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<blockquote><p>Solutions will fall flat unless we can recognize our blind spots.</p></blockquote>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>In a field that is dreaming up the future, it probably comes as no surprise that I like to spend a lot of time with movies that have done the same. Aside from diversity, Psi-fi movies also have the power to offer different perspectives. Flicks like Gattaca, Ai, Hunger Games, Battlestar Galactica, West World all have an identity component in the plot that’s interesting to observe. I love the impact it has on the characters’ quality of life, as well as their freedoms and liberties in some cases.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>As a teenager, I was full of big dreams and wanted to fulfil them all. Personally, this caused a lot of stress, and after a while it also didn’t leave a lot of room for connecting with the people and things I cared most for. If I had the opportunity, I’d tell my teenage self:&nbsp; “Continue to dream big and have a compass, but don’t be so hard on yourself. Instead, do your best with what you have while giving yourself space to do the things that are also fulfilling.”</p>

 Sovrin releases two new Guardianship papers at Internet Identity Workshop&nbsp;#32 <p>In December 2019 the Sovrin Guardianship Task Force released a whitepaper titled “<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Guardianship-Whitepaper2.pdf">On Guardianship in Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.” This groundbreaking paper explored guardianship in the context of SSI, and provided two use cases: one for a refugee, Mya, and one for an elderly living with dementia, Jamie. (Watch the video illustration of these two use cases at the end of this article.)</p><p>Recognising the need to develop the work beyond the whitepaper, the Sovrin Foundation chartered a <a href="https://guardianshipwg.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GWG/overview?homepageId=229378">Sovrin Guardianship Working Group</a> (SGWG) in December 2019. Two key documents were identified as outputs for the working group: a Technical Requirements for Guardianship and Implementation Guidelines. After more than a year of hard work, the two papers were completed and will be publicly presented and released at the Sovrin’s breakout session at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) #32 during April 20–22,&nbsp;2021.</p><blockquote>“When we started the work on defining technical requirements for guardianship in early 2020, we viewed the task as relatively simple. ‘All’ we had to do was extract the guardianship requirements from the use cases in the previous whitepaper… It turned out that this view was optimistic,” said John Phillips, one of the authors and Chairs of SGWG in Asia Pacific. “We found that the gap between the two use cases in the whitepaper and technical requirements was too broad. So we realised we needed to revisit our thinking. We needed a conceptual bridge, a ‘mental model’ to understand Guardianship broadly so we could write appropriately narrow technical requirements. The lesson we have (re)learnt in our journey is that, before you can describe something in simple terms, you need to make sure you have a broad and deep enough understanding of the&nbsp;topic.”</blockquote><p>The first paper is called the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vBePVx8n3MRDWcePkwVDya9ab4BHEyU_/view?usp=sharing">Guardianship Credentials Implementation Guidelines</a> and its purpose is to provide readers with the background they need to implement IT systems that support various kinds of guardianship. In particular, it focuses on what they need to know when using Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised Identifiers, the building blocks of a SSI framework within the frameworks of <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/">Sovrin Governance</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP</a>&nbsp;(ToIP).</p><p>This paper is intended for all people interested in the design, build and operation of a Guardianship implementation using an SSI framework. It outlines the conceptual framework for Guardianship and provides implementation guidelines. The document introduces and uses a mental model to help understand the interplay and relationships of the key entities and actors involved in the establishment, running and ending of a Guardianship Arrangement.</p><p>While this document provides background explanations of the thinking that led to the technical requirements guidelines, it does not mandate or warrant specific rules for the implementation of Guardianship as these should be Jurisdiction specific, which is defined by the mental model in the document.</p><p>The second paper is called <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M21PznPAd0H6z1t4ODl-jiEoXZjEhwcb/view?usp=sharing">Guardianship Credentials Technical Requirements</a> which was developed by the technical requirements working group within the SGWG. The purpose of this document is twofold: i) provide principles under which guardianship scenario designs and requirements are considered and defined; and ii) provide technical requirements for SSI solutions that offer the capability of guardianship.</p><p>The intended audience for this document includes: i) individuals looking to understand how guardianship should be implemented for their use case; ii) SSI solution designers that require guardianship to support the use of VCs in their specific use case; iii) readers who want to understand how Guardianship can work in an SSI&nbsp;context.</p><p>The requirements described in this paper, together with other SSI standardization, describe when an SSI solution offers the capability of guardianship. In this case, the requirements are mainly for the technical building blocks that live in the bottom three layers of the Technical “Stack” of the Sovrin/ToIP framework. The mental model, however, is also relevant for the top layer (ecosystem), as guardianship is intricately linked to what we will be defining as Jurisdictions, and this enables human governance to be applied to the first three&nbsp;layers.</p><p>This document should be read in conjunction with the Sovrin Guardianship Credentials Implementation Guidelines mentioned above. In particular, readers who are looking to understand the thinking behind these requirements are encouraged to refer to the Implementation Guidelines.</p><p>These two papers are the first public release of implementation guidelines and technical requirements for guardianship in the context of SSI. There are sections at the end of the documents that propose areas of future work, and it is expected that these two documents will be updated as technology evolves and open discussion and decision areas are resolved.</p><p>Download the two papers&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QivpMOIYu0ry-LMfyh5b2pU7eG_SjimJ?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>Sovrin Guardianship Use Case #1— Mya (a refugee&nbsp;girl)</p><p>Sovrin Guardianship Use Case #2 — Jamie (an elderly living with dementia)</p><p>Video credit: John&nbsp;Phillips</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://sovrin.org/a-deeper-understanding-of-implementing-guardianship/">https://sovrin.org</a> on April 22,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>This all-volunteer Sovrin Guardianship Working Group is open to anyone with a genuine interest in and willingness to contribute to digital guardianship.

<p>First public review of this draft specification - ends May 21st</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) TC are pleased to announce that AMQP Addressing Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p><br>The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard for passing business messages between applications or organizations. It connects systems, feeds business processes with the information they need and reliably transmits onward the instructions that achieve their goals.</p>



<p>AMQP Addressing v1.0 further defines the “AMQP network” concept introduced in the main AMQP specification as a federation of AMQP containers whose nodes communicate with each other either directly or via intermediaries. This specification also defines the semantics of the “address” archetype that was left undefined in the main AMQP specification, and the syntax for the AMQP URI scheme and a matching restriction of the AMQP “address-string” type.</p>



<p>The documents and related files are available here:</p>

<p>The first Earth Day — held April 22, 1970 — is considered the birth of the modern environmental movement. More than half a century later, it has taken on renewed focus amidst the climate crisis. Here at Energy Web, we are developing open-source digital infrastructure to accelerate the low-carbon energy transition and expand access to clean energy markets for all. Here are five specific ways we — the Energy Web team, Energy Web members, and the broader Energy Web ecosystem — are working together to speed global decarbonization.</p> 1. Supporting flexibility markets, making it possible for DERs to help balance renewable grids <p>Distributed energy resources (DERs) — from batteries and electric vehicles to “behind the meter’ devices like smart thermostats — are fast becoming crucial components of increasingly decentralized and dynamic power grids that are running on growing amounts of renewable energy. Such DERs can play a valuable role providing grid services, such as helping to balance supply and demand in flexibility markets. Thus we believe it is essential to make it easy for DERs to enroll, participate, and get compensation for delivered grid services. This is why we built and keep advancing <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-flex/">Energy Web Flex</a> as a software development toolkit that grid operators <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/austrian-power-grid-and-energy-web-foundation-launch-proof-of-concept-to-use-distributed-energy-d9a378f5f5ee">like Austrian Power Grid</a> can use to tap into the full potential of DERs at the lowest administrative cost possible.</p> 2. Digitizing renewable energy markets, making it faster and easier to source renewables <p>We are building open-source tools to help buyers more easily achieve their proof-of-impact needs and companies around the globe launch user-friendly, digitized renewable energy market platforms. For example, <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-origin/">Energy Web Origin</a> is a software development toolkit we built and continue advancing that digitizes the entire energy attribute certificate lifecycle — from certificate issuance to trading and cancellations/claims — for any clean energy market. We are also working directly with various companies around the world to help them use EW Origin to launch their own digitized renewable energy marketplace platforms across Asia, Europe, and the Americas. In addition, Energy Web is developing <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero</a>, a renewable energy search-and-match engine that helps buyers discover all available renewable energy products and make direct purchases from platforms (like those built with EW Origin). Think Skyscanner or Kayak.com meets renewable energy&nbsp;markets.</p> 3. Enabling lifecycle asset tracking, such as batteries, as part of a circular green&nbsp;economy <p>We know that it is important to understand and track the environmental impacts of all energy devices — from batteries to solar panels and wind turbines — from cradle to grave. This lifecycle tracking is also part of major legislation such as the European Green Deal, not to mention major movements such as the circular economy. Energy Web is leveraging our tech stack and developing tools that companies are using to bring solutions to the market, such as <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/bebat-launches-easybat-an-open-source-decentralized-solution-for-battery-lifecycle-management-281f2ace61e9">our work with BeBat and Fluvius in Belgium to support EasyBat</a>. EasyBat makes it possible to holistically manage customer-owned batteries (both private &amp; professional use) participating in Belgian electricity markets, including legal takeback obligations and/or extended producers responsibility (EPR) of battery manufacturers.</p> 4. Advancing the Crypto Climate Accord to decarbonize an entire&nbsp;sector <p>We spearheaded the Crypto Climate Accord (CCA) earlier this month in partnership with RMI and the Alliance for Innovative Regulation (AIR) to decarbonize the global crypto and blockchain industry. We are excited to drive it forward with a fast-growing community of <a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoClimAcc/crypto-climate-accord-adds-over-a-dozen-new-supporters-in-two-weeks-since-launch-52dccc7c10a2">now 40 CCA Supporters</a>. More importantly, we have already started identifying, defining, and developing a <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/making-crypto-green-with-energy-web-zero-301cf4a979e5">fast-emerging suite of open-source solutions</a> to help decarbonize crypto. If your company can help us advance solutions in this area, we encourage you to become a CCA Supporter. For more frequent updates on progress related to the CCA, check out the new <a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoClimAcc">CCA&nbsp;Medium</a>.</p> 5. Fostering interoperability of digital twins across tech and&nbsp;markets <p>Historically, power grids and electricity markets — and the technologies used to run them — were heavily fragmented and siloed. Important was locked away in proprietary systems. Customer enrollment in various utility programs, such as selling surplus solar energy to a grid operator or participating in a demand response program, was cumbersome and duplicative. Even worse, customer devices in some cases were prohibited from providing services in certain electricity markets, even if they technologically were able to do so. But those metaphorical walls are coming down, with new regulations such as <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/ferc-order-2222-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity-for-decentralized-technologies-to-accelerate-the-c35cf41527cb">FERC Order 2222 in the United States</a> and a focus on customer-centric market design in the EU. The key to unlocking this new potential is with digital twins and ‘passports’ anchored to the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain.</p><p>This is just a snapshot of all the leading-edge work happening at Energy Web and among our global member community. Stay tuned for more updates and news in the weeks and months&nbsp;ahead!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/top-5-ways-energy-web-is-accelerating-the-clean-energy-transition-de2eeee5a88d">Top 5 Ways Energy Web is Accelerating the Clean Energy Transition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Significant advances are taking place right now in China relative to LEI adoption. Regulatory authorities within the region are proactively driving LEI usage and have set ambitious plans for substantial near-term increases in LEI volume. </p>
<p>For those who missed it, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) published an LEI implementation roadmap at the end of 2020, which looks ahead to 2022. This roadmap is part of the ‘One Belt One Road’ initiative, which is described in the following way on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative">Wikipedia</a>: ‘[…] incorporated into the Constitution of China in 2017. The Chinese government calls the initiative "a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future."’ The roadmap unveils national plans to increase LEI issuance by a minimum of 170% between the end of 2020 (there were 37,000 active LEIs) and the end of 2022 (the target is a minimum LEI volume of 100,000). </p>
<p>In a separate but complementary development, just this month GLEIF has welcomed the news that the Chinese Financial Certification Authority (CFCA) has launched the first commercial demo of LEIs embedded within digital certificates. CFCA has simultaneously become the first Certification Authority to assume a Validation Agent role within the Global LEI System. This innovation from CFCA shows a further commitment from the Chinese market, this time to facilitating and promoting LEI issuance in digital certificates. It is hoped that CFCA’s early mover status on this front will act as a catalyst for other similar demos to emerge. </p>
<p>The combined sum of these two initiatives is significant. It shows an advanced level of proactivity from regulatory authorities within the region, which is driving LEI issuance to support financial services and banking ecosystems, simplify international trade and enhance digital identity across the region. </p>
<p>Understandably, GLEIF advocates these steps being taken to advance LEI adoption across China and applauds the foresight and proactivity of regulators. A commitment to boosting LEI issuance across such a vast region, will not only deliver benefits to Chinese market participants, but has the potential to motivate regulators across other countries and regions to follow suit. GLEIF certainly hopes that this is the case. </p>
<p>A more detailed summary of each initiative is given below.</p>
<p>China’s LEI Implementation Roadmap: 2020-2022</p>
<p>In Q4 2020, four financial regulators in China released a report detailing a roadmap for LEI implementation. The four organizations involved were: PBOC, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). </p>
<p>The report, which is published in Chinese on the PBOC <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4142052/index.html">website</a>, outlines the general objective of the roadmap and details key LEI implementation milestones over the next two years. </p>
<p>As stated in a Regulation Asia <a href="https://www.regulationasia.com/pboc-publishes-roadmap-for-full-lei-adoption-in-china/">article</a>,  the intention of wide LEI implementation in China is to help the country connect with the international market, support China’s bid to open up its financial sector, and facilitate cross-border trade and financial transactions.</p>
<p>In line with a translation from the report on the PBOC website, GLEIF understands that the general objective of the roadmap is to establish a comprehensive LEI usage policy system across China’s financial system in line with international standards by the end of 2022. It envisions that the LEI will become an assisting tool for financial management authorities to maintain financial stability and implement financial supervision. It will become an important means for financial infrastructure, financial industry associations and financial institutions to carry out customer identification of legal persons involved in cross-border transactions. It will also become a corporate passport.  </p>
<p>This is in line with the PBOC’s role as a member of the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC). The ROC aims to promote the broad public interests to improve the quality of data used in financial data reporting, improving the ability to monitor financial risk, and lowering regulatory reporting costs through the harmonization of these standards across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>A number of phase objectives are then outlined for Chinese authorities: </p>
 
 By end of 2020: total LEI volume in China mainland to reach 30,000, covering all financial institutions, member institutions of financial infrastructure and industry associations, and listed companies in China. Proposed LEI application rules in scenarios such as RMB cross-border payments, digital RMB cross-border business, qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII) and RMB qualified foreign institutional investor (RQFII) access, derivatives trading, securities trading, and listed company supervision. Establish a mechanism for mapping and updating LEI with the codes of financial institutions, unified social credit codes, and codes of information systems related to major financial infrastructure. 
 By end of 2021: total LEI volume in China mainland reaches 50,000, with a focus on improving coverage among importers and exporters, trading enterprises, and non-financial enterprises involved in cross-border transactions. Proposed LEI application rules in areas such as the financial market transaction reporting system, credit rating, and application of special institutional codes by overseas institutions. Launch and operate the cross-border legal person information service and digital authentication platform to provide value-added LEI-based data services to financial management departments, financial infrastructure, financial industry associations and financial institutions. 
 By end of 2022: total LEI volume in China mainland reaches 100,000. Continued improvements in coverage among non-financial enterprises involved in cross-border transactions. Use LEI in scenarios such as digital identification of cross-border legal persons. Establish a mechanism for commercially sustainable operation of LEI.   
 
<p><br>
CFCA Paves the Way for Increased LEI Usage in Mass Market Digital Identity Products </p>
<p>CFCA has launched the first commercial demonstration of LEIs embedded within digital certificates. It has also become the first Certification Authority to act as a Validation Agent in the Global LEI System, streamlining LEI issuance with digital ID product and service provision.</p>
<p>These developments by CFCA follow the recent launch of the GLEIF CA Stakeholder Group, created as a platform for GLEIF to collaborate with CAs and Trust Service Providers (TSPs) on the coordination and promotion of a global approach to LEI usage across digital identity products. CFCA’s advances are significant because they are the earliest reported successes aligned to the direction of this industry initiative, which is aimed at achieving a critical mass of LEIs embedded within digital certificates. </p>
<p>Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF comments: “This progress by CFCA on both fronts is very welcome as it moves us one step closer to broad LEI usage in digital certificates globally. Realizing the goal of universal LEI usage in digital identity products will be an important step in enhancing trust and creating innovation opportunities across private sector digital identity management applications. Digital certificates linked by an LEI to verified, regularly updated and freely available entity reference data held within the Global LEI System are easier to manage, aggregate and maintain. The result will be significant efficiencies and far less complexity for certificate owners and the provision of greater transparency for all users of the internet and participants within digital exchanges.” </p>
<p>For more details, please read the corresponding press release <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-welcomes-pioneering-advances-by-china-financial-certification-authority-cfca-which-pave-the-way-for-increased-lei-usage-in-mass-market-digital-identity-products">here</a>.<br>
<br></p>
<p>The ‘LEI Lightbulb Blog Series’ from GLEIF aims to shine a light on the breadth of acceptance and advocacy for the LEI across the public and private sectors, geographies and use cases by highlighting which industry leaders, authorities and organizations are supportive of the LEI and for what purpose. By demonstrating how success derived from strong regulatory roots is giving rise to a ground swell of champions for further LEI regulation and voluntary LEI adoption across new and emerging applications, GLEIF hopes to educate on both the current and future potential value that ‘one global identity’ can deliver for businesses, regardless of sector, world-wide.</p>

<p>Eleven months after Derek Chauvin stole George Floyd’s final breaths, jurors took less than 11 hours to find Chauvin guilty on all three counts. The jury’s verdict shows that sometimes — but too rarely — justice can prevail, and it is very welcome, given the long history of acquittals that come before&nbsp;it.</p><p>It does not, however, bring George Floyd back to life, nor the dozens of other unarmed Black and Brown people who have been killed by the police since May 25, 2020. Since the trial began, police have killed at least 64 people, more than half of whom were Black or Latinx. Just 10 miles from the courthouse, Daunte Wright was shot dead, and across the Great Lakes in Chicago, police took the life of 13-year-old Adam Toledo in&nbsp;Chicago.</p><p>So, while we can briefly exhale today, we know there is so much work that remains to be done to build toward a more just system overall, so that outcomes like today’s are less exceptional.</p><p>Listening to the testimony during the trial reopened painful wounds that have been inflicted relentlessly since our country was founded and reflects the continued need for deep systemic change in our society. We know it won’t happen overnight, nor clearly in just one year, but it must happen. As George Floyd’s girlfriend, Courteney Ross, said, “Floyd was one man. George Floyd is a movement.”</p><p>And at Omidyar Network, while criminal justice reform is not one of our focus areas, there is a close link between economic injustice and racial violence. And between those two areas and true democracy. We know we will not bring about the kind of world we aspire to unless and until Black people are no longer trapped by systems that were intentionally created to lock them into poverty and strip them of voice and opportunity.</p><p>Last summer, we once again began a national racial justice reckoning, we looked deeply at our own systems and policies. We committed to become an anti-racist organization, and while we know we still have quite a long journey, we have taken the first of many steps. We gave more than $1 million to organizations fighting to protect and advance Black lives and another $4 million to organizations looking to reimagine our economy through a racial justice lens. Again, these are the first of many steps we are taking to live up to our commitment and we know there is so much more we can and must do until Black Lives&nbsp;Matter.</p><p>As Ibram X. Kendi wrote in How to Be Anti-Racist, “After taking this grueling journey to the dirt road of anti-racism, humanity can come upon the clearing of a potential future: an antiracist world in all its imperfect beauty. It can become real if we focus on power instead of people, if we focus on changing policy instead of groups of people. It’s possible if we overcome our cynicism about the permanence of&nbsp;racism.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/statement-from-omidyar-network-on-derek-chauvin-verdict-the-first-step-to-justice-f28ec7673805">Statement from Omidyar Network on Derek Chauvin Verdict: The First Step to Justice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Blockchain is an enabling technology that is changing the way we think about and implement business applications, but to understand it we need to reiterate the three components that make it possible:</p>
<p>The Software<br>
The Software is a set of three components: a write-only database, a networking system that connects multiple computers together (Peer-to-Peer), and a consensus mechanism that allows you to decide which transactions can be written and which cannot.</p>
<p>The Token<br>
Cryptoeconomics is the combination of Token + Game Theory. The latter has nothing to do with gaming but is the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision makers. Made famous by the movie “A Beautiful Mind” about the life of Nobel Prize-winning economist John Nash, it is linked to the Blockchain in the solution to the famous problem of Byzantine Generals lying about the coordination of their attack to ensure victory for their opponent. The implementation of a “Byzantine Fault Tolerance” (BFT) is important because it assumes that no one can be trusted. Cryptocurrency through Token is what makes a Blockchain secure, not the technology. Through a process called Mechanism Design, cryptoeconomic incentives can be created that push people to behave in the right way. On the Blockchain, it costs less to be honest than to be dishonest. A validating node receives tokens if it validates transactions and loses tokens if it goes absent.</p>
<p>Cryptography<br>
Cryptography is used in various parts to provide security to a Blockchain network and is based on three basic concepts: hashing, keys, and digital signatures. A “hash” is a unique fingerprint that helps verify that a certain piece of information has not been altered, without the need to actually see it. Keys are used pair one public and one private. As an analogy, imagine a door that needs two keys to be opened. In this case, the public key is used by the sender to encrypt information that can only be decrypted by the owner of the private key. You never reveal the private key to anyone. A digital signature is a mathematical calculation that is used to prove the authenticity of a (digital) message or document. Cryptography is based on the concept of public/private key. Public visibility, but private control. It’s kind of like your business address: you can post a company website, but that doesn’t give any information about how your production processes take place. You’ll need your private key to get into the company, and because you’ve declared that address as yours, no one else can claim a similar address. Although the concepts of cryptography have been around for a while, on the Blockchain they are combined with the innovation of Game Theory, where uncertainty is limited by mathematical certainty. You can mathematically prove that something has been done without necessarily having to show it to others. Very cool.</p>

<p>As we continue our pandemic journey that is 2021, more and more people are getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Once vaccinated, people are (finally!) able to do more “in the real world.” However, in some cases such as international travel, there is a need to prove that you have been vaccinated before you can participate. In the past, that proof has been accomplished in the form of the paper World Health Organization Carte Jaune/Yellow Card. But in our 21st century pandemic, a handwritten paper document is not particularly trusted. It’s just too easy to buy or make your own. The sudden, urgent need to be able to prove health information in a safe, privacy-preserving and secure way has brought the spotlight on the concept of verifiable credentials and, for Hyperledger, on the three identity-focused projects in the community, Indy (a distributed ledger for identity), Aries (data exchange protocols and implementations of agents for people, organizations and things), and Ursa (a cryptographic library underlying Indy and Aries).</p>



<p>While people understand that paper credentials are insufficient and that a trusted digital solution is needed, they don’t understand why verifiable credentials, or more generally, identity, works extremely well with distributed ledger technology (DLT)—a distributed database spread across multiple nodes, of which blockchain is an example. To be clear from the start, it is not to put the credentials on a public ledger so everyone can see them! We’ll reiterate that a lot in this post. No private data ever goes on the blockchain!!!</p>



<p>To understand why DLT is useful for identity, we need to go back to the basics—paper credentials, how that model has worked for 1000s of years, and how the use of DLTs with verifiable credentials allows us to transition the great parts—security and privacy—of that model to the digital age.</p>
<p><br>Since as far back as 450BC, people have used paper credentials to enable trusted identity. Legend has it that King Artixerxes of the Persian Empire signed and gave Nehemiah a paper “safe transit” authorization that he used in travels across the empire. People have been using such documents ever since. In technical terms, a credential is an attestation of qualification, competence, or authority issued to an entity (e.g., an individual or organization) by a third party with a relevant or de facto authority or assumed competence to do so. Examples of credentials issued to people include a driver’s license, a passport, an academic degree, proof-of-vaccination and so on. Credentials are also issued to companies, such as business registrations, building permits, and even health inspection certifications.</p>

A typical paper credential, say a driver’s license, is issued by a government authority (an issuer) after you prove to them who you are (usually in person using your passport or birth certificate) and that you are qualified to drive. You then hold this credential (usually in your wallet) and can use it elsewhere whenever you want—for example, to rent a car, to open a bank account or in a bar to show that you are old enough to drink. When you do that, you’re proving (or presenting) the credential to the verifier. The verifier inspects the physical document to decide if it is valid for the business purpose at hand. Note that in verifying the paper credential, the verifier does not call the issuer of the document. The transaction is only between the holder and the verifier. Further, it is the holder’s choice whether they want to share the piece of paper. If they want, they can keep it to themselves.

<p>The Paper Credential Model<br>By Peter Stokyo, <a href="mailto:peter.stoyko@elanica.com">peter.stoyko@elanica.com</a>, Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC By 4.0</a></p>
<p>Verification in the paper credential model (ideally) proves:</p>
<p>



</p>
 
 Who issued the credential.&nbsp; 
 That the credential was issued to the entity presenting it. 
 That the claims have not been altered. 
 
<p>



</p>
<p>The caveat “ideally” is included because of the real possibility of forgery in the use of paper credentials. Back to our “proof-of-vaccination” problem.</p>
<p>Let’s see how the good parts of the paper credential model are retained in the verifiable credentials model. With verifiable credentials:</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>



</p>
 
 An authority decides you are eligible to receive a credential and issues you one. 
 You hold your credential in your (digital) wallet—it does not go on the distributed ledger! 
 At some point, a verifier asks you to prove the claims from one or more credentials. 
 If you decide to share your data with the verifier, you provide a verifiable presentation to the verifier, proving the same three things as with the paper credentials. 
 Plus: You may be able to prove one more thing—that the issued credentials have not been revoked. 
 
<p>As we’ll see, verifiable credentials and presentations are not simple documents that anyone can create. They are cryptographically constructed so that a presentation of the claims within a credential proves four attributes:</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>Who issued the credential–their identifier is part of the credential and they signed the credential.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Who holds the credential–there is a cryptographic binding to the prover. 
 The claims have not been altered–they were signed at the time of issuance. 
 The credential has not been revoked. 
 
<p>



</p>
<p>Unlike a paper credential, those four attributes are evaluated not based on the judgment and expertise of the person looking at the credential, but rather by machine using cryptographic algorithms that are extremely difficult to forge. Like the paper credential, the verifier does not go back to the issuer to ask about the credential being presented. Only the prover and verifier, the participants in the interaction, need to know about the presentation. So where do the prover and verifier get the information they need for their transaction? We’re just getting to that…</p>
<p>



</p>
<p><br>The Verifiable Credentials Model<br>By Peter Stokyo, <a href="mailto:peter.stoyko@elanica.com">peter.stoyko@elanica.com</a>, Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC By 4.0</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>Compared to the paper credentials model, verifiable credentials are far more secure. When the cryptographic verification succeeds, the verifier can be certain of the validity of the data—those four attributes stemming from verifying the presentation. They are left only with the same question that paper credentials have—do I trust the issuer enough</p>
<p>So where does the DLT fit in?</p>
<p>Three of the four things that the verifier has to prove (listed above) involves published data from the issuer that has to be available in some trusted, public distributed place, a place that is not controlled by a central authority (hmm…sounds like a DLT!). In Indy and Aries, data published to a DLT is used to verify the credential without having to check with the issuer. In particular:</p>
 
 The verifier has to know who issued the credential based on an identifier and cryptographic signature. From the presentation, it gets an identifier for the issuer, looks it up on a DLT to get a public key associated with the issuer to verify the signature in the presentation. Thus, the identity of the issuer is known. 
 The verifier has to verify that the claims data has not been altered by verifying a cryptographic signature across the data. Based on an identifier for the type of credential, the verifier gets from a DLT a set of public keys and verifies the signatures. Thus, the verifier knows no one has tampered with the claims data. 
 The issuer periodically updates a revocation registry on a DLT indicating the credentials that have been revoked. If the holder’s credential is revoked, they are unable to create a proof of non-revocation (yes, that’s a double negative…). If the holder can generate that proof, the verifier can check it. Thus, the verifier knows the credential has not been revoked. 
 
<p>



</p>
<p>The fourth attribute (the binding of the credential to the holder) in Indy is done using some privacy-preserving cryptographic magic (called a Zero Knowledge Proof) that prevents having a unique identifier for the holder or credential being given to the verifier. Thus, no PII is needed for sharing trusted data.</p>
<p>So why DLT? First, we can get the good parts of paper credentials—private transactions between holders and verifiers and no callback to the issuer. Second, the issuer gets a trusted, open and transparent way to publish the cryptographic material needed for those private holder-verifier transactions. Third, there is no need to have a “Trusted Third Party” participating in the interactions.</p>
<p>And did I mention, no private data goes on the DLT!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>Hyperledger Indy, Aries and Ursa are enabling this approach to “self-sovereign identity” in a big way,&nbsp; bringing about a new layer of trust on the Internet that will let us preserve our privacy and give us control over our identity and data—where it belongs. There is a lot to learn.

<p>This is my first newsletter as the new Executive Director for DINZ and the very first thing I’d like to do is thank Andrew Weaver, our outgoing ED, for his tremendous leadership throughout our establishment phase and to wish him all the very, very best on the next stage of his journey. Andrew has worked tirelessly over the last two and a half years to ensure we are working towards a world where people can safely express their identity to fully participate in the digital economy and society overall.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Good luck Andrew and all the best.

<p>The DIF Steering Committee has approved the first major release of the Sidetree Protocol specification, “v1” so to speak. Here is a snapshot of the four companies and four implementations that stretched and built the specification.</p> Scalable, Flexible Infrastructure for Decentralized Identity <p>This week, the DIF Steering Committee officially approved the first major release of the Sidetree Protocol specification, “v1” so to speak. This protocol has already been implemented, and four of its implementers have been collaborating intensively for over a year on expanding and extending this specification together.</p> What exactly is a “Sidetree”? <p>Sidetree is a protocol that extends “decentralized identifiers” (DIDs), one of the core building blocks of decentralized identity. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) enable a person or entity to securely and directly “anchor” their data-sharing activities to a shared ledger, secured by cryptography. The first generation of DID systems accomplished this with a 1-to-1 relationship between “blockchain addresses” (cryptographic identities) and the more flexible, powerful addresses called DIDs. These latter functioned as privacy-preserving extensions of the blockchain addresses to which they were closely coupled. In this way, each DID effortlessly inherited the formidable security guarantees of those blockchains — but in many cases, they also inherited scalability problems and economic models that were a bad fit for many DID use-cases.</p><p>Sidetree is a systematic, carefully-engineered protocol that loosens that coupling between anchor-points on a distributed data system (usually a blockchain) and the DID networks anchored to them. Crucially, it replaces the 1-to-1 relationship with a 1-to-many relationship, pooling resources and security guarantees. Depending on the use-case and implementation strategies chosen, the protocol can optimize for scalable performance, for developer-friendly ergonomics and SDKs, for the portability of DIDs and networks of DIDs across multiple anchoring systems, and even for high-availability in low-connectivity contexts where a global blockchain cannot be relied upon directly.</p><p>The name “sidetree” combines two hints as to its early technical inspirations and superpowers. Each Sidetree network functions as a kind of identity-specific “Layer 2” overlay network where participating nodes root aggregated operational data into transactions of the underlying chain. This mechanism has many high-level conceptual similarities with the “sidechains” of other “Layer 2” systems, such as the Lightning network running atop Bitcoin or state channel implementations on Ethereum. It also shares with merkle “trees” (and <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/#further-resources">DAGs</a> like IPFS) the self-certifying property of content-addressability, a core building block of decentralized and distributed systems.</p><p>Leveraging concepts from sidechains and “Layer 2” network protocols, Sidetree was first <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/blob/master/sidetrees/explainer.md">proposed</a> by Microsoft’s Daniel Buchner and has been incubated in the DIF community, evolving along the way with major contributions from a growing list of DIF&nbsp;members.</p> The team that delivered the specification <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ownyouridentity">Microsoft</a> (Redmond, WA,&nbsp;USA)<p>A global consumer and enterprise app, service, hardware, and cloud infrastructure provider whose mission is to empower every person to achieve more. Microsoft is proud to have worked on Sidetree and implemented the Sidetree protocol via its contributions to ION. As a key piece of infrastructure that is foundational to its Decentralized Identity work, Microsoft is committed to the continued development of Sidetree and ION in&nbsp;DIF.</p><a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey</a> (Toronto, ON,&nbsp;Canada)<p>SecureKey is a leading digital identity and authentication provider, and is a champion of the ecosystem approach to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, revolutionizing the way consumers and organizations approach identity and attribute sharing in the digital age. This ecosystem-first philosophy informs our investment in Sidetree as a protocol for extensibility and scalability, which can evolve its featureset, and its network model over time. Of particular technological interest to us is how Sidetree can be overlaid on a wide variety of ledger and propagation systems. This will enable identity systems that span many use cases and work across public blockchains, federation and witness protocols, and permissioned blockchains without being locked to any particular ledger technology.</p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute Industries</a> (Austin, TX,&nbsp;USA)<p>Transmute uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to secure critical trade data by digitizing key trade documents so that they’re traceable and verifiable anywhere in the world, easily accessible and selectively shareable, searchable and auditable, and impossible to forge or alter. Transmute contributed to Sidetree’s development because it leverages batch processing capabilities to achieve enterprise scale and retains maximum optionality for our customers, allowing their business to span many blockchains and trust frameworks. Transmute sees Sidetree-based networks as necessary for scaling up decentralized identity capabilities to a global enterprise scale, where thousands of verifiable transactions per second can be processed at an unbeatable price.</p><a href="https://mattr.global/">MATTR Global</a> (Auckland, New&nbsp;Zealand)<p>Mattr works with communities and a growing network of companies to shift industries like digital identity towards a more equitable future, providing tools to support digital inclusion, privacy and end-user control. Sidetree represents a significant leap forward in thinking around how to create truly decentralized infrastructure for resilient identifiers. We welcome the agnostic and extensible approach not just to distributed ledgers but also to content addressable storage and other building-blocks of flexible infrastructure. We look forward to integrating many of the DID systems coming out of the Sidetree standardization effort.</p> The first generation of Sidetree&nbsp;Systems <p>Transmute maintains Sidetree ledger adapters for Ethereum, Amazon QLDB, Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric. We also support interoperability tests with DID Key, the Universal Wallet Interop Spec, the VC HTTP API, and Traceability Vocabulary. Transmute has built Sidetree.js, an implementation of the Sidetree protocol based on the DIF’s codebase that focuses on modularity: it is a Typescript monorepo where each component of a Sidetree node (Ledger, Content Addressable Storage, Cache database) can be substituted with different implementations that use a common interface.</p><p>SecureKey has created a ledger-agnostic <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-core-go">Go implementation</a> of Sidetree along with <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/orb">Orb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> variations built on top. The <a href="https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/">did:orb</a> method enables independent organizations to create decentralized identifiers that are propagated across a shared decentralized network without reliance on a common blockchain. By extending Sidetree into a Fediverse of interconnected registries, Orb provides the foundation for building digital ecosystems on top of decentralized identifiers using a federated, replicated and scalable approach.</p><p>Microsoft is a primary contributor to <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a>, an open source, public, permissionless implementation of Sidetree on the Bitcoin ledger. There are several repositories and public utilities that make working with ION easier, including:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">ION GitHub repo</a>: the main repository for the code that powers ION&nbsp;nodes  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decentralized-identity/ion-tools">ION Tools</a>: JavaScript libraries for Node.js and browser environments that makes using DIDs and interacting with the ION network easier for web developers  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/install-guide/">ION Install Guide</a>: A step-by-step guide for installing an ION&nbsp;node  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/">ION Explorer</a>: A graphical interface for viewing DIDs and auditing other data transactions published to the public ION&nbsp;network.   What’s next for&nbsp;Sidetree <p>One significant feature on the horizon is to add support for pruning of verbose lineage data (which is no longer needed to maintain the secure backbone of DIDs in a Sidetree implementation) at Sidetree’s anchor points. This addition will allow Sidetree-based networks to purge upwards of 95% of legacy operation data in a decentralized way that maintains all of the security guarantees the protocol currently makes.</p><p>Another near-future feature is the so-called “DID Type Table.” DIDs in various DID Method implementations may be typed to provide an indication as to what they DID might represent. The Sidetree WG will publish a table of types (not including human-centric types) that stand for organizations, machines, code packages, etc., which DID creators can use if they want to tag a DID with a given&nbsp;type.</p><p>The medium-term roadmap is up for discussion, so if you have ideas <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html">get involved</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1-9b565cf92db3">Sidetree Protocol reaches V1</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

This is why we make our quarterly Global LEI System Business Report accessible to all, and why we are committed to providing consistent updates on LEI adoption worldwide. These reports are always free of charge and support GLEIF’s aim of providing open, unrestricted access to LEI data on a global scale. </p>
<p>In our latest report, covering Q1 2021, we have seen continued growth within LEI issuance, with 63,000 LEI issued within the quarter, an increase of 1000 from Q4 2020. As a result, the total active LEI population now stands at 1.77 million.</p>
<p>The below infographic contains the key statistics from Q1 2021.</p>

<p>In Q1, we continue to see progress across our key growth markets, with Estonia taking the top spot as the largest growth market (12.1% growth rate), overtaking China (12%) for the first time in over a year.  Additionally, we are pleased to have onboarded two new issuers to our network of Local Operating Units (LOUs): Keler Central Depository Ltd., based in Hungary, and Tunisie Clearing, based in Tunisia. These additions to the LOU network present an excellent opportunity to grow the presence of the LEI in two key markets. </p>

 Canada’s trusted digital ID leader, the DIACC, welcomes Budget 2021 investments for digital transformation and Canadian innovation 



<p>TORONTO, APRIL 19, 2021 — Joni Brennan, President of the Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) released a statement following <a href="https://www.budget.gc.ca/2021/report-rapport/toc-tdm-en.html">the tabling of the federal budget today</a>:</p>



<p>If the global pandemic has shown us anything, it’s that the need for reliable and secure data is paramount as businesses, governments and Canadians from Vancouver to Quebec City to Charlottetown and everywhere in between move online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From receiving emergency pandemic benefits to ensuring health records are correct and helping children and youth with online education, the pandemic has put a renewed spotlight on the need for governments to move with urgency to invest in digital infrastructure. In fact, it’s critical to ensuring Canadians receive the services they need and that businesses can participate fully and securely in the global digital economy.</p>



<p>At the core of this infrastructure is a secure digital identity which is essential to the function of daily life during a pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DIACC, Canada’s digital ID leader, is pleased to see the federal government’s recognition that our economic future depends on digital investments. Initiatives like the investment in the Known Traveller Digital Identity pilot project and the Canada Digital Adoption Program will help Canadians, businesses and governments on this path.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, at the core of a safe and secure digital environment is a safe and secure digital ID. Given the federal government’s priorities around a Digital Charter, the government lost an opportunity to highlight the important need for investments in digital ID. Investing in digital ID makes economic sense, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). For SMEs, the impact of digital identity could be used to improve processes that are difficult today, resulting in a potential $4.5 billion of added value to SMEs and reinvestments in the Canadian economy.</p>



<p>Our digital future rests on getting digital ID right. We look forward to working with governments to meaningfully adopt a digital ID ecosystem, especially as we look toward post-pandemic economic recovery.</p>



<p>-30-</p>



<p>About Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC)</p>



<p>The Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada was created following the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review to bring together public and private sector partners in developing a safe and secure digital ID ecosystem. The DIACC has 100 high profile members spanning several sectors from financial institutions, networks for payments and for identity verification, technology service providers, strategy and integration experts and federal and provincial governments. For 10 years the DIACC has built up this important sector as the trusted voice for driving the development of standards and a trust framework that will secure a fully digital Canada. With established global partnerships that will help Canada lead efforts in international digital interoperability and accreditation, the DIACC provides a world-leading forum to foster collaboration for developing and recommending harmonizing policies, standards, and regulatory changes with international benchmarks — innovative solutions to navigate the digital future.</p>

  Computer scientist E. Dean Tribble stated that in smart contracts, identity-based access control did not support well dynamically changing permissions, compared to the object-capability model. He analogized the ocap model with giving a valet the key to one's car, without handing over the right to car ownership.

      <p>The structural properties of object capability systems favor modularity in code design and ensure reliable encapsulation in code implementation.</p>

      <p>These structural properties facilitate the analysis of some security properties of an object-capability program or operating system. Some of these – in particular, information flow properties – can be analyzed at the level of object references and connectivity, independent of any knowledge or analysis of the code that determines the behavior of the objects. As a consequence, these security properties can be established and maintained in the presence of new objects that contain unknown and possibly malicious code.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The capability model is, in a sense, the object model taken to its logical extreme. Where object programmers seek modularity – a decrease in the dependencies between separately thought-out units – capability programmers seek security, recognizing that required trust is a form of dependency. Object programmers wish to guard against bugs: a bug in module A should not propagate to module B. Capability programmers wish to guard against malice. However, if B is designed to be invulnerable to A’s malice, it is likely also invulnerable to A’s bugs.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Authorization Capabilities for Linked Data (ZCAP-LD for short) provides a secure way for linked data systems to grant and express authority utilizing the object capability model. Capabilities are represented as linked data objects which are signed with Linked Data Proofs. ZCAP-LD supports delegating authority to other entities on the network by chaining together capability documents. “Caveats” may be attached to capability documents which may be used to restrict the scope of their use, for example to restrict the actions which may be used or providing a mechanism by which the capability may be later revoked.</p>

We started by defining and describing object capabilities:</p>
       
         A Capability is a Transferable Unforgeable Permission. It can be implemented with unguessable URLS or signed objects. 
         A Java Program object reference is a capability, it allows for actions on the subject (the object instance). 
         A stronger implementation of object capabilities involves a digital certificate issued by a public key, for a resource with a set of supported methods:<br>
<code>Issuer: AlicePubKey</code><br>
<code>Resource: did:dad:0x123</code><br>
<code>Actions: Read,Write</code><br>

      <p>Object capabilities (ocaps) are increasingly recognized as an important tool for achieving the goals of self-sovereign identity. Many of the principles of self-sovereign identity, such as minimization and protection, can best be achieved through the disciplined pursuit of the principle of least authority that ocaps enable. This paper examines how POLA can be extended to better protect users when exercising their self-sovereign identity.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Considering different models for handling identity information allows reconciliation, and creates opportunities to address primary use cases across paradigms, increasing overall strength and security of a solution.<br>
[…]<br>
In the Object Capabilities model, authorization is managed by creating, sharing, attenuating, and using “capabilities” instead of, for example, access control lists. If you have a valid “capability”, you have the authorization. Like a car key, Object Capabilities may be used no matter who you are. This model shifts the burden of identification from error-prone correlations to directly work with individuals’ actual capabilities.</p>

Unfortunately Scheme on its own is neither “safe” nor (necessarily) deterministic. Thankfully we can get the properties we want through:</p>

       
         Making object capabilities a core part of the language. Specifically, <a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/pubs/secureos/secureos.html">Jonathan Rees’ “W7 security kernel”</a> demonstrates that a pure lexically scoped environment is itself an appropritate substrate for object capabilities.

    <blockquote>
      <p>Identity Hubs as currently proposed in the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) are a subset of a general Decentralized Identifier (DID) based user-controlled agent, based on ACLs rather than an object-capabilities (ocap) architecture.  The current approach has both security and scalability issues. Transitioning the Hubs design to an ocap model can be achieved by introducing an UMA authorization server as the control endpoint. This avoids creating confused-deputy security issues and expands scale by enabling the hub to delegate access to resources not stored in the hub itself.</p>

  <p>COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) is a part of Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH), an initiative by Linux Foundation to build, secure, and sustain open-source software to help public health authorities (PHAs) combat COVID-19 and future epidemics. After initial success with deploying exposure notification apps, LFPH started to host CCI in December 2020 to advance the use of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and data and technical interoperability of VCs in the public health realm, starting with vaccine credentials.</p>

      <p>Immunity credentials can allow those who are not COVID-positive to return to daily in-person routines, travel or going back to work, providing evidence that they are low-risk of transmitting the COVID-19 virus. This could be accomplished through a national digital identification system that monitors and tracks the health status of its citizens. The details of how digital immunity credentials would be implemented are still up in the air, but may include important features such as the ability to share results remotely, interoperability across systems, proof of authenticity and the potential for individuals to have full ownership over their health data.</p>

      <p>We are all painfully aware of the economic and social restrictions imparted on us as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to reopen offices, restaurants, local private and public facilities — and most importantly, international borders — will likely require a flexible, interoperable, and ubiquitous system that preserves individual agency and privacy. The COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) focuses its efforts on supporting technology projects that work to meet these requirements through the utilization of W3C compliant ‘Verifiable Credentials (VCs)’, a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified.</p>

      <p>When the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) was formed in April 2020, we were a self-organizing group of companies and individuals, held together by a few mailing lists and working groups, to explore how Verifiable Credentials (VCs), an open standard and an emerging technology, could be used for the public health crisis unfolding with COVID-19. Recognizing our limits early on as an informal group, we quickly pivoted from developing a solution together to supporting each other to build for their local contexts. Over the course of nine months, we have seen over 20 projects present their work to the CCI community and developed an MVP governance framework that can be adapted to specific COVID-19 use cases.</p>

      <p>Drummond Reed, Steering Committee Member, Trust-over-IP-Foundation, comments: “The vLEI has the potential to become one of the most valuable digital credentials in the world because it is the hallmark of authenticity for a legal entity of any kind. The family of digital credentials in the GLEIF vLEI Governance Framework can serve as a chain of trust for anyone needing to verify the legal identity of an organization or of a person legally acting on that organization’s behalf. The demand this will create for LEIs — and the impact it will have on adoption of self-sovereign identity — cannot be overestimated. It will be a sea change for digital trust infrastructure that will benefit every country, company, and citizen in the world.”</p>

In the spirit of a true exploration, rather than starting from a point of ‘expertise’ and homogeneity, I offer this as an emergent thought process, and to invite in participation. I must also point out that though this blog is written through the lens of my journey, my learning isn’t mine alone — it is greatly informed by so many people, disciplines and research and I am grateful to the countless people that have gracefully shared their knowledge and wisdom so that we might collectively grow together.</p><blockquote>“Who and what gets fixed in place to enable progress? What social groups are classified, corralled, coerced and capitalized upon so others are free to tinker, experiment and engineer the future?” Ruha&nbsp;Benjamin</blockquote><p>I started off my exploration with this hypothesis: Can humanitarian digital policy be decolonized?</p><p>I started with this, as I’ve often argued that the humanitarian aid system perpetuates hierarchical, patriarchal, hegemonic views of what ‘development’ and ‘progress’ looks like, ignoring other world-views, and underlying systemic and structural pillars of inequality and bias. As the humanitarian aid system increasingly intersects with technology systems developed in the context of Western capitalism and in small pockets of privileged power, I have not been alone in raising concerns on the implications of collision of two systems that are fundamentally patriarchal and hegemonic on those that are minoritized in the Global&nbsp;South.</p><p>To put in context, the range of digital or technology systems that humanitarian actors engage with is incredibly wide. This can range from (as a snapshot):</p>  Systems used to support the coordination of aid efforts — for example, biometric digital identities with refugee assistance programs or earth observing technology in disaster&nbsp;relief  Digital platforms or digital transformation with partners — for example, e-government services that link social protection and citizen&nbsp;welfare  Technology innovations to support affected populations access to aid — for example, ICTs, apps, digital ledgers, hardware and many&nbsp;others  <p>Even what we constitute as ‘humanitarian’ has shades of grey — whether it’s at the pointy end of a crisis, to support during peacetime. The wide array of aid provision does not easily exist within the carefully designed terminology found in textbooks and political resolutions.</p><p>Additionally, who works on technology or digital innovations within humanitarian institutions is wildly divergent — mostly within institutions innovation labs, or within digital or thematic teams — then deployed to the global south for implementation or testing (the notion of testing on vulnerable groups is already contentious and has its own set of critiques).</p><p>The diversity of use cases, contexts, stakeholders and owners does have one common thread however. As humanitarian organisations do not tend to traditionally have the requisite digital or technology expertise in-house, they partner externally to achieve their aims. And this is the sticking point — it easily falls into expertise and partnerships that predominantly come from small communities of public-private, technology partners, and academic institutions from the global north. What this does (whether implicitly or unconsciously) is to reinforce a dominant, hegemonic narrative that&nbsp;assumes:</p>  The experiences of global civil society and its actors, is homogeneous  The singular ‘Silicon Valley’ values that underpin such digital policies are the ones that all people aspire to, regardless of where they live or their cultural, societal, economic, geographic bearings  Power dynamics will continue to be affirmed in the hands of those that currently hold it without considering the cascading impacts of those policy decisions on those that are most going to be affected by&nbsp;it  <p>The appropriateness and impacts of digital technologies and AI within aid systems is still being discovered and understood. An incredible amount of work has gone into establishing data governance guidance and data protection protocols but not as much into broader policy governing the deployment and use of these technologies sector wide. Often they are siloed into communities or thematic areas of work, or perhaps resulting in codes of conduct — but not systematically looking at a sector wide approach that interrogates whether the use of these technologies paradoxically expose, mitigate or expand harm on often marginalised, minoritised constituents AND whether the digital futures we are chasing merely replicate or reinforce existing or past inequalities?.</p><blockquote>“..the relationship between tech industries and those populations who are outside their ambit of power — women, populations in the Global South, including black, Indigenous and Latinx communities in North America, immigrants in Europe — is a colonial one” Sareetyta Amrute, Data and&nbsp;Society</blockquote><p>So, could humanitarian actors play a more intentional role in designing just and equitable digital futures? Could we in fact, unshackle ourselves from our neo-colonial humanitarian mental models, and push back against the hierarchies of techno-chauvinism and meritocracy? Could we use this moment in time to design worlds that don’t imagine some figures, especially populations in the Global South — to merely be passive beneficiaries and outside of the borders of expertise we seek? Could we invert the pathways of tech colonialism in the aid&nbsp;sector?</p><p>As I started my exploration, I realised that my original hypothesis needed more rigour. There were tensions inherent in my original starting point. Firstly, what in fact constitutes digital policy? For whom? For what purpose? What influence does policy have in fact over systems? Different actors have their own policy making instruments — that are incumbent on different leverage points that service multiple agendas. Considering the multiplicity of use cases, actors, and contexts — what I was softly heading to was the governance of the deployment and use of digital systems and technologies within the aid sector. Notwithstanding the work in data governance and data protection in aid, there are still gaps in governance in terms of how and when we deploy tech innovation, the digital systems we are creating and supporting to create, supply chains that we are a part of, due diligence processes, accountability and risk ownership, and many other elements. In addition to this, are questions of immunity (traditionally, humanitarian organisations do not go beyond the individual institutional governance mechanisms, that often are bordered by the institution’s immunity); and appropriateness of the technology innovations we&nbsp;deploy.</p><p>How then do we design digital governance systems that speak to these complex, intertwined issues? Instead of merely looking at digital governance in terms of control, could weaving in feminist and decolonial approaches help us liberate our digital futures so that it is a space of safety, of humanity — for those whom we are meant to support? Are these approaches ways in which we can design new forms of digital humanism?</p><blockquote>“We could build systems for durability, but instead some dipshits told you we needed to move fast and break things” Audrey&nbsp;Watters</blockquote><p>Could a digital governance approach consider questions like the following:</p>  How then do we go beyond what we are merely legally required to do versus what is right to do? And importantly, are humanitarian actors willing to go beyond their immunity?  How do we extend digital governance to go beyond the fortresses of individual institutions to a multi-actor, sector wide approach that is emergent and iterative?  Can and should governance systems help users realize and/or amplify their rights and in fact use it as a way to hold humanitarian actors to&nbsp;account?  How might governance systems actually flatten power in decision&nbsp;making  Can governance systems help us monitor our accountability to our promises to affected populations?  Who has the power to draw the conclusions from assessments done?  Just because we *can* deploy a specific asset or tech, *should*&nbsp;we?  How do we increase percentage of risk/harm that gets absolved by humanitarian institutions rather than that risk/harm being pushed further down the chain to affected populations?  How might we incentivise governance systems to do the right&nbsp;thing?  <p>Digital technologies and AI mask ideologies of power, and are wed to a market ideology of dominance. To intentionally carve a different type of ideology would require governance systems that are informed by different knowledge sources into decision making. That prioritise those that are most impacted by or are on the receiving end of that initiative, rather than cantering donor or aid institutions privileges. Good digital governance in the vein that this research is pursuing then, must disrupt the idea of ‘solutionism’, must also critique the systems in which that technology is being deployed and the impacts of that deployment — now and into the&nbsp;future.</p><p>And this is when my hypothesis started to fork out. Where I originally thought to use elements of futures methodologies to analyse future states and imaginaries of what we might collectively desire, I realised this was not enough for the rigour of what is needed to be achieved. What I have learned in my practice of strategic foresight within systems and institutional transformation is that the facilitation of the method does not automatically result in a change in policy and/or strategic decision making. And that is because the application of insights isn’t weaved into and within how change actually occurs. Often in humanitarian/development work, we are fire-fighting the now — the problem right in front of us. We design solutions and interventions aimed to problem solving what is immediately in front of us without necessarily assessing three&nbsp;things:</p>  The complexity of the system in which that issue&nbsp;lives  Just as rights are not static, neither is harm. What is the current and future theory of harm that might arise out of that solution/intervention  What might be the impact of the solution/intervention on future generations and on our&nbsp;planet  Who holds the fiduciary duty to future digital selves of affected populations?  <p>I now radically pursue the idea of foresight within ethics systems to inform governance. Can we consider the ethics of intervention through the lens of constraining future good and mitigating future bad? Might this in fact be where it can add rigour and&nbsp;value?</p><blockquote>“Our radical imagination is a tool for decolonization, for reclaiming our right to shape our lived reality.” ― Adrienne Maree&nbsp;Brown</blockquote><p>Lastly, I realised that my focus on decolonisation was somewhat, and honestly — skewed.</p><p>Decolonisation is the process of undoing and giving up social and economic power, and restoring what has been taken away in the past, which arguably includes reparations. As Eve Tuck and Wayne Yang argue — decolonisation is also not a metaphor for diversity and inclusion nor is it a replacement for social justice efforts. Would the efforts of humanitarian aid ever include reparations? Could we ethically profess to even do so? We often argue that for the humanitarian system to change, it would involve giving up the status quo that we have a strangle-hold on. However, could this ever be achieved through the result of this one approach/framework? Am I being authentic, am I being honest if I were to declare it so? The answer was&nbsp;no.</p><p>What I was unpacking in actuality, was the notion of decoloniality — an aspiration to restore, renew, elevate, rediscover, acknowledge and validate the multiplicity of lives, lived-experiences, culture and knowledge of indigenous people, people of colour, and colonised people as well as to decenter hetere/cis-normativity, gender hierarchies and racial privilege. I think of this as how do we exist in plurality — in a multiverse so to speak. And to include this in governance, not as a tokenistic or virtue-signalling flag, but rather to help us consider different lenses, perspectives, sources of truth in even how we think about what is right, what is fair and what is just. How might decolonial and feminist approaches help us reframe our starting points and in fact influence governance design? This isn’t about just getting different under-represented groups around the table, but rather how might we shift the knowledge and experiences we draw from in the very design and decision making of policy and governance frames. It is to ensure that we are considering the multiplicity of ways in which issues of rights, privacy and agency are understood and experienced the world over, and not imposing just one or a narrow valued judgement on these&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Through applying a decolonial lens to governance, might we in fact be able to intentionally design for equity rather than for privilege?</p><blockquote>“Decolonisation, expressed by your lips, differs from the decolonisation that comes from within, as a revolutionary concept that speaks about rehumanization — a fundamental planetary project” — Sabelo Ndlovu-Gatsheni</blockquote><p>Thus, I am gently landing on Decolonial Humanitarian Digital Governance. An emergent process that is grounded in the following hypothesis: How do we not lock people into future harm, indebtedness or future inequity? It seeks to help start answering the questions unearthed through the journey thus far. Importantly, its primacy is to shift the focus of current humanitarian digital efforts that prioritise the problem solving of now, to one that aims to mitigate future harm and inequity. It aims at not binding nor narrowing the governance actions of humanitarian actors to merely their institutional legal liabilities and privileges but rather allows self-regulation for a shared responsibility for our collective futures across all actors and constituents in the aid&nbsp;sector.</p><p>The Decolonial Humanitarian Digital Governance is a framework that&nbsp;is:</p>  Multi-Dimensional (intentionally includes plurality of perspectives affected populations, minoritized groups, humanitarian and tech governance actors, activists, and ethicists)  Rigorously analyses future harms and impacts on future generations  Interrogates who absorbs future&nbsp;harm  Grounded in the rights and equity of impacted minoritized people  Is emergent and acts as a compass (not a checkbox)  <p>I see it visualised in three&nbsp;weaves:</p><p>And how we might judge this? Though not complete, perhaps some questions we might weave into that could&nbsp;include:</p><p>1. For the improvements it makes relative to what is&nbsp;replaced</p><p>2. For its understanding and active management of unintended consequences</p><p>3. For its mitigation and absorption of current and future&nbsp;harm</p><p>4. For its ability to cultivate an evolved awareness of rights, accountability and collective humanity</p><p>And that is where I am up to. This is a journey that isn’t complete by any measure. In fact, this framework must never be complete. It must never be static. The complexities we are dealing with are continuously evolving, and our commons have irrevocably shifted. We must unpack decades of mental models and behaviours as the range of choices about the type of futures we want to inhabit — has expanded exponentially, and the choices we make now will decide our collective fates.</p><p>To design more flourishing and liberated futures for all, we must uncover the plurality that is available to all of us, to frame how we see the&nbsp;world.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/decolonial-humanitarian-digital-governance-48b35b05b110">Decolonial Humanitarian Digital Governance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Between Games and Apocalyptic Robots: Considering Near-Term Social Risks of Reinforcement Learning  An increasingly popular branch of Machine Learning challenges current approaches to algorithmic governance. <p>With many of us stuck at home this past year, we’ve seen a surge in the popularity of video games. That trend hasn’t been limited to humans. DeepMind and Google AI both released results from their Atari playing AIs, which have taught themselves to play over fifty Atari games from scratch, with no provided rules or guidelines. The unique thing about these new results is how general the AI agent is. While previous efforts have achieved human performance on the games they were trained to play, DeepMind’s new AI Agent, MuZero could teach itself to beat humans at Atari games it had never encountered in under a day. If this reminds you of AlphaZero which taught itself to play Go then Chess well enough to outperform world champions, that’s because it demonstrates an advance in the same suite of algorithms, a class of machine learning called Reinforcement Learning&nbsp;(RL).</p><p>While traditional machine learning parses out its model of the world (typically a small world pertaining only to the problem it’s designed to solve) from swathes of data, RL is real-time observation based. This means RL learns its model primarily through trial and error interactions with its environment, not by pulling out correlations from data representing a historical snapshot of it. In the RL framework, each interaction with the environment is an opportunity to build towards an overarching goal, referred to as a reward. An RL agent is trained to make a sequence of decisions on how to interact with its environment that will ultimately maximize its reward (i.e. help it win the&nbsp;game).</p><p>This unique iterative learning paradigm allows the AI model to change and adapt to its environment, making RL an attractive solution for open-ended, real-world problem-solving. It also makes it a leading candidate for artificial general intelligence (AGI) and has some researchers concerned about the rise of truly autonomous AI that does not align with human values. Nick Bostrom first posed what is now the canonical example of this risk among AI Safety researchers — a paperclip robot with one goal: optimize the production efficiency of paperclips. With no other specifications, the agent quickly drifts from optimizing its own paperclip factory to commandeering food production supply chains for the paperclip making cause. It proceeds to place paperclips above all other human needs until all that’s left of the world is a barren wasteland covered end to end with unused paper clips. The takeaway? Extremely literal problem solving combined with inaccurate problem definition can lead to bad outcomes.</p><p>This rogue AGI (albeit in more high-stakes incarnations like weapons management) is the type of harm usually thought of when trying to make RL safe in the context of society. However, between an autonomous agent teaching itself games in the virtual world and an intelligent but misguided AI putting humanity in existential risk lay a multitude of sociotechnical concerns. As RL is being rolled out in domains ranging from social media to medicine and education, it’s time we seriously think about these near-term risks.</p><p>How the paperclip problem will play out in the near term is likely to be rather subtle. For example, medical treatment protocols are currently popular candidates for RL modeling; they involve a series of decisions (which treatment options to try) with uncertain outcomes (different options work better for different people) that all connect to the eventual outcome (patient health). One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lIr8rgo5zE&amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks">such study</a> tried to identify the best treatment decisions to avoid sepsis in ICU patients based off of multitudes of data, including medical histories, clinical charts and doctor’s notes. Their first iteration was an astounding success. With very high accuracy, it identified treatment paths that resulted in patient death. However, upon further examination and consultation with clinicians it turned out that though the agent had been allowed to learn from a plethora of potentially relevant treatment considerations, it had latched onto only one main indicator for death — whether or not a chaplain was called. The goal of the system was to flag treatment paths that led to deaths, and in a very literal sense that’s what it did. Clinicians only called a chaplain when a patient presented as close to&nbsp;death.</p><p>You’ll notice that in this example, the incredibly literal yet unhelpful solution the RL agent was taking was discovered by the researchers. This is no accident. The field of modern medicine is built around the reality that connections between treatment and outcomes typically have no known causal explanations. Aspirin, for example, was used as an anti-inflammatory for over seventy years before we had any insight into why it worked. This lack of causal understanding is sometimes referred to as <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c">intellectual debt</a>; if we can’t describe why something works, we may not be able to predict when or how it will fail. Medicine has grown around this fundamental uncertainty. Through strict codes of ethics, industry standards, and regulatory infrastructure (i.e. clinical trials), the field has developed the scaffolding to minimize the accompanying harms. RL systems aiming to help with diagnosis and treatment have to develop within this infrastructure. Compliance with the machinery medicine has around intellectual debt is more likely to result in slow and steady progress, without colossal misalignment. This same level of oversight does not apply to fields like social media, the potential harms of which are hard to pin down and which have virtually no regulatory scaffolding in&nbsp;place.</p><p>We may have already experienced some of the early harms of RL based algorithms in complex domains. In 2018 YouTube engineers released a paper describing an RL addition to their recommendation algorithm that increased daily watch time by 6 million hours in the beta testing phase. Meanwhile, anecdotal accounts of radicalization through YouTube rabbit holes of increasingly conspiratorial content (e.g., NYTimes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html">reporting</a> on YouTube’s role in empowering Brazil’s far right) were on the rise. While it is impossible to know exactly which algorithms powered the platform’s recommendations at the time, this rabbit hole effect would be a natural result of an RL algorithm trying to maximize view time by nudging users towards increasingly addictive content.</p><p>In the near future, dynamic manipulation of this sort may end up at odds with established protections under the law. For example, Facebook has recently been put under scrutiny by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18286660/facebook-hud-housing-discrimination-case-section-230-legal-defense">discriminatory housing advertisements</a>. The HUD suit alleges that even without explicit targeting filters that amount to the exclusion of protected groups, its algorithms are likely to hide ads from ‘users whom the system determines are unlikely to engage with the ad, even if the advertiser explicitly wants to reach those users.’ Given the types of (non-RL) ML algorithms FB currently uses in advertising, proving this disparate impact would be a matter of examining the data and features used to train the algorithm. While the current lack of transparency makes this challenging, it is fundamentally possible to roll out benchmarks capable of flagging such discrimination.</p><p>If advertising were instead powered by RL, benchmarks would not be enough. An RL advertising algorithm tasked with ensuring it does not discriminate against protected classes, could easily end up making it look as though it were not discriminating instead. If the RL agent were optimized for profit and the practice of discrimination was profitable, the RL agent would be incentivized to find loopholes under which it could circumvent protections. Just like in the sepsis treatment case, the system is likely to find a shortcut towards reaching its objective, only in this case the lack of regulatory scaffolding makes it unlikely this failure will be picked up. The propensity of RL to adapt to meet metrics, while skirting over intent, will make it challenging to tag such undesirable behavior. This situation is further complicated by our heavy reliance on ‘data’ as a means to flag potential bias in ML&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Unlike RL, traditional machine learning is innately static; it takes in loads of data, parses it for correlations, and outputs a model. Once a system has been trained, updating it to accommodate a new environment or changes to the status quo requires repeating most or all of that initial training with updated data. Even for firms that have the computing power to make such retraining seamless, the reliance on data has allowed an ‘in’ for transparency. The saying goes, machine learning is like money laundering for bias. If an ML system is trained using biased or unrepresentative data, its model of the world will reflect that. In traditional machine learning, we can at least follow the marked bills and point out when an ML system is going to be prone to discrimination by examining its training data. We may even be able to preprocess the data before training the system in an attempt to preemptively correct for&nbsp;bias.</p><p>Since RL is generally real-time observation-based rather than training data-based, this ‘follow-the-data’ approach to algorithmic oversight does not apply. There is no controlled input data to help us anticipate or correct for where an RL system can go wrong before we set it loose in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>In certain domains, this lack of data-born insight may not be too problematic. The more we can specify what the moving parts of a given application are and the ways in which they may fail–be it through an understanding of the domain or regulatory scaffolding–the safer it is for us to use RL. DeepMind’s use of RL to lower the energy costs of its computing centers, a process ultimately governed by the laws of physics, deserves less scrutiny than the RL based K-12 curriculum generator Google’s Ed Chi views as a near-term goal of the field. The harder it is to describe what success looks like within a given domain, the more prone to bad outcomes it is. This is true of all ML systems, but even more crucial for RL systems that cannot be meaningfully validated ahead of use. As regulators, we need to think about which domains need more regulatory scaffolding to minimize the fallout from our intellectual debt, while allowing for the immense promise of algorithms that can learn from their mistakes.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/between-games-and-apocalyptic-robots-considering-near-term-societal-risks-of-reinforcement-35ec5af8f04a">Between Games and Apocalyptic Robots: Considering Near-Term Societal Risks of Reinforcement…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
 Bitcoin is increasingly becoming more accepted as a currency and as a way to pay for products and services. 
<p>And Bitcoin ATMs are making it easier to buy and sell Bitcoins or transfer funds from anywhere in the world.</p>
 What is a Bitcoin ATM 
<p>Bitcoin ATMs are similar to a regular bank ATM. Bitcoin ATMs are not connected to a bank, they are connected via the internet to a cryptocurrency exchange. They allow users to buy and sell Bitcoin using cash. (Do note that using cash to buy Bitcoin is <a href="https://commodity.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/#Bitcoin_vs_Bitcoin_Cash">not the same thing</a> as “Bitcoin Cash” – which is the name of a digital coin.)</p>
<p>They look similar to a bank ATM with a monitor, QR scanner, and acceptors and dispensers for cash. Buying Bitcoin from an ATM makes it convenient to buy Bitcoin whenever you want.</p>
<p>Selling Bitcoin for cash is also a simple process and makes it convenient to get money when you need it. Users log in to their account, select the withdraw cash option, enter the amount of cash they want to withdraw, and send the Bitcoin to the wallet address.</p>
<p>This gives users a quick way to convert their cryptocurrency into cash. Not all Bitcoin ATMs have this option though. These types of ATMs are sometimes referred to as 2-ways kiosks because they can be used to both buy and sell cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Some Bitcoin ATMs allow users to transfer or send money to others anywhere in the world where there is a cryptocurrency ATM. If a user wanted to send money to a friend, they would first send the cash equivalent in Bitcoin to their friend. Their friend would then sell the Bitcoin and receive the cash from the Bitcoin ATM.</p>
<p>Before using one of these cryptocurrency ATMs, users should have an account with the company that operates that particular ATM and become familiar with how to use it.</p>
 The History of Bitcoin ATMs 
<p>Bitcoin ATMs have come a long way from the very first Bitcoin ATM, which at the time, was called a Robocoin machine. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/10/bitcoin-atm-gallery/">Robocoin</a> was the first company to install automatic teller machines for Bitcoin. The first one in the world was installed in Vancouver, Canada, in 2013.</p>
<p>With much fanfare, the first Robocoin ATM for Bitcoin opened in Austin, Texas, in 2015. Robocoin was the only manufacturer of Bitcoin ATMs in those days and expected to expand worldwide.</p>
<p>In 2015, Robocoin started facing cash flow problems and faced a lawsuit for failing to refund a customer. The customer, Adam O’Brien, president of Bitcoin Solutions, had never received their Robocoin machine and sued for a refund.</p>
<p>Facing numerous customer complaints, Robocoin never really got a foothold in the Bitcoin ATM business. Since then, other companies have taken their place, and Bitcoin ATMs are becoming as common as a bank ATM.</p>
 The Rise of Bitcoin ATMs 
<p>As of early 2021, Bitcoin is near record highs, and interest in cryptocurrencies has been described as a “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-24/bitcoin-mania-grips-retail-traders-in-flashback-to-fall-2017">mania</a>.” This is also increasing the popularity of Bitcoin ATMs around the world.</p>
<p>In addition to the increased popularity of cryptocurrencies, the pandemic also brought awareness to Bitcoin ATMs. During the pandemic, many businesses wouldn’t accept cash for products and services.</p>
<p>Because of the fear of handling money that could pass the Covid-19 virus, contactless forms of payment like debit cards, credit cards, and in some cases Bitcoin, were the only way to pay.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ATMs make it possible to quickly turn cryptocurrency into money that can be deposited into a bank account or turn money into Bitcoin. The only thing a person needs, is their digital wallet to deposit the bitcoins into.</p>
<p>At the end of 2019, there were approximately 6,372 machines worldwide. As of April 2021, there are 17,827 Bitcoin ATM machines <a href="https://www.theee.ai/2021/04/07/9246-global-total-of-crypto-atms-to-hit-20k-in-june/">worldwide</a>.</p>
<p>At the start of April 2021, the United States had the most Bitcoin ATMs with 15,431 machines, an increase of 250% over the previous year. In one month, October 2020, the United States added 800 machines. The top countries for Bitcoin ATMs as of April 2021 are:</p>
<p>United States<br>
Canada<br>
United Kingdom<br>
Austria<br>
Spain</p>
<p>Figures are changing so rapidly that it is hard to get an exact count of just how many Bitcoin ATMs there are in any given month.</p>
<p>While some countries have shown a constant increase, other countries like the United Kingdom have shown a decrease, possibly due to the pandemic. The United Kingdom peaked at 283 machines in February 2020, dropping to 199 by the end of the year. The latest figures show an increase again in early 2021.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, London and Birmingham have the highest concentration of Bitcoin ATMs. In Scotland, customers can find Bitcoin ATMs in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee, and Dunfermline.</p>
 Summary 
<p>During the pandemic, when contactless payments became popular, customers found that Bitcoin ATMs are a great way to pay for products at businesses that accept cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Customers can buy Bitcoins through these ATMs and transfer the cryptocurrency to their digital wallet. If a customer needs money in their bank account, they can sell their Bitcoin and deposit the money into their bank.</p>
<p>If someone needs to send money to a friend, they can accomplish that using a Bitcoin ATM, provided their friend also has a digital wallet. It might not be long before Bitcoin ATMs are as popular as bank ATMs.</p>

<p>Not all Blockchain projects need to be disruptive of the status quo to generate value.&nbsp; The obvious benefits of reducing transaction complexity and costs, as well as improving transparency and controls, can be reaped by any company in the world. Creating a system that allows companies to exchange traditional business documents through Blockchain can generate enough value to drive mass adoption at multiple levels. Economic incentives to capture value opportunities are driving companies to leverage the Blockchain rather than be overtaken by others using it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the business model that is most likely to succeed in the short term is the federated model.</p>
<p>A Public Blockchain, like Bitcoin, has no central authority and represents a path to total monetary disintermediation.</p>
<p>Ethereum, on the other hand, with its ability to be programmable, is a perfect fit for those who use it for any purpose, but at this time it lacks the scalability to handle the current needs of businesses.</p>
<p>A federated Blockchain such as @Commercio.network was created with the express purpose of helping companies leverage the Blockchain quickly and easily, it is hosted on computer networks of certified operators (TSPs) that offer:</p>
 
 a controlled access of all participants through KYC 
 a level of service compatible with Enterprise standards 
 predictable transaction costs (€0.01) 
 scalability up to 15,000 transactions per second 
 a very high level of privacy by design.

  Hyperledger Ursa is a shared cryptographic library, it enables implementations to avoid duplicating other cryptographic work and hopefully increase security in the process. The library is an opt-in repository (for Hyperledger and non Hyperledger projects) to place and use crypto. Hyperledger Ursa consists of sub-projects, which are cohesive implementations of cryptographic code or interfaces to cry

      <p>Ursa is a library for cryptography and the result of a collaborative effort from teams at ACM, Bitwise, DFINITY, Evernym, Fujitsu, Intel, the Linux Foundation, the Sovrin Foundation, and State Street. Duplication among blockchain project features heightens security risks. Ursa, however, gathers up crypto implementations across projects and compiles them into a single metalibrary, creating a central repository for crypto code. This way, projects can select sources of code from Ursa, instead of the original source, decreasing duplication security risks and boosting interoperability among projects.</p>

 Manifesto 
<p><a href="https://id2020.org/manifesto">The Alliance Manifesto</a></p>
 
   The ability to prove one’s identity is a fundamental and universal human right. 
   We live in a digital era. Individuals need a trusted, verifiable way to prove who they are, both in the physical world and online. 
   Over 1 billion people worldwide are unable to prove their identity through any recognized means. As such, they are without the protection of law, and are unable to access basic services, participate as a citizen or voter, or transact in the modern economy. Most of those affected are children and adolescents, and many are refugees, forcibly displaced, or stateless persons. 
   For some, including refugees, the stateless, and other marginalized groups, reliance on national identification systems isn’t possible. This may be due to exclusion, inaccessibility, or risk, or because the credentials they do hold are not broadly recognized. While we support efforts to expand access to national identity programs, we believe it is imperative to complement such efforts by providing an alternative to individuals lacking safe and reliable access to state-based systems. 
   We believe that individuals must have control over their own digital identities, including how personal data is collected, used, and shared. Everyone should be able to assert their identity across institutional and national borders, and across time. Privacy, portability, and persistence are necessary for digital identity to meaningfully empower and protect individuals. 
   Digital identity carries significant risk if not thoughtfully designed and carefully implemented. We do not underestimate the risks of data misuse and abuse, particularly when digital identity systems are designed as large, centralized databases. 
   Technical design can mitigate some of the risks of digital identity. Emerging technology — for example, cryptographically secure, decentralized systems — could provide greater privacy protection for users, while also allowing for portability and verifiability. But widespread agreement on principles, technical design patterns, and interoperability standards is needed for decentralized digital identities to be trusted and recognized. 
   This “better” model of digital identity will not emerge spontaneously. In order for digital identities to be broadly trusted and recognized, we need sustained and transparent collaboration aligned around these shared principles, along with supporting regulatory and policy frameworks. 
   ID2020 Alliance partners jointly define functional requirements, influencing the course of technical innovation and providing a route to technical interoperability, and therefore trust and recognition. 
   The ID2020 Alliance recognizes that taking these ideas to scale requires a robust evidence base, which will inform advocacy and policy. As such, ID2020 Alliance-supported pilots are designed around a common monitoring and evaluation framework.

 Introduction 
<p>Financial-grade API&nbsp;(FAPI) is a technical specification that&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">Financial-grade API Working Group</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a>&nbsp;has developed. It uses&nbsp;OAuth 2.0&nbsp;and&nbsp;OpenID Connect&nbsp;(OIDC) as its base and defines additional technical requirements for the financial industry and other industries that require higher API security.</p>

 
 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 OpenID Foundation Working Groups and Financial-grade API Stack
 History 
<p>Implementer’s Draft 1&nbsp;— The initial version of the FAPI specification was published in 2017. The version is called Implementer’s Draft 1 (ID1).</p>
<p>Implementer’s&nbsp;Draft 2&nbsp;— The second version was published in October, 2018. The version is called Implementer’s Draft 2 (ID2). In this version, the FAPI specification was renamed from “Financial API” to “Financial-grade API” for wider adoption across various industries.</p>
<p>Final Version&nbsp;— The final version was published in March, 2021. In this version, the main two parts of the FAPI sepecification, “Part 1: Read-Only Security Profile” and “Part 2: Read and Write API Security Profile”, were renamed to “Part 1: Baseline Security Profile” and “Part 2: Advanced Security Profile”, respectively.</p>
<p>FAPI 2.0&nbsp;— The FAPI WG has started to discuss the next version of the FAPI specification, which is called “FAPI 2.0”. The&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/faq/">FAPI FAQ</a>&nbsp;published on March 31, 2021 (<a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/31/picking-up-speed-on-the-fapi-roadmap-from-the-fapi-rw-implementers-draft-2-to-fapi-1-0-advanced-final/">announcement</a>) mentions FAPI 2.0. Authlete is mentioned in the answer to the question “Are there FAPI 2.0 implementations?” because Authlete has already implemented new technical components of FAPI 2.0 such as&nbsp;PAR&nbsp;(<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-par/">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>),&nbsp;RAR&nbsp;(<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-rar/">OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests</a>) and&nbsp;DPoP&nbsp;(<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop/">OAuth 2.0 Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer</a>).</p>

 Prior Knowledge 
 Basic Specifications 
<p>The format of the FAPI specification is a terse list of technical requirements, so the document is not long. In exchange, a lot of prior knowledge is required to read it smoothly. Especially, you have to learn&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">RFC 6749</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750">RFC 6750</a>&nbsp;(the core of OAuth 2.0) and&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</a>&nbsp;(the core of OpenID Connect) by heart.</p>
<p>In addition, because specifications related to JWT (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515">JWS</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516">JWE</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517">JWK</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518">JWA</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">JWT</a>) are prior knowledge to understand OIDC Core, they are of course prior knowledge to read the FAPI specification. Therefore, you need to understand them perfectly.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 JWS Compact Serialization (RFC 7515 Section 7.1)
<p>Furthermore,&nbsp;PKCE&nbsp;(<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636">RFC 7636</a>) which was published in September, 2015 is now regarded as a part of the basic set of OAuth 2.0 specifications as well as RFC 6749 and RFC 6750.</p>
<p>The following is a list of specifications that you should read at least once before the FAPI specification.</p>

 Mutual TLS 
<p>In general, “Mutual TLS” means that a client is also required to present its X.509 certificate in a TLS connection. However, in the context of FAPI, Mutual TLS means the following two which are defined in “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>” (MTLS).</p>
 
 OAuth client authentication using a client certificate 
 Tokens bound to a client certificate 
 
 OAuth Client Authentication using a Client Certificate 
<p>When a&nbsp;confidential client&nbsp;(RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">2. Client Types</a>) accesses a token endpoint (RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.2">3.2. Token Endpoint</a>),&nbsp;client authentication&nbsp;(RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3">2.3. Client Authentication</a>) is required. Client authentication is a process where a client application proves it has its confidential authentication information.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication at Token Endpoint
<p>There are several ways for client authentication. The following are client authentication methods listed in OIDC Core,&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication">9. Client Authentication</a>&nbsp;(except&nbsp;<code>none</code>).</p>
 
 <code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;— Basic Authentication using a pair of client ID and client secret 
 <code>client_secret_post</code>&nbsp;— Embedding a pair of client ID and client secret in a request body 
 <code>client_secret_jwt</code>&nbsp;— Passing a JWT signed by a key based on a client secret with a symmetric algorithm 
 <code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;— Passing a JWT signed by a private key with an asymmetric algorithm 
 
<p>In&nbsp;<code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>client_secret_post</code>, a client application directly shows the server its client secret to prove that it has the confidential information.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Client Authentication using Basic Authentication
<p>In&nbsp;<code>client_secret_jwt</code>, a client application indirectly proves that it has the client secret by signing a JWT with the client secret and passing the JWT to the server. On the other hand, in&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>, signing is performed with an asymmetric private key and the server verifies the signature with the public key corresponding to the private key.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Client Authentication using JWT
<p>Apart from the above, “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-mutual-tls-for-oauth-client">2. Mutual TLS for OAuth Client Authentication</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>&nbsp;introduces new client authentication methods below.</p>
 
 <code>tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;— Utilizing a PKI client certificate used in a TLS connection 
 <code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;— Utilizing a self-signed client certificate used in a TLS connection 
 
<p>These two utilize the client certificate used in a TLS connection between the client and the token endpoint for client authentication.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Certificate for Client Authentication
<p>In&nbsp;<code>tls_client_auth</code>, the PKI client certificate used in a TLS connection established between a client and a server is used for client authentication. The server verifies the client certificate (this should be done even in a context irrelevant to OAuth) and then checks whether the Subject Distinguished Name or Subject Alternative Name matches the pre-registered one. For this process, client applications that want to use&nbsp;<code>tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;for client authentication must register Subject Distinguished Name or Subject Alternative Name into the server in advance. The specification newly defines the following client metadata for this purpose (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-client-registration-metadata">2.1.2 Client Registration Metadata</a>).</p>
 
 <code>tls_client_auth_subject_dn</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_dns</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_uri</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_ip</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_email</code> 
 
<p>In&nbsp;<code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>, a self-signed client certificate is used instead of a PKI client certificate. To use this client authentication method, client applications have to register a self-signed client certificate into the server in advance.</p>
<p>The following table is the list of client authentication methods mentioned in the FAPI specification.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication Methods
<p>For detailed explanation about client authentication, please read “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/oauth-2-0-client-authentication-4b5f929305d4">OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication</a>”. Also, if you are not familiar with X.509 certificate, please read “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/illustrated-x-509-certificate-84aece2c5c2e">Illustrated X.509 Certificate</a>”.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 X.509 Certificate Chain

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 X.509 Certificate in PEM Format
 Certificate-Bound Tokens 
<p>Once a traditional access token is leaked, an attacker can access APIs with the access token. Traditional access tokens are just like a train ticket which anyone can use once it is stolen.</p>
<p>An idea to mitigate this vulnerability is to check whether the API caller bringing an access token matches the legitimate holder of the access token when an API call is made. This is just like the boarding procedure for international flights where passengers are required to show not only a plane ticket but also their passport.</p>
<p>This idea is called “Proof of Possession” (PoP) and FAPI lists “Mutual TLS” as an only possible option of PoP ( — in the previous versions (ID1 &amp; ID2), “Token Binding” was mentioned as a PoP mechanim but it was dropped by the final version). In this context, “Mutual TLS” means the specification defined in “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-mutual-tls-client-certifica">3. Mutual-TLS Client Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>.</p>
<p>Because Mutual TLS has several meanings as explained above and I actually experienced a problematic conversation like below,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: The API management solution of your company does not support Mutual TLS (as a PoP mechanism).<br>
The company: Not correct. Our solution supports Mutual TLS (because it can be configured to request a client certificate for TLS communication).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve personally decided to call Mutual TLS as a PoP mechanism “Certificate Binding”. This naming is not so bad (at least for me) because it sounds symmetrical to Token Binding and because actual implementations will eventually become just binding a certificate to an access token and won’t care whether the certificate has been extracted from a mutual TLS connection or has come from somewhere else.</p>
<p>In an implementation of Certificate Binding, when the token endpoint of an authorization server issues an access token, it calculates the hash value of the client certificate presented by the client application in the TLS connection and remembers the binding between the access token and the hash value (or embeds the hash value into the access token if the implementation of the access token is a self-contained JWT). When the client application accesses an API of the target resource server, it uses the same client certificate that was previously used in the communication with the token endpoint. The implementation of the API extracts an access token and a client certificate from the request, calculates the hash value of the client certificate and checks the hash value matches the one that is associated with the access token. If they match, the API implementation accepts the request. If not, it rejects the request.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Certificate Binding
<p>It is relatively easy to implement Certificate Binding because it can be implemented only if the client certificate is accessible. On the other hand, Token Binding is relatively hard because it is necessary to modify multiple layers such as TLS layer and HTTP layer. In addition, the future is uncertain as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5097603234529280">Chrome has removed the Token Binding feature</a>&nbsp;although the community strongly tried to urge Chrome team to rethink it (“<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/OkdLUyYmY1E">Intent to Remove: Token Binding</a>”). However, anyway, related specifications were promoted to RFCs at the beginning of October, 2018.</p>
 
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8471">RFC 8471&nbsp;</a>— The Token Binding Protocol Version 1.0 
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8472">RFC 8472</a>&nbsp;— Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extension for Token Binding Protocol Negotiation 
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8473">RFC 8473</a>&nbsp;— Token Binding over HTTP 
 
<p>“<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-token-binding/?include_text=1">OAuth 2.0 Token Binding</a>” (its status is “expired”) is a specification that defines rules to apply Token Binding to OAuth 2.0 tokens based on the specifications listed above.</p>
<p>NOTE: The final version of the FAPI specification dropped Token Binding due to its unlikeliness of future availability.</p>
 JARM 
<p>JARM&nbsp;is a new specification which was approved at the same timing with FAPI Implementer’s Draft 2. JARM is referred to in FAPI Part 2.</p>
 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-jarm-ID1.html">Financial-grade API: JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode for OAuth 2.0 (JARM)</a> 
 
<p>The specification defines new values for the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;request parameter as shown below.</p>
 
 <code>query.jwt</code> 
 <code>fragment.jwt</code> 
 <code>form_post.jwt</code> 
 <code>jwt</code> 
 
<p>If one of the above is specified, response parameters of an authorization response are packed into a JWT and the JWT is returned as the value of a single&nbsp;<code>response</code>&nbsp;response parameter.</p>
<p>For example, a traditional authorization response in the authorization code flow looks like below.&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;response parameters are included separately.</p>
 HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://client.com/callback?code={CODE}&amp;state={STATE} 
<p>On the other hand, if&nbsp;<code>response_mode=query.jwt</code>&nbsp;is added to an authorization request, the authorization response will become like below.</p>
 HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://client.com/callback?response={JWT} 

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 JARM example
<p>Because the JWT is signed by a key of the server, a client can confirm that the response has not been tampered by verifying the signature of the JWT.</p>
<p>Client Metadata for JARM</p>
<p>Before using JARM, client applications have to set a value to the&nbsp;<code>authorization_signed_response_alg</code>&nbsp;metadata in advance. The metadata represents an algorithm for signature of response JWTs. If the value of the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;request parameter is&nbsp;<code>*.jwt</code>&nbsp;although the metadata is not set, the authorization request fails because the specification requires response JWTs be always signed.</p>
<p>To encrypt response JWTs, algorithms have to be set in advance to the&nbsp;<code>authorization_encrypted_response_alg</code>&nbsp;metadata and the&nbsp;<code>authorization_encrypted_response_enc</code>&nbsp;metadata. To use an asymmetric algorithm, configuration about client’s public key is necessary, too.</p>
<p>The screenshot below is client-side settings for JARM in Authlete’s web console that is provided for client management.</p>

 Part 1: Baseline 
<p>As introduction of prior knowledge was done, let’s start the main part of this article. To begin with, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html">Part 1</a>” which defines baseline security profile.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Authorization Server 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#authorization-server">5.2.2. Authorization server</a>” in “Part 1” lists requirements for authorization server. Let’s take a look one by one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 1.</p>
<p>shall support confidential clients;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 2.</p>
<p>should support public clients;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The definition of “confidential clients” and “public clients” is described in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">2.1. Client Types</a>” of RFC 6749. I don’t explain the difference between the client types here as it is prior knowledge for those who read the FAPI specification. However, the relationship between client types and OAuth 2.0 flows is often misunderstood even by those who are familiar with OAuth 2.0. It is only the combination of a “public client” and “client credentials flow” that RFC 6749 explicitly prohibits. Other combinations are allowed. Without this understanding, you would misread the FAPI specification.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Combinations of Flow and Client Type (RFC 6749)
<p>Just FYI. It is confidential clients only that are allowed to make backchannel authentication requests which are defined in CIBA.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Combinations of Flow and Client Type (CIBA)
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 3.</p>
<p>shall provide a client secret that adheres to the requirements in section 16.19 of OIDC if a symmetric key is used;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OIDC Core states that a value calculated based on a client secret must be used as the shared key when a symmetric algorithm is used for signing and encryption. If the entropy of the client secret is lower than the one required by the algorithm, the strength of the algorithm is weakened. Therefore, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SymmetricKeyEntropy">16.19. Symmetric Key Entropy</a>” requires that client secrets have entropy strong enough for used algorithms. For example, when&nbsp;<code>HS256</code>&nbsp;(HMAC using SHA-256) is used for signing algorithm of ID tokens, client secrets must have 256-bit entropy at minimum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 4.</p>
<p>shall authenticate the confidential client using one of the following methods:</p>
<p>1. Mutual TLS for OAuth Client Authentication as specified in section 2 of MTLS;</p>
<p>2.<code>client_secret_jwt</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;as specified in section 9 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that&nbsp;<code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>client_secret_post</code> defined in RFC 6749 are not allowed as client authentication methods at the token endpoint.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication Methods allowed in FAPI Part 1
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 5.</p>
<p>shall require and use a key of size 2048 bits or larger for RSA algorithms;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 6.</p>
<p>shall require and use a key of size 160 bits or larger for elliptic curve algorithms;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, when&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;is used as client authentication method and RSA is used for signing the JWT, the key size must be 2048 or bigger. Likewise, when an elliptic curve algorithm is used, the key size must be 160 at minimum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 7.</p>
<p>shall require RFC7636 with&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is required to implement RFC 7636 (PKCE) which is a countermeasure for “authorization code interception attack”.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Authorization Code Interception Attack
<p>RFC 7636 has added&nbsp;<code>code_challenge</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method</code>&nbsp;request parameters to the authorization request and&nbsp;<code>code_verifier</code>&nbsp;request parameter to the token request. Because the default value of&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method</code>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<code>plain</code>, authorization requests that comply with FAPI must include&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method=S256</code>&nbsp;explicitly.</p>
<p>See “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/developers/pkce/">Proof Key for Code Exchange (RFC 7636)</a>” for details about PKCE.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 8.</p>
<p>shall require redirect URIs to be pre-registered;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, registration of redirect URIs is not required under some conditions. For FAPI, registration of redirect URIs is always required.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 9.</p>
<p>shall require the&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter in the authorization request;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, the&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;request parameter of an authorization request can be omitted under some conditions. For FAPI, the request parameter must be always included. OIDC has the same requirement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 10.</p>
<p>shall require the value of&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;to exactly match one of the pre-registered redirect URIs;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When an authorization server checks whether the value of the&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;request parameter matches a pre-registered one, the rule described in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6">6. Normalization and Comparison</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">RFC 3986</a>&nbsp;(Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax) is applied unless the pre-registered one is an absolute URI. On the other hand, FAPI (and OIDC also) requires that simple string comparison be always used to check whether the redirect URIs match.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 11.</p>
<p>shall require user authentication to an appropriate Level of Assurance for the operations the client will be authorized to perform on behalf of the user;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is required that user authentication performed during authorization process satisfy an appropriate level of assurance. ID1 and ID2 required LoA (Level of Assurance) 2, which is defined in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.1254">X.1254</a>&nbsp;(Entity authentication assurance framework. However, the Final version made the requirement more abstract (= changed the requirement from “LoA2” to “appropriate LoA”).</p>
<p>FYI: The following is the definition of LoA 2 described in “6.2 Level of assurance 2 (LoA2)” of X.1254.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At LoA2, there is some confidence in the claimed or asserted identity of the entity. This LoA is used when moderate risk is associated with erroneous authentication. Single-factor authentication is acceptable. Successful authentication shall be dependent upon the entity proving, through a secure authentication protocol, that the entity has control of the credential. Controls should be in place to reduce the effectiveness of eavesdroppers and online guessing attacks. Controls shall be in place to protect against attacks on stored credentials.</p>
<p>For example, a service provider might operate a website that enables its customers to change their address of record. The transaction in which a beneficiary changes an address of record may be considered an LoA2 authentication transaction, as the transaction may involve a moderate risk of inconvenience. Since official notices regarding payment amounts, account status, and records of changes are usually sent to the beneficiary’s address of record, the transaction additionally entails moderate risk of unauthorized release of PII. As a result, the service provider should obtain at least some authentication assurance before allowing this transaction to take place.</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 12.</p>
<p>shall require explicit approval by the user to authorize the requested scope if it has not been previously authorized;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 13.</p>
<p>shall reject an authorization code (Section 1.3.1 of RFC6749) if it has been previously used;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prohibiting reuse of authorization codes and ensuring that authorization codes have never been used previously are different things. If the current implementation of an authorization server uses randomly-generated strings as authorization codes and removes them from the database after they are used, the authorization codes have to be kept in the database even after they are used just only for the verification. If strings that represent authorization codes are generated randomly with high enough entropy, it is wasteful to keep authorization codes in the database even after their use. A certain famous engineer says&nbsp;“Most implementations prevent reuse of authorization codes by deleting corresponding database records and don’t check if they have been used previously, and such implementations are sufficient enough.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 14.</p>
<p>shall return token responses that conform to Section 4.1.4 of RFC6749;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a FAPI-specific requirement. Every authorization server implementation that claims it supports OAuth 2.0 must conform to&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.4">Section 4.1.4</a>&nbsp;of RFC 6749.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 15.</p>
<p>shall return the list of granted scopes with the issued access token if the request was passed in the front channel and was not integrity protected;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;response parameter can be omitted unless requested scopes and granted ones are different (RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-5.1">5.1. Successful Response</a>). In FAPI, the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;response parameter is required (even if the requested scopes and granted ones are equal) if the authorization request is passed in the front channel and is not integrity protected.</p>
<p>“Integrity protected” here means that a Request Object (OIDC Core&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests">Section 6</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-jwsreq/">JAR</a>) is used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 16.</p>
<p>shall provide non-guessable access tokens, authorization codes, and refresh token (where applicable), with sufficient entropy such that the probability of an attacker guessing the generated token is computationally infeasible as per RFC 6749 Section 10.10;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ID2 requires that access tokens have a minimum of 128 bits of entropy, but the Final version avoids mentioning the exact size of the minimum entropy and just says “sufficient entropy”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 17.</p>
<p>should clearly identify the details of the grant to the user during authorization as in 16.18 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suppose that a client application requests&nbsp;<code>payment</code>&nbsp;scope. A typical authorization page will tell the user just that the client application is requesting the&nbsp;<code>payment</code>&nbsp;scope. However, recent regulations in financial industries require that details be explained to the user. For example, information about the purpose of the&nbsp;<code>payment</code>&nbsp;scope, the amount of money transferred, and so on. Generally speaking, recent regulations require that grant be more specific.</p>
<p>UK Open Banking has invented “Lodging Intent” for the purpose. In the mechanism, (a) a client application registers details of grant it wants into an authorization server in advance, (b) the authorization server issues an intent ID that represents the registered details, and (c) the client makes an authorization request with the intent ID. As a result, the authorization server can generate an authorization page which includes the details of the authorization request.</p>
<p>To make the lodging intent pattern available as standards, OpenID Foundation has developed two separate specifications; “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-par/">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>” (PAR) and “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-rar/">OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests</a>” (RAR). These specifications will be mentioned again later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 18.</p>
<p>should provide a mechanism for the end-user to revoke access tokens and refresh tokens granted to a client as in 16.18 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that,&nbsp;if the format of access tokens is self-contained-type (e.g. JWT), the access tokens cannot be revoked&nbsp;unless the system implements and operates a mechanism like&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list">CRL</a>&nbsp;(Certificate Revocation List) or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol">OCSP</a>&nbsp;(Online Certificate Status Protocol) of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">PKI</a>&nbsp;(Public Key Infrastructure). If the system does not provide such mechanism, it means that the system has decided to give up revocation of access tokens. In this case, the duration of access tokens must be short enough to mitigate damage of access token leakage. See “<a href="https://medium.com/@darutk/oauth-access-token-implementation-30c2e8b90ff0">OAuth Access Token Implementation</a>” for further discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 19.</p>
<p>shall return an&nbsp;<code>invalid_client</code>&nbsp;error as defined in 5.2 of RFC6749 when mis-matched client identifiers were provided through the client authentication methods that permits sending the client identifier in more than one way;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FAPI Part 1 requires MTLS (<code>tls_client_auth</code>,&nbsp;<code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>) or JWT (<code>client_secret_jwt</code>,&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>) for client authentication.</p>
<p>MTLS uses a client certificate but a certificate does not include the client identifier of the client which tries to authenticate itself with the certificate. Therefore, the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter needs to be given explicitly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, JWT-based client authentication methods present a JWT as the value of the&nbsp;<code>client_assertion</code>&nbsp;request parameter and the JWT contains the client identifier as the value of the&nbsp;<code>iss</code>&nbsp;claim. Therefore, the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter is not necessary. In addition, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523">RFC 7523</a>, 3. and OIDC Core, 9., the&nbsp;<code>sub</code> claim also holds the client identifier when a JWT is used for client authentication.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 JWT-based Client Authentication and Client Identifiers
<p>In MTLS, it is only the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter that represents a client identifier. On the other hand, in JWT-based client authentication, both the&nbsp;<code>iss</code>&nbsp;claim and the&nbsp;<code>sub</code>&nbsp;claim hold a client identifier. The values of the claims must match. Also, if the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter is redundantly given although JWT-based client authentication is used, the value of the request parameter must match the client identifier, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 20.</p>
<p>shall require redirect URIs to use the&nbsp;<code>https</code>&nbsp;scheme;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentence added by FAPI Implementer’s Draft 2 is short but has a big impact. Because of this sentence, developers&nbsp;cannot use custom schemes in FAPI&nbsp;any more. To process redirection on client side only without preparing an external Web server, developers have to use the method described in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.2">7.2. Claimed “https” Scheme URI Redirection</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212">BCP 212</a>&nbsp;(OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 21.</p>
<p>should issue access tokens with a lifetime of under 10 minutes unless the tokens are sender-constrained; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement was added by the FAPI Final version. “sender-constrained” here means that access tokens have to be bound to a client certificate (MTLS).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 22.</p>
<p>shall support OIDD, may support RFC8414 and shall not distribute discovery metadata (such as the authorization endpoint) by any other means.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement was added by the FAPI Final version. OIDD here is short for “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0</a>”. Therefore, authorization servers for FAPI must implement a “discovery endpoint” which is defined in OIDD&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig">Section 4</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier</p>
<p>Further, if it is desired to provide the authenticated user’s identifier to the client in the token response, the authorization server:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 5.2.2.1. lists requirements that an authorization server must follow when the authenticated user’s identifier is requested. In other words, when an ID token is requested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 1.</p>
<p>shall support the authentication request as in Section 3.1.2.1 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest">3.1.2.1. Authentication Request</a>” of OIDC Core is the definition of a request to an authorization endpoint in the context of OpenID Connect. RFC 6749 calls a request to an authorization endpoint “authorization request”. OIDC Core calls it “authentication request”. Aside from the names, considering that the specification of an authorization endpoint is the main part of OIDC Core, the FAPI’s requirement is almost equal to stating&nbsp;“shall support OIDC Core”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 2.</p>
<p>shall perform the authentication request verification as in Section 3.1.2.2 of OIDC;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 3.</p>
<p>shall authenticate the user as in Section 3.1.2.2 and 3.1.2.3 of OIDC;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 4.</p>
<p>shall provide the authentication response as in Section 3.1.2.4 and 3.1.2.5 of OIDC depending on the outcome of the authentication;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 5.</p>
<p>shall perform the token request verification as in Section 3.1.3.2 of OIDC; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 6.</p>
<p>shall issue an ID Token in the token response when&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;was included in the requested&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;as in Section 3.1.3.3 of OIDC with its&nbsp;<code>sub</code>&nbsp;value corresponding to the authenticated user and optional&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;value in ID Token.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summary of the requirements above is&nbsp;“shall follow OIDC Core specification.”&nbsp;Nothing special for FAPI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.2. Client requesting openid scope</p>
<p>If the client requests the&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;scope, the authorization server</p>
<p>1. shall require the&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in Section 3.1.2.1 of OIDC in the authentication request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OIDC&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest">Section 3.1.2.1</a>&nbsp;(Authorization Code Flow) states that&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;is optional. On the other hand, OIDC&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitAuthRequest">Section 3.2.2.1</a>&nbsp;(Implicit Flow) states that&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;is mandatory.</p>
<p>The FAPI requirement above requires&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;even in the authorization code flow if&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;is included in&nbsp;<code>scope</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.3. Clients not requesting openid scope</p>
<p>If the client does not requests the&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;scope, the authorization server</p>
<p>1. shall require the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in Section 4 of RFC6749</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter is optional. FAPI makes the parameter mandatory when&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;is not included in&nbsp;<code>scope</code>.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Public Client 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#public-client">5.2.3. Public client</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for public clients. Let’s take a look one by one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 1.</p>
<p>shall support RFC7636;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>RFC 7636 is PKCE.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 2.</p>
<p>shall use&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method for the RFC7636;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means&nbsp;“an authorization request must include&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method=S256</code>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 3.</p>
<p>shall use separate and distinct redirect URI for each authorization server that it talks to;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 4.</p>
<p>shall store the redirect URI value in the resource owner’s user-agents (such as browser) session and compare it with the redirect URI that the authorization response was received at, where, if the URIs do not match, the client shall terminate the process with error;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These requirements are so clear that further explanation is not needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 5.</p>
<p>(withdrawn); and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“(withdrawn)” here indicates that the requirement which existed in the previous FAPI versions has been withdrawn. You’ll see more “withdrawn”s in following sections, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 6.</p>
<p>shall implement an effective CSRF protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In normal cases, CSRF protection is implemented on server side. What is CSRF protection as a requirement for public clients? This is CSRF protection for redirect URIs. The following is an excerpt from “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12">10.12. Cross-Site Request Forgery</a>” of RFC 6749.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The client MUST implement CSRF protection for its redirection URI. This is typically accomplished by requiring any request sent to the redirection URI endpoint to include a value that binds the request to the user-agent’s authenticated state (e.g., a hash of the session cookie used to authenticate the user-agent). The client SHOULD utilize the “state” request parameter to deliver this value to the authorization server when making an authorization request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the requirements from “Public client, 1” to “Public client, 6”, “if it is desired to obtain a persistent identifier of the authenticated user”, that is, if an ID token is requested, an authorization request by a public client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 7.</p>
<p>shall include&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;value; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 8.</p>
<p>shall include the&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in Section 3.1.2.1 of OIDC in the authentication request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, “If&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;is not in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;value”, an authorization request by a public client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 9.</p>
<p>shall include the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in section 4.1.1 of RFC6749;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 10.</p>
<p>shall verify that the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;received in the token response is either an exact match, or contains a subset of the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;sent in the authorization request; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 11.</p>
<p>shall only use Authorization Server metadata obtained from the metadata document published by the Authorization Server at its well known endpoint as defined in OIDD or RFC 8414.</p>
</blockquote>
 Part 1: Requirements for Confidential Client 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#confidential-client">5.2.4. Confidential client</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for confidential clients. The requirements are positioned as additions to the requirements for public clients. Therefore, confidential clients must follow not only the requirements in 5.2.4 but also the requirements in 5.2.3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 1.</p>
<p>shall support the following methods to authenticate against the token endpoint:</p>
<p>1. Mutual TLS for OAuth Client Authentication as specified in Section 2 of MTLS, and</p>
<p>2.<code>client_secret_jwt</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;as specified in Section 9 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that client authentication methods defined in RFC 6749 (<code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>client_secret_post</code>) cannot be used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 2.</p>
<p>shall use RSA keys with a minimum 2048 bits if using RSA cryptography;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 3.</p>
<p>shall use elliptic curve keys with a minimum of 160 bits if using Elliptic Curve cryptography; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 4.</p>
<p>shall verify that its client secret has a minimum of 128 bits if using symmetric key cryptography.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These requirements apply when encrypted JWTs are used.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Protected Resources 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#protected-resources-provisions">6.2.1. Protected resources provisions</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for protected resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 1.</p>
<p>shall support the use of the HTTP GET method as in Section 4.3.1 of RFC7231;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 2.</p>
<p>shall accept access tokens in the HTTP header as in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage RFC6750;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, protected resource endpoints must support HTTP&nbsp;<code>GET</code>&nbsp;method and be able to accept an access token in the format of&nbsp;<code>Authorization: Bearer&nbsp;{AccessToken}</code>.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Request to Protected Resource Endpoint
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 3.</p>
<p>shall not accept access tokens in the query parameters stated in Section 2.3 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage RFC6750;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, protected resource endpoints must not accept a query parameter in the format of&nbsp;<code>access_token={AccessToken}</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 4.</p>
<p>shall verify that the access token is neither expired nor revoked;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 5.</p>
<p>shall verify that the scope associated with the access token authorizes access to the resource it is representing;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 6.</p>
<p>shall identify the associated entity to the access token;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 7.</p>
<p>shall only return the resource identified by the combination of the entity implicit in the access and the granted scope and otherwise return errors as in Section 3.1 of RFC6750;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are general steps of access token verification that protected resource endpoints are expected to take.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-3.1">3.1. Error Codes</a>” of RFC 6750 defines three error codes. They are&nbsp;<code>invalid_request</code>,&nbsp;<code>invalid_token</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>insufficient_scope</code>. One point those who are not familiar with RFC 6750 may feel strange is that an error code is embedded not in the response body but in the&nbsp;<code>WWW-Authenticate</code> HTTP header.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 RFC 6750 Error Response
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 8.</p>
<p>shall encode the response in UTF-8 if applicable;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 9.</p>
<p>shall send the&nbsp;<code>Content-type</code>&nbsp;HTTP header&nbsp;<code>Content-Type: application/json;&nbsp;</code>if applicable;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Protected resource endpoints in FAPI are expected to return their responses in JSON format.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 10.</p>
<p>shall send the server date in HTTP&nbsp;<code>Date</code>&nbsp;header as in Section 7.1.1.2 of RFC7231;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The format of&nbsp;<code>Date</code>&nbsp;header is defined in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.1">7.1.1.1. Date/Time Formats</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231">RFC 7231</a>. Below is an example.</p>
 Date: Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT 
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 11.</p>
<p>shall set the response header&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;to the value received from the corresponding FAPI client request header or to a RFC4122 UUID value if the request header was not provided to track the interaction, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id: c770aef3-6784-41f7-8e0e-ff5f97bddb3a</code>;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a requirement specific to FAPI. Responses from FAPI protected resource endpoints must include an&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;header.</p>
<p>When an incoming request has&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>, the same value of the header must be included in the response. Otherwise, the protected resource endpoint must generate a new value for&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 12.</p>
<p>shall log the value of&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;in the log entry; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is also specific to FAPI. This requirement doesn’t have any impact on request and response formats, but this can make it easy to correlate server-side logs and client-side logs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 13.</p>
<p>shall not reject requests with a&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address</code>&nbsp;header containing a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 14.</p>
<p>should support the use of Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) [CORS] and or other methods as appropriate to enable JavaScript clients to access the endpoint if it decides to provide access to JavaScript clients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, if a protected resource endpoint wants to allow JavaScript clients to access it from anywhere, the endpoint should include an&nbsp;<code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>&nbsp;header in responses.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Clients to Protected Resources 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#client-provisions">6.2.2. Client provisions</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for clients to follow in accessing protected resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 1.</p>
<p>shall send access tokens in the HTTP header as in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage RFC6750; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, clients send an access token in the format of&nbsp;<code>Authorization: Bearer&nbsp;{AccessToken}</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 2.</p>
<p>(withdrawn);</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 3.</p>
<p>may send the last time the customer logged into the client in the&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-auth-date</code>&nbsp;header where the value is supplied as a HTTP-date as in Section 7.1.1.1 of RFC7231, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-auth-date: Tue, 11 Sep 2012 19:43:31 GMT</code>;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 4.</p>
<p>may send the customer’s IP address if this data is available in the&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address</code>&nbsp;header, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address: 2001:DB8::1893:25c8:1946</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address: 198.51.100.119</code>; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 5.</p>
<p>may send the&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;request header, in which case the value shall be a RFC4122 UUID to the server to help correlate log entries between client and server, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id: c770aef3-6784-41f7-8e0e-ff5f97bddb3a</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are FAPI-specific HTTP headers. It is up to clients whether to send the headers or not.</p>

 Part 1: Security Considerations 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#security-considerations">7. Security considerations</a>” of “Part 1” lists security considerations. Summary is as follows.</p>
<p>7.1.&nbsp;— Follow&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp195">BCP 195</a>. Use TLS 1.2 or newer. Follow&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125">RFC 6125</a>.</p>

<p>7.3.&nbsp;— Part 1 doesn’t assure message integrity of authorization request.</p>
<p>7.4.1.&nbsp;— Part 1 doesn’t discuss encryption of authorization request.</p>
<p>7.4.2.&nbsp;— Be careful not to leak information through logs.</p>
<p>7.4.3.&nbsp;— Be careful not to leak information through referrer. Make duration of access tokens short.</p>
<p>7.5.&nbsp;— Native applications shall follow&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212">BCP 212</a>&nbsp;but must not support “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.1">Private-Use URI Scheme Redirection</a>” and “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.3">Loopback Interface Redirection</a>”. They must use&nbsp;<code>https</code>&nbsp;for the scheme of redirect URI as introduced in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.2">Claimed https Scheme URI Redirection</a>”.</p>
<p>7.6.&nbsp;— Both FAPI implementation and underlying OAuth/OIDC implementation must be complete and correct. See&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID Certification</a>.</p>
<p>7.7.&nbsp;— Use a separate&nbsp;<code>issuer</code>&nbsp;per brand if multiple brands need to be supported.</p>
<p>“Part 2” provides solutions for security considerations listed in “Part 1”, for example, by making “request object” mandatory. “Part 2” is recommended when higher security than “Part 1” is needed.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Part 2: Advanced 
<p>Next, let’s read “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html">Part 2</a>” which defines advanced security profile.</p>
 Detached Signature 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#id-token-as-detached-signature">5.1.1. ID Token as Detached Signature</a>” of “Part 2” states that it uses “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken">ID token</a>” as “detached signature”.</p>
<p>An ID token is signed by an authorization server, so even if an attacker tampered the content of the ID token, it could be detected. A client application that has received an ID token can confirm that the ID token has not been tampered by verifying the signature of the ID token.</p>
<p>If an authorization server embeds hash values of response parameters (such as&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>state</code>) into an ID token, a client application can confirm that the values of the response parameters have not been tampered by computing hash values of the response parameter values and comparing them to the hash values embedded in the ID token. In the context, the ID token is regarded as a detached signature.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 ID Token as Detached Signature
<p>For the&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;response parameter that represents an authorization code,&nbsp;<code>c_hash</code>&nbsp;has already been defined in OIDC Core as a claim that represents the hash value of&nbsp;<code>code</code>. Likewise,&nbsp;<code>at_hash</code>&nbsp;has been defined as a claim that represents the hash value of&nbsp;<code>access_token</code>.</p>
<p>What is missing is a claim that represents the hash value of the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;response parameter. So, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#id-token-as-detached-signature">5.1.1. ID Token as Detached Signature</a>” defines&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;for that purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>s_hash<br>
State hash value. Its value is the base64url encoding of the left-most half of the hash of the octets of the ASCII representation of the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;value, where the hash algorithm used is the hash algorithm used in the&nbsp;<code>alg</code>&nbsp;header parameter of the ID Token’s JOSE header. For instance, if the&nbsp;<code>alg</code>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<code>HS512</code>, hash the state value with SHA-512, then take the left-most 256 bits and base64url encode them. The&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;value is a case sensitive string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because “Part 2” uses ID tokens as detached signatures, even if client applications don’t need ID tokens in their application layer, they have to send authorization requests that require an ID token. To be exact, they have to include&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter. This is the reason that the second requirement in “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#authorization-server">5.2.2. Authorization Server</a>” is saying&nbsp;“shall require the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;values&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>”.</p>
<p>However, since Implementer’s Draft 2,&nbsp;ID tokens don’t have to be used as detached signatures when JARM is used. It is because the entire set of response parameters is packed into a JWT.</p>
 Part 2: Requirements for Authorization Server 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#authorization-server">5.2.2. Authorization server</a>” of “Part 2” lists requirements for authorization server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 1.</p>
<p>shall require a JWS signed JWT request object passed by value with the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter or by reference with the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameters are defined in “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests">6. Passing Request Parameters as JWTs</a>” of OIDC Core. To use these parameters, the first step is&nbsp;to pack request parameters into a JWT. This JWT is called “request object”. An authorization request (1) passes the request object as the value of the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter directly or (2) puts the request object somewhere accessible from the authorization server and passes the URI pointing to the location as the value of the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code> parameter.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Passing a Request Object by Value
<p>Signing a request object is not mandatory in OIDC Core, but signing is mandatory in FAPI Part 2. If request objects are signed, authorization servers can confirm that the request parameters have not been tampered by verifying signatures of the request objects.</p>
<p>To be honest, what surprised me most when I read the FAPI specification for the first time (many years ago) is this requirement. It’s because I knew from my experience it is hard to implement the request object feature on authorization server side. As the feature is hard to implement and optional in OIDC, there are many authorization server implementations that claim they support OIDC but don’t support request object.&nbsp;Be careful not to choose an authorization server implementation that doesn’t support request object if you want to build a system that supports FAPI Part 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 2.</p>
<p>shall require</p>
<p>1. the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;values&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>, or</p>
<p>2. the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;in conjunction with the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>jwt</code>;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To use ID token as detached signature, even if an ID token is not needed in the application layer,&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;must be included in the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter.</p>
<p>But, as mentioned in the previous section,&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;doesn’t have to be included in the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter when JARM is used. “When JARM is used” is, to be concrete, “when the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;request parameter is included and its value is one of&nbsp;<code>query.jwt</code>,&nbsp;<code>fragment.jwt</code>,&nbsp;<code>form_post.jwt</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>jwt</code>”.</p>
<p>NOTE: ID2 requires that&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;be either&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>code id_token token</code>&nbsp;when JARM is not used, but the Final version has removed&nbsp;<code>code id_token token</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 3.</p>
<p>(moved to 5.2.2.1);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 4.</p>
<p>(moved to 5.2.2.1);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 5.</p>
<p>shall only issue sender-constrained access tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In ID2, this clause was&nbsp;“shall only issue authorization code, access token, and refresh token that are holder of key bound;”. However, because the requirement was impractical, it was changed to the current one. See&nbsp;<a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/202">FAPI Issue 202</a>&nbsp;for details if you are interested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 6.</p>
<p>shall support MTLS as mechanism for constraining the legitimate senders of access tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In ID2, this clause was&nbsp;“shall support [OAUTB] or [MTLS] as a holder of key mechanisms;”. However, OAUTB (Token Binding) was removed from the Final version due to its unlikeliness of future availability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 7.</p>
<p>(withdrawn);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 8.</p>
<p>(moved to 5.2.2.1);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 9.</p>
<p>(moved to 5.2.2.1);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 10.</p>
<p>shall only use the parameters included in the signed request object passed via the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;</p>
<p>shall require that all parameters are present inside the signed request object passed in the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In ID2, this requirement was&nbsp;“shall require that all parameters are present inside the signed request object passed in the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;”. The expression was changed but the point remains the same. A request object must include all request parameters to conform to FAPI Part 2.</p>
<p>This is different from OIDC Core which allows request parameters to be put inside or outside a request object and merges them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 11.</p>
<p>may support the pushed authorization request endpoint as described in PAR;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “pushed authorization request endpoint” is a new endpoint defined in “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-par/">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>” (PAR). A client application can register an authorization request at the endpoint and obtain a&nbsp;Request URI&nbsp;which represents the registered authorization request. The client specifies the issued Request URI as the value of the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;request parameter when sending an authorization request to the authorization endpoint.</p>
<p>The following diagram excerpted from “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/illustrated-par-oauth-2-0-pushed-authorization-requests-652d71ed5cfb">Illustrated PAR: OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>” shows the authorization code flow which utilizes the pushed authorization request endpoint.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Authorization Code Flow with Pushed Authorization Request Endpoint
<p>HISTORY:&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-ID2.html#request-object-endpoint">The 7th section of ID2</a>&nbsp;showed an idea about pre-registration of an authorization request. The section named the endpoint for the pre-registration “request object endpoint”. The specification of PAR was developed based on the idea. As a result, the FAPI Final version has withdrawn the 7th section.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 12.</p>
<p>(withdrawn)</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 13.</p>
<p>shall require the request object to contain an&nbsp;<code>exp</code>&nbsp;claim that has a lifetime of no longer than 60 minutes after the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OIDC Core does not require that request objects include the&nbsp;<code>exp</code>&nbsp;claim. In contrast, FAPI Part 2 requires&nbsp;<code>exp</code>&nbsp;as a mandatory claim.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Final version has added a requirement&nbsp;“a lifetime of no longer than 60 minutes after the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim”. Because of this requirement, the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim has become mandatory.</p>
<p>The new requirement is a breaking change from a viewpoint of client applications because authorization servers now reject authorization requests whose request object does not include the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim. As a matter of fact, some test cases in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite">conformance suite</a>&nbsp;had to be updated for the new requirement.</p>
<p>Authorization server implementations may provide a mechanism to mitigate the impact of the breaking change. For example, Authlete has defined&nbsp;<code><a href="https://authlete.github.io/authlete-java-common/com/authlete/common/dto/Service.html#isNbfOptional--">Service.nbfOptional</a></code>&nbsp;flag that indicates whether the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code> claim in the request object is optional even when the authorization request is regarded as a FAPI-Part2 request. The value of the flag can be changed by “nbf Claim” in the Service Owner Console.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Service Configuration: nbf Claim
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 14.</p>
<p>shall authenticate the confidential client using one of the following methods (this overrides FAPI Security Profile 1.0 – Part 1: clause 5.2.2-4):</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<code>tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;as specified in section 2 of MTLS, or</p>
<p>2.<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;as specified in section 9 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that&nbsp;<code>client_secret_jwt</code> is not allowed in Part 2. This is different from Part 1.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication Methods in FAPI
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 15.</p>
<p>shall return the&nbsp;<code>aud</code>&nbsp;claim in the request object to be, or to be an array containing, the OP’s Issuer Identifier URL;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement was added by the Final version. Client applications have to put the&nbsp;<code>aud</code>&nbsp;claim in request objects. The value of&nbsp;“OP’s Issuer Identifier URL”&nbsp;can be found in the discovery document as the value of the&nbsp;<code>issuer</code>&nbsp;metadata (cf. OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0,&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata">3. OpenID Provider Metadata</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 16.</p>
<p>shall not support public clients;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement is a new one added by the Final version, but it is said that it has been logically impossible to support public clients in the context of FAPI Part 2 since older FAPI versions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 17.</p>
<p>shall require the request object to contain an&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim that is no longer than 60 minutes in the past; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 13th requirement implies that the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim is mandatory. This 17th requirement states it explicitly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 18.</p>
<p>shall require PAR requests, if supported, to use PKCE (RFC7636) with&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“PAR” here is “OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature</p>
<p>In addition, if the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>value&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>&nbsp;is used, the authorization server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 5.2.2.1. lists requirements for authorization servers which are applied when an ID token is used as a detached signature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 1.</p>
<p>shall support OIDC;</p>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 2.</p>
<p>shall support signed ID Tokens;</p>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 3.</p>
<p>should support signed and encrypted ID Tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a viewpoint of OIDC, these requirements are not new. By definition, ID tokens are always signed. Encryption of ID tokens is optional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 4.</p>
<p>shall return ID Token as a detached signature to the authorization response;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requires that an authorization server issue an ID token, but because the condition written at the top of Section 5.2.2.1 requires that&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;be included in&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;and so an ID token is issued as a general consequence, this requirement doesn’t have to exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 5.</p>
<p>shall include state hash,&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>, in the ID Token to protect the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;value if the client supplied a value for&nbsp;<code>state</code>.&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;may be omitted from the ID Token returned from the Token Endpoint when&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;is present in the ID Token returned from the Authorization Endpoint; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When JARM is used, this requirement doesn’t have to be followed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 6.</p>
<p>should not return sensitive PII in the ID Token in the authorization response, but if it needs to, then it should encrypt the ID Token.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PII is short for “Personally Identifiable Information”.</p>
<p>The feature of ID token encryption has existed since OIDC Core. When the encryption algorithm for ID tokens is an asymmetric one, the authorization server must either (1) manage public keys of client applications directly in its database or (2) fetch JWK Set documents from the locations pointed to by clients’&nbsp;<code>jwks_uri</code>&nbsp;metadata and extract public keys from the documents.</p>
<p>For signing ID tokens, it is server-side keys only that an authorization server has to handle.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 ID Token Signing
<p>In contrast, if an authorization server wants to support encryption of ID tokens, the authorization server has to handle client-side keys, too.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 ID Token Encryption
<p>This is the reason that not a small number of authorization server implementations don’t support ID token encryption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5.2.2.2. JARM</p>
<p>In addition, if the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;is used in conjunction with the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>jwt</code>, the authorization server</p>
<p>5.2.2.2. JARM, 1.</p>
<p>shall create JWT-secured authorization responses as specified in JARM, Section 4.3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This clause does not include any FAPI-specific requirements. It just says that JARM implementations should function as the JARM specification requires.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;does not contain&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>, no ID token is issued. Therefore, an ID token cannot be used as a detached signature. In this case, JARM has to be used to assure that the authorization response has not been tampered.</p>
 Part 2: Requirements for Confidential Client 
<p>The FAPI Final version has renamed Part 2: Section 5.2.3 from “Public client” to “Confidential client”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 1.</p>
<p>shall support MTLS as mechanism for sender-constrained access tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, the authorization server must issue certificated-bound access tokens as defined in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-mutual-tls-client-certifica">Section 3</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 2.</p>
<p>shall include the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter as defined in Section 6 of OIDC in the authentication request;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As listed in the list of requirements for authorization servers, either the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter or the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter must be included. Note that OIDC Core says&nbsp;“If one of these parameters is used, the other MUST NOT be used in the same request.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 3.</p>
<p>shall ensure the Authorization Server has authenticated the user to an appropriate Level of Assurance for the client’s intended purpose;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement states just that the user shall be authenticated appropriately. The FAPI Final version removed the requirement&nbsp;“by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim”&nbsp;which once existed in the clause.</p>
<p>HISTORY:</p>
<p>In ID2, this requirement was&nbsp;“shall request user authentication at LoA 3 or greater by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim as defined in section 5.5.1.1 of [OIDC];”.</p>
<p>When a client wants to require claims as essential ones, the&nbsp;<code>acr_values</code>&nbsp;request parameter cannot be used. Instead, a client must use the&nbsp;<code>claims</code>&nbsp;request parameter, pass JSON as its value, and include&nbsp;<code>{“essential":true}</code>&nbsp;inside the JSON. The following is an example of JSON that needs to be given as the value of the&nbsp;<code>claims</code>&nbsp;request parameter in order to mark&nbsp;<code>urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver</code> as an essential ACR.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Claims for Essential ACR
<p>BTW, this requirement is loosened in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/">UK Open Banking</a>&nbsp;which is based on FAPI Part 2. That is, clients don’t have to require ACRs as essential. Probably, it is not intentional. I guess that the snapshot of FAPI specification which was referred to when&nbsp;Open Banking Profile&nbsp;(OBP) was developed didn’t contain the sentence, “by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim”.</p>
<p>The official Financial-grade API conformance test suite (<a href="https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite">conformance-suite</a>) developed and maintained by&nbsp;<a href="https://fintechlabs.io/">FinTechLabs.io</a>&nbsp;contains test cases for OBP. When FinTechLabs ran the OBP test cases using Authlete to test the test suite itself, they encountered an error. Because Authlete strictly follows FAPI specification, Authlete reported&nbsp;“<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim is not required as essential.”&nbsp;However, the expected behavior in the context of OBP is to ignore the FAPI requirement.</p>
<p>The right approach for the error was to amend OBP (to make OBP compliant with the latest FAPI specification). However, I was given explanation like&nbsp;“if the official conformance test suite did it, all the existing OBP implementations wouldn’t be able to pass the official tests. Changing the tests at this timing might cause delay in the officially-announced schedule of Open Banking.”</p>
<p>Therefore, I decided to tweak Authlete and added OPEN_BANKING option in addition to FAPI option.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Supported Service Profiles (in Service Owner Console provided by Authlete)
<p>If OPEN_BANKING is enabled, Authlete dare not to check if the&nbsp;<code>acr</code> claim is required as essential even in the context of FAPI Part 2. The code snippet below is the actual implementation excerpted from Authlete’s source code.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Code to judge whether acr should be required as an essential claim
<p>As a result of this, Authlete is listed as a platform vendor that has passed “<a href="https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/126321042/Open+Banking+Security+Profile+Conformance">Open Banking Security Profile Conformance</a>”.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Authlete listed in Open Banking Security Profile Conformance
<p>~HISTORY END</p>
<p>However, again, the FAPI Final has removed the requirement&nbsp;“by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim”, so Authlete no longer checks whether ACRs are requested as essential ones. Therefore, the flag OPEN_BANKING is not meaningful any more.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If request parameters are all put into a request object, either the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter or the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter is sufficient. However, if parameters that are mandatory in OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Core (e.g.&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>) are omitted, the request is no longer compliant with OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Core. Therefore, parameters that are mandatory in OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Core must be put outside the request object duplicately even if they exist inside the request object.</p>
<p>The FAPI Final version has added a condition&nbsp;“if not using PAR”. This implies that the set of request parameters don’t have to be compliant with OAuth 2.0 / OIDC when PAR is used. This incompatibility comes from&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-jwsreq/">JWT Secured Authorization Request</a>&nbsp;(JAR). See “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/implementers-note-about-jar-fff4cbd158fe">Implementer’s note about JAR (JWT Secured Authorization Request)</a>” for details.</p>

<p>The same requirement can be found in Section 5.2.2. Authorization server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 15.</p>
<p>shall use RFC7636 with&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method if using PAR; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, an authorization request must include&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method=S256</code>&nbsp;request parameter when PAR is used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 16.</p>
<p>shall additionally send a duplicate of the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;parameter/value using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax to the authorization endpoint, as required by Section 5 of JAR, if using PAR.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The PAR specification requires that authorization servers handle request objects based on the rules defined in JAR. The JAR specification has made the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter optional, but the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;remains mandatory. See “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/implementers-note-about-jar-fff4cbd158fe">Implementer’s note about JAR (JWT Secured Authorization Request)</a>” for details.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In addition, if the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>&nbsp;is used, the client</p>

<p>Section 5.2.3.1. lists requirements for client applications which are applied when an ID token is used as a detached signature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 1.</p>
<p>shall include the value&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;into the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;parameter in order to activate OIDC support;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a FAPI-specific requirement. OIDC Core requires that an OIDC request include&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;parameter. See the explanation about the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;parameter written in&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest">Section 3.1.2.1. Authentication Request</a>&nbsp;in OIDC Core for details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 2.</p>
<p>shall require JWS signed ID Token be returned from endpoints;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing new from OIDC’s viewpoint. By definition, ID tokens are always signed. And when&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;contains&nbsp;<code>openid</code>, both the authorization endpoint and the token endpoint return an ID token. See “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/diagrams-of-all-the-openid-connect-flows-6968e3990660">Diagrams of All The OpenID Connect Flows</a>” for details about what the endpoints return.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 3.</p>
<p>shall verify that the authorization response was not tampered using ID Token as the detached signature;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, client applications have to compute hash values of response parameters outside the issued ID token and compare the values to the hash values in the ID token.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 4.</p>
<p>shall verify that&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;value is equal to the value calculated from the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;value in the authorization response in addition to all the requirements in 3.3.2.12 of OIDC; and</p>
<p>NOTE: This enables the client to verify that the authorization response was not tampered with, using the ID Token as a detached signature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement particularly mentions the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter and the&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;claim in the ID token although they are just one of parameter/hash pairs that have to be considered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 5.</p>
<p>shall support both signed and signed &amp; encrypted ID Tokens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By definition, ID tokens are always signed. When ID tokens are encrypted, the order of signing and encrypting is “sign then encrypt”. As a result, an encrypted ID token takes the form of “Nested JWT” as illustrated below.</p>

 Part 2: Security Considerations 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#security-considerations">8. Security considerations</a>” of “Part 2” lists security considerations. Summary is as follows.</p>
<p>8.1&nbsp;— This specification references security considerations in&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10">Section 10</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">RFC 6749</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819">RFC 6819</a>.</p>
<p>8.2&nbsp;— Protected resource endpoints shall accept only certificate-bound access tokens.</p>
<p>8.3.1&nbsp;— Clients should use a different redirect URI per authorization server.</p>
<p>8.3.2&nbsp;— Authorization codes and client secrets are passed to attackers if developers are deceived into using a fake token endpoint.</p>
<p>8.3.3&nbsp;— Hybrid flow or JARM can be used as a countermeasure for IdP mix-up attack.</p>
<p>8.3.4&nbsp;— (removed)</p>
<p>8.3.5&nbsp;— Because an access token is bound to an X.509 certificate, stolen access tokens cannot be used without corresponding certificates.</p>
<p>8.4.1&nbsp;— RFC 6749 doesn’t assure message integrity of authorization request and response.</p>
<p>8.4.2&nbsp;— Using request objects prevents authorization request parameter injection attack.</p>
<p>8.4.3&nbsp;— Using hybrid flow or JARM prevents authorization response parameter injection attack.</p>
<p>8.5&nbsp;— Cipher suites for TLS 1.2 are restricted.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#tls-considerations">8.5. TLS considerations</a>” of “Part 2” permits only the following cipher suites for TLS communication when the TLS version in use is below 1.3.</p>
 
 <code>TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</code> 
 <code>TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</code> 
 <code>TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code> 
 <code>TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code> 
 
<p>But, from a viewpoint of interoperability of web browsers, additional cipher suites allowed in the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp195">BCP 195</a>&nbsp;are permitted for authorization endpoints.</p>
<p>Because I couldn’t find any good reasons to exclude the following cipher suites,</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<code>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</code></p>
<p>6.<code>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code></p>
<p>I created&nbsp;<a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/216">Issue 216</a>&nbsp;(TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA cipher suites) to suggest adding them to the list of permitted cipher suites. 1 year and 4 months later, the issue was closed with the reason that FAPI now allows TLS 1.3.</p>
<p>8.6&nbsp;—&nbsp;<code>PS256</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>ES256</code>&nbsp;only are allowed for JWS signature algorithm.</p>
<p>Signing algorithms of JWS are listed in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.1">3.1. “alg” (Algorithm) Header Parameter Values for JWS</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518">RFC 7518</a>&nbsp;(JSON Web Algorithms). Among the 13 algorithms, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#algorithm-considerations">8.6. Algorithm considerations</a>” of “Part 2” permits&nbsp;<code>PS256</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>ES256</code>&nbsp;only. The section explicitly states that RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 (e.g.&nbsp;<code>RS256</code>) should not be used and&nbsp;<code>none</code> must not be used.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 JWS algorithms permitted by Financial-grade API, Part 2
<p>FYI: JWT is used at the following places in an authorization server implementation.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 JWT Usage in Authorization Server Implementation
<p>8.6.1&nbsp;—&nbsp;<code>RSA1_5</code>&nbsp;encryption algorithm must not be used.</p>
<p>This requirement about encryption algorithms was added by the FAPI Final version. FAPI prohibits&nbsp;<code>RSA1_5</code>. The algorighm identifier is defined in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-4.1">4.1. “alg” (Algorithm) Header Parameter Values for JWE</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518">RFC 7518</a>&nbsp;(JSON Web Algorithms). The identifier represents RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5.</p>
<p>8.7&nbsp;— Use certified FAPI implementations.</p>
<p>8.8&nbsp;—Don’t allow privileged actions without an access token.</p>
<p>8.9&nbsp;— Keys for signature verification should be accessible via the&nbsp;<code>jwks_uri</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>jwks</code>&nbsp;client metadata (cf.&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591">RFC 7591</a>) and the&nbsp;<code>jwks_uri</code>&nbsp;server metadata (cf.&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414">RFC 8414</a>).</p>
<p>8.10&nbsp;— A compromise of any client that shares the same key with other clients would result in a compromise of all the clients.</p>
<p>8.11&nbsp;— JWK sets should not contain multiple keys with the same&nbsp;<code>kid</code>, but other key attributes may be used to select one among multiple key candidates.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 FAPI implementation 
<p>This chapter picks up some topics related to FAPI implementation.</p>
 Baseline or Advanced? 
<p>When a client application requests an access token and accesses APIs with the access token, which security profile should apply, FAPI Part 1 or FAPI Part 2, or neither of them?</p>
<p>Some implementations may configure themselves statically and others may make the decision dynamically at runtime.&nbsp;The FAPI specification mentions nothing about how to determine which security profile should apply.</p>
<p>A simple approach would be&nbsp;“Regard all authorization requests as FAPI Part 2 requests.”&nbsp;Actually, UK Open Banking has adopted this approach. A hard-coded implementation like this may be acceptable if the system development is a one-time work.</p>
<p>However, this approach is not appropriate for a generic authorization server implementation. It’s because a hard-coded implementation hinders flexibility of system design too much. Therefore, in a generic implementation, it is better to judge dynamically at runtime whether an authorization request is for FAPI Part 1 or for FAPI Part 2 (or for normal OAuth 2.0 / OIDC).</p>
<p>If so, how to judge dynamically? The conclusion everyone will eventually reach after thinking will be just one. It is&nbsp;judged by checking the requested scopes.</p>
<p>(Note: Another possible way would be to utilize the&nbsp;<code>resource</code>&nbsp;request parameter defined in “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html">RFC 8707 Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0</a>”.)</p>
<p>For example, (1) prepare scopes named&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>write</code>, (2) adopt a rule where the&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;scope requires FAPI Part 1 requirements be satisfied and the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope requires FAPI Part 2 requirements be satisfied, and (3) implement APIs so that they interpret the scopes accordingly. If APIs are implemented in this way, the implementation of an authorization endpoint can change its behavior dynamically by (a) applying FAPI Part 2 requirements when the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter includes the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope, (b) applying FAPI Part 1 requirements when the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter does not include the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope but includes the&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;scope, and (c) applying normal OAuth 2.0 and OIDC requirements when the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter includes neither the&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;scope nor the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope.</p>
<p>How to implement the scope-based switch? For instance, one approach might be to regard scopes whose name starts with&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;as scopes for FAPI Part 1. However, this approach imposes heavy restrictions on scope names. If that is the case, what approach has Authlete adopted?</p>
<p>As the first step, Authlete implemented a generic mechanism to set arbitrary attributes to each scope. On the mechanism, Authlete treats the attribute name&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;in a special way. An attribute having name&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;and value&nbsp;<code>r</code>&nbsp;represents Read-Only (= Baseline). Likewise, an attribute having name&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;and value&nbsp;<code>rw</code>&nbsp;represents Read-and-Write (Advanced).</p>
<p>The web console for FAPI-aware Authlete (version 2.0+) provides UI for scope attributes. The screenshot below defines a scope named&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;with an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=r</code>.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Scope Settings for FAPI Read-Only
<p>Authlete’s&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.authlete.com/#auth-authorization-api">/auth/authorization API</a>&nbsp;that parses an authorization request checks scopes listed in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter in the authorization request and regards the request as a request for FAPI Part 2 if the scope list includes a scope that has an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=rw</code>. If the scope list does not include any scope having an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=rw</code>&nbsp;but includes a scope having an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=r</code>, the authorization request is regarded as a request for FAPI Part 1. In other cases, the authorization request is treated as a normal OAuth 2.0 / OIDC request.</p>
<p>NOTE: In ID2, the names of FAPI Part 1 and Part 2 were “Read-Only Security Profile” and “Read and Write Security Profile”. The FAPI Final verison renamed them to “Baseline Security Profile” and “Advanced Security Profile”. The values of&nbsp;<code>r</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>rw</code>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;attribute were determined based on the old names.</p>
 Mutual TLS 
<p>“Mutual TLS” has three meanings as listed below (as already explained previously).</p>
 
 TLS communication using a client certificate 
 Client authentication using a client certificate 
 Certificate binding 
 
<p>The first part is handled by API management solutions. On the other hand, the second and the third parts don’t necessarily have to be handled by the API management layer. Rather, a better system architecture would handle them in a different layer that is independent of the API management layer.</p>
<p>Because of its unique architecture, Authlete doesn’t take on any task in the API management layer. That is, Authlete does nothing for the first part. On the other hand, Authlete supports the second and the third parts. Thanks to this, with Authlete, systems can support MTLS (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>) required by FAPI on any API management solution that developers want to use. I actually tried MTLS on Amazon API Gateway and wrote an article titled “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/developers/tutorial/financial_grade_apigateway/">Financial-grade Amazon API Gateway</a>” to explains how to achieve it.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Example of Component Deployment for MTLS on Amazon API Gateway
<p>Any API management solution can support MTLS by using Authlete as long as the solution provides a mechanism which enables developers to access the client certificate used in TLS communication.</p>
<p>Existing API management solutions may try to implement MTLS directly. However, it would take time, and above all, it is not a good system design to support the functionality directly in the API management layer. At the time of this writing, if you use an API management solution provided by one of giant cloud vendors, Authlete is the best answer for MTLS.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/hYhHan5FzlA">video</a>&nbsp;below is a session in “<a href="https://financial-api.net/en/">Financial APIs Workshop</a>” that took place in Tokyo on July 24, 2018. In the video,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinricher/">Justin Richer</a>, one of the most famous software engineers in the community and the author of “<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/oauth-2-in-action">OAuth 2 in Action</a>”, is explaining Authlete’s MTLS implementation.</p>
<p>The material and transcript of the presentation are available at “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/resources/videos/20180724/authlete-fapi-enhancements/">Authlete FAPI Enhancements</a>”.</p>
 Access Token Duration 
<p>This is not related to FAPI, but I explain this feature here because I’m often consulted about the feature in the context of Bank API by customers who want to make duration of access tokens for remittance shorter than that of access tokens for other purposes.</p>
<p>The functionality can be achieved by making access token duration shorter when an authorization request contains a scope for remittance. For example, if an API for remittance requires a scope named&nbsp;<code>remit</code>, the authorization server would shorten access token duration when an authorization request contains the scope.</p>
<p>Authlete supports the functionality by treating a scope attribute named&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;in a special way.</p>
<p>Authlete checks all scope attributes of requested scopes, picks up the smallest value among values of&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attributes, and uses it as the duration of an access token being issued. If none of the requested scopes has an&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attribute, Authlete uses the default value of access token duration set per authorization server instance. If the default value is smaller than the smallest value of&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attributes, the default value is used.</p>
<p>The screenshot below shows how to set&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration=300</code>as a scope attribute.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Scope Settings for Access Token Duration
<p>Likewise, duration of refresh tokens can be set by utilizing&nbsp;<code>refresh_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attributes.</p>
<p>NOTE: Authlete 2.1 and newer versions support “access token duration per client”. See “<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/en/s/oauth-and-openid-connect/a/how-to-calculate-token-duration">How Authlete determines token duration</a>” on&nbsp;<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/">Authlete Knowledge Base</a>&nbsp;for details.</p>
 Access Token with Transaction Information 
<p>This feature is not related to FAPI, either, but I explain it here as I’m often consulted about it in the context of Bank API by customers who want to associate detailed transaction information with an access token. I hear that some regulations in Europe require an access token be issued per transaction under some conditions.</p>
<p>This functionality cannot be achieved by “scope attribute” which was explained in “Access Token Duration” because the functionality requires data be handled per access token, not per scope.</p>
<p>Since old days, Authlete has provided a mechanism to set arbitrary key-value pairs to an access token. This feature can be utilized to associate transaction information with an access token. Technical details about this feature are explained in “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/documents/definitive_guide/extra_properties">Extra Properties</a>”. See also “<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/en/s/oauth-and-openid-connect/a/extra-properties">How to add extra properties to an access token</a>” in&nbsp;<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/">Authlete Knowledge Base</a>.</p>
<p>However, note that it is not a smart way to associate detailed information such as amount of money with an access token directly. Instead, a recommended way is to (1) store detailed transaction information into another database and (2) associate the unique identifier of the database record with an access token.</p>
 Authorization Details 
<p>Since the version 2.2, Authlete supports “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-rar/">OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests</a>” (RAR). The standard specification adds a request/response parameter,&nbsp;<code>authorization_details</code>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<code>authorization_details</code>&nbsp;parameter is used to enable an access token to hold detailed information about authorization.&nbsp;For example, detailed information about payment such as “How much?”, “To whom?”, etc.</p>
<p>According to the specification, the&nbsp;<code>authorization_details</code>&nbsp;parameter can be used anywhere the&nbsp;<code>scope</code> parameter is used. For instance, (a) in the authorization request, (b) in the token response, (c) in the introspection response, and so on.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 (a) authorization_details in Authorization Request (RAR Section 3)

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 (b) authorization_details in Token Response (RAR Section 7)

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 (c) authorization_details in Introspection Response (RAR Section 8.2)
<p>RAR is an open standard to describe details about authorization and tie the information to an access token. RAR is to be adopted as a component of FAPI 2.0 (cf. “Are there FAPI 2.0 implementations?” in&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/faq/">FAPI FAQ</a>).</p>
<p>Authlete’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authlete.com/developers/definitive_guide/extra_properties/">Extra Properties</a>&nbsp;can be used for the same purpose. One functional difference is that Extra Properties can choose to expose or hide extra properties. Hidden extra properties never appear in any OAuth/OIDC responses but can be retrieved by Authlete’s introspection API (<a href="http://docs.authlete.com/#auth-introspection-api">/auth/introspection API</a>). There are some use cases where you want to tie information to an access token but hide the information from the client application and the user. In such cases, Extra Properties is useful.</p>
 Finally 
<p>Thank you for reading this long post till the end.</p>
<p>Authlete has already supports the FAPI 1.0 Final version and known technical specifications of FAPI 2.0&nbsp;as mentioned in&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/faq/">FAPI FAQ</a>. You can try FAPI through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authlete.com/developers/tutorial/">Authlete API Tutorials</a>&nbsp;with an Authlete account (<a href="https://so.authlete.com/accounts/signup">signup</a>).</p>

 Gordian Work 

<p>Our advances on Gordian were linked to a large-scale transition in the meaning of the Gordian system. Prior to 2021, we were offering a variety of applications, but we were simultaneously working with companies to create specifications. This created a real tension. Now that we’ve seen the beginnings of adoption of our best practices, we’ve been able to change the focus of our applications from being consumer-focused to being exemplars for other companies to study. In Q2, we expect this to mature into a Gordian Seal™ program that denotes companies who are producing products that follow the Gordian principles and our best practices. Like similar projects such as the FIDO Alliance, we expect the Gordian Seal to make it easier for everyone in the blockchain ecosystem to work together, creating  bizdev and interoperability opportunities.</p>

<p>Gordian Testing. Blockchain Commons now has three iOS reference apps available for public beta testing via Apple’s Testflight: <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/sJTaoUsM">Gordian Cosigner</a>, <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/0LIl6H1h">Gordian Guardian</a>, and <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/OQHyL0a8">Guardian Wallet</a>. Wallet was our original app, recently updated to support the newest Lifehash and <code>crypto-request</code> features; Cosigner is the companion signing app that we introduced last quarter; and Guardian is our newest release, a key-storage tool for iOS. As reference apps, these projects are mainly meant as exemplars, demonstrating the best practices and principles suggested by the Gordian architecture as well as exemplifying how multiple apps can interact through Airgaps and Universal Resources (URs). See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TosqR8a2OXg">our video</a> for a real-life example of Gordian Cosigner, Guardian, and Wallet working together to securely create a multisig account and sign a PSBT, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19GVOIZNedU">this video</a> that demonstrates AirGap signing between LetheKit and Gordian Cosigner.</p>

<p>Independent Recovery. We are already working to split a new app, “Gordian Recovery”, off of Gordian Guardian. One of our best practices for the Gordian system demands that a user can recover funds from a Gordian-approved wallet even if the company producing it disappears. Gordian Recovery will provide one way to do so, allowing a user to independently use the app to recover and sweep funds held in a multisig wallet, no matter the status of the wallet manufacturer. At its debut, we expect Gordian Recovery to support at least three different companies with their own multisig hardware or software wallet systems. Generally, Guardian Recovery, like Gordian Cosigner, demonstrates how Blockchain Commons will interact with the wallet ecosystem by providing not just specifications, best practices, and references, but also complementary apps that can support third-party wallets.</p>

<p>Keytool Updates. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-keytool-cli">keytool CLI (command-line interface) app</a> also received major upgrades in Q1. We expanded it to support the new UR (Universal Resource) <code>crypto-request</code> and <code>crypto-response</code> features that add support for arbitrary requests. This is a first step in moving away from the <code>m/48'</code> derivation used by current hardware wallets for multisig, which often results in master or cosigner xpub reuse and thus a risk to privacy. This means that we now have the infrastructure to demonstrate different solutions to the problems of <code>m/48'</code>xpub reuse, but there’s still a lot of legacy use cases that need to be resolved. (We also reviewed one solution for the <code>m/48'</code> derivation problem and found it unnecessarily complex, so: onward.)</p>

<p>Lifehash Improvements. Most of the Gordian specifications that we’ve created while working with our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions">Airgapped Wallet Community</a> focus on interoperability, particularly moving data across airgaps. Lifehash is something else: it’s a user-interface specification meant to give users trust in the continuity of cryptocurrency accounts without having to depend on reading text addresses, which aren’t user-intuitive. Instead, Lifehash creates unique, colored icons for each account that remain consistent over time. This quarter, we adjusted the colors used by Lifehash so that they look better in black &amp; white printing, and simultaneously experimented with dithering on the 200x200 LetheKit display, to ensure that we could display meaningful information on a worst-case small black &amp; white display.</p>

 

<p></p>

 

<p></p>

 

<p>Lethekit Updates. The DIY <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit/">LetheKit</a> has been our prime reference for testing hardware implementations of our Gordian best practices. Not only did we test it out with dithered Lifehashes last quarter, but we also were able to use its display to test out animated QRs for transferring PSBTs. It worked! (Albeit, slowly.) See also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19GVOIZNedU">this video</a> of LetheKit exporting derived keys to Gordian Signer.</p>

<p>Gordian Adoption. Finally, as noted, we’re very happy to see continued adoption of Gordian. Last quarter, we talked about all of the software and library development being done by wallet companies. This quarter, we’re seeing more companies committing to including SSKRs (Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction), URs (Universal Resources), and other Gordian features in their wallets. <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow Wallet</a> has been expanding its capabilities, while <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/">Foundation Devices</a> was the newest to announce their integration of some UR features, including animated PSBTs. Foundation and Sparrow have both been working with us for a while: we’re thrilled to see both hardware and software wallet companies incorporating Blockchain Commons specifications! We’re also aware of two more software-wallet companies who haven’t made announcements yet, and we’ve been extensively working with a third company to produce a Gordian-approved wallet that entirely matches our principles and best practices and adds on some great UI besides. We can now announce that third company is Bitmark …</p>

<p>Autonomy Architecting. Blockchain Commons has been working with Bitmark to design Autonomy, a bitcoin wallet and digital assets manager. Their goal is to make it easy for families to gain independence and preserve generational wealth. Autonomy combines a mobile app with your own dedicated full node running privately in the cloud. We used a partitioned architecture (keys across app+node) and a personal recovery network (using SSKR) to remove all single points of failure. When you transact, everything is multisig between your app and full node. Any single key can fail and you won’t lose your funds. Nothing else like this currently exists in the market.</p>

 Other Advances 

<p>Here’s some details on our other major projects:</p>

<p>Multisig Documents. This quarter, we released our first major expansion to our #SmartCustody tutorials since 2019: a 10,000-word document on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md">Designing Multisig for Independence &amp; Resilience</a>. The state of multisig wasn’t sufficiently advanced to provide specific advice when we originally wrote #SmartCustody, so we’re now happy to include it by breaking down the design of multisig addresses into theoretical, transactional, operational, and functional elements and providing design patterns and examples to help you put those elements together. Want to know why Blockchain Commons is today focused on multisig technology and how to create them to meet your own needs? It’s all here.</p>

<p>DID Recommendation. We’ve been working with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID specification</a> since it was incubated at early <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting-the-Web-of-Trust workshops</a>, and co-authored by Blockchain Commons founder Christopher Allen. We’re thrilled that it’s now a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Candidate Recommendation</a>. There might still be revisions and new candidates, but this is the beginning of the last stage in creating an official internet standard for decentralized identity on the internet.</p>

<p>DID Method Expansion. Meanwhile, Blockchain Commons is doing its own work on DIDs, with a new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/did-method-onion">did:onion method implementation</a>. We’re happy to say that <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/">Spruce Systems</a> is already considering it for their DID resolver. We’re also considering returning to work on our own <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">BTCR DID method</a>, which was one of the first DID methods, but has gotten somewhat out of date with recent updates to Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Apt Packages. We have produced apt packages for installing <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli">seedtool</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-keytool-cli">keytool</a> for use with Debian and Tails OSes. This is a first step in providing support tools for human-rights activists, which we expect to get more emphasis in our work in Q3.</p>

<p>Legislative Work. Finally, Christopher Allen’s work with legislatures multiplied last quarter. In Wyoming, he led efforts that resulted in the <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">Wyoming Digital Identity Act</a>, which includes a specific definition of digital identity that works toward the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">principles of self-sovereign identity</a>. Work on a private-key-protection bill was less successful, as it had to be withdrawn after being spoiled by an amendment. Christopher has also recently testified before legislatures in <a href="https://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/67-2021/testimony/HIBL-3024-20210208-5787-F-ALLEN_CHRISTOPHER.pdf">North Dakota</a> and Nevada. This is all crucial work because actual engineering will ultimately be limited and directed by what states legislate, so we want to make sure the laws fit the technology and the needs of the individual.</p>

<p>Intern Search. We’re thrilled that our Summer 2021 internship program has been sponsored by the <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/1366880813845909506">Humans Rights Foundation</a>. We’ve thus put out <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/32">a call for interns</a>, and we’re expanding our usual development work to also include direct support for activists, who need help to maintain their privacy in potentially hostile regimes. However, to really support activists requires knowing what they need. So, we’re also considering working with interns to do research and conduct interviews to create user engagement models for activists. This would be similar to the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/final-documents/amira.pdf">Amira model</a> from RWOT. If you are interested in having developers work with or mentor blockchain interns, want to suggest intern projects, or even have engineers who might be interested in working on Blockchain Commons projects briefly during the summer, <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">please mail us</a>.</p>

<p>Taproot &amp; Schnorr First Steps. We may see a major upgrade for Bitcoin as soon as this fall, if Speedy Trial is approved for Taproot and Schnorr. The first will increase privacy for #SmartCustody features such as timelocks and multisig, while the second will allow aggregated multisig, which offer several advantages over traditional ECDSA signatures. Our brand-new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/musign-cli">musign CLI</a> app provides the first experimental support for Schnorr signatures leveraging the Taproot/Schnorr BIPS, but independent from <code>bitcoind</code>. More to come as we ramp up to this expansion.</p>

 Supporting the Future 

<p>We’ve laid out our initial roadmap for the next two cycles of Blockchain Commons efforts, covering spring and summer. Important topics includes finalizing our Gordian Seal program, solving problems with xpub reuse in Bitcon multisig, supporting and advancing SSKR (Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction) for not just cryptographic seeds but other data, continuing to support and advance URs (Universal Resources) with encrypted and/or signed CBOR, and architecting a new QuickConnect 2.0 for initiating TorGap-based services between peers. If you’d like to know more about our roadmap, especially if you considering becoming a sustaining sponsor or to sponsor a specific project on our roadmap, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">contact us directly</a>.</p>

      <p>The concept of digital identity, implemented in the Tangle Identity Eclipse project, provides this layer of trust that the online world requires. Build on IOTA’s Tangle and the standards of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) of DID and Verifiable Credentials, people, organizations, and things can identify each other, share data, and instantly verify the integrity of this data. They remain fully in control over their data in a privacy-first process. A few examples of how Tangle Identity can be used:</p>
       
         Digitizing physical documents such as passports and licenses, creating reusable Know Your Customer (KYC) information. 
         Verifiable company registrations and proof of employment to prevent phishing and fraud. 
         Proof of authenticity, signed by the manufacturer, creating trust in devices and their capabilities.

      <p>At the IOTA Foundation, we fundamentally believe that a new time requires novel approaches to governance. As the first non-profit foundation in the European Union that was financed with a cryptocurrency endowment, we pioneered such novel arrangements in what we think will serve the IOTA protocol best in the very long term. Throughout the year we have been sharing our learning and have been working with diverse thought leaders and renowned organizations from the field of sustainable finance and economics to strategize how we can create the structure to support long-term impact initiatives.</p>

Built on Selv, IOTA´s self-sovereign identity (SSID) demonstration platform, we want to give you a glimpse into digital identities and how they can impact mankind’s sustainability in the future.

		<p>Newark, NJ, April 13, 2021 – Edge, the region’s nonprofit research and education network and technology partner, has announced a new service designed to protect against data exfiltration and sale on the dark web. An addition to Edge’s existing cybersecurity assessment services, the dark web vulnerability scan enables institutions to identify undetected security breaches and better prepare for future attacks.</p>
<p>With ransomware attacks in higher education increasing 100% over the past year, and average pay-outs totalling nearly $450,000, the ability to quickly scan network traffic as well as the dark web is critical in protecting the personal information stored in institutional systems and intellectual property at research institutions from potential hackers.</p>
<p>Edge’s Dark Web Vulnerability Scan is a combination of traditional vulnerability scanning technology, plus a suite of proprietary tools that scan the institution’s network traffic for interactions with known attack vectors on the internet as well as the depths of the dark web to illuminate blind spots for institutions.</p>
<p>“Colleges and universities hold a treasure trove of personal data in their systems, making them very attractive targets for hackers. In some cases, these systems have already been breached without the institution even being aware of that fact,” said Dawn Dunkerley, PhD, who leads Edge’s team of virtual Chief Information Security Officers. “Smart hackers can get inside your network quietly, and stay there extracting information to the dark web over long periods of time. This service offers organizations a way to find out if their data is already out there on the dark web and protect themselves from future attacks.”</p>
<p>Given a <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2021/03/18/fbi-warns-increased-ransomware-attacks-targeting-colleges">recently issued FBI warning</a> about rising numbers of cyberattacks against colleges and universities, the higher education community is expected to remain an attractive target for cybercriminals seeking to steal sensitive information and exfiltrate it to the dark web and/or hold it for ransom.</p>
<p>Edge’s proprietary dark web vulnerability scan is available on a monthly or real-time subscription basis. The monthly plan provides a point-in-time snapshot of the institution’s data exposure on the dark web, and analysis of netflow traffic to identify whether attackers have interacted with your network. The real-time plan provides an immediate, ongoing, and specific view of possible attack vectors from the dark web and your institution’s files or infrastructure to notify the institution of any warning signs as they arise.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland — 13 April 2021 — Today Energy Web announced a new initiative, funded by a €1 million grant from Google.org’s Impact Challenge program, to provide a digital framework for coordinating distributed energy resources (DERs) across the transmission and distribution market interface of Europe’s power grid. <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/who-we-are/what-is-climate-kic/">Climate-KIC</a>, the EU’s leading knowledge and innovation community focused on climate, helped to select winning grantees.</p><p>The initiative will leverage the open-source Energy Web stack to make it easy for prosumers and DERs to register and participate in local and regional energy markets. Working with mobile network operators, IoT service providers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and grid operators across Europe, the initiative will foster the procurement of flexibility services in a transparent, non-discriminatory, and market-based way, as prioritized by the <a href="https://acer.europa.eu/en/Electricity/CLEAN_ENERGY_PACKAGE">EU Clean Energy&nbsp;Package</a>.</p><p>Energy Web’s grant comes from the <a href="https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/climate2020">Google.org Impact Challenge on Climate</a>, which commits €10M to fund bold ideas that aim to use technology to accelerate Europe’s progress toward a greener, more-resilient future. It is expected to accelerate the strong momentum Energy Web has already generated working with European grid operators. This grant and initiative will build upon existing open-source software developed to support near-identical use cases with transmission system operators (TSOs) Austrian Power Grid, 50 Hertz, and Elia as well as distribution system operators (DSOs) Electra Caldense and Fluvius. The common theme across these projects is easing the digitization, registration, and participation of DERs in energy markets managed by both DSOs and TSOs. More recently, this same architecture underpinned <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/bebat-launches-easybat-an-open-source-decentralized-solution-for-battery-lifecycle-management-281f2ace61e9">EasyBat</a>, used to track the lifecycle of residential and commercial batteries in&nbsp;Belgium.</p><p>“This Google.org grant and the work it will fund supporting a pan-European electric flexibility market is the culmination of Energy Web’s mission to enable any customer and any asset to participate in any energy market,” explained Walter Kok, CEO of Energy Web. “We are able to harness the flexibility of prosumers to provide value throughout the electricity value chain to make DERs the backbone of the European&nbsp;grid.”</p><p>The initiative will focus on integrating the Energy Web stack with a number of electricity market participants, including but not limited&nbsp;to:</p>  Mobile Network Operators: in order to assign digital identities to all GSM-enabled energy assets via SIM&nbsp;cards.  IoT Service Providers: in order to co-develop SIM cards with electricity-sector roaming capabilities (i.e., independent of the Mobile Network Operator) that will allow energy assets to directly register with the Energy Web technology stack.  OEMs: in order to enable new generations of energy assets to directly embed an identity on the&nbsp;stack.  DSOs / TSOs: once integrated, DSOs will be able to tap into the flexible capacity of DERs connected to their networks and use them to procure flexibility. Likewise, TSOs will be able to simultaneously leverage DERs for regional / national markets in support of safer, greener, more-resilient electricity grids.  <p>Since it is common for Mobile Network Operators, IoT service providers, and payment solution providers to operate their own proprietary data systems and architectures, the project will ensure interoperability between these systems — including multiple blockchains — and the public Energy Web stack. Ultimately, at least 1 million DERs will integrate into electricity markets as part of the Google.org-funded project.</p><p>“We have received an overwhelming number of applications for our Google.org Impact Challenge on Climate,” said Rowan Barnett, head of Google.org in EMEA and APAC. “The Energy Web project is so exciting because it has tremendous transformative potential, not just for Europe, but for power grids around the world. We are catching a glimpse of the future electricity system — one that is inherently decentralized and democratized.”</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. We enable any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors our tech stack. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://energyweb.org.">https://energyweb.org.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/google-backs-energy-web-to-harmonize-low-carbon-electricity-markets-across-europe-204c18cd2f12">Google Backs Energy Web to Harmonize Low-Carbon Electricity Markets Across Europe</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Clouds hover over the horizon. The San Gabriel foothills smell of sage and soil after the rain. I feel my muscles begin to relax for the first time in a&nbsp;while.</p><p>I’m not alone. Though serious hurdles remain in the United States and globally, increasing numbers of American adults see hope on the horizon. A recurring Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-ipsos-poll-coronavirus-americans-hope-4bcc2761-82f0-43d0-b9eb-552f6a9ada71.html">poll</a> shows “hopeful” taking the lead over “stressed” and “frustrated” for the first time since the pandemic began. Roughly one-third of US adults have been vaccinated; the rest will be eligible by the end of April. Recent jobs reports show signs of an economy waking from hibernation. The American Rescue Plan and proposed American Jobs Plan would invest a combined $4 trillion in recovery and infrastructure.</p><p>These new possibilities bring a rush of questions. What does life look like after the pandemic for my community; my generation? How will we juggle work, education, and care to make ends meet? Whose lives and livelihoods are valued? After a year of isolation, where will we find belonging?</p><blockquote>When we look back on 2020, will we remember it as the year everything changed?</blockquote><p>“Disasters are extraordinarily generative,” Rebecca Solnit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/books/excerpt-paradise-built-in-hell.html">writes</a>, but “there is no simple formula for what arises: it has everything to do with who or what individuals or communities were before the disaster.”</p><p><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf">Our new PORTALS report</a> imagines possible futures arising out of today’s disasters. It is the latest installment of the annual <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/trends-to-watch-in-2020-beyond-16d457bf6b48">Trends to Watch</a> series, curated by our Exploration and Future Sensing team to support Omidyar Network’s mission of reimagining systems to build more inclusive and equitable societies. Across our focus areas of <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">Reimagining Capitalism</a>, <a href="https://omidyar.com/responsible-technology-2/">Responsible Technology</a>, and <a href="https://omidyar.com/pluralism/">Pluralism</a>, the work of “reimagining” requires that we interrogate our own assumptions about how systems need to change by <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/listening-to-the-future-5d709ea30d7d">listening to diverse viewpoints</a>.</p><p>Created in collaboration with <a href="https://futurearchitects.com/">Guild of Future Architects</a>, the 2021 report distills four open-ended provocations, designed to stir imagination and action, from a yearlong process of collective foresight. Between November 2019 and February 2021, the Guild invited 1,000 people to participate in a series of virtual sessions asking how systems that shape our daily lives could become more just and inclusive by 2036. A critical part of looking ahead was also looking back at how we arrived at today’s social, economic, and political realities.</p><p>Here are the provocations:</p>  What if shared well-being became the standard of success for our&nbsp;nations?  Are we ready to move from an era that rewards extraction to one that prioritizes regeneration?  How will we move from an era of destabilizing information into an age of trusted&nbsp;wisdom?  Can we dismantle industrial-age silos between work, home, education, play, and community?  <p>Each one pairs with a “Spectrum of Possibility” exercise to stir your own thinking about how imagined futures could become reality. Taken together, we hope that these provocations offer useful foundations for people working now to build tomorrow’s systems.</p> <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf">Download the full report&nbsp;here</a>. <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=5">What if shared well-being became the standard of success for our&nbsp;nations?</a><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=14">Are we ready to move from an era that rewards extraction to one that prioritizes regeneration?</a><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=23">How will we move from an era of destabilizing information into an age of trusted&nbsp;wisdom?</a><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=32">Can we dismantle industrial-age silos between work, home, education, play, and community?</a><p><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf">The PORTALS report</a> is a collaboration between Omidyar Network and the Guild of Future Architects.

<p>Description</p>



<p>The Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) has been developed jointly by UN/CEFACT and OASIS as the successor to the UN/CEFACT Standard Business Document Header (SBDH) version 1.3 and the OASIS Business Document Envelope (BDE) Version 1.1.</p>



<p>XHE defines a business-oriented artefact either referencing (as a header) or containing (as an envelope) a payload of one or more business documents or other artefacts with supplemental semantic information about the collection of payloads as a whole. An exchange header envelope describes contextual information important to the sender and receiver about the payloads, without having to modify the payloads in any fashion. This vocabulary is modeled using the UN/CEFACT Core Component Technical Specification Version 2.01.</p>



<p>The TC received 4 Statements of Use from IBM, ph-xhe open source project, Chasquis Consulting, and Efact [5].</p>

 It was business as&nbsp;usual <p>‘’Human rights protected offline should also be protected online’’</p><p>This was the resolution by the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) — the <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/38/L.10/Rev.1">resolution</a> on “the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet” at the 38th Session of the Human Rights Council of July 2018 which affirmed what we all held sacrosanct — that digital rights are human&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Internet and digital access have <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ITU_regional_global_Key_ICT_indicator_aggregates_Nov_2020.xlsx">deepened</a> across Africa in the past 20 years, in the process ushering in new vistas of human development. An important dimension of this development has been the expansion of new media, where new technologies such as social media have <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-new-media-platforms-have-become-powerful-across-africa-107294">given voices</a> to the hitherto voiceless and amplifying once stifled perspectives.</p><p>Given that the tight control many authoritarian regimes on the continent exercised relied on having a tight grip on public discourse, the Internet and the new media it spawned soon ran into <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37300272">cross hairs</a> with governments from Cairo to Cape Town. Africa has one of the most censored digital environments in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Pushing back against this censorship is a community of digital rights defenders. A basic, yet important tool in their efforts to promote media freedom is <a href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018/05/23/why-and-how-do-we-document-the-impact-of-rights-violations/">documentation</a>. In the aid of digital rights defenders everywhere, here’s a summary of some of the most important developments in digital rights in Africa in Q1&nbsp;2021.</p>Photo: <a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/human-humanity-silhouettes-camera-109103/">Pixabay</a> Internet shutdowns and website&nbsp;blocks <p>Sage-like, I had <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/internet-shutdowns-in-2021-c2a4e8dd4845">written presciently</a> in the first week of January that it was not a matter of if, rather when Internet shutdowns will occur in 2021. Like clockwork, the first Internet <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/uganda-shuts-down-internet-during-presidential-election/av-56243961">shutdown</a> happened shortly later in Uganda on January 13 on the eve of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55649467">Presidential elections</a> which saw young activist Robert Kyagulanyi (aka Bobi Wine) challenge Yoweri Museveni, the Ugandan President. The Internet shutdown was ordered by the government in retaliation for Facebook’s move to block a number of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-uganda-election-facebook-idUSKBN29G1H9">pro-government accounts</a>.</p><p>On November 4 2020, the Ethiopian government cut off <a href="https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/rest-of-africa/ethiopia-telephone-internet-services-tigray-2731442">telephone and Internet service</a> in the northern region of Tigray at the commencement of military offensive against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The restrictions on telephone and Internet service persisted into 2021. Curiously, numerous Twitter accounts <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/17/ethiopias-cracking-down-tigray-activists-are-spreading-news/">were created</a> elsewhere in the country in the following days to fill the information vacuum created in the Tigray&nbsp;region.</p><p>Following opposition protests after run-off elections in Niger on February 21, mobile Internet service providers <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/niger-election-internet-blackout/">disrupted service</a>. The election was won by Mohamed Bazoum, a former Interior Minister and candidate of the ruling party in the first <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56175439">democratic transition</a> in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>On March 5, Facebook, YouTube, and Whatsapp were <a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/social-media-and-messaging-apps-disrupted-in-senegal-amid-political-unrest-eA1R5pBp">restricted</a> on the Orange/Sonatel network in Senegal following protests against the arrest of opposition politician Ousmane Sonko of the Pastef party. Ousmane Sonko had been earlier accused of rape — an allegation he claimed was <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/03/05/senegal-blocks-social-media/">politically motivated</a>.</p><p>On Election day March 21, there was a disruption to Internet connectivity in Congo. The election, won by incumbent President Dennis Sassou Nguesso who was seeking his fourth term in office, was marked by low <a href="https://www.africanews.com/2021/03/21/congo-election-low-voter-turn-out-internet-shutdown-mark-polls//">voter turn-out</a>. The major opponent to the incumbent Guy-Brice Parfait Kolélas died of Covid-19 on <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56474855">election day</a>, after being flown out to France for medical attention.</p><p>In January, People’s Gazette, a critical website in Nigeria, was <a href="http://saharareporters.com/2021/01/28/nigerian-government-blocks-peoples-gazette-website-over-critical-media-reports">blocked</a> ostensibly from orders from the Nigerian government following an <a href="https://www.gazettengr.com/atiku-rsf-global-rights-gatefield-others-condemn-nigerian-govts-blocking-of-peoples-gazette-website/">investigative report</a> about senior officials of the President.</p> Legal and Policy developments <p>In Kenya, the Finance Act of 2019 empowered the Kenya Revenue Authority to announce a Digital Services Tax in 2020. The tax came into <a href="https://home.kpmg/us/en/home/insights/2020/12/tnf-kenya-digital-services-tax-regulations-effective-date-2021.html#:~:text=Overview%20of%20the%20digital%20services,of%20the%20gross%20transaction%20value.&amp;text=The%20digital%20services%20tax%20will,services%20through%20a%20digital%20marketplace.">effect</a> on January 1 2021. The tax is 1.5% of the total value of business services <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-africa-47639452?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_live&amp;ns_linkname=6006b04354a69202e80dcf9f%26Kenya%27s%20digital%20tax%20will%20%27undermine%20online%20businesses%27%262021-01-19T15%3A44%3A49.875Z&amp;ns_fee=0&amp;pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:f0b242e5-daae-48c4-b704-ae3e99075ddc&amp;pinned_post_asset_id=6006b04354a69202e80dcf9f&amp;pinned_post_type=share">rendered</a> through online platforms and is expected to hinder the development of online businesses.</p><p>Also in Kenya, the Statute Law Miscellaneous Amendment Act, an amendment to the Official Secrets Act, was signed on December 11 2020. According to AccessNow, it gives sweeping <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/kenya-right-to-privacy/">powers</a> to the Cabinet Secretary of Interior and Coordination of National Security to access data from any phone or computer.</p><p>In a landmark judgment in <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/news-analysis/4416/south-african-constitutional-court-declares-bulk-surveillance-powers-unlawful">favour</a> of privacy in February, South Africa’s Constitutional Court declared the bulk interception of communications by the country’s spy agencies unlawful. The case was based <a href="https://www.techfinancials.co.za/2021/02/15/top-court-ruling-on-south-africas-spy-law-is-a-victory-for-privacy-but-loopholes-remain/">on evidence</a> that the state spied on investigative journalist Stephen Patrick Sole of amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism while communicating with a source. The applicants including amaBhungane Centre argued that the Regulation of Interception of Communications Act of 2002 (RICA) and the National Strategic Intelligence Act 39 of 1994 (NSIA) violate the right to&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>In Uganda, the Tax Amendment Bills, 2021 is before Parliament for debate. If passed into law, will take effect from 1st July 2021. Among its goals are <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ug/Documents/tax/Uganda%20Draft%20Tax%20Amendment%20Bills%20Highlights%202021-2022.pdf?id=ke:2sm:3tw:4%23TaxAlert,%23Tax::6tax:20210401144115::4687826861:5&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_campaign=%23TaxAlert,%23Tax&amp;utm_content=tax&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;linkId=115105719">repealing</a> the top services (OTT) tax (reducing the rate of over the top tax from 20% to 12%) and introducing a new tax on internet&nbsp;data.</p><p>Zambia enacted a Cybersecurity and <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.zm/sites/default/files/documents/acts/Act%20No.%202%20of%202021The%20Cyber%20Security%20and%20Cyber%20Crimes.pdf">Cybercrime Act</a> which gives sweeping powers to the government to exercise greater control over social media and conduct communications surveillance without a court order. The Law has been quickly <a href="https://misa.org/news/zambias-newly-enacted-cybercrime-law-challenged-in-court/">challenged</a> in the High Court of Zambia by a coalition of civil society organizations who are praying the court to declare the law unconstitutional.</p> Arrests and detentions <p>In Zimbabwe Devine Panashe Maregere and his wife Vongai Nomatter Chiminya were both arrested in January for sending <a href="https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/africa/couple-detained-for-claiming-mnangagwa-died-of-covid-19-3272772">a message</a> on WhatsApp claiming that President Emmerson Mnangagwa had died of Covid-19. They were charged at Beitbridge magistrate court with publishing or communicating falsehoods.</p><p>On February 9 2021 Innocent Bahati, a poet and singer was <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/03/30/rwanda-arrests-prosecutions-over-youtube-posts">reported missing</a>. He was last seen a few prior in Nyanza, Southern Province. Innocent’s poems, which he recited in videos posted on YouTube, focused on issues such as poverty or criticism of the government, for which he had once been detained.</p> Countering Business as usual in Q2&nbsp;2021 <p>Why digital rights violations persist in the most brazen forms such as Internet shutdowns and clampdowns on freedom of expression in Africa has roots in the broader dysfunctional state of politics and society in general on the continent. We can only improve human rights standards when there has been a more fundamental change in the way our societies are run — which will include key institutional reforms in electoral democracy and economic justice. It is a campaign we’ve <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/internet-shutdowns-in-2021-c2a4e8dd4845">commenced</a> in Q1 2021 and will gladly continue in Q2&nbsp;2021.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/what-happened-with-digital-rights-in-africa-in-q1-2021-93a890cf3e2d">What happened with digital rights in Africa in Q1 2021?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Steady improvement and extension of the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/pull/121">Q&amp;A document</a> keeps going in parallel to the spec/whitepaper and the implementations 
 KERI is moving from a first-cut "promiscuous mode" proof of concept to the next stage of development: securing an internal interface for local events to protect a controller's authoritative key event log from contamination by potentially malicious external events and receipts.
 
 This entails designing a query mechanism for communicating requests for key events that manages the multisig escrow and the duplicity-detection log key

<p>Scalable, Flexible Infrastructure for Decentralized Identity</p><p>This week, the DIF Steering Committee officially approved the first major release of the Sidetree Protocol specification, "v1" so to speak. This protocol has already been implemented, and four of its implementers have been collaborating intensively for over a year on expanding and extending this specification together.</p> What exactly is a “Sidetree”? <p>Sidetree is a protocol that extends “decentralized identifiers” (DIDs), one of the core building blocks of decentralized identity. &nbsp;Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) enable a person or entity to securely and directly “anchor” their data-sharing activities to a shared ledger, secured by cryptography. The first generation of DID systems accomplished this with a 1-to-1 relationship between “blockchain addresses” (cryptographic identities) and the more flexible, powerful addresses called DIDs. These latter functioned as privacy-preserving extensions of the blockchain addresses to which they were closely coupled. In this way, each DID effortlessly inherited the formidable security guarantees of those blockchains-- but in many cases, they also inherited scalability problems and economic models that were a bad fit for many DID use-cases.</p><p>Sidetree is a systematic, carefully-engineered protocol that loosens that coupling between anchor-points on a distributed data system (usually a blockchain) and the DID networks anchored to them. Crucially, it replaces the 1-to-1 relationship with a 1-to-many relationship, pooling resources and security guarantees. Depending on the use-case and implementation strategies chosen, the protocol can optimize for scalable performance, for developer-friendly ergonomics and SDKs, for the portability of DIDs and networks of DIDs across multiple anchoring systems, and even for high-availability in low-connectivity contexts where a global blockchain cannot be relied upon directly.</p><p>The name “sidetree” combines two hints as to its early technical inspirations and superpowers. Each Sidetree network functions as a kind of identity-specific “Layer 2” overlay network where participating nodes root aggregated operational data into transactions of the underlying chain. This mechanism has many high-level conceptual similarities with the “sidechains” of other “Layer 2” systems, such as the &nbsp;Lightning network running atop Bitcoin or state channel implementations on Ethereum. It also shares with merkle “trees” (and <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/#further-resources">DAGs</a> like IPFS) the self-certifying property of content-addressability, a core building block of decentralized and distributed systems.</p><p>Leveraging concepts from sidechains and “Layer 2” network protocols, Sidetree was first <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/blob/master/sidetrees/explainer.md">proposed</a> by Microsoft’s Daniel Buchner and has been incubated in the DIF community, evolving along the way with major contributions from a growing list of DIF members.</p> The team that delivered the specification <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ownyouridentity">Microsoft</a> (Redmond, WA, USA)<p>A global consumer and enterprise app, service, hardware, and cloud infrastructure provider whose mission is to empower every person to achieve more. Microsoft is proud to have worked on Sidetree and implemented the Sidetree protocol via its contributions to ION. As a key piece of infrastructure that is foundational to its Decentralized Identity work, Microsoft is committed to the continued development of Sidetree and ION in DIF.</p><a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey</a> (Toronto, ON, Canada)<p>SecureKey is a leading digital identity and authentication provider, and is a champion of the ecosystem approach to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, revolutionizing the way consumers and organizations approach identity and attribute sharing in the digital age. This ecosystem-first philosophy informs our investment in Sidetree as a protocol for extensibility and scalability, which can evolve its featureset, and its network model over time. &nbsp;Of particular technological interest to us is how Sidetree can be overlaid on a wide variety of ledger and propagation systems. This will enable identity systems that span many use cases and work across public blockchains, federation and witness protocols, and permissioned blockchains without being locked to any particular ledger technology.</p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute Industries</a> (Austin, TX, USA)<p>Transmute uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to secure critical trade data by digitizing key trade documents so that they’re traceable and verifiable anywhere in the world, easily accessible and selectively shareable, searchable and auditable, and impossible to forge or alter. Transmute contributed to Sidetree’s development because it leverages batch processing capabilities to achieve enterprise scale and retains maximum optionality for our customers, allowing their business to span many blockchains and trust frameworks. Transmute sees Sidetree-based networks as necessary for scaling up decentralized identity capabilities to a global enterprise scale, where thousands of verifiable transactions per second can be processed at an unbeatable price.</p><a href="https://mattr.global">MATTR Global</a> (Auckland, New Zealand)<p>Mattr works with communities and a growing network of companies to shift industries like digital identity towards a more equitable future, providing tools to support digital inclusion, privacy and end-user control. Sidetree represents a significant leap forward in thinking around how to create truly decentralized infrastructure for resilient identifiers. We welcome the agnostic and extensible approach not just to distributed ledgers but also to content addressable storage and other building-blocks of flexible infrastructure. We look forward to integrating many of the DID systems coming out of the Sidetree standardization effort.</p> The first generation of Sidetree Systems <p>Transmute maintains Sidetree ledger adapters for Ethereum, Amazon QLDB, Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric. We also support interoperability tests with DID Key, the Universal Wallet Interop Spec, the VC HTTP API, and Traceability Vocabulary. Transmute has built Sidetree.js, an implementation of the Sidetree protocol based on the DIF’s codebase that focuses on modularity: it is a Typescript monorepo where each component of a Sidetree node (Ledger, Content Addressable Storage, Cache database) can be substituted with different implementations that use a common interface.</p><p>SecureKey &nbsp;has created a ledger-agnostic <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-core-go">Go implementation</a> of Sidetree along with <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/orb">Orb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> variations built on top. The <a href="https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/">did:orb</a> method enables independent organizations to create decentralized identifiers that are propagated across a shared decentralized network without reliance on a common blockchain. By extending Sidetree into a Fediverse of interconnected registries, Orb provides the foundation for building digital ecosystems on top of decentralized identifiers using a federated, replicated and scalable approach.</p><p>Microsoft is a primary contributor to <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a>, an open source, public, permissionless implementation of Sidetree on the Bitcoin ledger. There are several repositories and public utilities that make working with ION easier, including:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">ION GitHub repo</a>: the main repository for the code that powers ION nodes  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decentralized-identity/ion-tools">ION Tools</a>: JavaScript libraries for Node.js and browser environments that makes using DIDs and interacting with the ION network easier for web developers  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/install-guide/">ION Install Guide</a>: A step-by-step guide for installing an ION node  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/">ION Explorer</a>: A graphical interface for viewing DIDs and auditing other data transactions published to the public ION network.   What's next for Sidetree  <p>One significant feature on the horizon is to add support for pruning of verbose lineage data (which is no longer needed to maintain the secure backbone of DIDs in a Sidetree implementation) at Sidetree’s anchor points. This addition will allow Sidetree-based networks to purge upwards of 95% of legacy operation data in a decentralized way that maintains all of the security guarantees the protocol currently makes.</p><p>Another near-future feature is the so-called “DID Type Table.” DIDs in various DID Method implementations may be typed to provide an indication as to what they DID might represent. The Sidetree WG will publish a table of types (not including human-centric types) that stand for organizations, machines, code packages, etc., which DID creators can use if they want to tag a DID with a given type.</p><p>The medium-term roadmap is up for discussion, so if you have ideas <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html">get involved</a>!</p>

<p>Digital health passes — often mischaracterized as “vaccine passports” in the popular press — are making headlines as a key component in the drive to restore global travel and restart the global economy after the massive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Enabling individuals to receive and selectively share proof-of-test, proof-of-vaccination, and proof-of-recovery with the highest standards for security, privacy and data protection will allow destination countries and travel systems worldwide to accept credentials from multiple market vendors. But concerns related to equity and access can only be addressed if these health pass implementations are designed to be interoperable.</p>



<p>As the leading global consortium for interoperable digital trust infrastructure, the ToIP Foundation has partnered with the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> –&nbsp;a project of <a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020</a> –&nbsp;to host a new Working Group focused on the core issues of interoperability, privacy, and equity for digital health passes. The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pahttps://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=73790">Interoperability Working Group for Good Health Pass </a>consists of nine drafting groups, each focused on a specific interoperability challenge as defined in the<a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GHPC-Interoperability-Blueprint-Outline-v2.pdf"> Interoperability Blueprint Outline</a>.</p>



<p>“The Good Health Pass Collaborative is bringing people together to solve a set of problems that affect the entire world,” said John Jordan, executive director of the ToIP Foundation. “This ambitious effort uniquely aligns with the mission of ToIP because it requires interoperable digital credentials that can be accepted and verified anywhere they are needed. Getting this right, and doing so now, will not only make it safe for people to travel again, it will open the door for new tools and services that can solve other challenging problems that also require global-scale digital trust. For these reasons, ToIP is honored to contribute to this urgent global mission by hosting the Interoperability Working Group on behalf of the Good Health Pass Collaborative.”</p>



<p>Each drafting group, consisting of volunteer representatives from around the world representing the health, travel, technology, and policy sectors, will first conduct an intensive 30-day sprint to develop an initial set of draft recommendations. This will be followed by a second 30 day community and public review process to develop a final set of recommendations.</p>



<p>“Digital health passes –&nbsp;If properly designed and implemented –&nbsp;could offer a path to safely restore domestic and international travel, resume certain aspects of public life, and restart the global economy,“ said ID2020 executive director, Dakota Gruener. “Collaboration is critical at this juncture. Our organizations share a commitment to ensuring that digital health passes are designed and implemented in ways that serve the needs of the individuals and institutions that rely on them, while simultaneously protecting core values like privacy, civil liberties, and equity. ToIP has developed a powerful set of tools and models for digital trust frameworks, and we are delighted to be partnering with them in this critically important effort.”</p>



<p>The nine drafting groups collaborating within the new Working Group are:</p>



  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Paper+Based+Credentials+Drafting+Group">Paper Based Credentials</a> will define how a paper-based alternative can be created for any digital health pass so access will be available to all.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Consistent+User+Experience+Drafting+Group">Consistent User Experience</a> will specify the common elements required so that individuals can easily, intuitively, and safely use digital health pass implementations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Standard+Data+Models+and+Elements+Drafting+Group">Standard Data Models and Elements</a> will determine the core data items needed across all digital health pass implementations for both COVID-19 testing and vaccinations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Credential+Formats%2C+Signatures%2C+and+Exchange+Protocols+Drafting+Group">Credential Formats, Signatures, and Exchange Protocols</a> will specify the requirements for technical interoperability of Good Health Pass implementations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Security%2C+Privacy%2C+and+Data+Protection+Drafting+Group">Security, Privacy, and Data Protection</a> will define the safety requirements for Good Health Pass compliant implementations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registries+Drafting+Group">Trust Registries</a> will specify how verifiers can confirm that a digital health pass has been issued by an authorized issuer.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Rules+Engines+Drafting+Group">Rules Engines</a> will define how digital health pass apps can access different sources of policy information to determine what test or vaccination status is needed for a specific usage scenario.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Identity+Binding+Drafting+Group">Identity Binding</a> will specify the options for verifying that the holder of a digital health pass is the individual who received the test or vaccination credential.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Framework+Drafting+Group">Governance Framework</a> will define the overall set of policies that must be followed for an implementation to qualify as Good Health Pass compliant.  



<p>By adhering to the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint that will be synthesized from the outputs of these nine drafting groups, airlines, airports, hospitality industries, international customs officials and others will be able to process visitors easily without requiring additional unnecessary steps mandated by proprietary systems. Travelers will not be confused about which credential they need for each point of verification. Moreover, since individuals will be fully in control of their own personal data in credentials in their own wallets or devices, they can be confident that their private health data is not being tracked or misused.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interested organizations are invited to join the ToIP Foundation to participate directly in this new Working Group or in the public comment period in May. They are also encouraged to join the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> at ID2020 to participate in the construction, adoption, and advocacy of the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint.</p>

 Research Abstract 
<p>This session will provide information about research support resources and communities available at the local, regional, and national level, bridging researchers with the resources and collaborations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Topics will include national Cyberinfrastructure (CI) resources, such as XSEDE and Open Science Grid (OSG), Campus Research Computing Consortium (CaRCC), the Campus Champions network, regional communities and resources including the Eastern Regional Network’s (ERN) Broadening the Reach initiatives supporting less-resourced institutions,&nbsp;&nbsp;the NSF sponsored Cyberteams projects for advancing research and education in Eastern Regional Schools, and EdgeDiscovery enabling research and Innovation. As researchers become more reliant on the use of big data and sophisticated computing techniques such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, the demand for experts who can wield these tools effectively has grown considerably, the NSF CAREERS Cyberteam project strengthens the research computing career pipeline, increases the availability of research computing experts who can collaborate with researchers, and provide this support to underserved institutions. Northeast Cyberteam is addressing the challenges faced by smaller, mid-sized and under-resourced campuses by building a pool of research computing facilitators that can be shared across institutional boundaries. The regional networks have a significant role, such as Edge through EdgeDiscovery, in serving as facilitator and user support for the smaller institutions in advancing research and discovery.</p>

		 David Bader, PhD 
<p>Distinguished Professor, New Jersey Institute of Technology</p>
<p>Data science aims to solve grand global challenges such as: detecting and preventing disease in human populations; revealing community structure in large social networks; protecting our elections from cyber-threats, and improving the resilience of the electric power grid. Unlike traditional applications in computational science and engineering, solving these social problems at scale often raises new challenges because of the sparsity and lack of locality in the data, the need for research on scalable algorithms and architectures, and development of frameworks for solving these real-world problems on high performance computers, and for improved models that capture the noise and bias inherent in the torrential data streams. In this talk, Bader will discuss the opportunities and challenges in massive data science for applications in social sciences, physical sciences, and engineering.</p>

  Ceramic is a decentralized content computation network for a world of open source information.

<p>Ceramic is a public, permissionless, open source protocol that provides computation, state transformations, and consensus for all types of data structures stored on the decentralized web. Ceramic's real-time stream processing enables developers to build secure, trustless, censorship-resistant applications on top of dynamic information without trusted database servers.</p><p>This overview introduces how:</p>  Decentralized content computation gives rise to a new era of open source information  Stream processing provides an appropriate framework for dynamic, decentralized content  You can use Ceramic to replace your database with a truly decentralized alternative  <p>To skip ahead and get started building, try <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">Playground</a> to demo Ceramic in a browser application, the <a>Quick Start</a> guide to learn the basics using the Ceramic CLI, or follow the <a>Installation</a> page to integrate Ceramic into your project.</p><p>This post was originally published on the Ceramic documentation site. Contents here may fall out of date, but you can always find the most up to date version <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/overview/">here</a>.</p> The internet of open source information <p>At its core, the internet is a collection of applications running on stateful data sources – from identity systems and user tables to databases and feeds for storing all kinds of content generated by users, services, or machines.</p><p>Most of the information on today's internet is locked away on application-specific database servers designed to protect data as a proprietary resource. Acting as a trusted middleman, applications make it difficult and opaque for others to access this information by requiring explicit permissions, one-off API integrations, and trust that returned state is correct. This siloed and competitive environment results in more friction for developers and worse experiences for users.</p><p>Along other dimensions, the web has rapidly evolved into a more open source, composable, and collaborative ecosystem. We can observe this trend in open source software enabled by Git's distributed version control and in open source finance enabled by blockchain's double-spend protection. The same principles of open source have not yet been applied to content.</p><p>The next wave of transformative innovation will be in applying the same open source principles to the world's information, unlocking a universe of content that can be frictionlessly shared across application or organizational boundaries. Achieving this requires a decentralized computation network designed specifically for content with flexibility, scalability, and composability as first class requirements.</p> Decentralized content computation <p>Open sourcing the content layer for applications requires deploying information to a public, permissionless environment where files can be stored, computation can be performed, state can be tracked, and others can easily access content.</p><p>Advancements in other Web3 protocols have already achieved success in decentralized file storage. As a universal file system for the decentralized web, <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> (including <a href="https://ipld.io">IPLD</a> and <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a>) provides an extremely flexible content naming and routing system. As a storage disk, durable persistence networks (such as <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a>, and <a href="https://sia.tech/">Sia</a>) ensure that the content represented in IPFS files are persisted and kept available. This stack of Web3 protocols performs well for storing static files, but on its own lacks the computation and state management capacity for more advanced database-like features such as mutability, version control, access control, and programmable logic. These are required to enable developers to build fully-featured decentralized applications.</p><p>Ceramic enables static files to be composed into higher-order mutable data structures, programmed to behave in any desired manner, and whose resulting state is stored and replicated across a decentralized network of nodes. Ceramic builds upon and extends the IPFS file system and underlying persistence networks, as well as other open standards in the decentralized ecosystem, with a general-purpose decentralized content computation substrate. Due to Ceramic's permissionless design and unified global network, anyone in the world can openly create, discover, query, and build upon existing data without needing to trust a centralized server, integrate one-off APIs, or worry if the state of information being returned is correct.</p> Streams <p>Ceramic's decentralized content computation network is modeled after various real-time stream processing frameworks found in Web2. In these types of systems, events are ingested, processed in real-time, and the resulting output is applied to a log. When queried and reduced, this log represents the current state of a piece of information. This is an appropriate framework for conceptualizing how dynamic information should be modeled on the decentralized web. Furthermore because the function that processes incoming events on any particular stream can be custom written with logic for any use case, it provides the general-purpose flexibility and extensibility needed to represent the diversity of information that may exist on the web.</p><p>On Ceramic, each piece of information is represented as an append-only log of commits, called a Stream. Each stream is a DAG stored in IPLD, with an immutable name called a StreamID, and a verifiable state called a StreamState. Streams are similar in concept to Git trees, and each stream can be thought of as its own blockchain, ledger, or event log.</p> StreamTypes <p>Each stream must specify a StreamType, which is the processing logic used by the particular stream. A StreamType is essentially a function that is executed in real-time by a Ceramic node upon receipt of a new commit to the stream that governs the stream's state transitions and resulting output. StreamTypes are responsible for enforcing all rules and logic for the stream, such as data structure, content format, authentication or access control, and consensus algorithm. If an update does not conform to the logic specified by the StreamType, the update is disregarded. After applying a valid commit to the stream, the resulting StreamState is broadcast out to the rest of the nodes on the Ceramic Network. Each of the other nodes that are also maintaining this stream will update their StreamState to reflect this new transaction.</p><p>Ceramic's flexible StreamTypes framework enables developers to deploy any kind of information that conforms to any set of arbitrary rules as a stateful stream of events. Ceramic clients come pre-packaged with a standard set of StreamTypes that cover a wide range of common use cases, making it easy to get started building applications:</p>  Tile Document: a StreamType that stores a JSON document, providing similar functionality as a NoSQL document store. Tile Documents are frequently used as a database replacement for identity metadata (profiles, social graphs, reputation scores, linked social accounts), user-generated content (blog posts, social media, etc), indexes of other StreamIDs to form collections and user tables (IDX), DID documents, verifiable claims, and more. Tile Documents rely on DIDs for authentication and all valid updates to a stream must be signed by the DID that controls the stream.  CAIP-10 Link: a StreamType that stores a cryptographically verifiable proof that links a blockchain address to a DID. A DID can have an unlimited number of CAIP-10 Links that bind it to many different addresses on many different blockchain networks. CAIP-10 Links also rely on DIDs for authentication, same as the Tile Document.  Custom: You can implement your own StreamType and deploy it to your Ceramic node if the pre-packaged StreamTypes are not suitable for your use case.   Authentication <p>StreamTypes are able to specify their authentication requirements for how new data is authorized to be added to a particular stream. Different StreamTypes may choose to implement different authentication requirements. One of the most powerful and important authentication mechanisms that Ceramic StreamTypes support is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, the W3C standard for decentralized identifiers. DIDs are used by the default StreamTypes (Tile Documents and CAIP-10 Links).</p><p>DIDs provide a way to go from a globally-unique, platform-agnostic string identifier to a DID document containing public keys for signature verification and encryption. Ceramic is capable of supporting any DID method implementation. Below, find the DID methods that are currently supported by Ceramic:</p>  3ID DID Method: A DID method that uses Ceramic's Tile Document StreamType to represent a mutable DID document. 3IDs are typically used for end-user accounts. When 3IDs are used in conjunction with <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-20/CIP-20.md">3ID Keychain</a> (as is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a>), a 3ID can easily be controlled with any number of blockchain accounts from any L1 or L2 network. This provides a way to unify a user's identity across all other platforms.  Key DID Method: A DID method statically generated from any Ed25519 key pair. Key DIDs are typically used for developer accounts. Key DID is lightweight, but the drawback is that its DID document is immutable and has no ability to rotate keys if it is compromised.  NFT DID Method (coming soon): A DID method for any NFT on any blockchain. The DID document is statically generated from on-chain data. The DID associated to the blockchain account of the asset's current owner (using CAIP-10 Links) is the only entity authorized to act on behalf of the NFT DID, authenticate in DID-based systems, and make updates to streams or other data owned by the NFT DID. When ownership of the NFT changes, so does the controller permissions.  Safe DID Method (coming soon): A DID method for a Gnosis Safe smart contract on any blockchain. Typically used for organizations, DAOs, and other multi-sig entities.   Ceramic Network <p>The Ceramic Network is a decentralized, worldwide network of nodes running the Ceramic protocol that communicate over a dedicated topic on the Libp2p peer-to-peer networking protocol. Ceramic is able to achieve maximum horizontal scalability, throughput, and performance due to its unique design.</p> Sharded execution environment <p>Unlike traditional blockchain systems where scalability is limited to a single global virtual execution environment (VM) and the state of a single ledger is shared between all nodes, each Ceramic node acts as an individual execution environment for performing computations and validating transactions on streams – there is no global ledger. This "built-in" execution sharding enables the Ceramic Network to scale horizontally to parallelize the processing of an increasing number of simultaneous stream transactions as the number of nodes on the network increases. Such a design is needed to handle the scale of the world's data, which is orders of magnitude greater than the throughput needed on a financial blockchain. Another benefit of this design is that a Ceramic node can perform stream transactions in an offline-first environment and then later sync updates with the rest of the network when it comes back online.</p> Global namespace <p>Since all nodes are part of the same Ceramic Network, every stream on Ceramic exists within a single global namespace where it can be accessed by any other node or referenced by any other stream. This creates a public data web of open source information.</p> Additional node responsibilities <p>In addition to executing stream transactions according to StreamType logic, Ceramic nodes also maintain a few other key responsibilities:</p>  StreamState storage: A Ceramic node only persists StreamStates for the streams it cares to keep around, a process called "pinning." Different nodes will maintain StreamStates for different streams, but multiple nodes can maintain the state of a single stream.  Commit log storage: A Ceramic node maintains a local copy of all commits to the streams it is pinning.  Persistence connectors: Ceramic nodes can optionally utilize an additional durable storage backend for backing up commits for streams it is pinning. This can be any of the persistence networks mentioned above, including Filecoin, Arweave, Sia, etc. (coming soon).  Query responses: Ceramic nodes respond to stream queries from clients. If the node has the stream pinned it will return the response; if not, it will ask the rest of the network for the stream over libp2p and then return the response.  Broadcasting transactions: When a Ceramic node successfully performs a transaction on a stream, it broadcasts this transaction out the rest of the network over libp2p so other nodes also pinning this stream can update their StreamState to reflect this new transaction.   Clients <p>Clients provide standard interfaces for performing transactions and queries on streams, and are installed into applications. Clients are also responsible for authenticating users and signing transactions.</p><p>Currently there are three clients for Ceramic. Additional client implementations can easily be developed in other programming languages:</p>  JS HTTP client: A lightweight JavaScript client which connects to a remote Ceramic node over HTTP. The JS HTTP client is recommended for application developers.  JS Core client: A JavaScript client which also includes a full Ceramic node. The JS Core client is for those who want the maximum decentralization of running the full Ceramic protocol directly in a browser application.  CLI: A command line interface for interacting with a Ceramic node.   Getting started  Try Ceramic <p>To experience how Ceramic works in a browser application, try the <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">Playground</a> app.</p> Installation <p>Getting started with Ceramic is simple. Visit the <a>Quick Start</a> guide to learn the basics using the Ceramic CLI or follow the <a>Installation</a> page to integrate Ceramic into your project.</p> Tools and services <p>In addition to various standards referenced throughout this document, the Ceramic community has already begun developing many different open source protocols, tools, and services that simplify the experience of developing on Ceramic.

<p>The OpenID Foundation is proud to participate in the first ever ‘Identity Management Day,’ an annual awareness event that will take place on the second Tuesday in April each year. The inaugural Identity Management Day is&nbsp;April 13, 2021.</p>
<p>Founded by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/">Identity Defined Security Alliance</a>&nbsp;(IDSA), the mission of Identity Management Day is to educate business leaders and IT decision makers on the importance of identity management and key components including governance, identity-centric security best practices, processes, and technology, with a special focus on the dangers of not properly securing identities and access credentials.</p>
<p>In addition, the&nbsp;<a href="https://staysafeonline.org/">National Cyber Security Alliance</a>&nbsp;(NCSA) will provide guidance for consumers, to ensure that their online identities are protected through security awareness, best practices, and readily-available technologies.</p>
<p>From the point of view of an open identity standards development organization and with a hat tip to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">Kim Cameron’s 7 Laws of Idenity</a>, here are my 7 Laws of Identity Standards:</p>
 
 A identity standard’s adoption is driven by its value of the reliability, repeatability and security of its implementations. 
 A standard’s value can be measured by the number of instances of certified technical conformance extant in the market. 
 Certified technical conformance is necessary but insufficient for global adoption. 
 Adoption at scale requires widespread awareness, ongoing technical improvement and a open and authoritative reference source. 
 When Libraries/Directories/ Registries act as authoritative sources they amplify awareness, extend adoption&nbsp;and promote&nbsp;certification. 
 Certified technical conformance importantly complements legal compliance and together optimize interoperability. 
 Interoperability&nbsp;enhances security, contains costs and drives profitability. 
 
<p>On behalf of the OpenID Foundation, I want to thank Julie Smith, Executive Director of the IDSA for her and her colleagues’ leadership. The OpenID Foundation looks forward to supporting this important event in the years to come.</p>

<p>Tendermint, the team behind the interoperable blockchain ecosystem&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto/cosmos">Cosmos</a>, is building out a decentralized exchange (DEX) with a new acquisition.</p>
 
 
<p>The development studio has acquired B-Harvest, a decentralized finance project that has developed on Cosmos since the early days and which runs one of Cosmos’ validator nodes. Tendermint would not disclose all the details and dollar amount behind the acquisition, but it includes a four-year vesting of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/cosmos">ATOM&nbsp;(+3.17%)</a>&nbsp;tokens.</p>
 
 
 Tendermint will integrate B-Harvest’s Gravity DEX into Cosmos to facilitate “trustless and permissionless” trades, Tendermint’s CEO Peng Zhong told CoinDesk. 
 
 
 
 “We started working with B-Harvest in October because we were looking for a team with experience in finance and DeFi to create a decentralized exchange. With the Gravity DEX, it’s designed not just to be a native exchange for ATOM, but an exchange for tokens that use other blockchains, as well,” Zhong said.

				 <p>Verifier Universal Interface (VUI) is an interoperability working group that aims at building a complete set of standard APIs for Verifier components in SSI ecosystems</p>
<p>As different technology providers build SSI solutions, it becomes critical to ensure interoperability between these solutions. Available standards for SSI still have important gaps, leading us to an ecosystem of full-stack providers whose approach to interoperability is building proprietary plug-ins for each one of the other available solutions. This approach to interoperability is not scalable.</p>
<p>The underlying problem is that building standards take time. That is the reason that we propose a practical and focused approach to enable scalable interoperability in the SSI community.</p>
<p>We propose to start with a specific SSI component, namely the Verifier component, and lead the definition of the minimum set of standard APIs necessary to implement or interoperate with such module. That is, a role-centric approach to standardization at API level.</p>
<p>To date, 12 organisations are contributing to this initiative. The VUI working group has already drafted a first version of a generic spec that integrates existing standards and interop efforts and fills the gaps to provide a complete set of APIs. This draft version can be found at <a href="https://bit.ly/3h5VE7P">https://bit.ly/3h5VE7P</a> and has been built using ReSpec.</p>
<p>This draft version for VUI includes today 6 APIs:</p>
 
 Presentation Exchange 
 Consent Management 
 Schema resolution 
 Issuer resolution 
 ID resolution 
 Credential status resolution 
 
<p>Next steps <br>As next steps, the Working Group (WG) needs to take this ground work to a more mature level. That is, to further define the specification by achieving consensus in the broader community, and bridging perspectives from DIF, W3C, EBSI, and Aries.</p>
<p>The WG is organized in Working Packages (WP), one for each interface. Any participant can lead or contribute to WP, which shall integrate at least 2 Implementors and 1 Integrator. Implementors are responsible for defining the API, a set of interoperability tests, and service endpoints for Integrators to execute those tests.</p>
<p>The WG has launched a survey in the broad SSI community and two of the 6 interfaces have been selected as initial WPs:</p>

 And nominations are now being accepted <p>DIF was established to represent our fast changing community and to create a safe space for the co-development of next-generation code and specifications. From the original handful of members 4 years ago, the foundation has grown to become an organization with over 200 member companies, representing thousands of PRs and a strong commitment to decentralizing identity software.</p><p>Since its inception, DIF has been primarily governed by a Steering Committee. The Steering Committee is a &nbsp;group of member representatives whom lead DIF, set strategy, assure the high quality of ratified work items, react to the community’s needs, among other decisions.</p>Photo courtesy of <a href="https://unsplash.com/@element5digital">Element5digital</a><p>Over the last year, one of the main foci of the current Steering Committee has been restructuring itself to ensure it will represent the interests and diversity of its growing membership. Among the conclusions of this analysis was that a larger steering committee would garner more trust and visibility into DIF's internal governance as an organization. An operating addendum was adopted last month which formalizes procedures for periodic elections and distribution requirements. The following repackages those policies in the form of a Frequently Asked Questions document: for further clarification, see the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/c06c17bd2df58633eb74d9d5237281c79d9b676e/Org%20documents/Membership%20agreements/DIF%20Governance%20-%20Operating%20Addendum%20-%2020210304.pdf">addendum itself</a>.</p> 
    When are the dates and deadlines for this election cycle?
<br>  Announcement of election + Nomination starts - 8th April (Thu) 
 Last day for questions to candidates - 6th May (Thu) 
 Nomination Closes - 13th May (Thu) 
 SC ballot opens - 20th May (Thu) 
 SC ballot closes - 27th May (Thu) 
 New SC first meeting - 3rd June (Thu) 
 

    Who can be nominated and by whom?
    <br><p>Any individual who is active in DIF can nominate a DIF member to the Steering Committee, and/or get nominated for the Steering Committee by someone else. We recommend nominating members of the DIF community with high visibility and recognition, whether among DIF's membership or among the wider community. Only one individual can represent each DIF member organization, and there are distribution criteria to keep the Steering Committee balanced, but those considerations are applied *after* the election. This means that multiple colleagues from the same member organization can be nominated and accept that nomination, but only one of them can sit on the Steering Committee. The DIF membership includes Associate members, Contributors, individuals who signed a Feedback Agreement, and adjacent/partner organizations referred to as Liaisons (i.e. OIDF or Hyperledger).
    </p><p><br>
Nominations should be sent to the <a href="mailto:nominations@REMOVETHISidentity.foundation?subject=Nomination">nominations at identity.foundation</a> email address.
</p><br> 

    How and when do nominated people become candidates?<br>
    <p>Nominees will be contacted by DIF staff and must accept the nomination before the nomination period closes. Along with confirmation that they would serve if elected, they also provide a short biography and an optional statement describing their interest in and qualifications for serving on the Committee.
Early nominations are encouraged.
</p>
<br>
    How do voting members select which candidates to support?<br>
    <p>DIF Staff will share this list of accepting nominees and their statements with the membership via Slack. Since all Associate Members are eligible for one vote, it is recommended that colleagues within one member company confer or discuss in backchannel before submitting a vote on behalf of their whole company.</p>
<br>
    How can interested DIF members ask questions of all the candidates to help them decide?<br>
    <p>    
    If there are specific issues of interest to all or most of the DIF membership, any DIF member (whether they work at an Associate Member organization or not) may send clear questions to DIF staff.  Nominees should send these questions to the <a href="mailto:nominations@REMOVETHISidentity.foundation?subject=Questions_for_the_candidates">nominations at identity.foundation</a> email address, and a representative cross-section of these (lightly edited or unedited) will be compiled into a document sent to all nominees.
</p>
<br>
    Who votes and how?<br>
    <p>Only associate members can vote, and each votes as a whole on one ballot. This too is done as via email: ballots should be sent to the <a href="mailto:nominations@REMOVETHISidentity.foundation?subject=Ballot_for_NAME_OF_MEMBER_ORGANIZATION">nominations at identity.foundation</a> email address. These will be audited confidentially and not published in any way (not even as tallies). If one member organization accidentally votes more than once, DIF staff will reply to the emails to clarify the issue, so please use a monitored/normal email address in the organization's domain rather an personal accounts or "alts". All ballots are assumed to be collective/company-wide decisions even if multiple are received.</p>
<br>
    How many candidates can each associate member vote for?<br>
    <p>Each ballot should contain between 0 and X names, where X is the number of open seats.  Most elections, X should be between 4 and 6.  If less than X are named, the rest of the organization's votes are forfeited-- each vote counts singly.</p>
<br>
    When is the actual election period?<br>
    <p>DIF elections run for one week, from the distribution of the final list of candidates to one week later at midnight EST. In this election, those dates will be Thursday 20 May and Thursday 27 May, respectively. In the weeks leading up to 20 May, DIF staff will also contact all associate members to clarify any questions about the process and confirm the dates, the number of seats, the nominee statements, etc.</p>
<br>
    How often will the Steering Committee elections take place?<br>
    <p>They are expected to be annual, with 2-year terms to preserve continuity across elections.  If seats are unexpectedly made available between elections, they will stay open until the next election.</p>

<p>Energy Web is thrilled to be one of the three founding organizations behind the newly announced <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Crypto Climate Accord (CCA)</a>. In the next year, we anticipate dozens of novel approaches coming to market focused on decarbonizing the crypto industry in the spirit of the CCA. But we’ve also developed an open-source application that can play a major role in decarbonizing Crypto: <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero (EW&nbsp;Zero)</a>.</p><p>EW Zero is a public, low-cost application built on top of the open-source Energy Web stack that helps renewable energy buyers drive their carbon footprint to zero via purchases of different renewable energy products, such as <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/prec">impact-rich renewable energy certificates</a> from emerging economies and power-purchase agreements. We can use EW Zero beginning today to help the crypto industry achieve the provisional targets of the CCA by 1) helping crypto holders directly decarbonize crypto holdings while 2) enabling entire crypto networks to decarbonize from the bottom-up.</p> Demand-side solution: help crypto holders directly decarbonize their crypto&nbsp;holdings <p>Because of how energy markets are structured, cryptocurrency producers (such as miners) in many places around the world have very little choice in exactly where their power comes from. And even where that choice exists, given the extremely fragmented nature of renewable energy markets and regulatory frameworks with varying degrees of support for renewables, finding the right renewable energy product is a daunting task. EW Zero attacks both of these problems head-on by providing renewable energy buyers with a digital application for locating, procuring, and claiming emissions reductions from verified renewables around the world in a user-friendly, streamlined way.</p><p>In the spirit of the CCA, EW Zero can be used by crypto holders to make their crypto holdings green. Whether you are an institutional cryptocurrency investor, a retail crypto hodler, application developer, crypto service provider, or an exchange, EW Zero enables you to purchase renewable energy equal to the non-renewable energy used to create and maintain your cryptocurrency holdings.</p><p>This isn’t a new concept: corporates from around the world have been purchasing low-carbon products to help decarbonize supply chains in support of corporate sustainability objectives. In climate-speak, this concept of covering the power consumption from crypto purchases/holdings is analogous to actions to reduce Scope 3 carbon emissions. What’s new here is that we’re using EW Zero to apply these kinds of transactions to decentralized sources of power consumption: blockchains.</p><p>Here’s a simple example: you are an institutional cryptocurrency investor who purchased 20,000 BTC. Based on publicly available data, we can estimate the amount of electricity attributable to your 20,000 BTC holdings each year. By extension we can estimate the total carbon footprint of your BTC by making assumptions about how green various grids are around the world (in fact, one of the provisional objectives of the CCA is to develop an industry-wide open source account standard to make this even easier). With that information in hand, you can use EW Zero to search for different renewable energy products around the world. You can then buy enough renewables to make-up for the non-green energy that went into your 20,000 BTC. There are several renewable energy products to choose from: energy attribute certificates (EACs) from existing and future assets, power-purchase agreements, and onsite solar. Energy Web will encourage buyers to support impact-rich EACs, in part because locationality standards are less applicable compared to standard corporate renewables procurement. And once you’ve bought your renewables, you can “claim” the emissions reduction from them since EW Zero makes it easy for buyers to trace the full lifecycle of every megawatt-hour of clean power they bought all the way back to the specific power plant that the energy came&nbsp;from.</p><p>This is just one example for an institutional buyer. We can make the same kinds of transactions possible in a more automated way for retail crypto holders via exchanges (think “green crypto” features directly on your favorite exchange) and integrations with&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>This is just what we can do with EW Zero today. Our vision is for a whole new category of “negative emissions” products to make their way onto Zero. Here, instead of purchasing renewable energy, cryptocurrency holders invest in different negative emissions projects from around the world to remove and lock away carbon associated with their crypto holdings.</p> Supply-side solution: enable crypto networks to decarbonize from the bottom-up <p>Grids around the world are decarbonizing and so are the blockchains underpinning them. However, verifying and credibly measuring the share of crypto production powered by renewables is extremely challenging since most data come from self-reported surveys and proxies (see <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/18/18642645/bitcoin-energy-price-renewable-china">Vox’s article </a>on this topic) and entities like crypto miners don’t normally get the certificates or bills they need to prove where their renewables come&nbsp;from.</p><p>EW Zero and other components of the Energy Web stack address exactly this issue irrespective of the geography or market. Crypto miners and other blockchain actors will be able to automatically track renewables consumption at any given time and report that while preserving privacy. These claims will be, on the other hand, verifiable using a validation mechanism. For example, imagine a miner has onsite solar connected to the grid. This solar, along with the miner, each have unique, self-sovereign digital identities verified by trusted sources like corresponding solar manufacturers and local grid operators. All relevant events, such as estimated power production and excess power sent to the grid, are documented and validated on a highly granular level (e.g., every 30 minutes). That way, this specific miner can provide a verifiable proof of renewably powered, mining-related consumption anywhere in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The last point is key for all industries, not just crypto. Today corporates face significant challenges with reporting their impact in countries without an official tracking system. Energy Web’s open-source tech stack solves this issue. This proposed concept is similar to how Google and Microsoft are working to make their data centers 100% renewably-powered on an hourly basis according to when their data centers actually consume electricity in line with the emerging <a href="https://www.energytag.org/">EnergyTag</a> standard for&nbsp;EACs,</p> Join the Crypto Climate&nbsp;Accord <p>We are excited to act on the goals of the CCA and decarbonize blockchains. Interested companies from the energy and crypto sectors can join the CCA by contacting Energy Web directly via <a href="mailto:doug.miller@energyweb.org">doug.miller@energyweb.org</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/making-crypto-green-with-energy-web-zero-301cf4a979e5">Making Crypto Green with Energy Web Zero</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>1.What is the mission and vision of one37 Solutions?</p>



<p>Our mission is to unlock the potential of the universal identity with privacy, security and trust, one experience at time.</p>



<p>Our vision is to deliver unparalleled personalized user experience built on decentralized secure identity platform.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>The economic costs of the fragmented identity systems across various channels and businesses, the weak identity systems resulting in identity theft, SIM swaps and account takeovers, and increased corporate liability due to data breaches and regulatory non-compliance are skyrocketing and taxing in both existing and emerging markets.</p>



<p>The implementation of trustworthy digital identity systems will have exponential effects on the market growth and efficiency by streamlining and simplifying daily processes between citizens, governments and service providers in existing markets looking for efficiency and in emerging markets looking to close their digital gap and gaining security and speed of implementation.</p>



<p>At the onset, the rollout of decentralized identity systems seems both timely and significant. However, considering the various challenges that the global industries such as travel and healthcare have been currently facing in the form of security threats, adherence to health norms or regulatory compliances, there is a digital race to incorporate all of the above through a single trust platform while also ensuring a truly seamless experience. Thus, to stay competitive and build customer loyalty, there needs to be a paradigm shift in the way new advancements in technologies can be incorporated to balance such rising risk and opportunity demands.</p>

<p>There are some things you can do alone. Others are better done together. Blockchain is one of them.&nbsp; Companies across all industries will face a complex and potentially controversial set of questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Understanding and Awareness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I increase the understanding of Blockchain in my organization?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main problems associated with Blockchain are a deep misunderstanding of the technologies associated with it and a widespread lack of understanding of how it works, especially in industries other than banking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Collaboration and Federation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What problems and opportunities does my organization share with others in its industry? </p>
<p>Blockchain’s strength lies in creating maximum value for companies operating in the same industry sector and in areas with the same issues and opportunities. However, what is still problematic about current application methods is that they are compartmentalized approaches. Companies focus on their private blockchains, effectively negating the primary value of the blockchain – the network effect – and thus producing a less efficient result than a traditional approach. </p>
<p>3.Corporate Culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who will be most affected by the implementation of a blockchain project? </p>
<p>Although many industries have already undergone significant transformations with Digital Transformation, the implementation of Blockchain represents another complete departure from traditional approaches. It bases its reliability and authority on a decentralized network, rather than a central institution, and this loss of control can be deeply destabilizing for businesses. A Blockchain is about 80% business process change and 20% technology implementation. This means that a more open approach is needed to understand the opportunities and changes going forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Costs and Benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the costs and benefits of a Blockchain project?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Startups don’t ask themselves this question and have already started to use Blockchain technology by creating new businesses and solutions to replace existing ones. On the other hand, it is traditional businesses that are asking this question because the benefits are not necessarily obvious. For large companies, Blockchain initially presented itself as something unforeseen and poorly understood. No company right now, however, feels like completely ignoring Blockchain because, given its gradual expansion, there is a fear that one day another competing company, which relies on a Blockchain system, will be a competitor.</p>

 An Open Letter to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Advocating for Financial Inclusion in its Regulations <p>April 7,&nbsp;2021</p><p>On December 23, 2020, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the US Treasury Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) regarding “<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/15/2021-01016/requirements-for-certain-transactions-involving-convertible-virtual-currency-or-digital-assets">Requirements for banks and money services businesses</a>” related to certain transactions involving convertible virtual currency (CVC) or digital assets with legal tender status (“legal tender digital assets” or LTDA). FinCEN is identifying additional statutory authority for the proposed rule under the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, providing additional information regarding the reporting form, and reopening the comment period for the proposal.</p><p>The<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0EAHbtr2GFDoK7_WlbrOJO1p8rUv9HrKCFBsPdnaUo/edit"> Sovrin Compliance and Inclusive Finance Working Group (CIFWG)</a> took the opportunity to submit its formal response to FinCEN on March 29, 2021 — focusing explicitly on how their proposed rules will impact financial inclusion.</p><p>Sovrin Foundation asked Amit Sharma, Chair of the Sovrin CIFWG, to tell us more about the potential impact of the NPRM, their response and recommendations to&nbsp;FinCEN.</p><p>Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the Sovrin CIFWG? What’s your mission and who are your group&nbsp;members?</p><p>The purpose of the Sovrin CIFWG is to advance the mission of financial inclusion globally, by addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by innovations in the financial services and payments landscape, and the attendant financial and regulatory compliance implications. We are an open group of traditional bank and non-bank financial institutions, regulators, policymakers, technologists, ethicists, and legal experts who monitor the challenges faced by the financially excluded and under-served. CIFWG focuses on how economic and regulatory technologies can bridge the gap between traditional banking compliance and associated risks injected by innovation. We have developed and been actively promoting the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SswHBZ1pwuIUcePeFe8czOoAOaHE78ij4okXuQq5OW0/edit">Sovrin Compliance and Inclusive Finance Rulebook</a>, an innovative best practices framework that extends traditional banking compliance and payments guidance to emerging fintech and virtual asset service providers (VASP) processes.</p><p>Q: What do you mean by global financial inclusion, and why is it important?</p><p>Global financial inclusion remains a desirable and necessary development goal — 1.7 billion adults lack a bank account[1], and millions more have limited or no access to traditional financial services around the world. Furthermore, “de-risking” — the efforts of financial institutions to terminate or restrict relationships of certain clients and customers — has continued to be amplified by the continued growth of global anti-money laundry (AML) / counter-terrorism financing (CTF) controls[2]. The result is a disproportionate impact for the financially under-served, the global poor, and institutions and sectors that provide services to these segments of the economy. The attendant consequences of financial exclusion cannot be overstated given that remittances from migrant workers alone total over $500 billion a year (three to four times foreign aid) and is a vital source of finance for poor countries.</p><p>Q: What is the NPRM regarding “Requirements for banks and money services businesses” proposed by FinCEN&nbsp;about?</p><p>The December NPRM proposed to address the threat of illicit finance with respect to certain transactions involving CVC or LTDA by (a) establishing new reporting requirements for certain CVC or LTDA transactions analogous to existing currency transaction reports, and (b) establishing new record keeping requirements for certain CVC or LTDA transactions that is similar to the record keeping and travel rule regulations pertaining to funds transfers and transmittal of&nbsp;funds.</p><p>On January 1, 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (Division F of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283?link-type=html">Pub. L. 116–283</a>) (“AML Act of 2020”) became law. FinCEN proposed that by regulation, CVC and LTDA are monetary instruments because they are “similar material” to “coins and currency of a foreign country, travelers checks, bearer negotiable instruments, bearer investment securities, bearer securities, [and] stock on which title is passed on delivery[3].”</p><p>Q: What do you think about the NPRM? How does it impact the fintech sector and its key stakeholders?</p><p>We believe combating illicit finance activities is necessary and a top priority for FinCEN. But efforts to serve both law enforcement equities and financial inclusion do not present a binary choice. An effective anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime should also prioritize increased engagement of financially underserved, de-risked and/or excluded parties to foster a financial system that provides enhanced participation, greater transparency, and innovation in domestic financial systems.</p><p>Further, the data on illicit finance risks in the CVC sector don’t necessarily support the need for the proposed rule changes which are motivated to strengthen law enforcement and regulatory oversight efforts. According to a recently released report by Chainalysis, illicit activities or crime related to virtual assets has continued to decline, with the illicit share of cryptocurrency activity falling to just 0.34% in&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Importantly within the data analyzed by Chainalysis, the concentration of illicit activities has shown to be primarily with a “small group of shady cryptocurrency services, mostly operating on top of large exchanges, [who] conduct most of the money laundering that cybercriminals rely on to make cryptocurrency-based crime profitable[4].” This data would seem to call for more targeted efforts by law enforcement to concentrate investigations of criminals by identifying owners of these deposit addresses and the organizations that are conducting deliberate money laundering operations at scale (among otherwise legitimate activities).</p><p>As such, we are concerned with the proposed rules as they impact a growing sector that is increasingly providing solutions to marginalized and financially excluded constituencies. Also, organizations operating in CVCs, including fintech companies, virtual asset services providers (VASPs), and other similar organizations may fall under the broader definition of nonbank financial institutions or money services businesses/money transfer operators (MSBs/MTOs) that already face enormous scrutiny by mainstream financial institutions when evaluating their respective risks related to onboarding into new accounts. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) itself has acknowledged the fact of de-risking disproportionately impacting certain sectors like MSBs/MTOs[5].</p><p>Q: What is the role of the CVC services in regards to global financial inclusion, and how secure are&nbsp;they?</p><p>As CVC services continue to evolve and grow, so do the applications and opportunities inherent in facilitating greater inclusion of underserved and marginalized communities and organizations into the global financial ecosystems. As such, self-hosted wallets are playing an increasingly important role with virtual assets, as global financial operations continue to be unbundled, and an ongoing trend toward de-centralized financial services continues unabated[6].</p><p>Self-hosted wallets enable anyone with an internet connection to transact with others in digital assets on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis. Additionally, these wallets can be used to store value or digital assets securely and provide capability for the user/consumer to hold resources personally that enable them to interact in the fiat and digital financial context. This enables consumers to transact with counterparties directly without the need for a third-party intermediary–similar to making a cash transaction for a purchase of a good, pay an expense, or transfer value to a friend or family&nbsp;member.</p><p>When combined with blockchain technology, P2P transactions are arguably more secure and more transparent than activities undertaken in cash, as the convenience of cash and the efficiencies that come with electronic payments are combined with the risk controls associated with pseudonymous transactions that are not otherwise dependent on a specific financial intermediary[7].</p><p>Q: In sum, what are your recommendations to FinCEN regarding the&nbsp;NPRM?</p><p>We really appreciated the opportunity to comment on the NPRM. We believe that any proposed rule should explicitly include a thorough assessment of the threats to financial inclusion that may come about with such a proposal, and the Agencies should consider the concerns outlined in the response in our letter as part of such an assessment.</p><p>Secondly, increased targeted enforcement and requirements for transaction monitoring would strengthen law enforcement regulatory intentions with the proposed rules vs a more wholesale application of record keeping and reporting for related to all noncustodial wallet holders and their activities. In short, a smaller group of actors are engaged in such activity, and enforcement and regulatory measures should be better targeted to them vs the industry as a whole — especially in light of the financial exclusion implications of such proposed&nbsp;rules.</p><p>Strengthening financial inclusion, including by encouraging innovation in the financial services arena with technology applications that extend beyond existing banking and payments systems can actually provide enhanced security, risk and compliance controls, while bringing greater opportunities to marginalized and otherwise financially underserved or excluded communities. The underlying technologies include:</p>  The facilitation of cross-border remittances via P2P and blockchain networks that provide efficiency, cost advantages and security;  The enhanced auditability and traceability of transactions conducted via these applications that better enable financial services regulators and law enforcement interests; and  The application of digital and sovereign identity management capabilities that strengthen know-your-customers processes and customer information programs while preserving the essential privacy protections inherent in financial services.  <p>We welcome follow up with Agencies and participating members that are interested in providing guidance, examples and use cases of inclusion efforts — including the application of self-hosted/un-hosted wallets in particular.</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;Amit!</p><p>Anyone can download the full letter <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvQOHN9LeyoLAZFMgpYENLUXhYZaWClK/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

<p>By: FIDO Alliance staff</p>



<p>A major milestone has been realized, with the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI-Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) becoming the first organization to the achieve the Certified Authenticator Level 3+ level, which is the highest level of validation currently offered by the FIDO Alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The path toward the Level 3+ designation has been several years in the making.</p>



<p>Dr. Rae Rivera, Certification Director for the FIDO Alliance explained that the Certified Authenticator program was originally launched in August 2018 in a bid to define greater levels of assurance for FIDO authenticators. She noted that the FIDO Specifications include an inherent amount of security and privacy. The goal with the Certified Authenticator program is to provide additional security assurances for the authenticators themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the first Certified Authenticator Level 3+ designation now granted, Rivera expects other organizations will follow, helping to improve strong authentication for users and organizations around the world.</p>



<p>“We’re continuing to see more pickup and uptake in the Certified Authenticator program,” Rivera said. “At each higher level, there’s less risk of a vulnerability.”</p>



<p>Understanding the Different Certified Authenticator Levels</p>



<p>There are three core levels (L1, L2, L3 and ) in the Certified Authenticator program with each level building on the requirements of the preceding level. Incremental additional assurance can be obtained to allow a vendor to achieve a “+” within each level (L1+, L2+, L3+).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program evaluates authenticators to answer the question ‘how well does the authenticator protect the private key?The most basic entry level is L1 which Rivera said a vendor can achieve by supporting and implementing the FIDO specifications. An authenticator certified at L1 provides protection against phishing and credential abuse.</p>



<p>Moving up to L2, Rivera noted that restricted operating environments are required to protect against malware attacks. When you get to L3 and L3+, Rivera said that it’s all about looking at hardware authenticators, and how they provide protection against brute force attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the core attributes of our higher level programs, specifically level three and three plus, is that they require the product to have what we call a companion program certification,” Rivera said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She noted that the companion program certification that has been defined for those higher levels is <a href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/">Common Criteria</a> &nbsp;which provides sets of evaluations and designations to help define the security posture for a given device or service.</p>



<p>“The higher level that you go, the less vulnerable the authenticator is to any kind of attack,” Rivera said.</p>



<p>Why the Level 3+ Certification is Significant</p>



<p>With BSI now certified at L3+ the door is open to others to follow the same path toward the highest level of security assurance.</p>



<p>“Personally I feel like this is a huge leap forward for the program,” Rivera said.</p>



<p>Rivera noted that to date there have been many products that have been certified at the lower levels of the Certified Authenticator program. Now that the first L3+ has been achieved she anticipates that there will be more interest from organizations to go through the program to gain that additional higher level of assurance.</p>



<p>“This certification clearly demonstrates the value of our certified authenticator program – particularly at the higher levels,” she said. “Government and regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, energy and education often have more sensitive use cases that require specific types of authentication into their networks. Vendors and relying parties in these markets see this as a benefit because it meets the need for hardware protection and is also Common Criteria certified.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>How Others Can Benefit from the First Level 3+ Certification</p>



<p>Now that BSI has hit the Level 3+ certification, there is now quite literally a path for others to follow.</p>



<p>Rivera explained that with the L3+ certification there is a protection profile associated with it. The protection profile contains all the components that are used to achieve the L3+. As such, another vendor could utilize the protection profile to develop their product to get certified at the higher level.</p>



<p>“The protection profile serves as good guidance for those that are seeking the higher levels as to what they need to do and what modifications they need to make to their implementation,” Rivera said. “BSI getting certified at Level 3+ has made it a little easier for others to start achieving this level.”</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation held three interop events for implementations of the OpenID Connect Federation specification during 2020.  The learnings from each were used to iteratively refine the specification after each round, just as we did when developing OpenID Connect itself.  The current specification is the result of the iterative rounds of improvement, informed by the experiences of multiple implementations.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/RolandHedberg">Roland Hedberg</a> for organizing these useful interop events and to all those who brought their code to test with one another.</p>

<p>First public reviews for 3 extensions to popular messaging standard Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) are open through April 29th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) TC are pleased to announce that three new AMQP specifications are now available for public review and comment:</p>



  Event Stream Extensions for AMQP Version 1.0  AMQP Filter Expressions Version 1.0  AMQP Claims-based Security Version 1.0  



<p>The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard for passing business messages between applications or organizations. It connects systems, feeds business processes with the information they need and reliably transmits onward the instructions that achieve their goals.</p>



<p>Event Stream Extensions for AMQP Version 1.0 defines a set of AMQP extensions for interaction with event stream engines, including annotations for partition selection and filter definitions for indicating offsets into an extension stream to which a link is attached.</p>



<p>AMQP Filter Expressions Version 1.0 describes a syntax for expressions consisting of property selectors, functions, and operators that can be used for conditional transfer operations and for configuring a messaging infrastructure to conditionally distribute, route, or retain messages.</p>



<p>AMQP Claims-based Security Version 1.0 describes an AMQP authorization mechanism based on claims-based security tokens.</p>

 <a href="https://www.neatebox.com/">Neatebox</a>, a Scottish pioneer of “Social Tech”, has been awarded the Inclusion and Empowerment Award by WSA 2020 and is announced as the only UK business within the <a href="https://wsa-global.org/2020/12/17/wsa-winners-2020/">WSA Global Top 40.</a> 
<p>The <a href="https://wsa-global.org/">World Summit Awards</a> select and promote digital solutions that address global issues and improve society. Backed by the UN, the final jury of 43 internationally recognised experts selected 40 solutions from 26 countries. The winning organisations are diverse, and united by their impactful solutions for local communities, their technical finesse and strength in&nbsp; design.</p>
<p>This prestigious win for Scotland and the UK is important because it further cements their position as global digital front-runners and central to the digital accessibility conversation. It highlights the need for businesses to be responsive to their customers needs, safety and comfort in the continuing public-health crisis. It helps us understand that safe, affordable solutions are available to ensure we are more disability aware.</p>
<p>Neatebox’s Founder and CEO, Gavin Neate, comments “to be recognised at any time is fantastic but to represent your country by winning a World Summit Award for Inclusion and Empowerment at a time when disabled people are under such dreadful strain due to the effects of COVID19 is truly inspiring for us all.&nbsp; We very much hope that this award will raise awareness of what is possible and lead to us to work with those countries and businesses who see the provision of services for disabled and vulnerable people as a reflection of their international stranding in the world.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The long-awaited vision of the Cosmos blockchain has now been realized, as holders of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/cosmos">ATOM&nbsp;(+4.83%)</a>&nbsp;token have voted through<a href="https://ibcprotocol.org/">&nbsp;inter-blockchain communication</a>&nbsp;(IBC), enabling assets to transfer easily between blockchains.</p>
 
 
<p>The<a href="https://cosmos.bigdipper.live/proposals/41">&nbsp;final vote</a>&nbsp;to enable the feature was 112 million to 75, overwhelmingly in support of activation.</p>
 
 
<p>In the simplest terms, IBC enables messages to travel between blockchains that have implemented the standard. The most obvious use case in crypto is sending messages to transfer tokens off one chain and onto another.</p>
 
<p>“At its core, IBC is a method of securely exchanging data between two independent (sovereign) blockchains. This means that any two blockchains that support IBC can send communication back and forth in a permissionless manner,” Zarko Milosevic, chief scientist at the blockchain consultancy Informal Systems, told CoinDesk by email.</p>
 
 
<p>This development has the potential to open up opportunities in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/what-is-defi">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a>&nbsp;sector, where a product on an application-specific blockchain could use an asset from a completely different chain.</p>
 
 
<p>For example, ATOM is the governance token for Cosmos, the blockchain built to enable IBC. “Previously, ATOM was relegated to the Cosmos Hub with regard to its utility as a governance token. It is now transferable and interoperable with all blockchains that support IBC,” Milosevic said.</p>
 
 
 Pent-up demand 
 
 
<p>One place ATOM may go: the Terra blockchain, which runs<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/anchor-launch-ust-stablecoin-dai-defi">&nbsp;a DeFi savings account</a>&nbsp;called Anchor. Terra could plug in to IBC and make ATOM one of the tokens its underlying money market will loan.</p>
 
 
<p>IBC was built into the Stargate upgrade enabled by the Cosmos ecosystem<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cosmos-upgrades-to-stargate-another-2017-ico-very-nearly-completes-its-vision">&nbsp;in February</a>. ATOM holders, however, opted to let Stargate run a bit longer and do further testing before enabling IBC. The vote put IBC into effect on Cosmos.</p>
 
 
<p>There was no delay between the vote and the feature going live. “Since it is a parameter change, it does not require for the chain to be halted,” Milosevic explained.</p>
 
 
<p>The activation of IBC is not enough for all blockchains to work in conjunction with each other, though. IBC is a protocol that other blockchains can use, but they must upgrade to the IBC standard.</p>
 
 
<p>That is theoretically possible for<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/one-network-many-chains-the-case-for-blockchain-interoperability">&nbsp;any blockchain to do</a>, but those built on Tendermint, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency.asp">consensus model</a>&nbsp;native to the Cosmos ecosystem, are likely to be the first to adopt the standard.

<p>The FAPI Working Group published a <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/faq/">FAPI Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> as a resource for those new to FAPI and implementing FAPI. This FAQ will evolve over time as the Foundation engages with new members like the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission as well as colleagues in the US, Australia, Brazil and other jurisdictions on their open banking initiatives which were <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/16/standards-adoption-and-the-adoption-of-standards-financial-grade-api-fapi-1-0-final-specifications-published/">recently highlighted in an OIDF blog</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the OpenID Foundation achieved a major milestone in <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/12/fapi-1-0-part-1-and-part-2-are-now-final-specifications/">publishing the Financial-grade API (FAPI) Parts 1.0 and 2.0 final specifications</a>. This is a true accomplishment for open banking initiatives worldwide.</p>
<p>Many organizations and jurisdictions have utilized the FAPI Implementers Draft 2 as the starting point of their adoption of FAPI in defining their open banking solution stacks. To assist these organizations and jurisdictions in transitioning from the FAPI RW Implementers Draft 2 to the FAPI 1.0 Advanced Final specification, Joseph Heenan, led the OpenID certification work and&nbsp; <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/src/master/FAPI_1.0/changes-between-id2-and-final.md">published a non-normative list of changes document</a>.</p>
<p>This document is a non-normative list of the changes between the second implementers draft of FAPI1 part 1 (read only / baseline) and part 2 (read-write / advanced) and the final versions:</p>
 
 Changes are listed as major if they may require alterations to implementations. 
 Changes are listed as minor if they are generally clarifications and are unlikely to require alterations to existing implementations that were already applying best current practice. 
 Most changes have both client and server clauses that reflect the same change to the protocol; such a change is only listed once below in the interests of brevity. 
 
<p>The progress and pace of standards development is a function of the contribution of human capital, especially domain expertise. The Foundation would like to thank member, Authlete, a consistent key contributor to the FAPI standards. Authlete’s contribution of Joseph Heenan’s time and talent that was key to the ongoing improvements in the evolution of the FAPI standard.</p>

<p>Chalk up a win for the good guys on data privacy.&nbsp; And California residents are the ultimate winners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in December, 2020, the Me2B Alliance submitted a <a href="https://me2ba.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ccpa-fourth-round-comments-letter.pdf">letter</a> to the Office of the Attorney General for the State of California. The letter was in response to proposed changes to the regulations adopted by the AG’s office to implement the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (CCPA). Our letter noted that the Alliance has a clear preference for privacy by default , which in this instance means that “opt in” (a consumer’s clearly stated preference to share her information and receive advertising) is a more respectful default standard than requiring consumers to “opt out.” Further, as our letter pointed out, “mandating opting-out of selling data is tantamount to a default setting allowing the selling of data.” Instead, people should be presented with a clear, affirmative statement to allow the selling of data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proposed section 999.315(f) of the California privacy regulations would have created a uniform button to signify the consumer’s ability to opt out of having her personal information sold online. Our letter observed that the problem with this approach is that the button is a generic checkmark icon. Research amply shows that these kinds of icons are less understandable as a user interface (UI) than a simple “do not sell my data” text statement.&nbsp; We also pointed out other infirmities with the icon approach, which the new regulations would have mandated for all businesses in California.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 15th, the AG’s Office of Administrative Law (OAL) approved additional CCPA regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice. Notably, the Department withdrew its original language mandating the “Privacy Options” icon. In its place is new language making commercial use of the icons optional only.&nbsp; In other words, our stated concerns about the icons were well received, and ultimately adopted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wish to thank the Department of Justice for considering and acting upon our concerns.&nbsp; We believe millions of residents of California will be better served by online privacy notices that more clearly communicate their rights to control access to their personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>5 Use Cases for an Immutable and Distributed Blockchain</p>
<p>Blockchain has two distinctive characteristics:</p>
<p>Immutability: written data cannot be changed<br>
Distribution: data is present in multiple locations</p>
<p>These two features enable an interesting set of new use cases</p>
<p>Immutability</p>
<p>Unlike a classic database, transactions and values in a blockchain cannot be overwritten and are secured by cryptographic systems that make it obvious if the data has been tampered with.</p>
<p>1 Currency platform: Cryptocurrency is definitely the most ‘visible’ element in a Blockchain, especially if it is public like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) are. Each currency transfer is immutable and the same token cannot be given to two different people at the same time (double spending).</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is an inexpensive unit of account for transactions and a system to boost the security of a Blockchain. It is sometimes represented by a Token, which is another form of an underlying asset Transaction platform: A Blockchain network can validate a series of transactions relating to the value of Cryptocurrency, documents or assets that have been digitised into a Token. (tokenized). Each time a consensus is reached, a transaction is immutably recorded on a ‘block’, which is a storage space.</p>
<p>2 Verification platform: The Blockchain keeps track of these transactions, which can then be verified as having taken place. The Blockchain is therefore this giant transaction verification platform that can handle both<br>
micro-transactions as well as high-value transactions.</p>
<p>Distribution</p>
<p>By increasing the number of server nodes, the ability of a hacker or hostile government to block the network decreases.</p>
<p>3 Distributed ledger: The Blockchain is also a distributed, public, time-stamped ledger that keeps track of every transaction processed on its network, allowing the user’s<br>
user’s computer to check its validity so that there can never be a double count. This record can be shared between multiple parties and can be private, public or semi-private.</p>
<p>4 Distributed Exchange: Cryptocurrency is the basis of the Blockchain. When Cryptocurrency is considered as any currency, it can become part of a financial instrument, leading to the development of a variety of new Fintech financial products: derivatives / options / swaps / synthetic instruments / investments / loans.<br>
In addition, many other traditional instruments will have their digital version, thus creating a new stock market for trading decentralised financial services.</p>
<p>5 Distributed network: from the point of view of architecture, the basic layer of the Blockchain is a Peer-to-Peer network. The network is the computer and a Blockchain is distributed because it is composed of thousands of connected nodes. The network is the computer.<br>
In essence, a Blockchain is not a cloud but is more like a light fog that is really everywhere.</p>

<p>Introducing the new Executive Director for Digital Identity NZ and formally farewelling Andrew Weaver as the outgoing Executive Director.&nbsp;<br><br>We are excited to announce that Michael Murphy joins us as the new Executive Director for DINZ. With a wide and diverse background, Michael is active in the investment and startup communities along with business mentoring.&nbsp;He had some early involvement in the Digital Identity Forum, the precursor to DINZ and so joins us with a broad understanding of the importance of digital identity in furthering a trust based economy and society.<br><br>Over the next few months Michael will be connecting with our members and stakeholders to better understand what people need and desire from the work of Digital Identity NZ and from the wider ecosystem activity, including the Trust Framework development being led by DIA.&nbsp;Please do make Michael feel welcome as he appears in various events in the near future.</p>



  



 Executive Director – Michael Murphy 



<p>Across several roles, Michael is focused on helping Aotearoa’s best and boldest entrepreneurs in creating truly world-class companies that will employ coming generations of Kiwis and underpin the economic and social development of our country.&nbsp;<br><br>As Executive Director at Digital Identity New Zealand, Michael sees trust and digital identity as being at the very heart of how people, communities, businesses and economies will thrive and prosper in a future driven by disruptive innovation.&nbsp;He is highly motivated to explore how the many threads of digital identity and trust can be most effectively woven together to create the firm foundations needed for the development of a truly trust based economy in Aotearoa, for the benefit of us all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his other roles as investor, director, advisor and mentor, Michael works with globally ambitious start-up and early-stage ventures as well as more established businesses, looking to innovate and adopt a more exponential mindset to drive their growth. Working across both groups, cross pollinating ideas and methods, is where Michael is most energised: bringing experience and disciplined entrepreneurship to early stage ventures and helping more mature businesses explore the opportunities for growth and manage the risks presented by these massively disruptive times.</p>



  



 Outgoing Executive Director – Andrew Weaver 



<p>From the 31st March we bid farewell to Andrew Weaver who has so ably steered DINZ as the inaugural Executive Director since&nbsp;November 2018.&nbsp;Andrew has been such an active and positive influence in&nbsp;the digital identity&nbsp;sector it is hard to imagine him moving on.&nbsp;As the Chair of the Executive Council of DINZ I have had the pleasure of working with Andrew weekly over the past two years and have great admiration for his approach to the role.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He has developed a fantastic platform from which we can continue the work of enabling a world where people can express their identity using validated and trusted digital means in order to fully participate in a digital economy and&nbsp;society.&nbsp;The fact that the past 12 months has seen&nbsp;DINZ&nbsp;adapt seamlessly to a world with COVID-19 is a testament to Andrew’s flexibility and professionalism in getting the work done.<br><br>Andrew, thank you for all you have contributed to the work of DINZ.&nbsp;We truly wish you all the best in wherever your journey takes you.&nbsp;<br><br>Michael, a warm welcome and we look forward to working with you!</p>

<p>By Beth Kanter, Chief Advocacy &amp; Strategic Communications Officer</p><p>For many women, March symbolizes more than just a month of observance. It’s a time where women across all industries and geographies celebrate the achievements of their peers and colleagues today and take a critical look at the opportunities they’re creating for young women just entering the workforce. It’s also a chance for us to celebrate the historic achievements of the pioneering women that came before us. At Omidyar Network, we’re constantly working to create a culture and world where all women have equitable access to the systems and powers that govern our daily&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Like many, I was inspired to do this work by the first woman in my life — my mother. My commitment to social justice was developed while watching her work as a special education teacher for more than 30 years. As an educator, she worked passionately to support and empower students who were often marginalized because of their race, class, or learning abilities. As an active member of her union, she understood why it was critical for people to have power and voice in the workplace. She taught me the importance of being engaged in my community and how to live my values and support my community through politics — one of my first memories is stuffing envelopes for our neighbor who was running for the Montgomery County Council and reading her NOW newsletter.</p><p>After her sudden death in 2000, I’ve always wondered what she would think of some of the unfortunate events the country has endured over the years. Part of me is relieved that she did not have to witness the horrors of 9/11, the recession, and the pandemic. On the other hand, I think she would have been amazed to see the remarkable women who have trailblazed their way through the world by challenging the status quo, reimaging what’s possible, and ensuring equality for the leaders of the future. My mom, along with other women before me, would have beamed with pride to bear witness to the accomplishments of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and most recently, Vice President Kamala&nbsp;Harris.</p><p>I am constantly awed and inspired by the incredible women grantees we work with at Omidyar Network who are shaping a new inclusive economy, ensuring a responsible tech ecosystem, and positively impacting our society.

 Drilling down: Co-development <p>Competitors working together in the&nbsp;open</p><p>Having gone over the subtleties and complexities of <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76?source=friends_link&amp;sk=c61c55cdec30169ea99471b9bd09e81b">open-source software</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-standards-e745d84d0495?source=friends_link&amp;sk=971c11824b0023758c34114cffc6c339">open standards</a> in general, we will now drill down into how exactly DIF advances both, in the form of a “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ) document. Topics covered&nbsp;include:</p>  What “standardization” means to DIF and what DIF means to standardization.  A newbie-friendly survey of how DIF relates to nearby organizations with overlapping or related&nbsp;foci.  What “co-development” and “coöpetition” really mean, concretely  <p>The next installment in this series will offer some concrete steps that a DIF member organization (or even a non-member organization) can take to roll up their sleeves and get involved.</p><p>We can start with this 2020 diagram of how specific specifications fit in the landscape of open-source and open-standards organizations. Click on the image below to download a clickable PDF&nbsp;file.</p><a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/raw/master/assets/ssi-architectural-stack--and--community-efforts-overview.pdf"></a>Src: E.D. Rouven Heck 2019, updated by Interoperability Working Group,&nbsp;2020 What is DIF’s role in “standardizing” decentralized identity? <p>The governance of the decentralized identity standards space is, by design, decentralized: many different complementary organizations make steady, focused progress on specifications and codebases. In these coextensive communities, each garners consensus and buy-in for a focused set of data models and protocols with overlapping scopes and functions. Claiming the mantle of central authority for decentralization would be a pyrrhic victory for any Standards Development Organization (SDO).</p><p>Having been founded as a joint development project, DIF’s guiding mission is to effect harmonization, interoperability, and usability among early adopters, growing rather than controlling the development community. This nurtures healthy competition in the market growing around these technologies and provides a space for competitors to work together openly but safely, balancing “code-first” open source approaches and “standards-first” or protocol-driven ones. Allowing any single standards body (even DIF itself) to set the tone for all of decentralized identity or speak on its behalf would run counter to this&nbsp;mission.</p><p>Instead, the DIF exists to support, promote and facilitate two processes that seem to contradict each other at first blush. On the one hand, DIF accelerates the advance of standards and pre-standard specifications and libraries for emerging, decentralized identity systems. On the other hand, DIF strives to decentralize the landscape of identity technology and encourage new forms of data governance, new business models, and meaningful competition in our corner of the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>We unite these two processes with a pragmatic, considered, and adoption-ready strategy that is grounded in cooperation with external stakeholders and adjacent organizations. Most of these focus more squarely on technical standards or industry coordination and development, or some narrower set of technologies or protocols; decentralizing identity requires a both/and approach, which is deeply encoded in the DNA of DIF as an organization.</p> Who are the other major organizations in decentralized identity? <p>Of the various standards development organizations with which DIF cooperates closely, the World-Wide Web Consortium clearly has pride of place. The core specifications of decentralized identity were incubated there. The verifiable credential <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">specification</a> was ratified (or in W3C parlance, moved to “candidate recommendation” status) over a year ago, and the decentralized identifier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">specification</a> joined it <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizedID/status/1372480031184842753">two weeks ago</a>. As its name would imply, the WWW consortium is squarely focused on the standards structuring the WWW: browsers, cookies, web servers, and other “agents” in the topology of public web browsing.</p><p>Many important standards and specifications for data formats outside of the web problem space take place at the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>), particularly around data representations, transports, and security engineering. This includes many primitives and building blocks of modern programming, like JSON representations, cryptographic primitives, and universal tokens and authentication standards, usage of which extends far beyond the public web. There is a traditional division of labor according to which the web’s data models are standardized at W3C and its protocols are standardized in the IETF, leading to a kind of odd-couple dynamic whereby two very different cultures have grown up around these specialties.</p><p>Another major site of coordination for primitives and building blocks is the more constitutively open-source-focused Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</a>). Originally a governance group for XML and the earliest forms of what we now call “Big Data”, OASIS saw its purview and power extended when various global trade and messaging standards were built extending XML. To this day, the Open Office document standards and much of the open-source tooling for PDF, DITA, and other non-proprietary document standards are still governed and advanced through&nbsp;OASIS.</p><p>DIF supports decentralized identity by incubating and co-developing prototypes and specifications, some of which are handed off to these more deliberative organizations for formal review and standardization where appropriate. Importantly, though, not all “pre-standards” work has as its goal a standardized or universalized version of that work. In many cases, a specification that was good enough to guide an experimental or contingent implementation making its way to market might serve its purpose well enough without further hardening.</p><p>These “DIF-terminal” specifications and sample implementations are apt contributions to the field and the market without going on to formal review. They serve to bootstrap and jumpstart other development by getting more credentials or identifiers into circulation, while growing the pool of developers experienced and excited about the technology and the community. This “build early” approach is crucial to refining and hardening other parts of the stack, as well as building up a market and its workforce.</p> How does DIF work together with these organizations? <p>DIF is not the only pre-standards organization in which specifications and implementations are co-developed by early adopters and explorers of this family of technologies and applications. Anywhere companies and individual experimenters collaborate on open-source projects, “co-development” is happening, but these too vary in the kinds of collaboration for which they have designed and optimized their processes.</p><p>The earliest work in this space, as well as much of the long-view-oriented work developing tooling for open-world data models and Linked Data tooling, takes place in the Credentials Community Group (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>) of the W3C. The CCG is a community group operated through the W3C but open to participants that do not pay W3C dues. It promotes and hosts pre-standards work and maintains dialogue with various other W3C groups, not just those chartered to work on the VC and DID specifications. Since the CCG is hosted by the W3C, it inherits many of the procedures and specification publication processes from the members-only processes of the Consortium. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage</a> working group is cosponsored by the CCG and DIF to maximize the community-wide participation creating a pre-standards specification for <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">Confidential Storage</a> structures that can serve many different kinds of decentralized identity and data&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The Linux Foundation houses a complex family of Hyperledger projects, which coordinate global contributors to massive open-source codebases that power blockchains and other decentralized data and identity systems. <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a>, the first major fit-for-purpose permissioned distributed ledger optimized for decentralized identity applications, is the oldest and most high-profile of the identity-focused projects in Hyperledger, designed to anchor decentralized identities and governed by the Sovrin Foundation.</p><p>Another major Hyperledger project is the modular and progressively more blockchain-agnostic <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries </a>community, which evolved out of Indy-specific open-source systems. The Aries Project offers many common libraries, entire single-language frameworks, and cross-framework protocols so that small companies can quickly build into an ecosystem of interoperable service providers and business models. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DID-Communications</a> working group is co-sponsored by Aries and DIF, allowing members of either group to participate directly in the specification of a DID-based communications protocol for the entire decentralized identity community, not just the ecosystem built around the Aries codebases.</p><p>Other groups also overlap and coordinate with DIF in their development of implementations and specifications in advance of formal standards. One of these is the OpenID Foundation (<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>), which governs increasingly widespread standards for authentication that federate identity systems across most of the commercial consumer internet. As with Hyperledger Aries and CCG, this <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ae0719a23e9405c6d61fc19c8b938277">relationship is formalized</a> as a “liaison agreement” between the two organizations, and also entails a Liaison Officer to coordinate the relationship; DIF’s DID Auth WG was put on pause in mid 2020 to focus on work happening in OIDF working groups, and hopes to re-open regular meetings to work on items on the DIF side again&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Another is the Linux Foundation’s first project devoted exclusively to data governance and related legal and ecosystem management issues, the Trust-over-IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a>), where many DIF members work on task forces and working groups on compliance issues, consent tracking, data-capture best practices, and industry-specific governance issues. The decentralization-friendly but wider-scoped <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, which promotes user-centricity and data subject rights in legacy identity systems, is also an important touchstone for regulatory and legal issues. The <a href="http://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> continues to maintain the active Indy production network and house many important <a href="https://sovrin.org/interoperability-series-linking-and-exchanging-attachments-with-verifiable-credentials/">collaborations</a> and <a href="https://sovrin.org/the-sovrin-community-releases-new-ssi-iot-whitepaper/">working groups</a>, and are represented in many DIF working&nbsp;groups.</p> Coöpetition and DIF’s particular brand of co-development <p>The way DIF relates to other organizations working in the same space arose naturally from DIF optimizing its processes for neutrality and collaboration between companies of different sizes and market positions. DIF’s culture is one of business collaboration aligned with the increasingly buzzy term “co-opetition” (sometimes spelled “coöpetition” to emphasize the pronunciation). The term is a portmanteau combining cooperation and competition, but the clearest definition might be “coöperation between competitors, who remain competitors before and after coöperating”.</p><p>“Coöpeting” early in the design process makes for a unique pact between competitors, one that is crucial to the DNA of DIF: it is a forward commitment, before the design process, to cooperate through and after release of an open standard or codebase. This kind of pact makes the most sense in situations where network effects and portability of data and users matter more than platform control and vendor lock-in. Indeed, when your business plan is to maximize openness and interoperability, you end up cooperating earlier and more deeply than in more siloed forms of “open source” development. After all, much of what we consider open-source wasengineered for a single vendor’s business goals and opened up after release, once all the major design decisions had been made and tested. The difference of timeline and design process is hard to overstate!</p><p>Put bluntly, committing to coöpetitive development of common standards and protocols is committing in advance to a truly open standard, rather than one which advantages its designers on its path to general adoption. This kind of pact is particularly useful when forged between companies that are direct competitors or companies of vastly different sizes.</p> Cooperating in the patent-free zone <p>In large part, competitors and companies of different sizes find it far easier to work together substantively on new ideas once a safe space has been established for new ideas. Startups stay up at night worrying that their best ideas could be patented out from beneath them by collaborators with well-staffed legal departments, and large enterprises hesitate to do any work in the open that might endanger their R&amp;D inventions. The solution for both is often coming together openly on a precisely-scoped working group or project with proper “IPR protections.”</p><blockquote>Put in plain language, the IPR agreements protecting DIF’s work prevent all contributors from taking legal action against the results of the group, whether on the basis of previously-held patents, or the new ideas originating in the&nbsp;group.</blockquote><p>The terms of these IPR agreements can seem cumbersome to people coming from non-profit or academic research, but in the private sector and particularly at industrial or global scale, the enforceability in global courts of ownership over ideas and patents is absolutely essential to software investments, infrastructural governance, and even geopolitics. The protocols, specifications, and libraries co-authored in an IPR-protected group can be thought of as safe dependencies, which cannot have their open-source status (i.e., their royalty-free status!) endangered by the current or pre-existing intellectual property of any of its contributors. The relative degree of this safety is of huge importance to infrastructural decision-making and long-term planning. These assurances can be an important insurance policy against one major risk in software development — patent action against code or its dependencies.</p><p>Another crucial way in which this kind of “co-development” protects participants from the risks inherent in cooperating with competitors is that DIF, not the contributing member organizations, “owns” the products of its members’ collective labors. In concrete terms, this means the ongoing governance, maintenance, and licensing of the products of working groups, often referred to as “technical control” of resulting code or specifications, stays with the Foundation rather than with any of the legal entities contributing. The risk that a trusted co-development partner will change its strategy, its culture, or its ownership and thus its governance structure is only one of the many unsavory surprises a product or a company can meet on the road to&nbsp;market.</p><p>This means that if the relationship sours between two parties collaborating on a standard or a reference implementation, the work might “fork” and take on two different future paths, but the version ratified by DIF stays open to the public under DIF’s management. In such a case, any DIF member can join the relevant group and maintain the project’s main branch, or influence future versions if the group continues the open work. In fact, DIF’s licensing even imposes some restrictions on contributing organizations forking a DIF collaboration to continue the work elsewhere, whether further development is carried out in the open or&nbsp;not.</p><p>It is important to note that DIF is not original here, but rather, standing on the shoulders of giants. We were founded within the Joint Development Foundation, now part of the Linux Foundation, and inherits not only their licenses and legal structures but also their culture of co-development and IPR protection. While the staff of DIF is happy to help socialize, navigate, and enforce these structures, none of us are lawyers and we defer to the professionals (including those available to DIF through the JDF) for all serious matters and conflict resolution on the subject of intellectual property.</p> Drilling further&nbsp;down <p>We’ve sketched out the different kinds of open source development and the many ways variously-open standards can structure markets, and positioned DIF among all these concepts and its neighbors in the community. There’s not much further down we can drill in general terms: it’s time to get particular and start positioning you and your organization in this landscape! In our next piece, we’ll sketch out how you can get strategic about open source, roll up your sleeves, and get your hands dirty at&nbsp;DIF.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-co-development-in-the-open-765a86ab153f">Drilling Down: [Co-]Development in the Open</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Berkman Klein Center event explores how technology factors into pandemic&nbsp;response Kendra Albert, Tanya Cooper, Roslyn Satchel, and Thema Bryant-Davis during a Berkman Klein Center event on “Marginalized Women, Technology, COVID-19, and Intimate Partner Violence.” Screenshot by Lydia Rosenberg.<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has upended myriad aspects of everyday life, from education to the economy to interpersonal relationships. For victims and survivors of intimate partner violence, the many struggles of escaping or finding support are particularly exacerbated by the pandemic. An <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/marginalized-women-technology-covid-19-and-intimate-partner-violence">event</a> hosted by the Berkman Klein Center explored how technology factors into this problem — how it can help, and how it can&nbsp;harm.</p><p>Moderated by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/roslyn-satchel">Roslyn Satchel</a>, a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center and the Blanche Seaver Professor of Communication at Pepperdine, the event convened an interdisciplinary group of scholars to discuss various issues surrounding intimate partner violence, particularly for marginalized women, during the pandemic. The discussion covered fostering safe spaces online, access to resources, and navigating the legal system during the pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://gsep.pepperdine.edu/about/our-people/faculty/thema-bryant-davis/">Thema Bryant-Davis</a>, an associate professor of psychology at Pepperdine University, and director of the Culture and Trauma Research Lab, spoke about coping with trauma and supporting victims and survivors.</p><p>“The reality is that COVID-19 has also increased the risk of intimate partner violence when we see the large number of people who are practicing physical distancing and social distancing. There has been less of a buffer, less of an opportunity to come outside of the home and to seek services. And so we are mindful of the urgency of this work, as well as the additional barriers that make help-seeking difficult,” Bryant-Davis said.</p><p>“Part of what we are mindful of in the midst of COVID is the need for technology to be utilized in order to reach survivors and in order to protect survivors and help us to heal and restore,” Bryant-Davis said. “Many clinicians like me are currently practicing telehealth solely, so working with people in their healing journey by phone and by Internet which has benefits and challenges.” She pointed to easier access to resources not requiring travel, but also the dangers of sharing spaces with&nbsp;abusers.</p><p><a href="https://law.pepperdine.edu/faculty-research/tanya-asim-cooper/">Tanya Asim Cooper</a>, associate clinical professor of law and director of the Restoration and Justice Clinic, shared her experience working with victims of intimate partner victims from a legal perspective and illustrated her work through a case&nbsp;study.</p><p>“Studies show racial disparities in domestic violence for victims of color, predominantly women and they are in the greatest danger,” she said. “From my experience and based on my research, victims of color generally are perceived as less credible victims, suffer more serious violence, and require more concrete evidence of abuse, especially physical violence. They need photographs, they need not just medical records, they need medical professional live testimony.”</p><p>These demands are hard for people to meet — especially during the pandemic, with courts closing and forcing victims to wait. Cooper described how her clinic transferred their work online, but how she worries about people lacking technological skills or access to the internet.</p><p>“If law enforcement and courts can’t or won’t assist, especially during the pandemic, let’s equip faith communities and other online communities where marginalized women go, and let’s equip them to help,” she&nbsp;said.</p><p>Several event participants mentioned the idea of fostering online communities and safe digital spaces during the event. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/kalbert">Kendra Albert</a>, a clinical instructor at Harvard Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic, prompted the panel to question some of the values embedded in technologies and online tools and how those can be challenged in the intimate partner violence&nbsp;context.</p><p>As examples, Albert cited how phone companies may provide data about recently contacted phone numbers because “insiders are assumed to be safe.” Albert also pointed to Facebook’s “People You May Know” feature as a tool that has been shown to suggest mutual friends but that may expose degrees of connection that should remain private, such as therapist relationships “It’s just one example of these technologies that are often built on the assumption that more connection is better, that Facebook wants to connect to all of us or thinking about sharing as a net good, while not considering the very real reasons that people’s sharing or engagement with these platforms might be deeply contextual and they may have concerns about this information getting shared more broadly,” Albert&nbsp;said.</p><p>Although these contexts and situations are often not considered when developing such technology or their values, marginalized people are able to adapt the technologies to their circumstances, circumventing the intended uses and norms, Albert&nbsp;added.</p><p>“The reality is marginalized folks have been using, thriving, and changing technologies that were built without them in mind forever, for as long as we’ve had technologies,” they said. “And that we can think of examples of marginalized folks innovating and actually driving these technologies forward as the things that create change and in some cases, create money for these platforms. So I think while still keeping in mind that domestic violence victims and survivors, especially domestic violence victims and survivors that are women of color, Black and brown women could be much better served by these platforms and that their needs for contextual controls and control over one’s information.”</p><p>Towards the end of the conversation, Satchel drew connections between the speakers; she highlighted the theme of safety and security and acknowledged that the event is continuing an important conversation about centering the experiences of marginalized people and the value of cross-disciplinary discourse.</p><p>“This question of safety and security is really animating the very core of this discussion. And as a communication ethicist, as a person who actually studies communication in a variety of contexts, I really value interdisciplinarity. Why? Because it allows for conversations like this to happen,” she said. “The beauty is that we’re coming back to a common core, marginalized women. Women who are marginalized by race, socioeconomic status, ability, gender, sexual orientation, language, ethnicity, immigration status, and many more caste markers have very unique experiences, unique experiences that may very well cause them to call for different solutions and different options for justice.”</p><p>A podcast version of the event is available <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/marginalized-women-technology-covid-19-and-intimate-partner-violence">here</a>.

<p>Recognition of the value of FIDO in European digital identity systems and eIDAS continues to grow.&nbsp; This month has featured two new updates in Europe on the FIDO front: the release of a landmark ENISA report that discusses the role FIDO2 plays in eIDAS, and the accreditation by the Czech government of a new eID solution using FIDO2.</p>



<p>In March 2021, the EU Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA) issued the report <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-report-remote-id-proofing">Remote ID Proofing</a>, which describes the current regulatory landscape and supporting standards for the European countries’ remote identity proofing laws, regulations and practices. ENISA’s report is based on the ETSI TR 119 460 and ETSI TS 119 461 documents, which describe the policies and practices for remote identity proofing among trust service providers in the EU. Especially the eIDAS regulation, the AMLD5 directive to prevent money laundering, and EU directives on issuing ID-cards and exchanging identity information have been taken into account from a legal perspective.</p>



<p>Several methods for remote identification are proposed in the ENISA report: video recorded sessions, identification based on eID schemes or electronic signatures, bank identification, scanning of existing ID-cards, or a combination of several methods. In particular the option to identify a user with an eID scheme is of interest from a FIDO perspective. The following statement is written in section “2.2.4 Electronic identification means” of the ENISA report:</p>



<blockquote><p>“A protocol used by several electronic identity means providers is OpenID connect. It is an authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0 and is specified by the OpenID foundation. This protocol allows to verify the identity of the applicant based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, and by obtaining basic information about the applicant. Another technology that can be used in eID solutions is FIDO2. The FIDO Alliance explains in a <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FIDO_Using-FIDO-with-eIDAS-Services-White-Paper.pdf">whitepaper</a> how FIDO2 can be used for eID means corresponding to eIDAS article 8.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In the very same month, the Czech ministry of interior <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/e-podpis-povinne-zverejnovane-informace-oznameni-o-udeleni-akreditace-pro-spravu-kvalifikovaneho-systemu-elektronicke-identifikace-poskytovatel-cz-nic-z-s-p-o.aspx">issued eIDAS accreditation</a> for the Czech domain registry CZ.NIC, meaning that their identity provider mojeID can deploy FIDO2 as an eID scheme at eIDAS level of assurance High under the following conditions:</p>



  The FIDO2 authenticator is FIDO certified at Level 2 (or higher)  The FIDO2 authenticator is based on a secure element that is certified at FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or Common Criteria EAL4 + AVA_VAN.5  The FIDO2 authenticator has a PIN set and the PIN is required for all transactions at level of assurance High  Username and password are used in conjunction with FIDO2  



<p>Both ENISA’s report on remote identity proofing and the official approval of CZ.NIC’s FIDO-based eID scheme are great examples of how FIDO has been recognized as a viable authentication protocol for eIDAS compliant eID schemes in the EU.</p>

<p></p><p>Having gone over the subtleties and complexities of <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76?source=friends_link&amp;sk=c61c55cdec30169ea99471b9bd09e81b">open-source software</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-standards-e745d84d0495?source=friends_link&amp;sk=971c11824b0023758c34114cffc6c339">open standards</a> in general, we will now drill down into how exactly DIF advances both, in the form of a “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ) document. In this FAQ, we'll cover what co-development means in general, at DIF, beyond DIF, and in legal terms. The next installment in this series will offer some concrete steps that a DIF member organization (or even a non-member organization) can take to roll up their sleeves and get involved.</p><p>Let's start with this 2020 diagram of how specific specifications fit in the landscape of open-source and open-standards organizations. &nbsp;Click on the image below to download a clickable PDF file.</p> What is DIF’s role in “standardizing” decentralized identity? <p>The governance of the decentralized identity standards space is, by design, decentralized: many different complementary organizations make steady, focused progress on specifications and codebases. In these coextensive communities, each garners consensus and buy-in for a focused set of data models and protocols with overlapping scopes and functions. Claiming the mantle of central authority for decentralization would be a pyrrhic victory for any Standards Development Organization (SDO).</p><p>Having been founded as a joint development project, DIF’s guiding mission is to effect harmonization, interoperability, and usability among early adopters, growing rather than controlling the development community. This nurtures healthy competition in the market growing around these &nbsp;technologies and provides a space for competitors to work together openly but safely, balancing “code-first” open source approaches and “standards-first” or protocol-driven ones. Allowing any single standards body (even DIF itself) to set the tone for all of decentralized identity or speak on its behalf would run counter to this mission.</p><p>Instead, the DIF exists to support, promote and facilitate two processes that seem to contradict each other at first blush. On the one hand, DIF accelerates the advance of standards and pre-standard specifications and libraries for emerging, decentralized identity systems. &nbsp;On the other hand, DIF strives to decentralize the landscape of identity technology and encourage new forms of data governance, new business models, and meaningful competition in our corner of the sector. </p><p>We unite these two processes with a pragmatic, considered, and adoption-ready strategy that is grounded in cooperation with external stakeholders and adjacent organizations. Most of these focus more squarely on technical standards or industry coordination and development, or some narrower set of technologies or protocols; decentralizing identity requires a both/and approach, which is deeply encoded in the DNA of DIF as an organization. </p> Who are the other major organizations in decentralized identity? <p>Of the various standards development organizations with which DIF cooperates closely, the World-Wide Web Consortium clearly has pride of place. The core specifications of decentralized identity were incubated there. The verifiable credential <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">specification</a> was ratified (or in W3C parlance, moved to “candidate recommendation” status) over a year ago, and the decentralized identifier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">specification</a> joined it <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizedID/status/1372480031184842753">two weeks ago</a>. As its name would imply, the WWW consortium is squarely focused on the standards structuring the WWW: browsers, cookies, web servers, and other “agents” in the topology of public web browsing.</p><p>Many important standards and specifications for data formats outside of the web problem space take place at the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>), particularly around data representations, transports, and security engineering. This includes many primitives and building blocks of modern programming, like JSON representations, cryptographic primitives, and universal tokens and authentication standards, usage of which extends far beyond the public web. There is a traditional division of labor according to which the web’s data models are standardized at W3C and its protocols are standardized in the IETF, leading to a kind of odd-couple dynamic whereby two very different cultures have grown up around these specialties.</p><p>Another major site of coordination for primitives and building blocks is the more constitutively open-source-focused Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</a>). Originally a governance group for XML and the earliest forms of what we now call “Big Data”, OASIS saw its purview and power extended when various global trade and messaging standards were built extending XML. To this day, the Open Office document standards and much of the open-source tooling for PDF, DITA, and other non-proprietary document standards are still governed and advanced through OASIS.</p><p>DIF supports decentralized identity by incubating and co-developing prototypes and specifications, some of which are handed off to these more deliberative organizations for formal review and standardization where appropriate. Importantly, though, not all “pre-standards” work has as its goal a standardized or universalized version of that work. In many cases, a specification that was good enough to guide an experimental or contingent implementation making its way to market might serve its purpose well enough without further hardening. </p><p>These “DIF-terminal” specifications and sample implementations are apt contributions to the field and the market without going on to formal review. They serve to bootstrap and jumpstart other development by getting more credentials or identifiers into circulation, while growing the pool of developers experienced and excited about the technology and the community. This “build early” approach is crucial to refining and hardening other parts of the stack, as well as building up a market and its workforce.</p> How does DIF work together with these organizations? <p>DIF is not the only pre-standards organization in which specifications and implementations are co-developed by early adopters and explorers of this family of technologies and applications. Anywhere companies and individual experimenters collaborate on open-source projects, “co-development” is happening, but these too vary in the kinds of collaboration for which they have designed and optimized their processes.</p><p>The earliest work in this space, as well as much of the long-view-oriented work developing tooling for open-world data models and Linked Data tooling, takes place in the Credentials Community Group (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>) of the W3C. The CCG is a community group operated through the W3C but open to participants that do not pay W3C dues. &nbsp;It promotes and hosts pre-standards work and maintains dialogue with various other W3C groups, not just those chartered to work on the VC and DID specifications. Since the CCG is hosted by the W3C, it inherits many of the procedures and specification publication processes from the members-only processes of the Consortium. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage</a> working group is cosponsored by the CCG and DIF to maximize the community-wide participation creating a pre-standards specification for <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">Confidential Storage</a> structures that can serve many different kinds of decentralized identity and data systems.</p><p>The Linux Foundation houses a complex family of Hyperledger projects, which coordinate global contributors to massive open-source codebases that power blockchains and other decentralized data and identity systems. <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a>, the first major fit-for-purpose permissioned distributed ledger optimized for decentralized identity applications, is the oldest and most high-profile of the identity-focused projects in Hyperledger, designed to anchor decentralized identities and governed by the Sovrin Foundation. </p><p>Another major Hyperledger project is the modular and progressively more blockchain-agnostic <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries </a>community, which evolved out of Indy-specific open-source systems. The Aries Project offers many common libraries, entire single-language frameworks, and cross-framework protocols so that small companies can quickly build into an ecosystem of interoperable service providers and business models. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DID-Communications</a> working group is co-sponsored by Aries and DIF, allowing members of either group to participate directly in the specification of a DID-based communications protocol for the entire decentralized identity community, not just the ecosystem built around the Aries codebases.</p><p>Other groups also overlap and coordinate with DIF in their development of implementations and specifications in advance of formal standards. One of these is the OpenID Foundation (<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>), which governs increasingly widespread standards for authentication that federate identity systems across most of the commercial consumer internet. As with Hyperledger Aries and CCG, this <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ae0719a23e9405c6d61fc19c8b938277">relationship is formalized</a> as a “liaison agreement” between the two organizations, and also entails a Liaison Officer to coordinate the relationship; DIF’s DID Auth WG was put on pause in mid 2020 to focus on work happening in OIDF working groups, and hopes to re-open regular meetings to work on items on the DIF side again soon.</p><p>Another is the Linux Foundation’s first project devoted exclusively to data governance and related legal and ecosystem management issues, the Trust-over-IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a>), where many DIF members work on task forces and working groups on compliance issues, consent tracking, data-capture best practices, and industry-specific governance issues. &nbsp;The decentralization-friendly but wider-scoped <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, which promotes user-centricity and data subject rights in legacy identity systems, is also an important touchstone for regulatory and legal issues. &nbsp;The <a href="http://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> continues to maintain the active Indy production network and house many important <a href="https://sovrin.org/interoperability-series-linking-and-exchanging-attachments-with-verifiable-credentials/">collaborations</a> and <a href="https://sovrin.org/the-sovrin-community-releases-new-ssi-iot-whitepaper/">working groups</a>, and are represented in many DIF working groups. &nbsp;</p> Coöpetition and DIF’s particular brand of co-development <p>The way DIF relates to other organizations working in the same space arose naturally from DIF optimizing its processes for neutrality and collaboration between companies of different sizes and market positions. &nbsp;DIF’s culture is one of business collaboration aligned with the increasingly buzzy term “co-opetition” (sometimes spelled “coöpetition” to emphasize the pronunciation). &nbsp;The term is a portmanteau combining cooperation and competition, but the clearest definition might be “coöperation between competitors, who remain competitors before and after coöperating”. <br></p><p>“Coöpeting” early in the design process makes for a unique pact between competitors, one that is crucial to the DNA of DIF: it is a forward commitment, before the design process, to cooperate through and after release of an open standard or codebase. This kind of pact makes the most sense in situations where network effects and portability of data and users matter more than platform control and vendor lock-in. Indeed, when your business plan is to maximize openness and interoperability, you end up cooperating earlier and more deeply than in more siloed forms of “open source” development. After all, much of what we consider open-source wasengineered for a single vendor’s business goals and opened up after release, once all the major design decisions had been made and tested. The difference of timeline and design process is hard to overstate!</p><p>Put bluntly, committing to coöpetitive development of common standards and protocols is committing in advance to a truly open standard, rather than one which advantages its designers on its path to general adoption. This kind of pact is particularly useful when forged between companies that are direct competitors or companies of vastly different sizes.</p> Cooperating in the patent-free zone <p>In large part, competitors and companies of different sizes find it far easier to work together substantively on new ideas once a safe space has been established for new ideas. Startups stay up at night worrying that their best ideas could be patented out from beneath them by collaborators with well-staffed legal departments, and large enterprises hesitate to do any work in the open that might endanger their R&amp;D inventions. The solution for both is often coming together openly on a precisely-scoped working group or project with proper “IPR protections.” </p><blockquote>Put in plain language, the IPR agreements protecting DIF’s work prevent all contributors from taking legal action against the results of the group, whether on the basis of previously-held patents, or the new ideas originating in the group. </blockquote><p>The terms of these IPR agreements can seem cumbersome to people coming from non-profit or academic research, but in the private sector and particularly at industrial or global scale, the enforceability in global courts of ownership over ideas and patents is absolutely essential to software investments, infrastructural governance, and even geopolitics. The protocols, specifications, and libraries co-authored in an IPR-protected group can be thought of as safe dependencies, which cannot have their open-source status (i.e., their royalty-free status!) endangered by the current or pre-existing intellectual property of any of its contributors. The relative degree of this safety is of huge importance to infrastructural decision-making and long-term planning. &nbsp;These assurances can be an important insurance policy against one major risk in software development -- patent action against code or its dependencies.</p><p>Another crucial way in which this kind of “co-development” protects participants from the risks inherent in cooperating with competitors is that DIF, not the contributing member organizations, “owns” the products of its members’ collective labors. In concrete terms, this means the ongoing governance, maintenance, and licensing of the products of working groups, often referred to as “technical control” of resulting code or specifications, stays with the Foundation rather than with any of the legal entities contributing. The risk that a trusted co-development partner will change its strategy, its culture, or its ownership and thus its governance structure is only one of the many unsavory surprises a product or a company can meet on the road to market.</p><p>This means that if the relationship sours between two parties collaborating on a standard or a reference implementation, the work might “fork” and take on two different future paths, but the version ratified by DIF stays open to the public under DIF’s management. &nbsp;In such a case, any DIF member can join the relevant group and maintain the project’s main branch, or influence future versions if the group continues the open work. In fact, DIF’s licensing even imposes some restrictions on contributing organizations forking a DIF collaboration to continue the work elsewhere, whether further development is carried out in the open or not. </p><p>It is important to note that DIF is not original here, but rather, standing on the shoulders of giants. We were founded within the Joint Development Foundation, now part of the Linux Foundation, and inherits not only their licenses and legal structures but also their culture of co-development and IPR protection. While the staff of DIF is happy to help socialize, navigate, and enforce these structures, none of us are lawyers and we defer to the professionals (including those available to DIF through the JDF) for all serious matters and conflict resolution on the subject of intellectual property.</p> Drilling further down <p>We’ve sketched out the different kinds of open source development and the many ways variously-open standards can structure markets, and positioned DIF among all these concepts and its neighbors in the community. There’s not much further down we can drill in general terms: it’s time to get particular and start positioning you and your organization in this landscape! In our next piece, we’ll sketch out how you can get strategic about open source, roll up your sleeves, and get your hands dirty at DIF.</p>

<p>By: FIDO Alliance Staff</p>



<p>What’s the role of FIDO authentication in financial services and what can be done to help consumers and issuers be more secure? Those topics were at the foundation of the Authenticate Virtual Summit: Modern Authentication for Financial Services, hosted by the FIDO Alliance on March 25.</p>



<p>The financial services focused event included speakers from eBay, Financial Data Exchange, Gemini, Google, Javelin Strategy and Research, Mastercard, JP Morgan Chase, StrongKey, Trusona and Visa, with topics spanning from the future of authentication to best practices on how to optimize the authentication experience for users.</p>



<p>In his opening keynote, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance noted that over the course of the pandemic there has been an increase in cyberattacks against financial services institutions, which has only heightened the need for stronger authentication methods.</p>



<p>“At the end of the day, the vast majority of statistics and the vast majority of these problems come down to fundamental truth, which is that we’re trying to run a hyper connected economy, a networked society, on a authentication model that simply is not fit for purpose and that of course is our dependence on passwords,” Shikiar said.</p>



  



<p>Shikiar detailed how the FIDO Alliance is working to help move the world away from passwords and help users benefit from stronger forms of authentication. In particular, FIDO is playing a key role in the financial services market across a number of categories. FIDO specifications are being used today by financial services firms to help protect online accounts against account takeovers and phishing attacks. A key goal is to also make it easier for organizations to use strong authentication. Shikiar emphasized that the FIDO Alliance’s tagline is: simpler, stronger authentication.</p>



<p>“If there’s one thing the industry has seen is that the more complex the approach is for MFA [Multi-Factor Authentication] , the less likely someone is to stick with it,” Shikiar said. “So for people to keep using strong authentication, it needs to be easy and single gesture, which is the core of FIDO’s approach.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Improving Authentication with FIDO at Visa</p>



<p>Visa is one of the world’s largest credit card brands and financial services firms on the planet and it sees FIDO as being a strong tool for helping to improve security and reduce fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a keynote presentation, David Henstock, Head of Identity and Authentication Products at Visa, observed that FIDO specifications have a significant role to play in helping to drive better outcomes within the payments industry. Henstock noted that what has increasingly occurred in recent years is that fraudsters are targeting the authentication layer.</p>



  



<p>“The question that always comes up is what can Visa do to help fight account takeover fraud?” Henstock stated. “The culprit more often than not is knowledge based authentication, or simply put&nbsp; – passwords.”</p>



<p>Henstock noted that FIDO is an easy way to upgrade from usernames and passwords to a more secure standard upgrading the authentication experience that sellers have. He added that overall FIDO helps to provide a better, more easy to use customer experience for authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO is also important to help with regulatory compliance. In Europe, the PSD2 [Payment Services Directive version 2] is a key driver for strong authentication adoption as it mandates the use of Strong Customer Authentication (SCA).</p>



<p>“If you’re doing digital commerce in Europe, you must abide by the SCA regulations,” Henstock said.</p>



<p>In a bid to help organizations with FIDO deployment, Arshad Noor, CTO at StrongKey used his Authenticate session to detail new capabilities in the StrongKey FIDO server that can help organizations meet the challenges of global requirements.</p>



<p>“We see a lot of confusion in the WebAuthn and FIDO ecosystem where people are confused between security capability, and the user experience that consumers go through when interacting with FIDO,” Noor said. “We believe that FIDO should first be viewed as a security technology, and second as a convenience technology.”</p>



<p>Consumer Confidence in Passwords is Declining</p>



<p>The need to move away from passwords isn’t just about regulation, it’s also about consumer confidence in the security of password based authentication.</p>



<p>In a session, Javelin Strategy &amp; Research analysts Rachel Huber and John Buzzard outlined the state of the market in terms of fraud and online security.</p>



  



<p>“We have discovered trend wise that consumer confidence with passwords is down substantially and I want to say -finally,” Buzzard stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Buzzard noted that consumers have begun to realize that stronger authentication methods including biometrics are effective ways to validate identity. He added that consumers are now indicating that they are ready to move away from passwords.</p>



<p>“Whether the password disappears, maybe it becomes sort of like the Mayor McCheese of the city in the sense that it’s there but it doesn’t mean anything if that’s what it requires,” Buzzard said. “That’s still okay because we’re ready to move forward with stronger forms of authentication.”</p>



<p>Payments and the Future of Authentication&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO standards are at the core of security efforts at eBay, which helps the online marketplace meet the needs of its diverse user base. In a panel on Payments and the Future of Authentication Ashish Jain, Product Management Executive, Identity, Mobility &amp; Analytics, eBay explained that a key challenge for his platform is having the right experience that can fit the needs and requirements of a broad customer base.</p>



  



<p>“When we started investigating FIDO and saw that it was supported by Google, Microsoft, and Apple, it gave us the confidence that it can meet the needs for a variety of our customers and hence, we continue to investigate and invest in the protocol,” Jain said.</p>



<p>For Christiaan Brand, Product Manager for Identity &amp; Security at Google, FIDO adoption started out as a way to help curb phishing risks and has evolved to become a way to help improve multiple aspects of security for both Google and its users.</p>



<p>“FIDO is one of those few security inventions, which aims to both address security and improve on that axis, while at the same time also improving on the usability front,” Brand said. “The FIDO components that have been built into the platforms nowadays do give our users, better and more secure experiences.”</p>



<p>For Ranjita Iyer, SVP, Identity Solutions at Mastercard, FIDO specifications are being combined with other standards including the<a href="https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/3d-secure/"> EMV 3D Secure</a> effort to enable a seamless authentication and payment experience that can lead to better approval rates for digital transactions and lower fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Integrating FIDO with other standards is also something that the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) is implementing with its stack. Don Cardinal, Managing Director, Financial Data Exchange explained in a session that his organization is dedicated to unifying the financial service industry around an interoperable royalty free standard for secure permission to access data.</p>



  



<p>“The whole idea is to stop sharing user IDs and passwords and stop using them in the entire session,” Cardinal said. “Ideally, if you have OIDC [<a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>] and FIDO throughout FDX you can enroll, use and consume the whole setup and never use a credential, which I think is really powerful in today’s day and age.”</p>



<p>Optimizing UX for Strong Authentication&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the technical details of FIDO specifications are critical to enabling strong authentication, optimizing the user experience is critical to adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the final panel of the day, Megan Shamas, Director of Marketing, FIDO Alliance noted that there is an effort that is currently underway to to test and improve the FIDO user experience. Guidance from that testing effort is set to be publicly available in late 2021.</p>



<p>Kerry Hebert, Design Director (CX/UI) at Visa emphasized that it’s likely that FIDO implementation hinges on user adoption and adoption is only going to happen if the user registers. She noted that for&nbsp; users to take the step of registering, they need to believe that there’s value in what it provides and in some way makes the consumer’s life a little bit better.</p>



  



<p>Kevin Goldman, Chief Experience Officer, Trusona strongly suggests that financial services firms not think about user experience as something that is bolted on to the end of the process. Rather he suggests that it’s an integrated part of the entire process of supporting and enabling FIDO standards.</p>



<p>Judy Clare, Vice President, Product Manager, Digital Identity and Authentication at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, suggested during the panel that from an experience perspective, FIDO engagement needs to be easily digestible for consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You really have to have that value proposition out there&nbsp; – what’s in it for me, and why should I be clicking through this and take an extra 30 seconds to sign up for it and then go on my way, because I am here to do something and this wasn’t it,” Clare stated. “So it’s really important to keep the user in mind.”</p>



<p>Next Up: More Authenticate Summits and Authenticate 2021 Conference</p>



<p>There’s much more content to come from the FIDO Alliance in 2021.</p>



<p>Looking forward there is another virtual event coming in June which will focus on strong authentication in Europe. Plans are also coming together for a physical Authenticate conference set for October in Seattle.</p>



<p>“In general, what we see is a lot of best practice sharing, everyone is in this together, and is motivated to help protect the networked economy and FIDO authentication presents a great way of doing so,” Shikiar said. “So we encourage you to certainly take part.”</p>

<p>Today, SecureAuth is an official member of the OpenID Foundation a non-profit international standardization organization committed to enabling, promoting and protecting OpenID technologies. As a distinguished member of the Foundation, SecureAuth also now has a voice in the elections for the governing body.</p>
<p>SecureAuth Innovation Labs is dedicated to actively supporting and participating in the Shared Signals and Events Working Group (SSE WG) of the OpenID Foundation. This includes research and development teams commitment to the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. This protocol serves as the identity layer for human-based and machine-to-machine communications alike, which is built into SecureAuth’s Protect platform.</p>
<p>Always at the forefront of innovation, SecureAuth has been a long-time advocate and contributor of the OpenID Foundation prior to becoming an official member. As a trailblazer of the interoperability and extensions of authentication protocols that are integrated into every app to verify users, SecureAuth aligned with the latest standards for customers across the ecosystem.</p>
<p>“We welcome SecureAuth’s membership in the OpenID Foundation and look forward to their contributions to the SSE WG and their support for open standards in identity, access control and authentication”, said Don Thibeau of the OpenID Foundation. “The success of the Shared Signals Working Group is one of the great hidden successes. One objective is to define mechanisms to deliver system implementers with an approved standard for securely sending signals and receiving signals, access and avoid account takeover.”</p>
<p>The mission fits with SecureAuth’s core objective, which is to enable the continuous assessment of risk and trust, by leveraging signal and events in a way that security can be achieved without compromising the user experience and sharing of security events, state changes, and other signals between dependent systems.</p>
<p>SecureAuth’s participation in the SSE WG will aid in implementing two new standards: Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol (CAEP) and Risk &amp; Incident Sharing and Collaboration Initiative (RISC).</p>

<p>What has your career journey looked like?</p>



<p>My journey has been far from a straight line. I have a BA in political science from the University of Alberta and a masters in African Studies from the University of Oxford. Since finishing my education, I’ve worked in multiple sectors and countries. I started in student journalism, shifted to the non-profit start-up space working on community development with a social justice lens and dabbled in academia for a bit. Eventually, I settled into public relations in Nigeria for 4+ years. Upon moving back to Canada, I spent time in customer experience strategy for a power utility before joining the Saskatchewan government, first as the director for digital citizen services and now for digital ID.</p>



<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?</p>



<p>I’ve never quite had a dream job but I always knew I wanted to make a positive impact in people’s lives and somehow do my part in making the world a better place. That’s why I am so drawn to the public sector.</p>



<p><br></p>
 
 
 


<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>I’m extremely fortunate to say that I’ve had very few challenges on account of my gender identity. That said, I’ve grown up in professional environments where the gender balance is more prevalent. I have heard enough horrendous stories from other female leaders to know that my experience is not the norm. My barriers have more come from age, especially in my earlier years of leadership. As a young leader people consistently assumed I knew less and could do less. We often undervalue our youth as a society and this is something I consistently remind myself of as I work with the next generation of youth.</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>Work life balance is sacred to me, as is my respect for deadlines, and those two things can often come into conflict. My general rules for myself and my teams:</p>



  Work to outcomes. Be clear on your deliverables and get the job done. But in doing so, set boundaries and prioritize.  Ask for help in doing this if you need it. We only have 8 hours in a day and weekends and evenings should be exceptions, not the expectation.  Take your holidays! Payouts and carrying over should be exceptions not the norm.  


 
 
 
<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?</p>



<p>Tech doesn’t have to be intimidating (look at my background!) and tech also doesn’t have to mean being a developer. But I do believe that, love it or hate it, tech will continue to grow ever more central to our society. Dig into your passion and spend the time to understand how technology is impacting, shaping and changing that space. If the actual technical details aren’t for you, look to the concepts, outcomes, and impacts that technology has to offer and dig in there.</p>
 



 

 
 
 


<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Lift people up. Lift people up. Lift people up.</p>



<p>This goes for all voices that need more prominence in our organizations, not just women. Take the time on projects, in meetings etc., to give space to those who may not naturally take it themselves. This can come in many forms:</p>



  End meetings with a round table.  Work with a teammate or colleague to help them find professional outlets to develop their passion.  Be a mentor and a coach.  Offer public praise and private – and always constructive feedback.  If you have a hand in assigning resources, prioritize diversity. Diverse perspectives always benefit an organization and provides opportunities to lift people up.  



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you? </p>



<p>Women are a very diverse group and our challenges are not homogenous. For those like me, who have faced very little discrimination on account of their gender identity, the challenge will continue to be to recognize and use that privilege to widen the conversation and create space, not just for other women but for all those along the gender spectrum. We cannot become complacent that equality for some women is equal to equality for all.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Find your passion. Hone your strengths. Dig into the details, stay outcomes focused and curious, and always, always stay open to feedback.</p>

<p>This is a transcript of a keynote originally delivered at the 2021 Stefan A. Riesenfeld Symposium, <a href="https://globalspeechunderpressure.com/">Global Speech Under Pressure</a>. The video of the speech can be viewed&nbsp;<a href="https://globalspeechunderpressure.com/recordings">here</a>.</p><p>Thank you so very much: both for this incredible honour and for these kind words. And thank you to everyone who is joining us today via Zoom or the livecast — I am deeply grateful that you are making the time to engage with us on the many important topics we will be discussing at the Symposium today and tomorrow. To me the honour to kick us off with a few words, so let me do&nbsp;that.</p><p>Freedom of expression is an important right in and of itself. It plays a key role in our societies as an enabler of democratic debate, in holding our leaders to account, and it is crucial for truth finding. It is a fundamental right for us as individuals: expressing our views, convictions and beliefs is a central aspect of our self-determination.</p><blockquote>…expressing our views, convictions and beliefs is a central aspect of our self-determination.</blockquote><p>Freedom of expression also is a basic right for us as we act and organise in groups: it allows us to share information with each other, exchange views and opinions, and debate matters that concern us all. The American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman Frederick Douglass summed up the important role freedom of expression plays by saying that: “To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker. It is just as criminal to rob a man of his right to speak and hear as it would be to rob him of his&nbsp;money.”</p><p>But one of the things that makes freedom of expression so especially important is the way in which it facilitates the enjoyment of other fundamental rights. Here, it is obvious to think of the role of the press in bringing wrongs to light and thereby helping the enforcement of human rights standards. And the press, often referred to as the “lifeblood of democracy”, is indeed crucial. However, what I am getting at is something more all-encompassing. It is the interconnectedness of the different human rights acknowledged in international and national frameworks, and the role freedom of expression plays in that constellation as a facilitator.</p><p>This special role that freedom of expression plays as a supporting right inevitably also has its drawbacks.</p><p>Because freedom of expression underpins and is so closely connected to the exercise of other rights, it is also open to exploitation for the purpose of undermining, abusing or even destroying these other rights. Put very simply: if you can make good things happen, it also offers an opening for bad things to happen. Today, I want to look at some examples of the benefits of freedom of expression in this facilitating and supporting role, and also reflect on some of the challenges it&nbsp;brings.</p><blockquote>Because freedom of expression underpins and is so closely connected to the exercise of other rights, it is also open to exploitation</blockquote><p>In doing so, I want to take a slightly broader view than many of us have the liberty of taking day to day, confronted with a world in which — currently by necessity due to the pandemic — we are living significant parts of our lives online. Much focus is placed at the moment on the challenges that technology and social media bring for freedom of expression — and human rights in general — in the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>In doing so, we don’t always properly take into account that the right — which the drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights wisely framed as applying without frontiers and as a right that can be exercised through any means — already has a history of having been tried and tested through a variety of contexts and rapid societal developments.</p><p>When I say this, I by no means intend to downplay the novelty of the developments we are seeing unfold at the moment, nor the speed or scale at which this is happening. But I do want to emphasise that the human rights framework has made it through a lot already and it is my view that it will be able to withstand this,&nbsp;too.</p><blockquote>…the human rights framework has made it through a lot already and it is my view that it will be able to withstand this,&nbsp;too</blockquote><p>Another aspect I want to place squarely within the frame before we enter into the panel discussions today and tomorrow (which I am very much looking forward to), is that the way freedom of expression plays out in different contexts, online and offline, is a manifestation of the choices we make as a society and the power structures that govern it. This is a consideration that I don’t think is always sufficiently taken into account. Too often the focus in our debates about free speech in the digital age lies in dealing with symptoms, rather than reflecting on their root&nbsp;causes.</p><p>To illustrate these points, I want to highlight three contexts in which we’ve seen freedom of expression facilitate other rights in both the offline and online contexts: publishing, protest, and the fight for LGBTQ rights. After that, I’ll conclude with some reflections that we can jointly look at in more detail during the various panel conversations of the Symposium.</p> Examples of Freedom of Expression as a Facilitating Right <p>The Impact of Printing and Digital Publishing</p><p>The ability to express ourselves in writing and to share those writings with others has facilitated a great deal of other rights and advances in our societies over the centuries. It has helped the promotion of freedom of religion, the right to health, the right to rest and leisure, education, culture, and generally allowed us to share ideas and scientific discoveries across frontiers when we were not yet able to text or e-mail each other in&nbsp;seconds.</p><p>To start with its offline variety: the printed word has been referred to as one of the “Four Great Inventions” of ancient China, alongside the compass, gunpowder, and papermaking. When the German goldsmith Gutenberg adapted the technique in the 15th century, it made printing more affordable, easier to use, and more accessible. Historians often note the printing press’ significance as an “agent of change” throughout history, including during the Reformation, Renaissance and Scientific Revolution.</p><p>The printing press also provided more general access to the written word, which in Europe had been the domain of universities and the church. Universities and church institutions managed libraries and if books needed to be reproduced, this was done by making careful copies by hand. These books were mainly written in Latin, which made them inaccessible to anyone who did not master the language, even if they were literate.</p><p>As printing made the production of written texts at scale so much easier and affordable, it became lucrative to start printing works in languages that were accessible to those outside of ecclesiastic and academic circles. By starting to print in languages other than Latin, “regular” languages were standardised. It also facilitated the creation of communities around commonly read works to discuss their&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Of course, this did not mean that anyone was able to get printed whatever they wanted. Governments were able to restrict what did and did not get printed, and the workings of the “market” also made sure that not just everyone was able to see their ideas published and circulated.</p><p>Prior restraint, a form of censorship that allows government to review the content of printed materials and prevent their publication, was, and in some countries still is, a reality. Just like the practise of banning certain books on grounds such as national security, or for being perceived as obscene or blasphemous. Here, it is good to keep in mind that even books we would deem fairly innocent now, such as Alice in Wonderland, Ivanhoe, and Oliver Twist, all have been banned by various governments at some point in&nbsp;time.</p><p>Besides government interference, “access” — a concept I always find hard to define, but which speaks volumes about our ability or inability to effectively get to those with power in our societies — to a large extent determined who got to publish. A lot of power lies in the hands of the publishing industry, whose decisions of what “audiences” will want to read are made by teams and individuals that, according to recent survey data, still are predominantly white, cis-gender, straight and able-bodied. This inevitably has led to an underrepresentation on the shelves of our public libraries and bookshops of authors that do not fit that&nbsp;picture.</p><p>The arrival of digital publishing and online self-publication has shaken up the publishing landscape to some extent, in the sense that the lower barrier for “access” and the lower cost of publishing mean that authors have more options to get their work out in public now that this no longer is the same as getting “printed”.</p><blockquote>The new publishing landscape also allows for marginalised groups to create their own platforms to fill a gap left by mainstream publications</blockquote><p>The new publishing landscape also allows for marginalised groups to create their own platforms to fill a gap left by mainstream publications and reach a wider, more international audience than would be possible with, say a physical “”, the nonconformist, self-published booklets made by&nbsp;hand.</p><p>This does not mean that we’re now, in the digital age, completely free from the power dynamics and censorship at play in traditional printing and publishing. First, the traditional barriers that exist for those who are systematically excluded remain: think of the time, space and resources it takes to write in the first place. The “room of one’s own” and money to support themselves that Virginia Woolf argued women needed in order to write was accessible only to a privileged few.</p><blockquote>…we should all wonder if bypassing a publishing house to directly e-publish on Amazon truly is a win for the free&nbsp;word</blockquote><p>Second, digital publishing brings its own specific drawbacks with it. The website of an online Zine can be geographically blocked, doxxed or taken down; and we should all wonder if bypassing a publishing house to directly e-publish on Amazon truly is a win for the free word, trading traditional publishing houses as gatekeepers for a trillion-dollar capitalist behemoth.</p><p>The Galvanising Effect of Seeing Civil Rights&nbsp;Protests</p><p>Freedom of expression has traditionally been closely linked to the right to protest and the right to assembly. We organise and take to the streets to express our views on matters we believe should change in our societies, to get those in power to listen to us and, sometimes, even to tell them to step down. An important role in this is played by the media, and nowadays by us as citizen journalists and activists.</p><p>Gil Scott-Heron said that the revolution will not be televised, but television did play an important role in advancing the fight for civil rights in the South of the United States. Dr Martin Luther King Jr. understood the role the press and television could play in the civil rights movement by helping make visible to audiences across the United States — where, by the early 1960s, about 90% of households had a television set — what the Black experience in the country was. In their history of television news, Unsilent Revolution, journalists Robert Donovan and Ray Scherer wrote that “The civil-rights revolution in the South began when a man and the eye of the television film camera came together, giving the camera a focal point for events breaking from state to state, and the man, Martin Luther King Jr., high exposure on television sets from coast to&nbsp;coast.”</p><p>This attention from the media is often credited to have helped activists and politicians push for the adoption of key legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in&nbsp;1965.</p><blockquote>…the news we get to see and read about entails editorial choices, as does the way in which it is presented to&nbsp;us.</blockquote><p>There are also some critical notes to be placed here, of course. Not only is who gets to broadcast determined by a licencing system, which is administered by the state; the news we get to see and read about entails editorial choices, as does the way in which it is presented to us. We’ll talk about the theoretical aspect of that in a moment, but I want to note here that the way in which events in the South were covered and the imagery of resistance that was spread was to a large extent shaped by the needs of the then-new television stations and their desire to connect with a wide audience across the US. I think I do not need to make explicit what the makeup of those news stations looked like — today, still, diversity within broadcasting and news companies is lamentable.</p><p>Social activist and civil rights movement leader Julian Bond summed up the media’s approach at the time as follows: “What the media craved was a steady diet of bold mass action campaigns in the streets, ideally faced by violent white resistance, which could dramatize the issues at stake and make good print or electronic copy.”</p><p>The television networks had a clear idea of what their viewers wanted to see, and this resulted in an imagery of Black suffering, combined with extraordinary restraint in not responding in kind to any violence endured. This means that other narratives and perspectives of the fight for civil rights, which was of course a lot more complex than the TV version, did not get a place on prime time television. To come back to Gil Scott-Heron: to the extent that the revolution was televised, it was only a small part of it, curated and made presentable and palatable for a predominantly white audience.</p><blockquote>…to the extent that the revolution was televised, it was only a small part of it, curated and made presentable and palatable for a predominantly white&nbsp;audience</blockquote><p>If television was the medium that controlled audiences at scale in the 1960s, social media platforms perform that function in our current day and age. And of course especially since the COVID-19 pandemic took on a global scale in early 2020. Here, we are not dependent on a state body granting broadcasting licenses or newsroom making editorial choices, but what we do and do not see appear in our timelines is just as curated, and guided by the terms of service on which social media platforms operate and the algorithms that make sure items either end up “trending” or quietly slip out of&nbsp;sight.</p><p>There are many examples of social media playing a role in organising protests offline, of which the street protests against structural racism and police violence against Black people and people of colour last year is a recent and vivid&nbsp;example.</p><p>The Black Lives Matter hashtag and movement was born in the summer of 2013, when labour organiser Alicia Garza responded on her Facebook page to the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the man who murdered Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</p><p>Following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, the Black Lives Matter movement swelled in numbers, with protests not only taking place across the United States, but also internationally. Social media facilitated much of the organising and allowed information, images and videos of protests to be instantly shared with millions worldwide.</p><blockquote>The live protests built on social media and after people took to the streets, the violent response to some of the demonstrations was livestreamed for all the world to&nbsp;see</blockquote><p>Another protest that we saw in 2020 was the #EndSARS demonstrations in Nigeria. The movement had started in 2017 to protest against police brutality in the country by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and was reinvigorated in October last year after new abuses were brought to light. The live protests built on social media and after people took to the streets, the violent response to some of the demonstrations was livestreamed for all the world to&nbsp;see.</p><p>This online sharing of information — photos, protest details, livestreaming videos — is also where the greatest vulnerability lies for movement organising. Surveillance becomes easy with so much information at the ready and it is something governments have made grateful use of and, of course, a variety of private companies have been able to monetise. By monitoring messages and images posted on social media, sometimes through the use of fake user accounts, and combining that with other information, it is possible to identify upcoming protests and even individual protesters.</p><blockquote>Surveillance becomes easy with so much information at the ready and it is something governments have made grateful use&nbsp;of</blockquote><p>While the FBI needed to get Attorney General Robert Kennedy’s approval to place wiretaps on Dr King’s home and offices in an attempt to discredit him and destroy his reputation, no such measures are needed when surveilling movements through public social media posts. The same information that helps us mobilise in the streets can be collected and turned against&nbsp;us.</p><p>Supporting the Fight for LGBTQ&nbsp;rights</p><p>Freedom of expression ties in with the fight for equal rights of LGBTQ people in many ways. Amongst others by bringing to light inequalities and calling for them to be addressed; through organising and demonstrating, as we just touched upon; and by supporting the expression of individual identity.</p><p>Just like exposure was important for the civil rights movement to get racial inequalities examined and addressed, it is important for many other rights movements to see their cause featured in the media. But: who decides what makes it into the morning paper and the evening&nbsp;news?</p><blockquote>But: who decides what makes it into the morning paper and the evening&nbsp;news?</blockquote><p>A well-established media theory is that of “Hallin’s spheres”, developed by journalism historian Daniel C. Hallin in the late 1980’s. Hallin divides the world of political discourse into three concentric spheres: the middle circle is the sphere of consensus, which concerns topics on which there is widespread agreement. In the sphere of consensus, journalists assume everyone agrees. There is not a lot of exciting material for them to cover there, but it is also not kept out of the press. The next circle is that of legitimate controversy, topics on which people hold differing views. These topics are the most important to cover for journalists: there will be a lot of interest in them and journalists can help facilitate an informed debate. The outer circle is that of “deviance”, a label we wouldn’t really choose anymore nowadays, and those are the topics that fall outside the bounds of legitimate debate. Journalists are free to ignore these topics in their coverage. What falls within these categories shifts as public opinion shifts, which of course raises a bit of a chicken and egg question on how public opinion can shift if no one is reporting on certain&nbsp;issues.</p><p>For a long period of time, LGBTQ issues were part of the third circle we just looked at: they were not reported on at all in mainstream media or only to a limited degree, and then often negatively. In response to a nationwide demand in the United Kingdom by lesbians and gay men to be able to access news on the gay and lesbian liberation movement, the newspaper Gay News was founded in 1972 in a collaboration between former members of the Gay Liberation Front and members of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality.</p><p>The paper played a key role in the struggle for gay rights in the 1970s in the UK. Described as the movement’s “debating chamber”, the paper reported on discrimination, progress that was made in the fight for political and social equalities, and campaigned for further law reform, including equal rights in employment and the trade union movement. It also published personal ads, even though this was illegal at the time, under the headline “Love knoweth no&nbsp;laws.”</p><blockquote>Overcoming the obstacle of publishing alone is not enough: if you want to also reach your readership, your paper will need to be distributed</blockquote><p>Overcoming the obstacle of publishing alone is not enough: if you want to also reach your readership, your paper will need to be distributed. And this is where Gay News ran into difficulty a number of times. It had repeated clashes with W.H. Smith, which controlled one-third of the newspaper and magazine distribution in the UK at the time and who initially refused to stock the paper due to an alleged “low potential for&nbsp;sales”.</p><p>In countries like the UK, distribution is less of a problem these days for LGBTQ publications. In addition to self-published online Zines as touched upon earlier, big commercial publishers like Condé Nast have started to take on intersectional queer publications like the community platform them. To speak with Hallin’s circles: they are no longer part of the “outer” circle. This is not to say that the playing field is even now, but the landscape is starting to&nbsp;change.</p><blockquote>Social media platforms more generally have served as spaces for community building, information sharing and organising for queer communities</blockquote><p>Social media platforms more generally have served as spaces for community building, information sharing and organising for queer communities. It is not entirely a rosy picture, however. While there is no need to rely on a conservative establishment to get content distributed, like Gay News had to if it wanted to effectively reach its audience, social media platforms bring their own obstacles. Content “moderation” is often skewed against queer expression, and platform policies, such as Facebook’s real name policy, which effectively forces transgender persons to use their dead name if they want to be able to access the platform, are highly problematic. Going online also doesn’t mean it is possible to fully escape government censorship: platforms tend to comply with local “gay propaganda” legislation like we see in, for example Russia, and take down LGBTQ content or suppress related hashtags and search&nbsp;results.</p><p>Freedom of Expression and&nbsp;Power</p><p>We just looked at publishing, protest, and the fight for LGBTQ rights, and how freedom of expression facilitates — and sometimes hampers — other rights both offline and online in those contexts. Now, before we move on to the panel discussions, I would like to share some further reflections on where we are with freedom of expression at the moment and what I believe we should be thinking of as we navigate the digital landscape.</p><p>At the outset of this talk, I said I did not want to downplay the challenges we are facing at the moment, with most of our lives moving online and the exercise of our human rights along with it. And it is of course a reality that the exercise of many of our rights are now taking place on private platforms.</p><p>But: the question how we hold “big business” to account for human rights violations is also something we have struggled with before speech moved online. We are all too familiar with the images of, for example, big oil companies destroying wildlife and the livelihood of farmers through their negligence, as well stories about the use of child slavery in the production of our food, clothes, and smartphones. And while the conversation about corporate social responsibility and business and human rights is still very much ongoing, there are some positive lessons we can draw on for rethinking responsibility and accountability when it comes to corporations.</p><blockquote>…the effectiveness of any of this, whether it is the responsibility of the Shells, Exxons or Facebooks of this world, will depend on political will.</blockquote><p>In the end, though, the effectiveness of any of this, whether it is the responsibility of the Shells, Exxons or Facebooks of this world, will depend on political will. How far are our societies, the governments that we elect, willing to go to guarantee that human rights are upheld, guaranteed and protected?</p><p>The main challenge is of course how the human rights framework is set up, which is state-centric: the state has a number of obligations — to respect, protect and fulfil human rights — vis-à-vis individuals. We are not yet at a stage where direct horizontal effect of human rights, which would allow individuals to seek redress for human rights violations from another individual directly, including from actors like companies, is a&nbsp;fact.</p><p>So for the moment, we will need to work within the framework that we have, which means that human rights enforcement against companies and corporations, including the platforms on which much of our public debate takes place nowadays, will have to go via the&nbsp;state.</p><p>And this brings us back to the question of power dynamics: as individuals, we are dependent on the state and the international systems that states have created to see our human rights respected. Who actually gets to seek redress is a matter of access to justice, which is by no means equally distributed. The quip that “justice is open to all, like the Ritz hotel” still very much holds&nbsp;true.</p><p>This is what often makes me a bit anxious about the discussions on “regulating platform power”. Especially when these discussions point towards putting in place more legislation, I get very nervous. As some of the examples we just looked at demonstrated, and the overall picture around the globe when it comes to protecting free speech and journalism shows, government is often the problem and not the answer when it comes to stifling the free flow of information.</p><blockquote>Especially when these discussions point towards putting in place more legislation, I get very&nbsp;nervous</blockquote><p>Take an example like the NetzDG legislation in Germany, which makes it mandatory for companies like Facebook to remove “hate speech” from its platform or risk hefty fines. Enthusiastically copied by countries across the world, often by countries that do not have a good track record when it comes to protecting free speech, and often modified to expand the type of speech that should be taken down, this type of legislation has been shown to incentivise an overly zealous approach to speech removal. Putting the wrong type of pressure on platforms, and giving governments more power to suppress expression is not the&nbsp;answer.</p><p>If we are talking about regulation, I am much more in favour of thinking in the direction of parallels to the way another powerful private sector, that of banking and finance, is regulated. This would include putting in place stringent transparency obligations: what is taken down and promoted online and why; how are these processes and decisions automated? It would need to be combined with clear and accessible procedures for people to seek redress for perceived violations within an acceptable timeframe (as “justice delayed is also justice denied”…).</p><p>My main qualm with theorising about “solutions” for the conundrum of online speech regulation, however, is that we must ensure to not mistake the manifestation of a problem for the problem itself. Our societies have big, structural problems: power asymmetries that maintain structural inequalities, institutional racism, capitalism. Whatever we create in that setting, including internet platforms, will reproduce that.</p><blockquote>…while it’s nice to think we can “fix the internet”, I believe we should have no illusions of succeeding beyond symptom suppression if we aren’t willing to look&nbsp;deeper</blockquote><p>So while it’s nice to think we can “fix the internet”, I believe we should have no illusions of succeeding beyond symptom suppression if we aren’t willing to look deeper at the root causes of why it’s broken in the first place. If we accept societies in which those whose human rights are routinely violated generally won’t be able to easily seek justice, how do we expect to do better when it comes to safeguarding their human rights&nbsp;online?</p><p>You have heard me be critical of our societies and its power structures and I imagine some of you might be asking the question: “But wait: what about the human rights system itself? This, too, is a product of those same power structures and interests.” This is a very good point, and one I often struggle with, especially when I am reminded of Audre Lorde’s quote that “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s&nbsp;house”.</p><p>Where I stand on this at the moment is a belief that we need to combine a longer-term, aspirational vision with a certain degree of pragmatism. Even if our human rights framework may not be perfect, it is a good place to start to fight for our rights as individuals and as communities. And while we do so, we can work on changing the system itself in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>In doing this, we have to continue to be mindful of the broader impact our work has. Will taking up this particular fight lower barriers for others or increase them? Are we trading individual success for common good? This will entail making difficult choices at times, in which especially those of us who are lawyers and litigators will need to set our egos aside and look beyond short-term wins and ask what structural, systemic change we want to work towards in the longer&nbsp;term.</p><p>Coming back to the right to freedom of expression, and the role it plays in facilitating not only other human rights, but also the very struggle for their realisation, I want to make one final&nbsp;note.</p><blockquote>Progress, especially if we want it to lead to addressing some of the fundamental power inequalities I mentioned before, requires vigorous debate and sometimes fiery disagreement</blockquote><p>And that is that it is important to make sure that, whatever we do, we don’t end up with a lowest common denominator approach or a restrictive interpretation of what a good space for debate is. Progress, especially if we want it to lead to addressing some of the fundamental power inequalities I mentioned before, requires vigorous debate and sometimes fiery disagreement. When I say this, I am not arguing for a right to insult, but rather for a right to provoke. Professor, feminist, and social activist bell hooks expressed this wonderfully in her 1994 essay “Censorship from Left and Right”, and I would like to close with her&nbsp;words:</p><p>“When repression via censorship becomes the norm in progressive political circles, we not only undermine our collective struggles to end domination, we act in complicity with that brand of contemporary, chic fascism that evokes romantic images of unity and solidarity, a return to traditional values, while working to deny free speech and suppress all forms of rebellious thought and action. In recent years, feminist thinkers have fought long and hard to make feminist thinking, theorizing, and practice a radical space of openness where critical dialogue can take place. Much of that struggle has been waged by women of color, beginning with the conflict over whether or not to see issues of race and racism as feminist agendas. Feminist movement, black liberation struggle, and all our progressive political movements to end domination must work to protect free speech. To maintain the space for constructive contestation and confrontation, we must oppose censorship. We remember the pain of silence and work to sustain our power to speak-freely, openly, provocatively.”</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://digitalfreedomfund.org/the-great-facilitator-free-speech-and-power-online-and-off/">https://digitalfreedomfund.org</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-great-facilitator-free-speech-and-power-online-and-off-9651b38c4803">The Great Facilitator: Free Speech and Power, Online and Off</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I’m very grateful for the opportunities provided to me as an employee of RBC. The bank has created a fast paced environment where I truly learn something new each day. I’m constantly challenged to grow in my role, something I find very rewarding as I know it’s because my team sees potential in me.</p>
<p>This type of environment is something I never thought I’d be able to find in a role that doesn’t require me to travel extensively. I’m very fortunate that I can develop my my career each day while still being home in time for dinner with my family each night.</p>
<p>My work allows me to be my best self in all aspects of my life and that’s what drives me to get out of bed.</p>
 
How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Throughout my career, I’ve been in many different roles – systems administrator, business analyst, technical lead, project manager and project control officer. The wide variety of experiences has really helped me understand how these various functions work together technically.&nbsp; More importantly, I’ve learned many power skills from the people that I’ve worked with. Each person we meet has a story to tell and a lesson to teach.</p>
<p>In one of my first corporate roles, my supervisor was a former submariner, obviously carrying a superhuman level of diligence that I try to incorporate into my own work. There we shared a manager who taught us the importance of being calm and approaching things rationally in every situation.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, I’ve had an amazing manager and mentor, Melissa Carvalho, who has taught me what it means to be agile. Melissa has taught me to always be prepared with facts and data surrounding every situation so we know when to push and when to pivot. This has allowed me to accomplish more and deliver higher quality work than I honestly knew I was capable of.</p>
<blockquote>
 It’s much more important to learn what works for people before learning processes or technology.<br>
What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
</blockquote>
<p>Another mentor I’ve learned a lot from taught me about working with people in unique environments. Every environment is truly unique. As non-unionized employees in a union environment, we needed to learn very quickly how to be aware of and always respectful of the protections afforded to our unionized counterparts. The team had a large workload and needed to comply by certain timelines to ensure they were following their commitments to the union too. With limited time to get to know everyone and learn the roles I’d be helping them with, I found that it’s much more important to learn what works for people before learning processes or technology.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>I want to focus on continue here…Continue setting baselines and benchmarks to ensure we’re all held accountable to providing equitable opportunities. Continue facilitating discussions on how we can build better products that work for all of our clients. Continue cascading these messages into the workforce.</p>
<p>I know we still have so much work to do, but I’m very inspired by the conversations I’ve had in recent months. A lot of questions after previous WiD engagements centered on why diversity matters. In the past year, there’s definitely been a shift. People are now asking how they can be a part of creating diverse teams and providing equitable opportunities.</p>
 
In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>In terms of technology, diverse workforces create better solutions that work for more people. More importantly, diversity brings a richness to our lives that make us all better, stronger, more creative and more compassionate.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>We’ve been looking at a lot of art over the past year- almost like a tour of museums from home. I’m currently reading about Burhan Doğançay (1929 – 2013), a Turkish-American artist probably best known for his works turning graffiti and signs posted on urban walls into modern art. I love that art transcends time and provides a geo-political view of the past.</p>
  
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Work on time management and develop a better understanding of your priorities!</p>

 Tell us a little bit about what you do in the world of identity 
<p>My current role is Director, IAM Business Systems Analysis at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). In this role I oversee a team of Business Analysts who are assigned to work on the various solutions we implement to help centralize the bank’s internal enterprise Identity and Access Management</p>
<p>Another service I oversee is the enhancement process, basically managing requests to enhance and innovate the solutions that support our various objectives. We also manage the Intake process for new capability requests across the many IAM services to ensure they align to our roadmaps and strategic direction.</p>
<p>More recently we have started to focus on Customer IAM (CIAM) and my team will support these initiatives that look to centralize not only our enterprise IAM but also CIAM within the bank. It’s a really exciting development for us as it aligns to such a core focus for our industry.</p>
<p>I can certainly say no two days are the same!! There are so many moving parts. Recently, I have been handling the organizational change management responsibilities for the IAM services we work on, which has added an exciting new layer not only for me but for the wider team.</p>
<p>What I really love most about my role is the combination of self-growth opportunities, the people I work with, the organization as a whole, the great leadership I have experienced,&nbsp; Leading a team of amazing and resilient individuals, I am so proud to be able to support their career growth and development,</p>
<blockquote>
 Diversity helps establish a better sense of community, ensuring everyone has a seat at the table. 
</blockquote>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Firstly I had to remove any self-doubt and trust that I was capable.</p>
<p>Although I have been in the IAM space for 10+ years, I came in with no experience or formal training and that was scary. Much of what I know I learned on the job but I was also fortunate to have had a number of great leaders and mentors. Here I want to call out Melissa Carvalho, Her knowledge and expertise really motivated me. Thanks to her and my other mentors I became a sponge just absorbing everything they taught me. I am convinced that has contributed to getting me to this point, encouraging me to continue to grow and learn.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>To ask questions and encourage questions, feedback, recommendations and input.</p>
<p>We may have always done things a certain way&nbsp; but it does not always mean this is the only way. Being curious allows us to find efficiencies and improvements. It helps build a culture of creativity and thought leadership, driving and seeking change.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>As we focus on identity trends from advancing MFA with adaptive authentication, AI, biometrics or even self-sovereign identity, challenge the status quo.&nbsp; Do not rush into digital identity solutions without the backing of a diverse team who can help address the wide range of issues faced by our users.</p>
<p>Continue to focus on diversity within this space, to make room for different opinions and drive new discussions.</p>
<p>Stop looking for specific, pre-defined skillsets and start and/or continue to provide opportunities for candidates from outside our sector and ‘different’ backgrounds. Different people bring different perspectives which is exactly what we need if the identity sector is to thrive.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Because it broadens our perspective and allows for a variety of viewpoints that inspire me. I see real creativity and innovation come through from our teams but, more importantly, diversity helps establish a better sense of community, ensuring everyone has a seat at the table.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80240086">RBG (Ruth Bader Ginsburg)</a></p>
<p>This documentary is so powerful and moving and gives a real insight into the life and personality of this amazing woman who drove so much change around women’s rights.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>When a plan does not work out the way you envision, don’t let it stop you!</p>
<p>Adapt to change; failure is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Look at the lessons it taught you, rather than the setbacks or discomfort you felt.</p>
<p>And, finally, fall forward and use it to build your resiliency tool kit!</p>

 Berkman Klein event explores the early years of online platforms, the state of current platforms, and the&nbsp;future <p>“Today’s platforms were inspired by the many that preceded them, but along the way, we started to go astray. How can we make sense of where we are today? What can we understand about the decisions that were made and the structures we had in place? And most importantly, how can the builders of new platforms that also intend to bring the world closer together, give everyone the power to create or organize the world’s information, do it&nbsp;better?”</p><p>BKC fellow <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jad-esber">Jad Esber</a> posed these overarching questions at the start of a Berkman Klein Center <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/hindsight-2020">event</a> that looked back on online platforms over the past 30 years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Fake">Caterina Fake</a>, the founder of Flickr, <a href="http://www.bohnettfoundation.org/david-bohnett-bio/">David Bohnett</a>, the founder of Geocities, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/baym/">Nancy Baym</a>, Sr. Principal Research Manager, Microsoft Research, joined Esber to reflect on early platforms, the state of newer platforms today, and what they could look like in the future. Their conversation covered topics including subcultures, content moderation, and the evolution of technology.</p><p>Fake and Bohnett are themselves founders of early popular platforms, and early in the discussion, the panelists highlighted the significance of founders’ values shaping the platforms, and how that trend continues today.</p><p>“You can do a lot to influence and change and manage how a community grows and develops from the outset,” Fake said. “And so much of it is based on the personalities of the founders: what they value, what they don’t value, how they design the software,” she said, also pointing out the important role of business&nbsp;models.</p><p>“I paid a lot of particular attention to the values of building communities of interest,” Bohnett added, highlighting that founders’ values also play a critical role in the inclusiveness of platforms. “Do the founders and the early settlers or participants in these communities value inclusiveness and diversity through their actions?” he asked. “That’s what helps foster&nbsp;it.”</p><p>Baym, in turn, emphasized that values may be harmful in the long run. “They’re essential but I think that we see platforms over and over kind of lose their way when it becomes about the founder’s values,” she said. “And one of the ways I think that they go really wrong is that early on their users who are different from the founders who were running into real problems with those platforms and the users are going, ‘hello, there’s this really bad thing happening to me here.’ And the founders for whatever reasons are not fully able to absorb what they’re hearing about the dangers their platforms are posing. And I don’t mean to underestimate the technical and human labor demands of trying to deal with all of that adequately. They’re very, very hard problems.”</p><p>The discussants also talked about the shift from free services that run on users’ data towards fee-based platforms and how these business models may shape or inform user behavior and investment in the online communities.</p><p>“I do think that people are evolving into a kind of a paid model in reaction to a lot of the exploitation that they’ve suffered under for a long time. And as a result of that, I think, these are obviously very positive trends,” she said, citing Patreon and Substack as examples. “I do think Internet business models swing back and forth between the paid and the free and it’s a pendulum swing that many of us, I think that work in kind of online social systems actually welcome to a great degree. So, I do think that the behaviors are different on platforms that you pay for for all of the reasons David and Nancy have already kind of explained.”</p><p>But the pay-to-play model is not an option for everyone, Baym noted. “I think the trick with platforms you have to pay for, of course, is that we want people who don’t have excess income to be able to participate in online communities,” she said. “So we have to think through how do you enable that so that people in poverty are not getting a third rate internet while the rich folks get the really good community, which of course exacerbates wealth and&nbsp;equity.”</p><p>A podcast version of the event is available <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/hindsight-2020">here</a>.

Commissioner White has agreed to serve as a member of ID2020’s Ethics and Risk Advisory Committee.</p><p>“Digital identity solutions, if designed the right way, have the potential to place individuals in even greater control over how their personal information is used,” said White. “Such ethical, privacy-protective, and interoperable approaches will help build a more inclusive world and enable safer online experiences. ID2020 has long advocated for user control over personal data — a core belief that we share. Bermudians will benefit from the development of digital identity solutions and standards that promote privacy protections, and we look forward to collaborating with the ID2020 team to achieve our shared objectives.”</p><p>“Over the past several years, Bermuda has positioned itself as a leader in the fintech space, harnessing digital technology for the benefit of its citizens and the development of its economy. In establishing the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Bermuda, the government recognized that data protection, inclusion, and user-centricity are critical to the full realization of these benefits” said ID2020’s Head of Public Sector Partnerships, Meredith Kravitz. “We are delighted to welcome the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Bermuda to the Alliance and Commissioner White to his new role as a member of the ID2020 Ethics and Risk Advisory Committee.”</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p><p><a href="http://www.id2020.org">www.ID2020.org</a></p><p>About The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for&nbsp;Bermuda</p><p>The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Bermuda (PrivCom) is an independent supervisory authority established in accordance with the Personal Information Protection Act 2016 (PIPA) with a mandate to regulate the use of personal information by organizations in a manner that recognizes both the need to protect the rights of individuals and the need for organizations to use personal information for legitimate purposes.</p><p>The Privacy Commissioner’s powers and responsibilities include supervising the processing of personal information by both private- and public-sector organizations, investigating compliance with PIPA, issuing guidance and recommendations, liaising with other enforcement agencies, and advising on policies and legislation that affect privacy. PrivCom also works to raise awareness and educate the public about privacy risks, and to protect individual's rights and freedoms when their personal data is&nbsp;used.</p><p>Alexander White has served as the first Privacy Commissioner for Bermuda since January&nbsp;2020.</p><p><a href="http://www.privacy.bm/about-us">www.privacy.bm</a></p>

  <p>The origin of the LEI is firmly rooted in financial services and regulation, yet its future undeniably points to universal applicability across public and private sectors, with relevance to organizations large and small. This potential was recognized at the nascence of the LEI by its chief endorsers, the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). While the LEI’s initial purpose was to provide unique identification of legal entities participating in financial transactions across the globe, the G20 and the FSB were clear from the start that the LEI should become a broad public good and that it holds vast opportunity for the private sector. </p>
<p>Happily, the success of the LEI in context of its initial purpose has stimulated enthusiastic attention for the potential it offers outside of financial services regulation. With 1.82 million LEIs issued to date, 116 regulations and laws globally mandating LEI usage across financial services reporting, supervision and identification use cases worldwide, and a well-established and optimally functioning global LEI issuance and management infrastructure, there is a very convincing and reliable case for its use to be explored and championed in other areas.    </p>
<p>Consequently, in recent years there has been advancing acceptance and advocacy of the LEI’s value as a unique universal identifier among regulators, governments, public authorities and private sectors worldwide. Alongside increasing legislation that mandates the LEI as an identifier for participants in certain financial transactions, there is a growing appetite among leading industry influencers for LEI usage to be extended across existing and new markets and applications. All of this signals that we are on the verge of exciting and transformational developments as we look to the years ahead. </p>
<p>Yet with so many – as yet unidentified and untested - ways in which the LEI’s capabilities can be harnessed, there are many current and potential LEI stakeholders who are unaware or unclear of its potential to deliver unique trust benefits to identity management scenarios and ecosystems globally. GLEIF recognizes that the universal relevance of the LEI means that its future potential far exceeds its current application. Quite simply, all use cases have not yet been envisioned, least of all demonstrated, because its use cases are potentially limitless. This is especially true as society moves towards digitalization, and digital identity management systems are increasingly required to establish trust and transparency in online exchanges. The LEI is perfectly poised to support this challenge. </p>
<p>For this reason, GLEIF is launching this ‘LEI Lightbulb Series’. Its aim is to bring clarity, knowledge and understanding of how the LEI is being used and championed, both inside and outside of regulatory realms and who its advocates are, in order to create a ‘complete picture’ of the LEI’s progress. We hope that by sharing news of high-profile support and implementation by regulators and public and private sector influencers across a myriad of sectors, applications and geographies, we may help readers arrive at their own ‘light bulb’ moment regarding the increasing relevance and universal application of the LEI in use cases and industries beyond those circles where it is already well established.   </p>
<p>While educating on the powerful impact the LEI has already had on industry transformation and digitalization through regulatory mandates, and where its value has been recognized through endorsements by credible authorities, this blog series will also aim to outline the business case for consideration of further LEI usage and potential regulation, in industries and for use cases where it could make an immediate and positive impact. </p>
<p>By demonstrating how success derived from strong regulatory roots is giving rise to a groundswell of champions for further LEI regulation and voluntary LEI adoption across new and emerging applications, GLEIF hopes to educate on both the current and future potential value that ‘one global identity’ can deliver for businesses, regardless of sector, world-wide.</p>

<p>DIACC is hosting a series of spotlights showcasing our amazing female DIACC members in the digital identity space, noting the importance of diversity. These spotlights will be regularly socialized through DIACC’s LinkedIn and Twitter channels as well as our monthly member newsletters.</p>



<p>If you’re a DIACC member and would like us to feature your spotlight, <a href="https://diacc.ca/contact-us/">contact</a> us today to learn more!</p>


 
 
 
<p>What has your career journey looked like?</p>



<p>During my 15 year of career, I’ve had opportunities to work for leading firms including Wall Street institutions. My career is shaped by experiences with Aon/Hewitt, Wachovia/Wells Fargo, Fannie Mae, Bank of Tokyo, and Brown Brothers Harriman. I’ve played different roles including Software Engineering, Business Analysis, and Product Owner. Following my passion towards entrepreneurship, bootstrapped blockchain startup vlinder a couple of years ago. It’s been an exciting journey – startup life has given me exponential learning.</p>
 



 

 
 
 


<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?</p>



<p>Technology was gaining significant prominence back then and I wanted to perform a high-tech job (in Silicon Valley) leading to a CIO type role.</p>



<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>Honestly, I have been lucky not to face any significant barrier through my carrier. Personally, I believe such barriers are in the mind.</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>The key is to set family time aside and not think about work during that time. In this connected world, sometimes it is hard to decouple work (e.g. looking at emails, chat channels, linkedIn from smart phone). However, with discipline and drawing the line, balance can be achieved.</p>



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?</p>



<p>Tech cannot be painted blue or pink. Tech is for the entire population, pick your leader, inspiration, and follow them. If I have to stress a particular point, taking cue from the previous question, good work/life balance can be achieved in Digital ID/Tech space (given that most of the work can be performed remotely).</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Sometimes unconscious bias may exist – it’s important to think objectively and not about why a subset of the population cannot go up the ladder. It’s also important not to pay attention to historical metrics or even how many women are in executive positions in a given organization which is not a reflection of the future that can be achieved.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?</p>



<p>I would rather focus on the opportunity ahead of us – enterprises and the world now focus on equality and even have goals on the number of women leaders on the board. Some early indicators linking profitability and number of women leaders on the board are published.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Pursue the dream, strive for excellence, and success will follow.</p>

 Here’s what the next three months look like for BrightID. BrightID Q2 2021&nbsp;Roadmap<p>Let’s go into each of the six milestones in a little more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>🔬 Node discovery. How does a client (for example the BrightID app on your mobile device) know which node in the BrightID network to connect to? After this milestone, clients will be able to find out about other nodes from a small list of hard-coded “seed” nodes. If seed nodes trust other nodes, they’ll be added to the list. Then clients can use a “<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race">promise race</a>” and other data to find the best node to connect&nbsp;to.</p><p>👩‍🔬 Anti-Sybil: Stronger connection types. You may have noticed there are different connection levels in BrightID. Different connection levels create different graphs of users. The goal is to have a verification that uses the very strong “recovery” connection level, which real people only assign to others they trust enough to help guard their BrightID against theft or&nbsp;loss.</p><p>🕵🏽‍♀️ Blind signatures. Currently, BrightID nodes store mappings between anonymous identifiers used by apps and BrightID identifiers so that an app can query about someone’s unique verification using their own identifiers. (BrightIDs are not shared with apps.) While this structure makes it less likely that a data leak could reveal information from one app to another, we can do even better. <a href="https://forum.brightid.org/t/improved-privacy-social-recovery-for-apps-no-need-for-contexts/54">With blind signatures, we can remove this mapping completely</a>. This simplifies the architecture and makes the system even more immune to data&nbsp;leaks.</p><p>📲 Client portability. We’ve already created the necessary features in the node API for a user to install BrightID on multiple devices and backup or recover their BrightID using another device, but would be hard to implement this without an example. We’re going to build a web version of BrightID that supports these features so that others can use it as an example to make their own BrightID&nbsp;clients.</p><p>💉 Anti-Sybil: attack modeling and injection. <a href="https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-AntiSybil">We’ve already created a great platform for modeling sybil attacks and comparing the results of different algorithms or parameters</a>. In some approaches to sybil-resistance in social networks, there is a manual review step, and the algorithm is used to prioritize accounts to review. As a pseudonymous network, BrightID prefers an automated way to define the line between sybil and honest users. We can do this by automatically injecting modeled attacks into the real graph and measuring their rank against previously measured&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>🛡️Node Security. BrightID nodes have already gone through a hardening process, with sensible rate limits in place by default, but we want to take another pass at this. We also want to create <a href="https://stoplight.io/blog/introduction-to-api-testing/#api-producer-contract-testing">API contract tests</a> to make sure our node API and <a href="https://dev.brightid.org/docs/node-api/">reference docs</a> match. We will also audit the use of digital signatures and secure message&nbsp;passing.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/brightid/brightid-2021-q2-roadmap-e8585a42c3fc">BrightID 2021 Q2 Roadmap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/brightid">BrightID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Commission on Enhancing National Cyber Security report from December 1st, 2016 emphasized the importance of securing and growing the digital economy. In line with the recommendations from this document, and in compliance with the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada’s (DIACC) <a href="https://diacc.ca/the-diacc/principles/">10 Canadian Principles of a Digital Identity Ecosystem</a>, SecureKey Technologies entered into a multiphase program with DIACC and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) to evaluate, develop, and deliver a solution for enabling distributed privacy enhanced identity ecosystems.</p>



<p>This paper summarizes the work done as part of Phase 3 of the program, concentrating on the “Commercialization of the Verified.Me project,” and building upon the recommendations from the Applied Research completed in Phase 2 which are further described in this <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DIACC_SecureKey_Phase2_White-Paper.pdf">white paper</a>.</p>

 We meet Krista Pawley to find out about her role as a&nbsp; ‘woman in identity’ …. 
<p></p>
 Tell us about yourself and your work as Co-Lead at IdentityNORTH 
<p>We started IdentityNORTH as a small group of 30 people in a conference room and we’ve now grown into a community of over 3000 leaders from all sectors dedicated to working together to build a more innovative, secure, and inclusive digital economy.</p>
<p>What gets me excited about this work is the ability to connect with some of the smartest people in tech, public policy, civil society and business on some of the biggest questions facing our our world.</p>
<p>Over the years that I have been doing this work, I have seen how our conversations have evolved&nbsp; from highly technical discussions focused on IT and workflows to a more user-centric dialogue, focused on people, privacy and leveraging digital Identity.&nbsp; We are much more focused now on how we enable a more inclusive and safe digital economy.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that we have the talent, vision, and community in Canada to lead the world in digital transformation. It’s what gets me up each morning!&nbsp; And I know we can do it in an inclusive, privacy-enhancing way that will benefit all Canadians. The ability to be part of something that makes that kind of positive impact is so exciting to me.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I have had the privilege of working at senior levels across government&nbsp; (on and off Parliament Hill),&nbsp; the private sector (financial services, loyalty, and consumer retail sector leading teams in over 50 countries) and the non-profit world (working with a global leader in education and financial inclusion). Five years ago I decided to take what I had learned over the past 20 years and turn my experience, network, and energy towards building communities of action around the big questions that have the potential to drive positive change in Canada and around the world.</p>
<p>Inspired by the leaders and mentors who guided me throughout my career, I worked with communities like IdentityNORTH, SingularityU Canada, the Atlantic Council Geo Tech Centre, and Equitas to build communities of leaders who believe that we have the tools, the technology, and the responsibility to build a better future together.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seek out the different and invite them to be part of the conversation.</p></blockquote>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>People like to be asked, and they like to be thanked. A political boss taught me that!</p>
<p>If you are looking to build a community, you need to think about who should be part of that community. Don’t go just for those you already know and who look, sound, and think like you. Invite people from different backgrounds and perspectives. Seek out the different and invite them to be part of the conversation. This is how we grow, how we learn. When people feel included, they are more likely to help you and you are more likely to learn.</p>
<p>Oh, and say thank you. Being grateful and expressing that gratitude shows others that you recognize and appreciate them. It also re-enforces your own sense of appreciation for all that is good and constructive around you. That gratitude can help see you through a lot of challenges.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>If you are looking to grow your business in the digital age, digital identity is a vital enabler of that growth. The Pandemic pushed us forward at least five years in terms of customers’ willingness to adopt and demand secure, trusted, convenient, and user-centric digital services. From e-commerce and on-line banking to healthcare and education, every sector has the potential to be transformed through digitisation. The leaders who recognize this and build tools to enable their organisations to adapt will not only survive; they will thrive.</p>
<p>CEOs and Boards need to STOP looking in the rearview mirror and building strategies and business models that imagine a future that looks like our past. They need to START thinking about the exponential technologies that are transforming our world and think about how these might impact their business and sector. This new way of leading will require both courage and imagination. They need to START seeking out truly diverse perspectives to help them imagine the unimaginable future and plan for it – because chances are what is unimaginable is more likely than many believe.</p>
<p>Lastly, they need to CONTINUE building the critical infrastructure that will enable them to seize these opportunities. Working with organizations like DiACC (Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada), Women in Identity, and IdentityNORTH, leaders have the opportunity to move ahead of the competition. Diverse viewpoints from these extended teams helps with understanding and implementing the critical frameworks and tools that will make a real difference.</p>
<blockquote><p>diverse perspectives help to imagine the unimaginable future</p></blockquote>
 
Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity is the key to learning. If all we ever hear are the voices of those who look, think, and feel like us, we will fail to learn and grow.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>Warren Berger’s A More Beautiful Question.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many of us have lost our curiosity; we are afraid to ask questions for fear of looking foolish. Berger shows us that the foolish thing is , in fact, to stop asking. That learning, wisdom, and growth come from the courage to ask and stay curious.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Seek out the people you admire and ask them for advice. I was too shy as a teen to do this. When I got older, I learned that many of the people I admired were kind, generous people who were happy to help when approached with a thoughtful, clear request.</p>

<p>Digital Identity NZ is entering a new phase of its journey; our superlative inaugural Chair David Morrison is joined by Ben Tairea as Co-Chair and Tamāra Al-Salim as Deputy Chair.&nbsp; You can read more about Tamāra’s and Ben’s stories below.&nbsp; The trio will lead the governance of the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council</a>&nbsp;as we navigate the next period of rapid change.&nbsp; This is also my last newsletter as Executive Director of Digital Identity NZ.&nbsp; Like David, I took on this role upon the formation of Digital Identity NZ in 2019, and after nearly 2 ½ years it is time to hand over the pleasure and responsibility to someone new.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I reflect on the last 2+ years, an overriding theme is one of interconnectedness, both technically and socially.&nbsp; The premise and promise of digital identity is more seamless and efficient ways of interacting online, whilst at the same time improving privacy, transparency, security and choice (solutions that are truly mana-enhancing).&nbsp; The words of the karakia gifted to us by Janelle Riki-Waaka (kaiwhakahaere/advisor and member of our Executive Council) are apt to the journey we are on:</p>



<p>Unuhia te pō, te pō whiri mārama<br>Tomokia te ao, te ao whatu tāngata<br>Tātai ki runga, tātai ki raro, tātai aho rau<br>Haumi e, hui e, tāiki e!<br>&nbsp;<br>From the confusion comes understanding<br>From understanding comes unity<br>We are interwoven, we are interconnected<br>Together as one!</p>



<p>We start and end all of our Council meetings, webinars and working groups with these words as a reminder of our shared past, present and future.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is much work still to be done as we collectively work on a digital identity ecosystem designed for Aotearoa.&nbsp; This is the work of Government, iwi, innovators, advocates, academics, community groups and businesses of all shapes and sizes.&nbsp; My parting challenge to us all is to continue to work in trusted collaboration for the benefit of all people in Aotearoa, and to do so with the core principles of Te Tiriti anchoring the mahi (work); kāwanatanga (honourable governance), rangatiratanga (self determination and agency) and ōretitanga (equity and partnership).</p>

 Leverages the Energy Web technology stack, with an initial focus on industrial and home battery&nbsp;storage <p>Brussels, Belgium and Zug, Switzerland — 16 March 2021 — Today<a href="https://www.bebat.be/en"> Bebat</a>, the Belgian battery compliance scheme; <a href="https://over.fluvius.be/nl/thema">Fluvius</a>, the electricity and natural gas distribution system operator (DSO) for the Flemish Region of Belgium; and<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/"> Energy Web</a> jointly announced an open-source solution for decentralized lifecycle battery asset management, called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/easybat/">EasyBat</a>.</p><p>Since 2006, the EU’s <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02006L0066-20131230&amp;rid=1'">Battery Directive</a> has required member countries to institute takeback schemes to ensure environmentally responsible recycling and/or disposal of post-consumer batteries. To date, lifecycle asset management for batteries has been cumbersome at best. Before EasyBat, tracking battery assets was essentially non-existent. Currently, in Belgium, the registration of customer-owned assets, such as a home battery, requires a lot of information and burdensome paperwork collection.</p><p>EasyBat aims to greatly simplify that process. The solution is built on the<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/ew-dos/"> Energy Web Decentralized Operating System</a> (EW-DOS) open-source technology stack and focuses on the entire battery lifecycle. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, installers, and accredited inspection and certification organizations issue and verify every relevant asset transaction. The fact that all these entities work together on a shared decentralized ecosystem is an important and never-seen-before innovation.</p><p>“By having created a decentralized digital passport, the entire logistic flow — from put-on-market all the way to reverse logistics for the takeback obligation and waste collection — is digitized on a decentralized digitally trusted ledger,” said Philippe Decrock from Bebat. “This represents a revolutionary, customer-centric solution and affirms a key business case for distributed ledger technology.’”</p><p>In recent years, battery lifecycle management has taken on heightened importance, thanks to the fast-growing adoption of customer-owned distributed energy resources (DERs), including residential batteries and electric vehicles&nbsp;(EVs).</p><p>Just last month, the European Commission<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2312"> announced the first initiative</a> (the EU Battery Regulation) under its Circular Economy Action Plan: making batteries sustainable, high-performing, and safe along their entire life cycle — thus making them consistent with the carbon-neutral ambition of the European Green Deal. This includes minimizing the environmental impact of batteries and repurposing batteries from electric vehicles and industrial batteries so that they can have a second life. The core of this new initiative is the idea of a Battery Digital Passport, which is exactly where the EasyBat solution built on EW-DOS comes into&nbsp;play.</p><p>“We’ve long focused on creating ‘passports’ for assets like batteries. This concept is core not just to our tech stack but to the evolving electricity system around the world. The European Commission’s new initiative on Battery Passports is a strong validation of the concept and sets the stage for market transformation throughout the EU. We’re excited to see it come to life in EasyBat,” said Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer for Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>EasyBat will help Bebat to easily monitor the specific data linked to the legal takeback obligations and/or extended producers responsibility (EPR) of battery manufacturers. They have an obligation to register and report the put-on-market of various batteries (including technical specifications such as chemistry/weight/modules) through the battery’s lifecycle up to the moment of collection at a battery’s end of life. EasyBat makes it possible to holistically manage customer-owned batteries (both private &amp; professional use) participating in Belgian electricity markets — including those on the Fluvius network. EasyBat heavily leverages the open-source EW-DOS technology stack, including EW Switchboard, a new interface for managing decentralized, self-sovereign identities, as well as their associated assets, roles, and permissions.</p><p>Thanks to Switchboard and EW-DOS, customers remain in control of their own identity and the information associated with their assets, such as EV, residential, commercial, and industrial batteries. They create a self-sovereign ‘digital twin’ for any assets, which third-parties such as the manufacturer, installer, and/or DSO can verify. Such a DER Passport — or Battery Passport, in EU Commission parlance — provides a shared state of the asset and its history to any pre-approved energy market participants.</p><p>For example, DSOs like Fluvius and lifecycle management programs like Bebat can monitor batteries throughout their full value chain, from manufacturing to sales to providing energy services such as grid flexibility to secondary re-use (in the case of electric vehicle batteries) to end-of-life disposal (collection, dismantling, and recycling).</p><p>“This approach extends far beyond tracking the history of every DER throughout its lifetime, from manufacturing to operation to end-of-life recycling or decommissioning,” said Bart Coelus of Fluvius. “Creating digital twins of assets, especially DERs at the grid edge, gives grid operators like Fluvius unprecedented visibility into the physical grid they manage. That digital representation of the actual grid will be the core layer of future grid operations. EW Switchboard accelerated our progress on this front, allowing us to move further, faster down the path of digitalization.”</p><p>About Bebat<br>Bebat is a Belgian nonprofit association (vzw) established in 1995 by battery manufacturers — including Duracell, Energizer, Varta and Panasonic — to enable companies to meet the take-back obligation for the Belgian market. Bebat gives new life to used batteries and ranks among the world leaders in the collection of used batteries. Used batteries can be handed in at one of 24,000 collection points, convenient and free of charge. Bebat organises their collection as well as the sorting and recycling process. In 2019 Bebat collected more than 3,600 tons of batteries in Belgium. Over the last five years, Bebat has already collected 10.000 electric vehicle (EV) batteries, which it recycles through the best recycling companies in Belgium and Europe. With the growth of waste industrial batteries, Bebat also measures to make possible repurposing, re-use of waste batteries with still-usable capacity, and responsible end-of-life disposal for spent batteries. Bebat is also part of <a href="https://www.reneos.eu/">Reneos European cooperative</a>, a network of Europe’s top national battery collection systems, including GRS Batterien in Germany, Stibat in the Netherlands, Batteriretur in Norway, and Cobalt in Italy. The Reneos network covers 20 EU countries.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://www.bebat.be/en/homepage">https://www.bebat.be/en/homepage</a>.</p><p>About Fluvius<br>Fluvius is the network operator created on 1 July 2018 by the merger of Eandis and Infrax.

<p>I’m pleased to announce that the OpenID Foundation has <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/12/fapi-1-0-part-1-and-part-2-are-now-final-specifications/">published the Financial-grade API (FAPI) Parts 1.0 and 2.0 final specifications</a>. This is a true accomplishment for open banking initiatives worldwide. The Foundation couldn’t have reached this important milestone with the FAPI specification without the leadership of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> led by&nbsp;Chairman Nat Sakimura, Anoop Saxena (Intuit), Dave Tonge (MoneyHub), and a diverse group of experts with the technical chops, persistence and patience for the painstaking work of open&nbsp;technical standards development.</p>
<p>In many respects this is old news. &nbsp;Hundreds of organizations, large and small, from around the&nbsp;world, have for years adopted FAPI in the most&nbsp;important way, they’ve implemented it. &nbsp;They’ve&nbsp;implemented it after&nbsp;publicly self-certifying&nbsp;their&nbsp;conformance. In doing so they’ve confirmed:</p>
 
 FAPI is good for adoption (A standard is only as good as its adoption) 
 FAPI delivers on its promise of reliability, repeatability and security 
 FAPI is being adopted by others 
 
<p>Ultimately FAPI has reached a tipping point in the lifecycle of a standard where there is positive feedback:</p>
 
 A standard is only as good as its adoption 
 A standard’s adoption is driven by its value of the reliability, repeatability and security of its results 
 A standard’s value is measured by the number of instances of certified conformance extant in the market 
 
<p>Few areas of the increasingly noisy, fragmented global ecosystem demonstrate the importance of a standardized, certified approach better than open banking. Despite the potential, many stakeholders are still struggling to&nbsp;keep to open banking rollout schedules more than two years after the UK Open Banking Implementation Entity and PSD2 came into effect. The lack of a standardized security approach is acknowledged as a key factor in this, and one the&nbsp;OpenID Foundation is trying to right through ongoing collaboration with the American, Australian, Brazilian and European colleagues. And if standardization is essential, certification has a critical role to play:</p>
 
 Ensuring implementations’ interoperability and security, while bringing clarity and stability to a complex functional standards environments 
 Helping enforce the secure data exchanges between banks, Fintechs, and schemes to facilitate meeting the&nbsp;complex and changing regulatory requirements 
 
<p>The best way to celebrate the final publication of FAPI 1.0 is to note its <a href="https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor-fase2/">unheralded but important adoption in Brazil</a>. When visiting “Welcome to the Open Banking Brasil Portal developer area”, the references to&nbsp;Financial-grade API (FAPI) are clear even without the English translation. And there are indications of FAPI adoption in Bahrain and the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>But our collective efforts lack a home. Whether in an OIDF, FDX, Berlin Group or STET Group container there is no single,&nbsp;trusted place where anyone, at any time, at no cost can&nbsp;reliably find an&nbsp;authoritative&nbsp;listing of all open&nbsp;finance technical&nbsp;standards.&nbsp;Simply described we need a database, an online library of libraries, of all the technical standards in the open finance ecosystem. While simply described, it is not without challenges. While modest, it solves a burning&nbsp;business problem and one that requires a solution that best comes from an international collaboration of organizations, perhaps beginning with the OpenID Foundation.</p>

<p>President Biden’s ability to rebuild alliances, restore America’s standing in the world and unite the nation hinges on his ability to reign in tech giants here at&nbsp;home</p><p>By Gus Rossi, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>President Biden’s pledge to restore diplomacy as the United States’ primary instrument of foreign policy is an important and necessary shift away from his predecessor’s destructive America First approach that shunned multilateralism and jeopardized relationships with important allies.</p><p>But diplomacy alone is not a cure-all for America’s diminished standing abroad. To regain the trust of our allies and the American people, the Biden administration must wrest control of international affairs from American technology giants and into the hands of US citizens.</p><p>For decades, America’s foreign and digital trade policies had been guided by the notion that whatever Silicon Valley wanted was good for America — and for the world. That naive assumption is finally giving way to the recognition that unregulated and unaccountable tech giants pose great and literal danger for public safety, democracy, and competitive markets.</p><p>President Biden now has an opportunity to act against these&nbsp;threats.</p><p>The hands-off approach began in an era when the internet promised a free flow of information and ideas around the world. Technology, many believed, brought down autocracies in the Arab Spring with tweets instead of bombs. By unlocking social media’s organizing and mobilizing power, Barack Obama became America’s first Black president.</p><p>Democrats, including the Obama administration, were enamored by the tech industry. It helped that many tech leaders supported the administration’s priorities and gave generously to support those progressive causes. Inevitably, this love affair shaped Democrats’ digital foreign and trade&nbsp;policy.</p><p>But Big Tech has long enjoyed a cozy relationship with the executive branch, regardless of which party occupies the White&nbsp;House.</p><p>Silicon Valley has for decades pressured the US to limit the role of the International Telecommunication Union (the U.N. body tasked with setting internet, telecom, and other technical standards) so that tech companies can operate with as few regulations as possible.</p><p>In the early 2010s, the US Embassy to the E.U. lobbied on behalf of Silicon Valley against Europe’s privacy laws and promoted the APEC privacy framework, an alternative that was both toothless and&nbsp;weak.</p><p>When negotiating trade agreements, the US Trade Representative tried to include the Communications Decency Act (CDA) third-party liability shield that enables tech platforms to profit from disinformation and hate&nbsp;speech.</p><p>Both the Obama and Trump administrations consistently fought European efforts to tax tech companies.</p><p>By doing Big Tech’s bidding, US policies left consumers — and our national interest — vulnerable. The result is waning US influence across the globe and a fraying democracy at&nbsp;home.</p><p>Abroad, the EU has become the de-facto regulator of the tech economy with the 2014 adoption of its data and privacy regime, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It has since threatened to ban American companies from moving data across the Atlantic because the US does not offer guarantees for Europeans’ data. China has also seized the opportunity and is promoting its technology to manage our ally’s critical telecom infrastructure. Meanwhile, Chinese social media companies are collecting reams of American and European personal data through social media platforms.</p><p>Stateside, organized online and in plain sight across a variety of internet platforms, the failed insurrection at the Capitol was only the latest, most shocking example of Big Tech’s perverse incentive to promote disinformation and radicalization, suppress innovation, monopolize markets and other anti-democratic activities.</p><p>Fortunately, there signs that the love affair between Democrats and Big Tech is disintegrating:</p><p>Last year, dozens of Democratic state attorneys general brought antitrust cases against Google and Facebook. Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Facebook of being complicit in adding disinformation to the public debate. California, the heavily Democratic home to Silicon Valley, adopted a second landmark privacy law. The House Antitrust Subcommittee subpoenaed thousands of documents from tech titans, grilled CEOs at hearings, and published a report that outlines how to make digital markets competitive. And many Democratic members of Congress are actively considering bills to curtail the power of tech platforms.</p><p>Now, President Biden can both strengthen US democracy and rebuild relationship with allies by making substantial updates to America’s digital foreign policy including:</p><p>· Collaborate with the EU’s to develop and promote a framework for democratic governance of the tech economy, pro-competitive rules, and accountability principles.</p><p>· End trade agreements that make it harder for third countries to hold platforms responsible for promoting disinformation and hate speech. The CDA should not be exported.</p><p>· Protect transatlantic data flows and consumer data with an international agreement that commits the US to a privacy framework compatible and equivalent to Europe’s.</p><p>· Update global corporate tax rules for online companies to avoid a costly balkanization of taxation to American companies and allow third countries to collect a fair amount of taxes from the profit that companies make&nbsp;abroad.</p><p>· Diversify the State Department’s delegations to international institutions by offering travel stipends to independent academics and civil society experts to ensure corporate interests are not the only ones represented.</p><p>How we approach diplomacy abroad should reflect our values and interests at home. More than ever the world needs to hear that America and President Biden believe in the democratic governance and regulation of the tech economy for the public’s interest, not Silicon Valley. Only then will the US begin its uphill fight to restore its standing in the eyes of the world and its citizens&nbsp;alike.</p><p>About Gus Rossi, Principal, Responsible Technology</p><p>As a principal on the Responsible Technology team, Gus is focused on Omidyar Network’s work on encrypted messaging, platforms and power, and alternative business models, with a vision for technology that underpins greater individual empowerment, social opportunity, and user&nbsp;safety.</p><p>Prior to joining Omidyar Network, Gus was the director of global policy at Public Knowledge, an advocacy-oriented nonprofit that promotes freedom of expression, an open internet, and access to affordable communications tools.

<p>Contributions made by members of the DIACC’s Outreach Expert Committee</p>



<p>One of the nicest things about this pandemic is wearing our sweatpants all day, every day, while working. Right? Wouldn’t it be nice to wear sweatpants to the office, when this is all over?&nbsp;Sure, but that’s unlikely, at least if we want to keep our jobs.&nbsp;So, we choose to forgo our private sweatpants rights, to keep our more public jobs.&nbsp;Privacy and how we protect it has never been more important in our daily lives.&nbsp;Yet, a balance is necessary, between privacy and security, in our ever increasingly digital lives.&nbsp;With that, there is a rather public debate about privacy and the ethical use of biometrics.&nbsp;In particular, face biometrics can be misunderstood and feared with respect to our Right to Privacy.&nbsp;This article is an attempt to create a better understanding of it and, hopefully, reduce fear of such a promising and effective technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our use of biometrics enables our safety. At its most basic level, a biometric is a physiological trait or attribute that is unique to an individual person. When we recognize the faces of our loved ones, friends, and colleagues with our own eyes, we are using biometrics to help us build relationships and trust. Biometrics are, in a way, fundamental to human interaction and society.&nbsp;Today, biometrics can be used in person or automated, to increase convenience and security in various situations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many types of biometrics that we use daily.&nbsp;Face images are, by far, the most common.&nbsp;Any time somebody requests to see our driver’s license, passport, or ID badge, we are using biometrics.&nbsp;Most governments include face biometrics, in the form of a photograph, in their driver’s license, passport, or other national ID databases, as well as on the credential, itself.&nbsp;We use face biometrics, attached to a credential, to establish trust, when we access privileges, like driving a car, government services, commercial air travel and even buying liquor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today there is some confusion and fear about biometrics, what they are, and what they can actually do. There are only two basic functions that a biometric can perform, Identification and Authentication. When we first meet somebody, we may associate their name with their face. When we see that face we can identify that person by accessing the information in our mind. “Hi, I’m Jennifer” associates a name to face and allows us to identify them. When we arrive at a restaurant, we might scan customers to see if we recognize any of them. We identify Jennifer by recognizing their face in the crowd of people. In another instance, we can authenticate Jennifer by recalling information about them when presented with their face. If Jennifer were to knock on our front door, we can authenticate them with our own simple sight. Fundamentally these are the only two functions of a biometric. A properly designed face biometric system should include high confidence liveness checks, to differentiate between a real human face and a photo (for example) and face matching, in order to prove that a person is in fact who they claim to be. Stay tuned for our next blog where we’ll talk about liveness checks, anti-spoofing, and other methods to prevent various types of fraud.</p>



<p>In this age of information hyperbole, perhaps it’s understandable that there is some public misunderstanding of how these important technologies can and should be used.&nbsp;Big Brother surveillance and Privacy are central to debates about the ethical use of face biometrics.&nbsp;However, when examined thoroughly, we find that most, if not all of the ethical debate centers on how the biometrics are used and, more specifically, whether the biometric is used Voluntarily or Involuntarily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We tend to prefer freedom of choice, with our personal privacy.&nbsp;Sometimes we guard it.&nbsp;Other times, we agree to forgo some privacy, to access and enjoy many privileges of our society.&nbsp;For example, when applying for a credit card loan, the bank logically prefers to understand whether or not we are likely to repay the loan.&nbsp;To control its fraud and compliance risk, it requires knowing who it’s lending to and whether we are an existing customer, or potential fraudster, posing as a customer.&nbsp;So, we volunteer to divulge our private identities and backgrounds.&nbsp;We also allow the bank to compare our identity to those of existing customers, to learn if we are an existing customer or a fraudulent account holder at the bank.&nbsp;The bank Identifies us as a new customer (or not), as well as a legitimate customer (or not).&nbsp;It’s our choice to participate in this identification process, or not.&nbsp;It’s voluntary.&nbsp;If we agree, once we are approved, the bank requires us to Authenticate ourselves, every time we try to access the valuable privilege. In this case, we voluntarily relinquish our privacy Right, to get something of value in return.&nbsp;Moreover, the process includes both Identification and Authentication in a safe, productive and ethical way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, in some cases, the privilege we want to enjoy is so valuable (granting it is so risky) that the service provider may be tempted to invade our privacy, without our consent, to protect it.&nbsp;Of course, there are some bad people out there.&nbsp;The problem is that we can’t tell who is good and who is bad, unless we specifically identify them all.&nbsp;To this end, law enforcement may wish to investigate and identify everyone within a certain group, like those walking down the street.&nbsp;The City of London, England, for example, installed CCTV cameras on most city street corners, to survey walkers-by for criminal activity.&nbsp;Moreover, the CCTV system was equipped with biometric facial recognition technology, to learn if any passers-by were in the criminal mugshot database.&nbsp;The City used Involuntary face recognition surveillance to Identify anyone in the field of view.&nbsp;Innocent passers-by had no choice but to submit to such a surveillance investigation and many view this as a clear violation of privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar to any tool, there is nothing inherently ethical or unethical about face biometrics, however these tools must be used responsibly.&nbsp;In a voluntary scenario, both Identification and Authentication can be important functions when used to protect our privacy and enable privileges that could not be offered without the presence of a human authentication method. This can help break down barriers to accessing government services or performing international business (by using authentication to reduce instances of fraud) or even protecting your own assets by granting access to your files via authentication of your unique profile. However in an involuntary scenario, potentially unethical&nbsp;scenarios exist that require deep conversations and eventually regulation about the balance between safety and privacy.</p>



<p>Understanding the difference between Voluntary and Involuntary facial recognition is a foundational issue that is helping us set the boundaries for the ethical use of biometrics by both governments and businesses. How that data is stored and used are all tied into this same problem. While there is nothing inherently ethical nor unethical about face biometrics, understanding and regulating its acceptable use is an important step to building public confidence in this trust enabling tool.</p>

<p>One of the key principles of DIDAS is that we help experts coming from various industries and professions to work together, learn from each other and bring new ideas on how to apply SSI technology in real world.</p>
<p>To make it happen, we encourage our members to propose topics and explore ideas in dedicated working groups.&nbsp; Working Groups allow us to agree on the goals that the experts will pursue jointly,&nbsp; structure the work and define the results. After all, we want to see SSI become a reality in Switzerland!</p>
<p>We are very happy that more than 15 experts got together to kick off our Onboarding Working Group. This group grew out of the idea that many different activities today require sharing of verifiable information – personal identity, company registration, tax identifiers, addresses, and so on and so forth.<br>
In Switzerland, Financial sector is very strong and so a lot of innovation happens around Fintech.&nbsp; Our original idea, therefore, was to focus on Fintech use-cases around onboarding, KYC and AML processing and similar activities.</p>
<p>As we started to explore these ideas in depth during the session, we understood that not only Fintech, but other Industries ( e.g. Insurance, B2B Supplier onboarding, etc) can benefit strongly from an ability to securely exchange identity and registration data using Verifiable Credentials, which are easy to maintain in the future, including automated invalidation of credentials that were recalled by their issuers.</p>
<p>It is also clear that various use-cases depend on the existing legislation and might be difficult to implement in today’s legal environment.<br>
In recognition of this fact, the group has agreed to catalog various use-cases, examine their legal implications and requirements, explore whether or not it is possible to find solutions and approaches that are compatible with the today’s set of laws, plan technical PoCs and implementations.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Swiss lawyers are among the most creative professionals in the world and are enthusiastic about opportunities to find improvements in the legal system that are required to make Switzerland the best and the most innovative country to do business. The recent legislation on Blockchain Assets in Switzerland is a great demonstration of that fact.<br>
Even in the case that some SSI onboarding use-cases might be difficult to implement within the limits of the current legislation, the group will identify the needed improvements and&nbsp; work with the lawmakers, regulators and politicians to develop and promote the required changes.</p>
<p>This is one of the core missions of DIDAS –&nbsp; drive Thought Leadership and remove barriers to implementation of SSI and Verifiable Claims technology&nbsp;in Switzerland.</p>
<p>If you are interested and want to bring your technical, business, legal and/or creative skills and ideas into the effort, even if you know nothing about the SSI yet, we are looking for you!</p>

 Q&amp;A explores threat actors, early detection, and content moderation Oumou Ly interviews Lisa Kaplan for the latest episode of The Breakdown from the Berkman Klein&nbsp;Center.<p>From 2016 to 2020, research, civil society organizing efforts, industry planning, and national security responses to disinformation centered on the issue from the perspective that malign influence was propagated almost exclusively by foreign adversaries. This thinking was upended to a large extent in 2020 when disinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the presidential election, and other sustained-attention information events exposed the severity of the threat posed by domestic disinformation.</p><p>In this episode of the Breakdown, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/oumou-ly">Oumou Ly</a> is joined by Lisa Kaplan to further unpack what accounts for the shift in focus, whether stakeholders might consider adjusting mitigations already deployed to combat disinformation, and assess how current organizing around the disinformation problem can be reevaluated and repurposed to suit new challenges.</p><p>Read the transcript, which is lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity</p><p>Oumou Ly (OL): Welcome to The Breakdown. My name is Oumou, I’m a fellow on the Berkman Klein Center’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/research/assembly">Assembly: Disinformation</a> Program. I am recording today from California, and that is why my background doesn’t appear the way it normally does, but I am excited nonetheless to be joined by Lisa Kaplan of the Alethea Group. Lisa founded the Alethea Group to help organizations navigate the new digital reality and protect themselves against disinformation. Thank you for joining us, Lisa. I’m so excited to have a conversation with you about this and many, many other pertinent issues.</p><p>Lisa Kaplan (LK): Thanks so much for having me, excited to be&nbsp;here.</p><p>OL: Yes. So our conversation today centers on a really, really big topic in the disinformation space, and that is the shift in focus among a bunch of different stakeholder groups, including the national security community, academics, civil society, and others, in focusing on disinformation from a national security/foreign policy geopolitics perspective. Can you give us a little taste of your background and talk about what compelled you to found the Alethea&nbsp;Group?</p><p>LK: So I started the Alethea Group in 2019. And prior to that, I was the digital director on a 2018 Senate campaign.</p><p>One of the things about disinformation that I always like to remind people is that it’s not always a foreign government and it’s not always people who are seeking necessarily geopolitical ends. The goals for threat actors really do vary depending on the threat actor. And that’s one of the reasons why the hard work, the attribution that we do at Alethea Group is so important. But it does depend on who the actor is and what their motive is. And once you know that, you can infer what their goal may be and it can help to mitigate a situation before it even starts or we use [it] to mitigate a situation that’s elevated into more of a crisis situation.</p><p>So I was working for Senator Angus King and because he was running against a Democrat and a Republican, we were looking at disinformation narratives from both sides, not necessarily doing the work of attribution, but because we were a campaign, we had limited resources, trying to understand what the narratives were that were out there. And what we realized is the disinformation, it was targeting candidates, it was targeting issues, but at the end of the day, it’s really targeting voters, us as people. And when you think about it as an election context, it’s really straightforward. It’s trying to influence people’s decisions around when, where, and who to vote for. You know targeting those decision points. Are you going to vote? And then if so, for whom are you gonna cast your&nbsp;ballot?</p><p>However, disinformation, it’s not an issue that’s limited to just elections and especially for sophisticated actors. So think foreign adversaries, think for-profit disinformation networks who have built up influence to then sell to the highest bidder or are building up influence to be able to generate ad revenue through clicks, for example. They’re not just talking about one election or one candidate, they’re talking about a variety of different issues. And so I say that because for us, and it’s the proliferation of this, the number of threat actors since 2016 has been exponential. What started as being primarily Russian, we now have, according to Oxford, over 80 countries who are actively engaging in social media manipulation, and that doesn’t even account for all of the individuals who have stood up their own operations. We also see both sides of the aisle to be clear, political consultants engaging in similar behaviors as on social media manipulation tactics. So it really comes down to who is the actor and what is the goal. Now fast forward. One of the things that we saw, unfortunately, and it’s very unfortunate that it took essentially an insurrection attempt at the US Capitol to really catapult this conversation.</p><p>And there are a variety of research organizations including ours that had been beating this drum for several years now. And so people were saying, oh, it’s just a meme, but no, it can really, you know, disinformation really can lead to offline harms. And we know that. We’ve seen that with Pizzagate, We’ve seen that with different events such as the LA Dodgers stadium being shut&nbsp;down.</p><p>So we are seeing more and more offline action happening as a result of disinformation. I think one of the things about what happened at the US Capitol, is it’s a really important case study. And I say that, and I know it sounds clinical but because what happened was obviously a horrible day for our democracy. And I think it affected the research community in a variety of different ways. That was a very tough month for everyone. So I don’t wanna sound overly clinical about it, but in a lot of ways, there are a lot of lessons that can be learned. So for example, we can draw a straight line from some of the narratives that were happening in March saying that the election would be rigged, that there would be political violence, that people needed to start preparing for the worst, to what happened on January 6th. One of the good things to come out of January 6th, though, is that most people get a second chance. Not everybody, obviously there’s a Capitol police officer who died in the line of duty protecting the Capitol, but we’re able to really learn from this moment and move forward so that we’re addressing this threat in a way that does make it so that we’re able to identify these online threats and prevent them from becoming offline&nbsp;harm.</p><p>OL: Thank you for that summation of not only what happened on January 6th but for illustrating that you can draw a through-line between the initial Stop the Steal on narratives and organizing to what ended up happening on the 6th. And what I think is also projected to continue this week on the 4th. Can you talk a little bit about your practice at Alethea Group and how you help organizations navigate through this new digital environment?</p><p>LK: So at Alethea Group, what we do is we detect instances of disinformation, misinformation, and social media manipulation, as well as track other types of online harm such as targeted harassment to be able to help individuals figure out how to navigate this new digital reality. I think that a lot of times people don’t realize how many options they actually have. So for example, if you’re able to detect what a lot of people are doing right now is they’re analyzing something once it’s already gotten onto Twitter, onto Facebook, onto YouTube, for example, and it’s on one of these mainstream platforms and they call the social media platforms and they say, please take it down. That’s one option. But if you’ve gotten to that point, in a lot of ways it may already be too late. So what we do is we practice early detection. So we catch narratives when they start and we’re able to then track them and understand how they may be influencing individuals and seeking to change individual’s behavior. We analyze on the network level. And what that does is it enables us to take more&nbsp;options.</p><p>So for example, let’s take these for-profit disinformation networks. Well, you know, if they’re making a profit off of a potential organization, there could be an opportunity to seek damages. If they’re misappropriating intellectual property such as your name, your likeness, trademarkable or patentable, or copyrighted material, there are legal options that organizations can take to seek recourse. And if there is an opportunity to do counter-messaging, and I’m not talking about fact-checking and our experience fact-checking, while it’s helpful in creating a paper of record or it’s helpful in giving something to point to, to set the story straight, it’s not sufficient. And here’s why. The people who are choosing to believe in a narrative aren’t necessarily going to believe something salacious about — change their mind — and say they no longer believe something that’s totally salacious about you and confirms their biases about you just because you’re the one that said it isn’t true. So we’re talking about really counter-narrative building. And that can be done in an ethical way by creating a greater understanding around an individual or an organization. So what we do is we help through the entire process. So we detect what’s happening, we assess whether or not it’s having an impact on an organization’s goal. And then we help to mitigate any potential impacts, the idea being that we can solve a lot of problems before they become a real issue or a challenge for an organization.</p><p>OL: Along with the expansion of the threat landscape, there has been sort of an uptick in sustained information events, like the COVID pandemic, like Stop the Steal, and just a lot of that, not just disinformation, but chatter around the election. Are there other structural developments or other factors that you attribute to the expansion of the threat landscape and the shifts that you know the shift in focus from foreign disinformation to domestic?</p><p>LK: Yeah. I think one of the things about disinformation and, you know, there was conversation around how this was gonna happen after 2016 because it’s fast, cheap, and easy to do. If you know how to run a good marketing campaign, you can probably figure out how to run a disinformation campaign. And so with that, and then you also look historically, open-source estimates say that the Russian inner attempt to influence the 2016 election cost a million dollars, which is a rounding error to most large organizations or federal governments. So it wasn’t a question of if other organizations were going to start engaging in these tactics, it was a question of when. And I think what we’ve seen is the proliferation of that. It’s the proliferation of the number of threat actors that’s causing an increased number of threats when it comes to the disinformation landscape.</p><p>So going to the COVID-19 pandemic, and these narratives have shifted over time and they vary again, based on the threat actor. So one thing we saw, and again this is all open-source, just Russian state media. You know we did see Russian state media pushing race narratives targeting different communities and trying to pit them against each other. We saw RT put out content that was more focused on, you know, “what’s the big deal with calling it the China virus,” for example, “we called it the Spanish flu.” And RT typically targets one audience. And then we saw it in the NOW, which is, typically targeting younger audiences on Instagram with videos being like, “if you are Asian, you will get attacked in New York City.” And it’s not to say that people haven’t experienced those sorts of attacks. And, you know, as a result of disinformation, going back to the online to offline action, and I don’t wanna make it sound like it’s just the Russian government because there are definitely other actors who are playing in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>But it is I think just providing more opportunities from that perspective. And then, similarly, there’s the financial motivations and the financial perspective. So we’ll see some of these junk domains pushing false information about the pandemic and they’re doing so because they are likely to generate a profit. They have advertising revenue that they’re getting from clicks. So I think it really does depend on who the actor is as to why they’re pushing it, but because it’s so cheap, easy, and potentially lucrative to do as well as it works from a geopolitical perspective. So, and if it’s cheap, why not try it? There’s not really a high cost to people who are executing these sorts of campaigns.</p><p>OL: Not at all. And I would just echo what you said by pointing out that it’s been so interesting that since 2016, you know our own elected leaders see value in exploiting the sort of fissures in society that we have and exploiting them for their own political gain. And as you mentioned, this happens both on the right and on the left. I wanna shift gears and talk about some of the specific mitigations.</p><p>So one of the most significant impediments to legislating on disinformation and engaging on it from a policy or regulatory perspective is that moderation is often criticized as being a brush up against the First Amendment. What is your thinking around how regulation can encourage effective moderation without brushing up against those First Amendment concerns? And then I guess also more broadly, what is your thinking around what the government’s role should be in addressing domestic disinformation?</p><p>LK: Well, I do appreciate and admire a lot of our colleagues in this space who are putting out really important research that can inform eventual legislation. Where I see the opportunity for more immediate action is actually through other means such as our judicial system. And I’ll get to that in a second. When it comes to the First Amendment, that’s an argument that I just don’t really buy. We accept limits to speech in real life. I can’t yell fire in a movie theater — like there will be consequences for me. We’ve accepted that there are some limits on speech in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>And so I think we should be reframing this question to say, how can we make the online conversation more reflective of the conversations that we have offline? I think one of the things that’s become really clear in the pandemic when we’ve all been forced inside and online to a degree is, that that’s not where we’re at right now but there’s no reason why that’s not where we can be. I think what we need to be talking about too, though, is when it comes to content moderation, I don’t think that that necessarily removes the threat altogether. For example, we saw a lot of accounts be deplatformed for breaking the terms of service multiple times. And again, I think that’s a perfectly acceptable consequence. It’s kinda like the “no shirt, no shoes no service” version of social media platforms. It’s like, if you break the rules on multiple occasions you’re not gonna be allowed back in. But where I think we need to be headed and where I think we’re going to see the most progress in the immediate, is enforcing some of the laws that are already on the&nbsp;books.</p><p>So for example the Dominion lawsuit that’s ongoing right now is something that I’m paying attention to. I think that that is a potential avenue. We’ve also seen some successes when it comes to copyright infringements because bad guys aren’t really paying attention to following the laws if they’re spinning up disinformation campaigns. So I think that we can potentially anticipate some actions taken there. I think that the other thing that has been interesting to watch unfold is, the Stop Hate for Profit sort of activism. I think that that is potentially having an impact as well. So all that said, I don’t see this as a speech-only issue. I think that there are very serious concerns especially when we’re thinking about the world outside of the United States and the Western liberal order where sometimes social media is how you evade censorship. And so these are really tough challenges and there are no easy solutions. And I think having these conversations and debates is hugely important because if this were an easy fix, it would be solved by now. But I am confident that this is something that we will begin to see, and we’ve seen progress since 2016 to be fair. But we will continue to see progress. We will continue to see solutions proposed and implemented.</p><p>OL: You had mentioned earlier that you have observed that fact-checking is not necessarily the most effective way to clamp down on some of the bad and false information we see circulating online and certainly not enough to interrupt the cementing of alternate realities that really disinformation is intended to&nbsp;foster.</p><p>LK: Yeah. So I think that fact-checking definitely plays a role but I don’t think it’s something that can be done alone. I think, you know, labeling that sort of thing. These are relatively new features. And so, well, how effective they are — that’s a little bit outside of my purview. And I look forward to reading somebody’s research someday that did a longitudinal study on how effective labels were on any given social media user. But I do think we need to start thinking about this challenge more holistically than we currently are, right? So for example, it’s not just what’s happening on social media platforms, it’s also what’s happening on blogs. It’s how some of these disinformation networks are being financed. It’s through advertising revenue, it’s through, frankly, people who are building influence and then turning around and selling it for profit. Those are all things that I think we can incorporate into part of the solution when we’re trying to figure out, how do we put out the fire that’s happening right&nbsp;now?</p><p>I think when we look towards long-term solutions to figure out, what is it that we can do to really change the equation to make it so that disinformation is not as successful as it is now? There’s all kinds of things we can do but I keep coming back to education. If every single person knew what we knew and likely what everybody who’s listened to these podcasts knew, we’d be in a lot better shape. So how do we make it so that we’re not so special anymore? How do we make it so that the general population is more resilient to disinflation? And a lot of that has to do with education. So when I was in high school we used to do these things where we would basically learn how to read a news article. We would learn how to read a newspaper based on, you know what page was the article on in the newspaper for relative importance. What paper were we reading? Who’s the author? When was the paper published? How do you read the first two paragraphs? How do you read for bias? Why aren’t we teaching that for a digitized world? Because I am still pretty old school and I like physical newspapers, so I get them but I am like the rarest subscriber you will see for my age demographic. Like one of the things we need to consider is how do we modernize our approach to consuming media? And I don’t wanna put it on the social media user to protect themselves from a sophisticated information operation. But again, when you think about it as a holistic solution this can also be a piece of the puzzle that really makes the difference.</p><p>OL: So Lisa, my final closing question for you is, do you have anything that you think about as something that could be maybe a smaller low-intensity effort, but could make a world of difference in terms of moving the needle forward on this&nbsp;problem?</p><p>LK: Yeah, so I think that I always come back to, if every individual just stopped and thought before they hit send, or tweet, or post, or share, or whatever, I think we are all potential threat vectors, for furthering a disinformation or misinformation flow because disinformation and misinformation target us and our biases. And so by not sharing it and spreading it, we’re not making the problem worse. So I think if everybody did that, it would go a long&nbsp;way.</p><p>OL: Thank you so much, Lisa. I really enjoyed our conversation. Thanks for joining&nbsp;me.</p><p>LK: Thanks for having&nbsp;me.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-breakdown-lisa-kaplan-on-domestic-disinformation-f86bdecf3147">The Breakdown: Lisa Kaplan on domestic disinformation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Beth Kanter, Chief Advocacy &amp; Strategic Communications Officer</p><p>The past year has seen working Americans struggle amidst a global pandemic and economic crisis, further exacerbating the deep, structural inequities in our society. Over and over again, the rules, ideas, and power that lie at the heart of our economy and democracy have rewarded the few at the expense of the many. In order to build a truly equitable and inclusive society, these trends must be quickly reversed. President Biden signing the American Rescue Plan into law today moves us one step closer to that&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Because of critical aid in the American Rescue Plan, child poverty in the United States is expected to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/26/970999998/with-one-move-congress-could-lift-millions-of-children-out-of-poverty">drop by half</a>. More than one million unionized working people who faced the prospect of losing their pensions will now receive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/business/dealbook/bailout-pensions-stimulus.html">full retirement benefits</a> for at least the next 30 years. The government will be sending direct <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/1400-stimulus-checks-who-is-eligible-how-soon-they-could-arrive.html">relief checks</a> to the majority of Americans who earn less than $75,000 a year. Unemployed Americans will receive an extra $300 on top of their current benefits through the end of this summer. State and local governments will finally get <a href="https://statescoop.com/senate-approves-relief-package-with-350b-in-state-and-local-aid/">urgently needed aid</a> so they don’t have to make harmful cuts or enact&nbsp;layoffs.</p><p>This $1.9 trillion investment in families will help set us on a course toward an economy that works for all Americans. While there is still much to be done, Omidyar Network welcomes this momentous piece of legislation and we look forward to collaborating with our partners, grantees and policy makers to continue the path forward to a more equitable and inclusive society.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/omidyar-network-applauds-enactment-of-the-american-rescue-plan-5d2b395e90d5">Omidyar Network Applauds Enactment of the American Rescue Plan</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Announcing ELP <p>Today we're excited to announce that we are officially opening applications for the Ceramic Mainnet Early Launch Program (ELP). This program allows a limited number of projects to get early access to the Ceramic mainnet before it is opened to the general public later this year.</p><p><a href="https://3boxlabs.typeform.com/to/XizKdGH2">Apply to the Early Launch Program</a> if you want to deploy your <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> and/or <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> project to production in the coming months. </p> FAQs  Who is the program for? <p>ELP is for projects that want to use Ceramic and/or IDX in production ASAP. We created this program so you could get started immediately.</p> When does the program start? <p>Starting today we will begin accepting applications on a rolling basis. For those accepted into the program, mainnet access will begin in approximately 4-6 weeks. We will communicate the official mainnet start date via email. Before mainnet is ready, you can start prototyping your application on the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">Clay Testnet</a>.</p> How do I apply? <p><a href="https://3boxlabs.typeform.com/to/XizKdGH2">Apply using this form</a>. Our team will promptly evaluate submissions and reach out via email when we are ready to onboard your project. Please provide as much detail as possible to help us evaluate your submission.</p> How will you evaluate applications? <p>We have a set of evaluation criteria but generally we will prioritize projects with the most active users, those who have been most active in our community, those who plan to go live with Ceramic/IDX as soon as possible, those with the most interesting use cases, those that deliver the most aggregate value to the Ceramic ecosystem, and those who can commit to providing us detailed feedback.</p> What happens if I'm on the waitlist? <p>While you're waiting, you can begin prototyping and building your application on the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">Clay Testnet</a> and contributing in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>. We will accept projects from the waitlist on a rolling basis.</p> What are the program details? <p>Projects that have been accepted into the ELP get early access to Ceramic mainnet nodes running on <a href="https://3boxlabs.com/">3Box Labs</a> infrastructure. For the duration of the program, these will be the only nodes connected to mainnet.</p> Is this a "centralized mainnet"? <p>We like to think of ELP as a mainnet with training wheels. All the primary features of mainnet are there such as a Ceramic mainnet pubsub topic and anchoring document updates on the Ethereum mainnet, but by limiting variables such as the number of nodes on the network and the number of overall participants we can make sure everything works well in a controlled production environment before opening the network to the chaos of the general public.</p> How long does the program last? <p>We have not yet set an end date. We will conclude the program and launch the public Ceramic mainnet when we feel the network has been battle tested enough by applications in production during ELP.</p> What happens at the conclusion of the program? <p>After ELP has concluded, Ceramic mainnet will be released to the general public and anyone can run a node and deploy their project in production.</p> When is public mainnet launching? <p>At the conclusion of ELP.</p> Where can I learn more? <p>Join the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Sign up today <p><a href="https://3boxlabs.typeform.com/to/XizKdGH2">Complete the ELP application</a></p>

<p>1.What is the mission and vision of  Stonebridge Solutions?</p>



<p>Stonebridge’s primary objective is to establish new mechanisms for identification, privacy and security to enable legitimacy, establish trust between two unknown parties and prevent fraud before it happens.</p>



<p>Our next generation technologies anticipate evolving and growing threats to both consumers and merchants and are designed to prevent these risks and empower users to positively impact their security and privacy as they transact digitally.</p>



<p>Our vision is to reduce the economic impact of fraud by provisioning a secure &amp; private ‘digital last mile’ for payment.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



 <a href="https://stonebridgesolutions.ca">https://stonebridgesolutions.ca</a>/ 



<p>The world is experiencing a social and economic shift at an unprecedented rate. This is driving the growth of new and more sophisticated threat models and legacy systems and technologies that are not easily adapted to address them creating a large gap being exploited by fraudsters and driving a an urgent need for a trusted digital identity.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>One of XUMI’s founding principles it that there is economic value creation through the prevention of fraud and the elimination of risks through the establishment of a trusted digital ID that can be legitimized at the point of interaction.</p>



<p>We also believe that the promotion of digitization in Canada coincident with a Pan-Canadian framework for digital identity will enable greater and more efficient access to banking, government benefits, education, health care and many essential services while facilitating the security of the digital footprint and this will strengthen Canada’s economy locally and its position globally.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space?</p>



<p>Canada has a significant role to play as a leader in digital identity and trust. We have a demonstrated history of ‘locking arms together’ collaboratively to work towards the common good. When that is blended with best in class technology, banking, government, and healthcare through DIACC we can effect a change and establish a framework for success for others to model.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>We joined DIACC because we understand and share the mission. We believe in the ‘root of trust’ being established and held by a trusted authority and have designed the last mile to extend this in a secure way to consumers and merchants. When we set out 4 years ago we believed that the road to global digital transformation was long, and then suddenly it wasn’t. Our technology is bigger than we are, and it has the ability to change the game, switch things up, have impact. We believe in the power of partnership and collaboration between great teams to solve extraordinary challenges. While working quietly away on our tech we’ve witnessed an unprecedented shift to digital in the last year, and alarming growth in the risks associated with it. We want to help, lend what ever we can to eliminate those risks and feel we can further that objective through DIACC.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Stonebridge Solutions is a small, focused tech company located in Vancouver BC. Our objective of eliminating fraud began with the simple phrase “there has to be a simpler, more secure and easier way”. </p>



<p>We’ve spent 4 years devoting ourselves to eliminating the threat models associated with merchant payment, mobile wallets and mobile devices while designing innovative, intuitive and frictionless experiences for users, and a platform to support it under the brand name XUMI.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to sponsor the Identity, Unlocked podcast. This week’s episode <a href="https://identityunlocked.auth0.com/public/49/Identity%2C-Unlocked.--bed7fada/ad784008">“eKYC with Mark Haine” features host Vittorio Bertocci and special guest Mark Haine</a>. The episode focuses on the work of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">OpenID Foundation’s eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Working Group</a>. Mark Haine is the Director at considrd.consulting and one of the Co-chairs of the eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Working Group. Among the many dots Mark is connecting on behalf of the OpenID Foundation is work with the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, the Open Identity Exchange Trust Framework Initiatives and the Open Banking Implementation Entity.</p>
<p>The working group is named for two processes that are largely the same but represent different industries. eKYC or Electronic Know Your Customer is a process most closely tied to the financial industry, whereas identity assurance is the more generic counterpart present in most other sectors. Identity assurance is the process of establishing the Identity of someone you’re interacting with within a very reliable fashion, and while it was historically often carried out in person, the rapid transition to new technologies and options for remote engagement have created a need to find ways of moving identity assurance online and allowing for it to be done in a standardized fashion.</p>
<p>The working group <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/charter/">charter</a>, in summary, explains the group’s aim to deliver a tech solution that communicates “verified claims” and information about how they were verified. The metadata about the “verified claims” answers questions of how and when claims were established. The working group represents many countries and industries and was launched in the context of the OpenID Foundation because of the natural connections between the foundation and the group’s initiative. Offering further detail on this project, Mark comments on the choice not to mandate but strongly encourage the use of FAPI, the level of adoption of the working group’s spec thus far, and – with regard to deliverables – what specification documents and definitions the group is working with. As the conversation winds to a close, Mark explains the danger of using scope, the benefits of the TXN claim within the working group’s specification, the PKI analogy for the trust framework, and ways listeners can help by fostering awareness of the program and its many less obvious use cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

     <p>Chain of custody </p> <p>A time-ordered sequence of parties who take physical custody of an object or collection of objects as it moves through a supply chain network. </p> <p>Chain of ownership </p> <p>A time-ordered sequence of parties who take legal possession of an object or collection of objects as it moves through a supply chain network. </p> <p>Critical Tracking Event (CTE) </p> <p>A record of completion of a step in the business process in a supply chain, that is critical to record and share, in order to ensure end-to-end traceability.</p> <p>Key Data Element (KDE)</p> <p>Those data required to be present in a CTE to accurately represent what occurred in the step of a business process, in order to ensure traceability. </p> <p>Party </p> <p>An organisation or individual acting as an entity in a supply chain. Parties may play multiple different roles in the supply chain. </p> <p>Supply chain </p> <p>A supply chain is a system of organisations and business processes that are involved in the manufacture, distribution and maintenance of a product or asset. </p> <p>Supply chain visibility </p> <p>The awareness of, and control over, specific information related to product orders and physical shipments, including transport and logistics activities and the statuses of events and milestones that occur prior to and in-transit. [Aberdeen Group] </p> <p>Traceability</p> <p>Traceability is the ability to trace the history, application or location of an object [ISO 9005:2015]. When considering a product or a service traceability can relate to:</p> <p>■ the origin of materials and parts;</p> <p>■ the processing history;</p> <p>■ the distribution and location of the product or service after delivery. </p> <p>For practical reasons, “trace” or “track and trace” may be used as equivalent terms to designate the action of ensuring the traceability. </p> <p>Traceability system </p> <p>The system used by an individual party to manage traceability in its supply chain(s). A traceability system includes mechanisms for the identification of objects and for the capture of information about observations of those objects over time as they move between locations or participate in various business processes. </p> <p>Traceability party </p> <p>A party that has been selected to be in scope of a traceability system. Parties in scope of traceability systems may include those that take custody of traceable objects, those that take ownership of traceable objects, those that inspect traceable objects, those that insure traceable objects, etc. End-customers (including consumers and patients) will often not be treated as traceability parties, since they do not necessarily carry a traceability responsibility and very often remain unknown to the other traceability parties.</p> <p>Traceability location </p> <p>A traceability location is a designated physical area that has been selected to be in scope of a traceability system. </p> <p>Traceable object </p> <p>A traceable object is a physical or digital object whose supply chain path can and needs to be determined. </p> <p>Tracing </p> <p>Tracing is the capability to identify the origin and characteristics or history of a particular traceable object upstream (through earlier observations) based on data recorded at defined points of the supply chain. Trace or Tracing backward or ascending traceability </p> <p>Tracking</p> <p>Tracking is the capability to locate or follow the path of a particular traceable object downstream (through later observations) based on data recorded at defined points of the supply chain. Track forward or descending traceability </p> <p>Transparency </p> <p>Transparency refers to the need to ensure visibility and access to accurate information across supply chains (inclusive of consumers), including the provision of relevant traceability data to trading partners and consumers in a spirit of openness. </p> <p>Visibility </p> <p>Visibility is the ability to know exactly where things are at any point in time, or where they have been, and why.</p> <p>Visibility event data </p> <p>Visibility event data are records of the completion of business process steps in which physical or digital entities are handled. [ARCH] </p> <p>Each visibility event captures what objects participated in the process, when the process took place, where the objects were and will be afterwards, and why (that is, what was the business context in which the process took place).</p>

It could be tracked, traced, recalled or withdrawn. It could exist in multiple locations at the same time (for example, if identified at the trade item and batch level).  A traceable item may be related to another traceable item. It is the choice of the Traceability Partner which identification level (e.g. GTIN or Lot/Batch or serial level) to use for the traceable item. See also definition for process</p>   <p>Trace Request</p>   <p>A formal inquiry about the history, application, or location of a traceable item.

<p>10 March 2021 – Today, the <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/">Baseline Protocol</a>, part of the Ethereum OASIS Open Project and in partnership with <a href="http://opencollective.com/opensource">Open Source Collective</a>, announced that it has received a grant of $100,000 from the <a href="https://ethereum.foundation">Ethereum Foundation</a> to be used for the purpose of encouraging and accelerating baseline protocol R&amp;D and enablement efforts. This comes on the first anniversary of the community’s formation.</p>



<p><a href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/">Launched in March</a> of 2020, the Baseline Protocol uses advances in peer-to-peer messaging, zero-knowledge cryptography, and blockchain technology to coordinate complex, confidential workflows between enterprises without moving company data out of traditional systems of record.&nbsp; Today, hundreds of companies and thousands of individuals are actively participating in the initiative, which coordinates with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.&nbsp; For more information go to <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/">baseline-protocol.org</a>.</p>



 “2021 is stacking up to be a breakout year for Enterprise blockchain usage with more and more projects landing on the public Mainnet,” said Dan Shaw of the Ethereum Foundation. “Baseline has been a key driver of this, since the protocol enables private collaboration between enterprises without putting any sensitive data on-chain.” 



<p>The Baseline Protocol community conducts steering committee meetings every two weeks. Starting in April 2021, these meetings will include a segment to hear proposals for projects seeking funding from the grant pool. Each month, the Technical Steering Committee will allocate a portion of the total grant to selected projects. Allocations are managed by the <a href="https://opencollective.com/baseline-protocol">Open Source Collective</a>. These projects can include technical work such as contributions to open source code and also can include work to contribute enablement content, documentation and outreach programs. For more information on proposing projects for grants and bounties, go <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/news/grants-ef-funding-2021/">here</a>.</p>



<p>It is hoped that this grant will attract other organizations to contribute additional funding to the effort. Organizations interested in contributing can do so <a href="https://opencollective.com/baseline-protocol#category-CONTRIBUTE">here</a>.</p>

<p>Conviction Voting (CV) is a governance mechanism that allows users to signal their preference on various issues by staking their tokens on proposals. A proposal passes if it has sufficient weight allocated to it. The weight of a proposal is calculated based on the amount of tokens that have been staked and the amount of time these tokens have been staked. The <a href="https://medium.com/commonsstack/announcing-the-conviction-voting-cadcad-model-release-8e907ce67e4e">introduction to conviction voting</a> by Common Stack is a great primer if you want to learn more about how CV works. </p><p>Implementations of CV so far have been developed on the EVM, which makes the results and outcomes completely trustless. While there are some deployments like <a href="https://1hive.org">1Hive</a> and <a href="https://cv.commonsstack.org">Common Stack</a>, high gas costs and the sub-optimal user experience of transferring tokens for every vote make this quite problematic. Fortunately conviction voting systems can be securely implemented using off-chain, verifiable data structures. Building CV systems off-chain, as opposed to on-chain, avoids the high gas costs and poor user experience that plagues current implementations while still achieving verifiability and participant trust.</p><p>This article will explain how you can use <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> and <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> as an underlying data structure to build a conviction voting dapp.</p> Intro to Ceramic and IDX <p>Ceramic is a decentralized protocol for verifiable, version-controlled content. Ceramic is used to create mutable documents on IPFS with permanent identifiers, called DocIDs. All document updates are signed and then periodically anchored into the blockchain for time-stamping and consensus. You can think of a single Ceramic document as its own ledger (a doc-chain) which contains all the information needed to reconstruct the state of the document in a completely trustless manner. For more details refer to the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md">Ceramic specification</a>.</p><p>IDX is a decentralized identity protocol built on top of Ceramic which makes it easy to associate data to a user, discover data a user has created, and build user-centric applications. You can think of IDX as a decentralized user table. Each user has their own index which is a map from definitions to records. Definitions are globally-defined descriptions of data created by developers. Each user has their own individual record for each definition which stores their content. For more information have a look at the <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/learn/overview/">IDX developer documentation</a>.</p> System overview <p>The proposed conviction voting system is based on an ERC20 token that is periodically snapshotted. This means that the token balances of all users are not updated continuously but instead on a set interval, e.g. twice a day. Additionally, users can easily change their voting preferences at any time.</p><p>There are three main system components:</p>  User-created content including: 1) proposal documents which contain information for a given proposal, and 2) conviction documents where users set their preferences among all live proposals  A snapshot service that takes snapshots of the balances of all users of a particular ERC20 token, calculates the total conviction weight for all proposals from users' conviction documents, and saves them into a conviction state document  An oracle system that resolves passed proposals on-chain when the conviction state document has sufficient conviction weight for any given proposal   User-created content  Proposal document <p>Any user can create a proposal document when they want to request funds for a project. This document could contain any amount of information, but most important to be included is: <code>context</code> the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-19.md">caip-19 asset id</a> (ERC20 token address) that is used for the conviction voting, <code>beneficiary</code> the receiver of the funds if the proposal passes, <code>amount</code> the amount of funds to send if the proposal passes.</p><p>Example content<br>This example is a proposal to get some funding for a project. Other proposals might include executing a transaction with call data, setting a protocol parameter, or updating some organizational document.</p> <code>{
  context: "eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474...", // ERC20 adddress as CAIP-19
  title: "Develop an off-chain conviction voting system",
  currency: "ETH",
  amount: 200,
  beneficiary: "0xabcdef",
  description: "Fund team X to implement off-chain conviction voting using Ceramic &amp; IDX.",
  url: "https://ceramic.network"
}
</code> <p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">Proposal document schema in CIP-87</a></p> Convictions document <p>Each participant in the conviction voting system creates their own convictions document when they first interact with the conviction voting dapp. This document contains the convictions the user has assigned to various proposals as a fraction of their entire token holdings. Every time they change their preference the underlying Ceramic document gets updated, signed, and eventually anchored on-chain.</p><p>A conviction voting dapp would create a definition as defined in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">CIP-87</a> and each user would store a convictions document as a record in their IDX.</p><p>Example content<br>In this example we see a single user's convictions document. They have created <code>proposal2</code> and they have allocated different fractions of their token holdings to proposal 1, 2, and 3.</p> <code>{
  context: "eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474...", // ERC20 adddress as CAIP-19
  proposals: ["&lt;proposal2-DocID&gt;"],
  convictions: [{
    proposal: "&lt;proposal1-DocID&gt;",
    allocation: 0.2,
  }, {
    proposal: "&lt;proposal2-DocID&gt;",
    allocation: 0.5,
  }, {
    proposal: "&lt;proposal3-DocID&gt;",
    allocation: 0.3,
  }]
}
</code> <p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">Preference document schema in CIP-87</a></p> Snapshot service <p>The snapshot service performs the task of periodically taking a snapshot of the balances of all token holders of the particular ERC20 being used. Using this information together with individual users' conviction documents, it <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb">calculates the total conviction</a> and writes it to a conviction state document. This service is not trusted since anyone could compute the same conviction state by simply grabbing the data from the blockchain. The service executes at a set time interval, for example twice a day.</p> Syncing data &amp; performing calculations <p>Since we are not restricted to calculate the conviction score for all proposals on-chain we can simply use the discrete version of the conviction voting algorithm which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb">1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad</a>. On every discrete time interval the snapshot service grabs all token holders and their balances from the blockchain (e.g. using TheGraph). The address of each token holder is used to look up their individual IDX document which should contain their convictions document. The total conviction y_t+1 can now be calculated for each proposal using the formula in Figure 1.</p>Figure 1: How to calculate the total conviction for each proposal j. Source: <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb">https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb</a><p>Once total conviction for each proposal is calculated, the snapshot service also calculates the trigger function for each proposal. Finally the service updates the conviction state document with the new state.</p> Conviction state document <p>The conviction state document stores the full state of the conviction voting system. It is created and updated by the snapshot service. It contains two main arrays as well as supply information:</p>  <code>participants</code> - all token holders, their current token balance, and the latest CommitID of their convictions document at the time the snapshot was made  <code>proposals</code> - all active proposals and their total conviction which has been calculated by the snapshot service  <code>supply</code> - the total supply of the ERC20 token that is used for governance  <p>Example content<br>In this example we see that there are two participants who have a token balance and have created their own convictions documents. We also see that there are two active proposals, both of which have not yet been triggered, and have different levels of total conviction.</p> <code>{
  context: "eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474...", // ERC20 adddress as CAIP-19
  supply: 9001,
  participants: [{
    account: "0x12345...",
    balance: 1337,
    convictions: "&lt;convictions1-CommitID&gt;"
  }, {
    account: "0xabcde...",
    balance: 42,
    convictions: "&lt;convictions2-CommitID&gt;"
  }],
  proposals: [{
    proposal: "&lt;proposal1-DocID&gt;",
    totalConviction: 234,
    triggered: false
  }, {
    proposal: "&lt;proposal2-DocID&gt;",
    totalConviction: 432,
    triggered: false
  }]
}
</code> <p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">Conviction state document schema in CIP-87</a></p> Oracle system <p>Once we have the conviction state document it's trivial to check the <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/BlockScience/Aragon_Conviction_Voting/blob/master/models/v3/Trigger_Function_Explanation.ipynb">trigger function</a> for any particular proposal. When a proposal has sufficient weight an oracle service (e.g. Chainlink) can be triggered to submit the data of the passed proposal on-chain. This would send the requested funds to the beneficiary in the proposal. It's also possible to use conviction voting to set smart contract parameters or proposal ranking (not execution). In these cases we would calculate a dynamic average instead of using a trigger function.</p> Executing proposals on-chain <p>In order to execute the transaction on-chain we can use an oracle system to get the relevant state from the conviction state document on-chain if a proposal has been triggered. Ideally this would be a set of oracles that can independently verify the state of this document before it's committed on-chain. However, in many cases it might be sufficient to use a simpler oracle system such as Chainlink to simply fetch the state of the document from the Ceramic gateway. The main data that needs to make it on-chain is <code>beneficiary</code> and <code>amount</code>.</p> Notes on security  Snapshot trust <p>The main point of trust in this system is the snapshot service. While anyone can independently verify that it has performed the proper calculations, this might not always happen. When implementing this CV system in production there likely needs to be some additional checks and balances that enable the snapshot service to be replaced. Alternatively a system may choose to require multiple snapshot service providers that are operated by independent parties.</p> Proposal manipulation <p>The proposal document could be updated to request a larger <code>amount</code> of funds after it has already started getting a large amount of conviction. In order to mitigate this attack, the snapshot service might require users to reconfirm their conviction for the proposal, without losing the time staked, before it is triggered.</p> Convictions reorg attack <p>Since Ceramic documents currently rely on the "earliest anchor wins" conflict resolution method, a user could perform a <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md#data-withholding-attacks">data withholding attack</a> where their conviction would be counted twice. The attack would involve the user first updating their preference document to proposal A and anchoring it, but withholding this data by not submitting it to the Ceramic network. Then they would set their preference doc to proposal B and publicly submit this to the network. Once proposal B has been passed, they would publish their data about proposal A which would invalidate their conviction on proposal B (because A was anchored earlier) and it would look as if they have staked their tokens on proposal A for a long period of time. This entire problem is solved by the fact that the snapshot service sets the CommitID of the user's preference doc in the snapshot document. So if a user cheats like this it would be simple to see that they have double voted and all of their votes would be invalidated from that point in time.</p> Alternative implementations <p>IDX can be used to store any type of user-related data such as verifications for social accounts (Twitter, Github, Discord, Discourse, ...), a BrightID score, or any other similar information. This flexibility makes it possible to easily experiment with quadratic voting where accounts that are less likely to be sybils can influence the vote more.</p><p>Using an oracle to trigger actions on-chain would be ideal, but as a minimum viable product it might be simpler to just use the off-chain voting system as a way to generate signal. A trusted multi-sig can then be used to execute on-chain actions, similar to how <a href="http://snapshot.page">snapshot.page</a> is used.</p> Get involved! <p>This article outlines a basic framework for how off-chain conviction voting systems can be built, but there are still many details that need to be solved.

<p>By Audrey Stienon, Analyst, Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>This post expands on the first key pillar for building a new economic paradigm as outlined in <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Our Call to Reimagine Capitalism</a>. Read the first post in this series, “An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and Economy”&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">here</a>.</p><p>Five decades ago, our society experienced a seismic shift. Underneath the layers of headlines about the crises of the day — lingering economic stagnation, growing calls for civil rights and racial justice, and the departure of a disgraced president — the values that we used to guide our lives were changing. Old traditions and ideals were being abandoned, and new ones were emerging. <br> <br>One value, in particular, quickly rose to the forefront of our social discourse and crystalized to become our cultural touchstone: individual liberty. <br> <br> Liberty, of course, is a bedrock American value — ranking right in between “life” and “the pursuit of happiness” in the Declaration of Independence. Our country was founded on the belief that a society and economy can only truly thrive when individuals are free to pursue their desires and self-interests, both at the ballot box as a citizen of a democratic nation, and in the free market as an enterprising participant of a capitalist system.<br> <br>For two hundred years, a commitment to liberty was one of the integral pieces of the base on which we sought to construct an ever-larger, ever-more-inclusive American society. In the 1970s, however, this base of diverse values and norms failed to shelter us from the crises of the time, and we chose to prioritize liberty as the base value that could keep our social edifice standing. Meanwhile, we abandoned the other values, norms, and institutions supporting our society as unnecessary constraints on liberty, and through willful neglect if not active undermining, allowed these parts of our social foundations to erode and decay.<br> <br>To build on this new, more sparse, foundation of values, we turned to a set of ideas that described markets as the ideal tool for maximizing liberty. Ideal markets, after all, are ones where anyone is free to buy, sell, work, or trade without interference. We therefore accepted as fact a simple, yet compelling theory: that these free markets, by generating wealth and automatically distributing it from businesses to working people, would create the best possible society for everyone. <br> <br>For the past fifty years, these ideas have been the blueprint we used to design and build our society.<br> <br>We have measured the wellbeing of our society by tracking the wellbeing of markets, and lauded ourselves as GDP, corporate profits, job numbers, and the stock market continued to rise. <br> <br>We have sought to remove government from markets and our lives: lowering taxes, deregulating, and increasingly relying on markets to provide services that had once been the responsibility of government. We worked to weaken labor unions, community leaders, even our own elected representatives — anyone who threatened to challenge the wisdom of markets. <br> <br>At the same time, we have empowered business leaders and trade associations, assured that these job creators knew best how to generate profits that would naturally, and without intervention, trickle down to the rest of society. <br> <br>Have trickle-down economics worked? If we view our society through the narrow frame of profits and growth, we could almost believe that the last fifty years have been a success. Look at the stock market! If it’s reaching record heights, then we must all be richer than we’ve ever been before!<br> <br>But, of course, we all know this view to be a delusion. By so many measures, our economy has failed us. Our growing GDP masks our growing inequality, just as rising job numbers ignore how job quality and wages have been falling, forcing more and more people to work multiple jobs while still being barely able to support their families. Meanwhile, growing corporate profits do not mean this wealth is shared with the working people who made those profits possible — let alone invested to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/windfall-profits-and-deadly-risks/">protect people’s health during a pandemic. </a>Finally, an excess focus on free markets has, if anything made the markets themselves weaker — less innovative, less competitive, less resilient — as businesses used their new freedom to earn profits through monopolies and rent seeking rather than producing services of value to society.<br> <br>If these fifty years have been an experiment of an economic theory, it is time to conclude, based on overwhelming evidence, that it has failed. Freer markets did not create a freer society. In fact, by “freeing” business from having to account for the negative consequences of their behavior, we burdened people, communities, and the planet with the growing weight of these costs, and by “freeing” people from familial, community, and public support systems, we forced people to pay the full price of any accident or mistake they might run into. <br> <br>In doing so, we eliminated the choices people could make. How many of us have been unable to search for a better job, move to a new state, or open a new business because we and our families simply cannot afford the risk? Our living costs are rising, and there is nothing left to catch us if we fall.<br> <br>We have spent too long trying to balance the entirety of our vibrant and complex society on top of a narrow and crumbling foundation. It is time for us to widen our frame of thinking and design a society built using a broader set of values that will be resilient to the growing tremors facing the world. <br> <br>We need values like the dignity of having one’s worth measured by one’s contribution to one’s community, and not one’s wage; like the security and stability that comes from knowing that, even if the worst were to happen — unemployment, sickness, injury, natural disaster, or even a pandemic — you would still be able to keep your family in your home, put food on the table, and receive needed care; like the justice of seeing past harm accounted for, and future harm averted; like the sustainability of a society that can prosper in perpetuity.</p><blockquote>Our definition of success must be more than just a subset of economic indicators. True success is achieved when our families are safe and healthy, when our communities are welcoming and full of opportunity, when our use of our planet’s resources are not unsustainably destructive…and, yes, when our businesses, small and large, can thrive and support our society’s wellbeing.</blockquote><p>Omidyar Network supports a number of organizations that are pushing to expand the range of values and ideas used to understand the economy. Our goal is not to advance any one solution, but rather to generate a multitude of proposals for moving us from a society that prioritizes only profits to a reimagined capitalism which prioritizes human flourishing in all its&nbsp;forms.</p><p>Our search for new ideas led us (unsurprisingly) to think tanks. This is why we are supporting a range of organizations that are elevating human centered perspectives on the social role of our economy and proposing innovative solutions to our collective challenges.<br> <br>The <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/">Roosevelt Institute</a>, for example, advocates for structural economic change through progressive policies. Their fellows are key voices in promoting the pursuit of economic security, more dignity, and, ultimately, more human thriving for more people. As its President and CEO Felicia Wong <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RI_EmergingWorldview_report-202001-1.pdf">notes</a>, “The move to values beyond ‘freedom to participate in a capital-focused marketplace’ is the central pillar of post-neoliberal thinking. If the new progressivism is to thrive, making plain the values inherent in our economic choices will be essential.” One of their recent reports, <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/new-rules-for-the-21st-century-corporate-power-public-power-future-american-economy/">New Rules for the 21st Century</a>, discusses the need to strengthen our democracy by thinking differently about the respective social roles of markets and government; last summer, they released a <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RI-TrueNewDealReport_202008.pdf">True New Deal</a> promoting essential reforms for the COVID-19 era. <br> <br>Meanwhile, <a href="https://americancompass.org/about/">American Compass </a>is working to create a coalition of thinkers drawing on conservative values for family, community, industry, and strong social and political institutions to advance economic ideas that ensure markets are serving people and their communities. Launched in May 2020, they have published and hosted discussions with thinkers from across the conservative and broader political spectrum. In September, they released a <a href="https://americancompass.org/essays/conservatives-should-ensure-workers-a-seat-at-the-table/">joint-statement calling for a renewed conservative labor movement</a> that elevates worker voices in economic and market discussions, which was signed by a number of prominent conservative figures, including Senator Marco Rubio and former attorney general Jeff Sessions.<br> <br>Our second focus is in strengthening the coalition of organizations working to disseminate these new economic ideas and incorporate them into strategic and policy discussions. <br> <br>Although the academic field of economics has developed <a href="http://www.oecd.org/governance/beyond-growth-33a25ba3-en.htm">an array of new branches of research</a> — from behavioral to ecological economics — that deepen our appreciation for the complexity of markets and their impact on society, this new thinking is not reflected in the ways that economics is taught in schools and universities, especially at the introductory level. We are therefore supporting the dissemination of <a href="https://www.core-econ.org/">CORE</a>, a new open-source economic curriculum developed with the collaboration of top economists, which incorporates recent advances in economic thinking. This curriculum is being adopted by schools and universities around the world.<br> <br>To help coordinate and align this growing global field of organizations that are developing and implementing new economic ideas, we are also supporting the <a href="https://www.econchange.org/">Economic Change Unit</a>, which both amplifies new ideas and works to strengthen the groups working around the world to transition us to a more equitable, sustainable, and democratic socio-economic paradigm.<br> <br>We have also turned to the media, given its power to shape how we all understand the economic forces impacting our lives, to help disseminate these ideas and reframe how we think about our economy. To that end, we have supported compelling reporting on the structural economic inequities that have been laid bare by the pandemic by journalists and photographers from new outlets such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/21362321/economy-american-policy-coronavirus-covid-recovery-fix-solutions-mobilization-great-rebuild">Vox</a>, and <a href="https://covid19-biggerpicture.trust.org/">Thomson Reuters</a>. <br> <br>Finally, we know that good ideas do not come from experts alone, and that real change is impossible without a broader cultural shift in how we, as a society, understand and discuss the economy.<br> <br>In addition to supporting a range of local and national organizations that are working to formulate and disseminate new ideas at the grassroots level, we are also working to cultivate the next generation of economic leaders and thinkers. Last year, we collaborated with The <a href="https://prospect.org/essaycontest">American Prospect </a>in a high school essay contest inviting students to read and reflect on one of four books highlighting the interlinking economic and racial justice challenges facing our country. We also partnered with <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/sponsored/story/tell-us-your-plan-to-reimagine-capitalism">Teen Vogue </a>to solicit ideas from young people about how they would redefine economic success in our society. Amongst hundreds of submissions, we heard ideas ranging from educating people to move money in support of racial justice to a worker-owned coffee shop on a mission to end wage theft and democratize the workplace.<br> <br>The ground below our feet is shifting, as it did all those decades ago. It is our mission to ensure that we have a solid foundation of values on which to build, and as many design ideas as possible at our disposal.

 Tell us what you do and what it is about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I have been managing the World Bank’s (WBG) Identification for Development Initiative (ID4D) for the last 5 years alongside a sister initiative – G2Px – which we launched end of 2019.&nbsp; Through ID4D, we are helping countries realize the transformational potential of digital identity in achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. G2Px focuses on supporting countries on digitizing payments from government to individuals, but in a more holistic way so that it can pave the way for broader outcomes of financial inclusion and women’s economic empowerment. It’s why we have the tagline of “payments that empower”.</p>
<p>These two WBG-wide initiatives are aimed squarely at helping governments and policy makers to reimagine and build the digital rails that underpin the way they transact with individuals. It also can transform the way people engage with their governments and with each other.&nbsp; A digital stack of ID, together with digital payments and trusted data exchange, has the ability to really empower individuals and change the way services are delivered – faster, more transparently and more conveniently.&nbsp; This past year, under the COVID pandemic, we have seen the need for all of this come to light with countries ramping up service delivery digitally, including social assistance to those most in need.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I joined the World Bank Group 20 years ago. &nbsp;I was passionate about international development and eager to contribute.&nbsp; The same passion sustains and energizes me to this day. When I joined, I didn’t imagine I would stay this long, but it’s hard to leave when the Bank provides the opportunity to work both in support of countries and on global public goods around on key development issues.</p>
<p>My earliest support system was generated at home. Growing up, my mother and father always encouraged my sisters and I and set the expectations to try our best and make a difference in any way we could.&nbsp;&nbsp; My parents came to the US in the mid ‘60s from Sri Lanka. At the time, it wasn’t always the norm for parents to push their daughters academically. &nbsp;But my parents certainly did (much to my annoyance at that same time) and that support helped me tremendously. And of course, now, that support system has expanded to include my husband who shares equally with the kids and at home.</p>
<p>The other thing that has helped me tremendously is my wonderful set of colleagues, team members and mentors – both within the Bank and in our wider group of external partners who have been with us since the beginning of these initiatives.&nbsp; We could not have achieved the multi-sector approach we have taken to digital public platforms without a really strong ecosystem of senior management support and hard-working teams who are passionate about this agenda across the Bank and externally.</p>
<blockquote>
 The COVID-19 crisis has shone a spotlight not just on ID, but Good ID, ID that is a gateway to inclusion and the development of digital societies. 
</blockquote>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>One of my favorite quotes is from anthropologist and women’s rights campaigner, Margaret Meade: “”Never doubt&nbsp;that a small group of thoughtful committed individuals can change the world. In fact, it’s the only thing that ever has.”</p>
<p>It’s been a guiding principle for me and I’ve adopted it in the advice I give to all our new team members. &nbsp;“Don’t wait until a system or an individual tells you to do something. Change comes from a group of individuals, not a “system”.</p>
<p>People often think reforms come from “policy” or “a system”. But what I have realized is that behind any policy or any system or organization are people – individuals and groups of human beings just like us!&nbsp;&nbsp; At work, we often will work with senior levels of governments and of course a high-level vision is key. But behind the vision you’ll always find a group of individuals who are shaping that vision and a group of individuals that need to work together to make the vision a reality.</p>
<p>So the advice I give to young professionals joining the Bank or newer team members is to know that you have the capability to be a shaper.&nbsp; An organization like the World Bank may appear to the outside as large and bureaucratic. But you can be quite entrepreneurial. You can shape the agenda – as long as you work hard to bring together different teams and different ideas as part of it. And don’t surprise anyone!</p>
<p>Collaboration is also part of what I do today. I know, for instance, that we couldn’t have agreed the updated Principles for Identification for Sustainable Development we have just published without a strong team of partners and collaborators working together on a shared vision.</p>
<p>It’s summed up in the words of an African proverb, printed on the walls of Gates Foundation HQ. “If you want to go fast, go alone.&nbsp; If you want to go far, go together.”</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>We have been working with governments to shift the identity agenda away from the way it has traditionally been viewed it.&nbsp; Identity is a core element for countries to transform service delivery to people, particularly in the digital age.&nbsp; The COVID-19 crisis has shone a spotlight not just on ID, but Good ID, ID that is a gateway to inclusion and the development of digital societies.</p>
<p>So, to CEOs I would say: “Build greater innovation on top of foundational ID systems, including new applications that will help people transact more seamlessly.&nbsp; There are increasingly ambitious countries all wanting to do digital ID the right way.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity is the combination of different ways of thinking, different cultures and ethnicities, gender that leads to whole being greater than the sum of the parts.</p>
<p>As a woman in identity, I am proud that about 80% of our team is female!&nbsp; Given the dearth of women in technology and identity space, I feel like we’re making a real contribution towards shaping the next generation of identity and digital development experts.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
Vyjayanti Desai
<p>Amanda Gorman’s poem at the inauguration of Joe Biden, “The Hill We Climb” Not only was it great to have a young woman captivate the entire world but it was hopeful and unifying, while also surfacing some of the very real issues that we face today.&nbsp; And her delivery of it was so inspiring.</p>
<p>I also have grown to really enjoy podcasts this past year. It was one of the things that kept me sane while taking my daily walks during the pandemic. Two podcasts: “It Was Said” and “Hope through History” by Jon Meacham are among my favorites.&nbsp; Each episode centers around a powerful, impactful public speech including Franklin D Roosevelt during the Great Depression, Hillary Clinton’s speech on ‘Women’s Rights are Human Rights’, Robert F Kennedy’s eulogy for Martin Luther King and Ronald Reagan’s farewell address.&nbsp; &nbsp;I’d love to see him expand this podcast and bring in speeches from across the globe.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>I have teenage twin boys, so I get plenty of practice giving unsolicited advice to teenagers!  But the advice I would give to the teenage me is: “Live in the moment; cherish everyone and everything around you because you never know when it may change.” My mother passed away from cancer when I was in high school and that definitely made me change my perspective. I try to ground myself by not worrying about the little things and try to live with a perspective of a glass half full.</p>
<p>And .. “be that change maker!”</p>

<p>Debates on whether or not E-ID Law is a good thing or a disappointment have been growing in intensity and have taken a decidedly political turn.<br>
Our Association is politically neutral and so we tried to stay away from these debates. We’ve been asked recently however about our opinion on the matter as independent experts that strive to bring and establish privacy friendly Self-Sovereign Identity technology to Swtizerland. We’ve decide not to pass that opportunity and shared our view points on the Law and DIDAS.</p>

 Indian Farmers’ Protest, Blocking Orders to Twitter, and the Fragile Balancing of Free Speech Amid Abysmal Regulation  Outlining limitations of blocking&nbsp;orders <p>February 2021 has borne witness to a standoff between Twitter India and the Modi Government. In the backdrop of a six-month-long <a href="mailto:https://www.bloombergquint.com/politics/indian-farmers-protest-in-delhi-determined-to-stop-modi-s-new-laws">farmers’ protest</a> which has garnered both national and international support, the Indian Government issued blocking orders for Twitter to <a href="mailto:https://thenewsmen.co.in/india/india-directs-twitter-to-block-1178-accounts-in-fresh-notice/33050">remove over 250 accounts</a> linked to the farmer’s protest that were considered a threat to public order. At first, Twitter complied with the order, but within a few hours unblocked the accounts. This led to the government issuing a non-compliance order to Twitter which threatened to impose fines and imprison Twitter executives for up to seven years. As a result, Twitter complied with the order and blocked a majority of the accounts. However, in a <a href="mailto:https://blog.twitter.com/en_in/topics/company/2020/twitters-response-indian-government.html">statement</a> that followed, they clarified that they would not take action on 250 of the accounts, those that belonged to media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians, since removing those would violate their owners’ right to freedom of speech. Further, they stated that they would continue to explore options under Indian law for the accounts that had been affected by the Government’s blocking&nbsp;order.</p><p>The resulting hornet’s nest stems from a combination of the Modi government’s strong-armed will to curb dissent and the inability of current Indian laws to provide a fair balance between restrictions on illegal speech and procedural safeguards to protect freedom of speech. This article will shed light on the flaws with the current procedure laid down for issuing blocking orders, which the Government frequently and arbitrarily uses to seek the removal of content that is entirely legal under Indian law but simply critical of government actions. Some examples of such behavior include the recent blocking of over <a href="mailto:https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/aliexpress-to-tiktok-to-pubg-mobile-full-list-of-all-chinese-apps-banned-in-india-so-far-7064134/">100 Chinese mobile applications</a> and discussing the <a href="mailto:https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/government-may-block-facebook-whatsapp-instagram-in-specific-situations/1271470/">possibilities of blocking Facebook, Whatsapp, and Instagram</a> citing reasons of public&nbsp;order.</p><p>Government blocking orders in India are primarily regulated by Section 69A of the <a href="mailto:https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/1999/3/A2000-21.pdf">Information Technology Act, 2020</a> (“IT Act”) and the procedure for blocking is laid out in the <a href="mailto:https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Information%20Technology%20%28%20Procedure%20and%20safeguards%20for%20blocking%20for%20access%20of%20information%20by%20public%29%20Rules,%202009.pdf">Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009</a> (“Blocking Rules”).</p><p>Section 69A of the IT Act provides that the Central Government may block public access of any online information if it is believed to be necessary in the interest of the state, public order, or for preventing incitement to commit a crime. Most of the controversial or speech-restrictive requests for removal are initiated by the Government under this section because of the opacity and flexibility of the accompanying Blocking Rules, which provide the procedure that must be followed for the issuance of such&nbsp;orders.</p><p>The Blocking Rules essentially set up an examining committee with a designated bureaucratic officer acting as its chairperson to consider the legality of blocking requests. There are three main shortcomings of the Blocking Rules, first lack of transparency, second, fundamentally inadequate provisions for allowing a response from recipients, and third, casting a wide net over what qualifies as an ‘emergency’ blocking&nbsp;order.</p><p>The first of these concerns the lack of transparency: the blocking rules mandate strict confidentiality of any requests made for removal of content and the subsequent action which is taken by the intermediary. This not only means that blocking orders are not subject to the public’s right to information but also creates a serious obstacle for an aggrieved party who would want to appeal the decision. Hence, mandating secrecy within the rules renders judicial redressal futile. For instance, Tanul Thakur, the creator of a satirical website, was <a href="mailto:https://www.theleaflet.in/content-takedown-and-users-rights/">not given access to the blocking request</a> even after publicly claiming ownership of the&nbsp;website.</p><p>Next, it is difficult or impossible to successfully challenge an order once issued. The Blocking Rules provide that once the examining committee receives a blocking request, an opportunity may be given to the intermediary or content creator to appear and submit their “reply and clarifications”. However, in reality, this right to reply is hardly ever exercised. No record can be found of this having happened in the past. This may be for two reasons: first, because the designated officer in most cases does not issue a notice seeking an appearance and reply from the relevant party in the first place, and second, because intermediaries cannot be expected to be in a position to defend each of the millions of takedown notices that they receive. Hence, in the off-chance that the examining committee seeks a response from the intermediary, asking intermediaries to appear in front of designated officers to justify the content uploaded by one of its millions of content creators remains a futile exercise. It is even more so if such response is sought from the content creator because they would not have access to the blocking request in the first place, due to mandated&nbsp;secrecy.</p><p>This general lack of awareness of a right to respond to order is evident in the present case of the tweets supporting the farmers’ protest, where the designated officer told Twitter that there existed “no statutory requirement to provide or demonstrate justifications to the intermediary while passing orders under Section 69A”. Further, he stated that it was “astonishing” for Twitter to be commenting on “significant issues of freedom of speech”. This evidences an obvious departure from the due process — a process which, if followed appropriately, could have potentially led to several pieces of important information remaining online.</p><p>Finally, the language in the Blocking Rules providing for the issuance of emergency blocking orders is extremely broad, and confers almost unlimited discretion to the issuer, defining emergency orders only as an order that can be passed when “no delay is acceptable”. By contrast for regular blocking orders, it is required that the examining committee issue directions as a unit and then have the direction approved by the Secretary of the Government’s Department of Information Technology before notifying the intermediary. However, in cases of emergency blocking orders, the Department Secretary can decide on her own accord and retrospectively bring the request to the examining committee. The two disconcerting aspects here are first, lack of any clear definition of what comprises an emergency, and second, the liberty of the government to act as a check on itself without balancing this with sufficient transparency for an aggrieved person to seek judicial&nbsp;relief.</p><p>These shortcomings may very well be the reason that <a href="mailto:https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/ttr-17.html">India ranks in the top five countries</a> that made the most removal requests to Twitter in the first half of 2020. The Blocking Rules’ lack of procedural safeguards protecting freedom of speech makes it extremely easy for the Government to issue take-down orders, and very difficult to challenge those&nbsp;orders.</p><p>The constitutionality of Section 69A and the corresponding Blocking Rules was challenged in the Supreme Court of India in the landmark <a href="mailto:https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/shreya-singhal-v-union-of-india/">Shreya Singhal ruling</a> of 2015. This ruling is famous for invalidating Section 66A of the IT Act which prohibited the dissemination of information causing ‘annoyance’, ‘inconvenience’, or ‘insult’. However, the same ruling reaffirmed the constitutionality of Section 69A and the Blocking Rules on grounds that any violations could be reversed once individuals moved to Court. It seems clear it is time for this position to be reassessed, given the impossibility of judicial review due to the confidentiality provision.</p><p>Withholding information from the public, not providing sufficient opportunity for the aggrieved party to respond, and creating a vaguely defined situation of what comprises an emergency has allowed for a wide net to be cast for the situations in which such orders can be issued. This fear of over-regulation has exacerbated over the past few years and is evident in the severe crackdown on free speech by the Indian Government. For instance, over the past years, the Indian Government has issued several blocking orders for Twitter to remove legitimate content highlighting the <a href="mailto:https://thelogicalindian.com/news/twitter-blocked-kashmir/">human rights violations in Kashmir</a> and the <a href="mailto:https://lumendatabase.org/notices/22220327">Khalistani movement in north-west India</a>.</p><p>There is an urgent need to reform the Blocking Rules and place adequate procedural safeguards within the mechanism of issuing blocking orders. <a href="mailto:https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">Article 19 of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights</a>, an international human rights instrument to which India has ratified, lays down a three-part test of legality, legitimacy, and necessity that a law restricting freedom of speech has to be in line with. This test has been applied on several occasions by the Supreme Court of India, including in the Shreya Singhal ruling discussed above. The constructive way forward is through dialogue between lawmakers and civil society to ensure that the Blocking Rules are revised to comply with these tests and to ensure that the legal mechanism for the Government issuing blocking orders is transparent, contains adequate procedural safeguards, and provides for effective judicial oversight through transparency.</p><p>Finally, until these loopholes in the existing laws are fixed and adequate judicial and procedural safeguards are put in place, it is incumbent upon the Indian Government to ensure that such laws are used sparingly and not merely as armor to regulate content that is critical of its practices.</p><p>— About the author: <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/shreya-tewari">Shreya</a> is an Employee Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center, where she works on the Lumen Project.

 How the EWT Escrow Model Unlocks the Full Potential of the Energy Web Tech&nbsp;Stack <p>As our <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/its-coming-quality-of-service-guarantees-for-decentralized-technologies-c0e133ebe644">CEO Walter recently explained</a>, service-level agreements (SLAs) are important tools when it comes to widespread commercial adoption of new technologies, especially digital technologies like software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud computing. They give enterprise customers confidence by providing guaranteed performance and availability of service at a fixed cost, and they give vendors clear delivery requirements and stable&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>We intend for <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/ew-dos/">EW-DOS</a> to become a de facto standard for digital identity and infrastructure in the energy sector. For this vision to become reality, we need to figure out how to deliver the guarantees of traditional SLAs and the convenience of “-as-a-service” subscriptions—in the context of a public network operated by many different organizations from around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Over the past year we’ve spent hundreds of hours researching technologies, brainstorming commercial and operational models, and speaking with members of our community to identify a solution. The result is an EWT escrow and subscription model for services in the Utility Layer of the EW-DOS stack that combines well-established elements from financial markets and enterprise IT procurement practices with features common in emerging decentralized finance and escrow applications.</p><p>In addition to promoting the physical, commercial, and political decentralization of EW-DOS, this model will catalyze the transition from pilots and proof-of-concept applications to mainstream adoption and commercial implementations. It’s also a triple-win scenario for the three primary stakeholders in the Energy Web community:</p>  Users of EW-DOS—especially enterprise customers like grid operators, OEMs, and energy companies—will gain easy access to performant, reliable services that help them realize the benefits of running applications on&nbsp;EW-DOS.  Operators of EW-DOS, including EWC validators and technology vendors, can build stable, profitable business models around hosting infrastructure nodes in a public&nbsp;network.  The EWT community gains a new way to use their EWT to contribute in the development and operation of EW-DOS infrastructure, which ultimately will accelerate digital transformation across the global energy sector and help to decarbonize the grid&nbsp;faster.  <p>This article describes the key roles, processes, and value propositions of the escrow model at a high level. While the main components are already being developed into a working prototype, some of the fine details have yet to be finalized. Our intent with this article is to elicit feedback and questions from the community, so don’t hesitate to respond in the comments&nbsp;below.</p>How it&nbsp;startedHow it’s&nbsp;going How EWT Escrow&nbsp;Works <p>Just like in proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus models (and in traditional escrow models in financial and energy markets), the purpose of EWT escrow is to incentivize/reward honest behavior and discourage/penalize bad actors. However, instead of being used to achieve consensus in a blockchain, EWT escrow is used to achieve performance guarantees for digital services like key management, data storage, and high-volume messaging in the Utility Layer of the EW-DOS stack. These services are necessary to support all types of applications running on EW-DOS, from <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/catalonian-grid-operator-electra-caldense-energy-web-and-bamboo-energy-announce-grid-flexibility-51c75e5bcc25">distributed flexibility markets</a>, to <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/dena-selects-energy-web-to-build-prototype-identity-registry-for-germanys-energy-market-2580f53b2d20">identity registries for energy assets</a>, to <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/r3-joins-energy-web-to-provide-enterprise-grade-settlement-services-for-the-energy-sector-d4a6a834da44">enterprise-grade settlement</a>, and even <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/xrp-ledger-foundation-ripple-and-energy-web-announce-worlds-first-decarbonized-blockchain-5c3cecbff31a">decarbonizing blockchains themselves</a>.</p><p>The EWT escrow model has two primary roles, which anyone in the global community can&nbsp;become:</p>  Service Providers (“Providers”) are organizations that operate Utility Layer service nodes. In order to become a qualified Provider, an organization must pass a basic KYC check and deposit a minimum balance of EWT into an escrow smart contract for a multi-year period. Once qualified, Providers can launch service nodes by depositing an incremental amount of EWT in escrow and passing a performance test for each node. To meet the minimum escrow balance requirement, providers can either acquire the necessary EWT themselves or accept EWT from external Patrons in the wider community. As long as Providers deliver services in accordance with the prescribed rules, they will earn a stable income on their deposited EWT.  Patrons are individuals or organizations that deposit EWT in escrow on behalf of Providers (similar to the relationship between <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-validator">validators</a> and <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-nominator">nominators</a> in Polkadot). Unlike Providers, there are no minimum balance thresholds or lockup periods for Patrons; anyone who holds any amount of EWT can participate. Patrons have the flexibility to withdraw or transfer their EWT from the escrow account(s) of Providers at any time, creating competition among Providers to deliver the most-reliable services (and thus earn the highest and most-stable income) and to offer the most competitive revenue-sharing models (to attract the most Patrons).  <p>There is no limit to the number of Service Providers. In fact, to meet the enterprise performance requirements for applications running on EW-DOS, we anticipate the need for hundreds of Providers operating thousands of nodes globally to ensure sufficient geographic coverage and network reliability for millions of applications and end-users.</p><p>At this time, the expected minimum escrow threshold for becoming a qualified Provider will be in the range of 10,000–100,000 EWT with an additional 1,000–10,000 EWT per service node. The incremental escrow requirement for individual nodes means each node will be judged (in terms of payments and penalties) on its own performance, and it also helps prevent monopolization. The final decision on the threshold requirements will be made based on feedback from the EW-DOS community, and must balance the need to ensure reliability and guarantee trust for enterprise users without creating insurmountable barriers to entry for potential Providers.</p><p>In addition to incentivizing good performance, Provider escrow accounts are used to make the Utility Layer carbon neutral from day one. Each month, the escrow accounts will be drawn down to purchase renewables via <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web&nbsp;Zero</a>.</p><p>Providers will be required to commit to delivering services for ~two or more years from the time of their initial enrollment (two years is a standard contract length for most enterprise IT services). During this period, deposited EWT will remain locked and if the Provider fully ceases delivering services they will forfeit their escrow balance. Providers who commit to a longer service delivery period will earn more each year than those who commit to the minimum duration. This multi-year commitment ensures that Providers are fully dedicated to delivering reliable services, and gives enterprise customers assurances about service availability and quality over a longer time horizon. After the initial commitment period, Providers may exit the Utility Layer service pool and withdraw their EWT from escrow by providing six months advance notice (which allows other Providers to backfill capacity as&nbsp;needed).</p><p>As long as Providers operate reliable service nodes that meet the performance standards (e.g., uptime, throughput capacity, latency) for each Utility Layer service, they will earn stable income through a combination of subscription payments and rewards from the Community Fund. Annual income for a Provider will be in the range of 10–20% of their EWT escrow account&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Initially, Providers’ income will be subsidized by the Community Fund&nbsp;, but over time as adoption (and subscription volume) increases, this subsidy will diminish. We expect that within 3–5 years, the Utility Layer will be driven by a sustainable commercial model where the vast majority of Provider earnings will be derived from subscription payments.</p><p>Patrons should expect to earn similar, if not identical, income as Providers (i.e., at least 10–20% of deposited EWT annually), though exact revenue-sharing arrangements will be determined by each Provider individually. To reiterate, there are no minimum escrow thresholds or commitment periods for Patrons. It is up to each Provider to define their own terms for Patrons, and natural competition encourages Providers to invest in appropriate infrastructure to ensure high-quality services, and to offer favorable terms to attract Patrons and maximize their own earning potential. When evaluating Providers, Patrons should consider not just revenue-sharing terms, but also reputation (e.g., overall historical performance) and individual node&nbsp;metrics.</p><p>In the event that a node fails to deliver services in accordance with the performance standards, the offending node and its Provider each lose a portion of their EWT deposit (similar to slashing in other crypto staking models). Accordingly, Providers are strongly incentivized to invest in appropriate resources and backup systems to ensure that nodes do not experience unplanned outages (especially if they have accepted EWT from external Patrons). If they fall below the minimum threshold, they must replenish their balance to remain eligible to host their node(s). Importantly, Utility Layer services are designed so that the failure of any given node does not materially impact the overall service. Much like electric grids, the Utility Layer is built to withstand the unexpected loss of individual components.</p> What to expect moving&nbsp;forward <p>Our goal is to launch the first Utility Layer services, complete with escrow and subscriptions, in production by Q3&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Here’s what to expect between now and&nbsp;then:</p>  In the next two weeks, we will publish more information outlining the service subscription model and explaining how EW Switchboard is used to manage both escrow and subscriptions.  In April 2021, we will release a series of video demonstrations, technical documentation, and a clickable prototype for the escrow and subscription models.  In May 2021, we will conduct an alpha release of escrow and subscription tools on our testnet&nbsp;Volta.  In June 2021, we will conduct a beta release of escrow and service components on the Energy Web Chain (EWC), with an initial cohort of Service Providers from the EWC validator community.  Throughout the remainder of the year, we will focus on scaling the Utility Layer service network, onboarding additional Providers and Patrons from the wider Energy Web community, adding new Utility Layer services, and integrating the escrow and subscription models with exchanges and other external systems to make it even easier to participate.  <p>We’ll also be publishing a steady stream of articles, tutorials, and demos in the coming months to further explain the operational and commercial details of the escrow model.

 Thriving or Surviving? A Conversation on the Black Informal Economy with Equity and Transformation <p>By Nicole Allred, Strategic Communications, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>Richard Wallace- Founder and Director of Equity and Transformation<p>For years, politicians have talked about the need to create economic opportunities that support and expand the middle class in America. On one extreme, the political dynamics and systems of power place the greatest attention on the well-heeled and the well off. However, at the other extreme are those everyday people struggling simply to survive day-to-day within the same system. In this economic system, individuals and families are either thriving or just surviving.</p><p>Richard Wallace, founder of Equity and Transformation [EAT] in Chicago, is an advocate for those working in the Black informal economy — people who are excluded from mainstream sanctioned opportunities to earn a livable wage, and instead, use creativity and community networks to make enough money to piece together a&nbsp;living.</p><p>As we continue our <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/dream-we-did-act-we-must-a-commitment-to-action-c06781f244da">blog series focused on racial justice</a>, we’re speaking with leaders in the field to highlight their perspectives and life journeys that led to their work. EAT [an Omidyar Network grantee] calls out the hypocrisy of our economic system by asking some direct questions: Who has economic privilege in our society, even at more disadvantaged levels, and why? How and why does the state determine which forms of work are sanctioned while others are illegal? In January, EAT issued the <a href="https://www.survivaleconomies.report/">Survival Economies Report</a> which examines each of these dynamics and more as part of the organization’s mission to support those in the informal&nbsp;economy.</p><p><a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-team/nicole-allred/">Nicole Allred</a> conducted this interview with Richard Wallace. A transcript of our conversation is below, edited for length and&nbsp;clarity.</p> Nicole Allred: Richard I want to go back to the beginning to hear about your childhood, your mother’s transition into the ministry, and how that shaped your worldview from the&nbsp;start. <p>Richard Wallace: It was an interesting journey. I grew up in a single-parent household raised by my mother, who often worked two jobs most of her life. I remember when she came home one day and said she was quitting her job for the ministry. We were already poor, but in my mind, it was about to get worse! So, she left her job and began her work in the ministry starting in the church. She wanted to preach, but the male dominated system wouldn’t allow her, so she found solace preaching where no one else was, and that was behind prison walls. This is really where I get introduced to the practice of being accountable to the people you want to help and, in the inverse, who are helping you, and this is how I approach the work&nbsp;today.</p> NA: And you were about six or seven when your mom started the ministry, right? <p>RW: Yeah, she would take me behind the prison walls without a pause. I would go through the searches and be back there with most of the folks we consider “heavies.” They would tell me stories about what they would do in the ’90s in Chicago if they were&nbsp;free.</p><blockquote>“These were genuinely great humans behind bars, and I knew that when I left, they couldn’t&nbsp;leave.”</blockquote> NA: So, what happened next, and talk a bit about your own experience with the system and incarceration. <p>RW: My mom and my family planted seeds, but no matter how deep the seeds are planted, there are still things you have to go through and experience as a young&nbsp;person.</p><blockquote>“My mom moved us into a townhouse in the suburbs, and I was like an ink drop in a glass of&nbsp;milk.”</blockquote><p>I was the only Black person on my block. It was exciting to have a townhouse, but we were poor. Middle class integration has always been the goal for Black families, but the truth is there was a contradiction that exists there. Things that other kids did in our community I would get arrested for. So, what was really a maladjusted reaction to that lifestyle turned into a two and a half year bid at the [Illinois Youth Center] state&nbsp;prison.</p><p>So, I was going to visit these places when I was six and seven years old, and now I’m in this place in my teens. It was a rude awakening for me. It became one of the core experiences that transformed my life. My service to the people began there. Incarceration was horrible, but the lived experience after incarceration was much&nbsp;worse.</p> NA: How was your current work with Equity and Transformation and its mission born out of your experience being incarcerated? <p>RW: There are thousands of collateral consequences to being incarcerated when you come home. Your citizenship has thousands of doors that are no longer open to you. You don’t have access to employment nor college because of your background. What that meant for me is that I had to hustle to&nbsp;survive.</p><blockquote>“Unemployed people are barred from the system on which they depend for subsistence. If you don’t stay in the system, then they dare you to find a means of subsistence for yourself.”</blockquote><p>In my work organizing the temp labor sector around issues of discrimination and exploitation, many of the immigrant workers faced higher rates of exploitation because of their undocumented status. Employers were able to extract higher value labor out of immigrant workers than Black workers. Meanwhile, Black workers would sit for hours before being chosen to go to the jobsite because the immigrant workers were always chosen first. So, there was a lot of tension between Black and Latino workers because of this notion of “privilege.” That said, immigrant exploitive wages of $4-$5 per hour would never have been accepted by Black workers, and that is why these groups need to be in solidarity.</p><blockquote>“Our folks are literally out here working and dying to survive.“</blockquote><p>They are standing in a temp line and often being passed over. Ironically, I can work for a Fortune 500 company in prison making 89 cents a day, but I come home, and I can’t work for that same Fortune 500 company. It’s the same in the temp labor sector. I can’t work for this institution for full pay and a union, but they can garnish my wages and charge me for transportation to and from&nbsp;work.</p> NA: EAT is the only organization working to support the Black informal economy and recently published the <a href="https://www.survivaleconomies.report/">Survival Economies Report</a>. You reveal that policymakers are light years behind in the development of alternatives to formal employment. What do you mean by that? What are people doing to&nbsp;survive? <p>RW: When we started EAT, I definitely thought there was a range of things we could do including building informal workers associations built out by trade. The reality is our people are doing a multitude of activities. They’re hair braiding, scrap metal trade people, and street vending, which is a wide range of activities from selling DVDs to clothes. They’re ride sharing. There’s just a host of activities our people are engaged&nbsp;in.</p><blockquote>“One of the patterns we discovered is that occupations that exist in the informal sector aren’t fixed. They don’t stay there for perpetuity. They migrate from informal to formal, and in that process of migration there is a lack of retention of Black&nbsp;bodies.”</blockquote><p>Let me break that down. Bootlegging alcohol had a high rate of Black activity. People could enter it and leave it at their leisure. Then it is legalized, and it becomes hard to find a Black alcohol manufacturer. People point to celebrities like 50 Cent and P-Diddy, but they own the label. They put the label on the bottle. We’re talking about manufacturing the actual&nbsp;product.</p><p>When you think about ride sharing, you get Uber, but you don’t think about the people who are already doing ride sharing in our communities. It supported people who didn’t have the money to take a cab or to own their own care. So, it was really about shared resources. Then it becomes formalized and makes billions for the owner but very little for the drivers using their own cars. Once again, the pioneers are left out of ownership.</p><p>So, I believe there are innovations galore. This is a pattern when I say our folks are innovative.</p><blockquote>“When you really begin to see informality, you get some of the strongest expressions of Black culture.”</blockquote> NA: There is also a certain level of organization, planning, hustle, and work that goes into these informal activities. The report reveals what goes into someone selling loose cigarettes, for example. You have to be at a certain place at a certain time or you’re going to miss your main morning rush. Come rain or shine you still need to be there. Even buying those cigarettes at the cost that you need so that you can then sell them at the right markup. There is so much that the report broke down that I hadn’t even considered. We then start thinking about COVID and how these activities require people to be close by. How have these activities been impacted by&nbsp;COVID? <p>RW: In mid-March it dawned on us that COVID was here to stay. We immediately took a look at the CARES Act, and there are two provisions that boxed out informal workers from receiving any aid — the child support clause and paying taxes. If they hadn’t paid taxes in the past five years, they were ineligible, and if they owed child support, they were ineligible. So, nine out of 10 Black folks who were informal workers were ineligible when in fact these were the people who needed the resources the&nbsp;most.</p><blockquote>“There is a consistent bifurcation of resources so that these people are said to be deserving and other people are not. What does it mean to self-quarantine when you are homeless? What does it mean to tell someone to self-quarantine in a home that may be more violent than the streets&nbsp;are?”</blockquote><p>We developed COVID 19 life kits to educate people about COVID because we were battling the ghost of Tuskegee and also the digital divide. A lot of our folks don’t have IDs nor smart phones. So, while the average person is watching the news, where are homeless people getting the information that is alarming the rest of the world? So, we developed the kit to myth bust and also provide mutual&nbsp;aid.</p> NA: Thinking about philanthropy and systems of power, what role do you think philanthropy should&nbsp;play? <p>RW: We need philanthropy to get behind us and invest in our experimentations of alternatives. It’s one thing to dismantle the system but invest in us to rebuild. Rebuilding requires experimentation. It requires us sitting in a room with the community, freedom dreaming and then coming out and testing&nbsp;it.</p><p>My experience has evolved from direct action to electoral politics to policy to research and has come full circle. So, the investment around alternatives needs to be deepened. We don’t want to just dismantle. We also want to rebuild, and the resources need to be there so we can do&nbsp;so.</p><p>Learn more about Equity and Transformation via their <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/survival-economy-report">latest report</a>, <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/">website</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ChicagoEat">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/thriving-or-surviving-a-conversation-on-the-black-informal-economy-with-equity-and-transformation-f4225e52651b">Thriving or Surviving?

<p>The OpenID Foundation is a non-profit international standardization organization of individuals and companies committed to enabling, promoting, and protecting OpenID technologies. Formed in June 2007, the Foundation serves as a public trust organization representing the open community of developers, vendors, and users. The Foundation assists the community by providing needed infrastructure and help in promoting and supporting expanded adoption of OpenID.</p>
<p>The strength and viability of the OpenID Foundation is predicated on its ability to earn the active support of both individual members and innovative global organizations. Every member in the Foundation is valued for what they contribute to the larger whole and this is why it is so important that the Foundation strives to maintain long time members while attracting new membership.</p>
<p>As the Foundation continues to grow globally, it requires an increasing investment to support the day-to-day operations while enabling the expansion of the Foundation to include the certification program, driving new outreach opportunities – such as Open Banking initiatives worldwide, and supporting new working groups. The OpenID Foundation has not increased membership dues in over 10 years; the board of directors recently revisited the topic of membership dues and unanimously approved increases to membership fees effective July 1, 2021:</p>



Individual Level
$50


Non-Profit Organization Level
$250


Organization with 1-25 Employees Level
$1,000


Organization with 26-100 Employees Level
$5,000


Organization with More than 100 Employees Level
$20,000


Sustaining Organization Level
$50,000



<p>The Foundation recognizes that individuals and organizations have to make difficult decisions when it comes to both financial and time commitments to organizations like the OpenID Foundation. The Foundation cannot exist without the ongoing support of both long-standing and new members alike so the board of directors would like to thank all members and those considering membership for their support of the increases in membership dues.</p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/04/openid-foundation-announces-increases-to-membership-dues-in-2021/">OpenID Foundation Announces Increases to Membership Dues in 2021</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a>.

 Energy Web and Volkswagen Jointly Investigate the Potential of Blockchains for Energy Market Integration <p>Zug, Switzerland and Wolfsburg, Germany — 4 March 2021 — Today, Energy Web and <a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/group/group-innovation.html">Volkswagen Group Innovation</a>, the research department of one of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers, Volkswagen Group, announced a partnership to investigate digitalization and integration of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure in support of advanced electric vehicle charging programs and markets globally. Under the partnership, Volkswagen Group Innovation and Energy Web will jointly develop and test open-source software to enable seamless end-to-end electricity market participation for electric vehicles. The test will pair Energy Web’s open-source tech stack with existing EV charging standards, including the ISO 15118 Plug &amp; Charge standard in combination with the PKI of <a href="https://www.electrifyamerica.com/">Electrify America</a>, one of the world’s largest EV charging networks.</p><p>EVs are known for their powertrain efficiency, lack of tailpipe emissions, and ability to run on carbon-free renewable energy, making them a crucial component for decarbonizing the transportation sector. But they can also add tremendous value to low-carbon energy systems. With digital infrastructure in place, grid operators can use EVs to avoid electricity network congestion, absorb greater amounts of renewable energy, and increase the resilience of electricity networks. The market for electric vehicles to provide such services is slowly maturing, with <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/ferc-orders-grid-operators-to-open-wholesale-markets-to-distributed-energy-resources">regulators increasingly requiring</a> customer-owned resources be allowed to compete in electricity markets on equal footing with traditional centrally managed and controlled thermal power&nbsp;plants.</p><p>“With this partnership, we want to accelerate electric mobility and deliver even more value to EV customers,” explained Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer of Energy Web. “One way is to make it easy for EVs to seamlessly participate in energy markets. If we’re successful, the moment an EV rolls off the lot of a dealership that car will be fully integrated into the energy system in the area. Customers can then be paid for their EVs to help balance the grid in near real-time.”</p><p>Volkswagen is a global driver of e-mobility. The newly developed, all-electric ID.3 was launched in 2020, leaping straight to the pole position on the sales chart in many countries in Europe. The ID.4 SUV will follow soon, hitting the market in Europe, China, and the United States. Overall, the Group will be investing about €35 billion in e-mobility in the next five years and launch about 70 all-electric models by&nbsp;2030.</p><p><a href="https://about.bnef.com/electric-vehicle-outlook/">Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) forecasts</a> that annual global EV sales will rise from 1.7 million in 2020 to 54 million by 2040, accounting for nearly 60% of new vehicle sales. As power grids around the world accommodate more and more EVs, dynamic “managed charging” represents today’s state of the art for EV grid integration (such as modulating the timing of EV charging to avoid large spikes in peak energy demand if too many EVs begin charging at the same&nbsp;time).</p><p>“We are keen to explore the possibilities that blockchain technology can have for smart charging applications and how this can have a positive effect on the ecological footprint and thus an increase in value for our customers,” said Marvin Schroeder, the project leader at Volkswagen Group Innovation. “At this early stage of the EV industry we have a great opportunity to shape and improve standards on how EVs like ours integrate into markets around the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>Energy Web has been working with grid operators globally and <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/austrian-power-grid-and-energy-web-foundation-launch-proof-of-concept-to-use-distributed-energy-d9a378f5f5ee">announced a proof of concep</a>t with Austrian Power Grid to use distributed energy resources — especially batteries — for frequency regulation. The same architecture is now being developed by Energy Web to enable any EV to participate in any combination of energy&nbsp;markets.</p><p>For the pilot, a Volkswagen EV and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) will be integrated with the open-source Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) tech stack. The Volkswagen / Energy Web partnership is expected to provide a proof point that EVs and EVSE can be digitized and integrated cost efficiently, securely, and compliant with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to electricity markets and grid operator operational systems.</p><p>About Volkswagen Group<br>The Volkswagen Group, with its headquarters in Wolfsburg, is one of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers and the largest carmaker in Europe. The Group comprises twelve brands from seven European countries, including Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, SEAT, ŠKODA, and Porsche.

<p>Working Group approved status</p>
 
 Sidetree is a protocol for creating scalable decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) networks that can run on top of any existing decentralized anchoring system (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, HL Fabric, QLDB) and be as open, public, and permissionless as the underlying anchoring systems they utilize. The protocol allows users to create globally unique, user-controlled identifiers and manage their associated metadata, all without the need for centralized authorities or trusted third parties.

<p>DCMS Trust Framework - UK Govt.<br>
The UK government has published its draft rules of the road for governing the future use of digital identities.  The new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework">trust framework</a> lays out the draft rules of the road organisations should follow. It includes the principles, policies, procedures and standards governing the use of digital identity to allow for the sharing of information to check people’s identities or personal details, such as a user’s address or age, in a trusted and consistent way. This will enable interoperability and increase public confidence.  The framework, once finalised, is expected to be brought into law.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport">DCMS</a> are seeking feedback on the trust framework until 11 March, through a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework">survey</a> that is available on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>More than 1,000 banks in the <a href="https://yes.com/">yes®</a> scheme enable online banking customers to prove their identity to 3rd parties with existing bank-managed KYC data. This data can also be used to seamlessly create qualified electronic signatures conforming to the EU’s eIDAS directive.</p>
<p>The banks recently finished the migration of all Identity Providers (IdPs) in the yes® scheme towards OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance (<a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">eKYC &amp; IDA</a>). From a technical perspective, this means over 1,000 different bank IdPs participating in the yes scheme were adapted to support requests for verified claims and are able to assert verified claims in ID Tokens, UserInfo, and Token Introspection responses.</p>
<p>yes partners undertook this major investment because OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance provides all the necessary bits and pieces to support strong identification, including regulated use cases, such as eIDAS or eKYC, while being simple to use, versatile, and privacy preserving.</p>
<p>yes firmly believes that open international standards benefit every industry and they are especially crucial for the fragmented banking market to compete with new entrants.</p>
<p>Since yes operates an ecosystem with multiple implementations of OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance, it’s aware of the importance of interoperability and the key role conformance tests play to achieve it. yes therefore decided to provide <a href="https://openid.net/oidf-directed-funding-faq/">directed funding</a> to the OpenID Foundation to develop conformance tests for OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance as part of the <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID Foundation Certification Program</a>. yes will also contribute its existing test implementation to the Foundation as part of its contributions.</p>
<p>yes hopes to facilitate the further evolution of OpenID Connect for Identity assurance and its broad adoption in the market. Furthermore, yes is hopeful that other Foundation members that have a vested interest in the success of OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance will follow with additional directed funding and contributions to support the development of conformance tests and the expansion of the OpenID Foundation Certification Program.</p>

<p>The community effort to bridge DID methods with a new data model</p> <p>The world of digital identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) is evolving quickly, giving much cause for optimism. Standards are starting to connect and move towards functional interoperability, regulated by testable protocols. Most of this work is happening on the level of VCs. However, DIDs and their infrastructure are also starting to converge and mature as an extensible-yet-interoperable technology.</p><p>Adoption by markets, standards bodies and regulators is largely contingent upon provable security and provable interoperability, so these promising developments cannot come soon enough.</p><p>The Digital Identity Foundation (DIF) is very proud to be hosting one particular research and development project that could prove pivotal in this process. It is currently a work item of DIF’s <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>. However, a charter for an autonomous working group will be available for review at <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">#IIW31</a> this week (20–22 October 2020) to facilitate broader participation. The project is called KERI and it is a project that could only be developed in the open, for the public good and for the widest, quickest adoption.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pucelano">Fernando Santander</a> But first, what is&nbsp;KERI? <p>KERI stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. A “key event” is a discrete event in time that involves public/private keypairs, often called blockchain identities or cryptographic identities. These events can be generalized as inceptions (creations), rotations, and signing events: the three kinds of events for which KERI generates and handles receipts. In other words, key events are cryptographic events in the history of an identifier.</p><p>Importantly, everything else a decentralized identifier says, does, or refers to is not a key event. As KERI is deliberately laser-focused on key events only, we can call these other events non-KERI events. The real world consequences of a signature or rotation are out of scope and method-specific to boot. KERI is only interested in the most universal aspect of interactions between keys and cryptographic systems, i.e. the cryptography that allows drastically different DID systems to trust each other’s security guarantees.</p><blockquote>“DID Methods exist to solve a trust issue. This does it in a different way.”<br>Charles Cunningham (Jolocom GmbH, Rust development lead for KERI)</blockquote><p>Each key event produces a receipt containing only checkable signatures of key event information. Nothing more. Receipts are threaded into logs tracking the history of each identifier, which is similar to a traceable audit trail of hashes — useful for confirming but not for deducing the underlying key material. These threads are compiled into logs that are shared and replicated according to a consensus algorithm and a logic of trust thresholds that creates a fabric of shared history between nodes.</p> Is KERI a blockchain or a DLT? No. Does it replace blockchains? Also&nbsp;no. <p>The trust fabric created when KERI nodes share and propagate key material records might</p><p>sound redundant to the blockchains where all of today’s DID methods store their key material chronologically. To a degree, this is true: each log containing the history of one key is a “microledger,” like a blockchain with only one participant. Inception and rotation events in all of today’s DID methods are stored in a chronological distributed ledger which can be crawled to create a log of these key events by DID. So, why the redundancy? Why replicate a subset of the blockchain’s capabilities and features in a distinct blockchain-like infrastructure just for key material?</p><p>The answer is simple and manifold: blockchains enable many features outside the scope of KERI. These features bring with them complexity, diversity, scale costs, and trust issues. Within KERI’s scope, however, only some of a blockchain or distributed ledger technology’s (DLT’s) features are necessary. Total ordering and double-spend protection, for instance, are hallmarks of distributed ledgers, but hardly justify the added complexity here.</p>Subset of blockchain/DLT capabilities required by KERI (<a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/KERI2_Overview.web.pdf">Dr Sam Smith</a>, 2019)<p>Working backwards from a short list of security features, KERI infrastructure can be a much more performant, minimalist distributed ledger system. It is still in the family tree of blockchain, DLTs and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), but it is closer to a sidechain or a trans-blockchain interoperability mechanism. In use cases where all that is needed is a self-certifying, widely-portable identifier, KERI can stand alone as a lightweight DID method. In combination with a traditional DID Method, KERI can increase key management options and strengthen security guarantees by raising a red flag at the first discrepancy between the two parallel and redundant systems.</p><p>As a scaling mechanism, KERI can also take away some of the traffic and complexity from the underlying blockchain. In implementations where key management and state maintenance (record keeping about keys that rotate over time) are entrusted directly to the KERI mechanism, these functions can be operated much closer to the edge and replicate after a slight delay. This might be a totally acceptable trade-off of efficiency for latency in many use cases. For example, a roundtrip write-and-wait-for-finality transaction on a global blockchain makes no sense in a low-connectivity Internet of things (IoT) use case, where double-spend is a non-issue.</p> KERI is both an interoperability mechanism and a standardization incentive <p>More importantly for the DIF, however, is another major feature of KERI: it could become the foundation of massive interoperability and portability at the infrastructure layer. What’s more, if adopted by enough major players, it could even speed up the standardization process of DIDs themselves. By offering a minimum level of security guarantees shared across all participating methods, it would simplify the security review process for both individual DID methods and for interoperable DIDs as a whole.</p><p>By abstracting out the universal, minimal set of key functions, a KERI log that spans multiple ledgers or methods is just as verifiable as one that does not. This means that anywhere</p><p>self-certifying KERI identifiers are accepted, an identifier’s history can stretch back further than the existence of KERI. Plus, that history can include so-called “portability events”, where an identifier is deactivated on one ledger and re-activated on another. Method-specific features or records might still need to be exported and imported. The core proof of control function of a DID, however, would be universalized in a way that enabled massive portability.</p><p>This same universalizing effect of sharing a security vocabulary across all participating DID methods has the added benefit of being able to guarantee certain security features in any KERI-compliant system. Since KERI also lends itself to simple compliance tests, and since KERI logs give a benchmark against which to test method-specific and blockchain-specific security, this is a small leap for each DID method and a giant leap for standardization and security engineering.</p> KERI’s history: from whitepaper to community incubation <p>So far we have been highly technical in our explanation of the project. A careful reader, however, may already have caught the community commitment implicit in phrases such as “KERI-compliant” and “participating DID methods.” KERI is only useful if the major DID methods incorporate it, or if the set of participating DID methods becomes congruous over time with the set of major DID methods.</p><p>It is, in a nutshell, a community project of alignment as much as a technological innovation: an agreement on the security model for the common core functionality shared across all DID methods, allowing much variety and extensibility to be preserved by the participating DID methods. Decentralized identifiers have been very decentralized in their design and governance from the beginning, with a high degree of extensibility and flexibility within the fiefdom of each DID method and its governance. KERI has been gathering steam for over a year as a countervailing force, potentially making all DIDs function in an end-verifiable and thus universal way.</p><blockquote>“Investing in KERI is investing in interoperability, standardization, and cross-community security guarantees.”<br><br>Dr. Sam Smith, author of the KERI whitepaper and project lead</blockquote><p>In large part, the roots of KERI lie in debates within the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a>. For years it has been discussing the “shalls” and “mays” that define a W3C-compliant DID method (and thus a DID system). In practical terms, this process specifies what each DID method can and must assume about other DID methods for such a decentralized and open system to make appropriate security guarantees.</p><p>KERI’s creator and the author of its whitepaper is Samuel M Smith PhD., a pioneering technologist in multiple fields, including automated reasoning, distributed systems, autonomous vehicles and blockchain protocol design. Dr. Smith has been refining and experimenting with such a cross-method mechanism since 2019, presenting at every meeting of the biannual Internet Identity Workshop. First came some core principles and requirements of a key infrastructure at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/OffChain_%28PKI%29_Key_Management_%E2%80%93_Revocation_Rotation">IIW28</a>, then at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI:_1_Universal_DKMI_Root%28s%29_of_Trust_Decentralized_Systems_Primitires_%26_DKMI_Last_Mile_of_Trust">IIW29</a> a series of sessions about different aspects of a hypothetical system of witnesses that could replicate logs. For <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_%28C%29_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">IIW30</a>, Dr Smith brought more concrete sessions on finer points and even the roadmapping session that became the DIF working group. Along the way, he has iterated an ever-growing <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">whitepaper</a> describing and explaining all of this.</p><p>Now, however, Dr Smith has moved the project into the DIF under the auspices of its <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a> where he sits as co-chair. Asked about the decision, Dr Smith said, “DIF was a natural choice because I wanted the work to happen quickly but in the open, with participation from the greatest number of companies and innovators across various communities.”</p> KERI’s contributors: join&nbsp;us! <p>Foremost among DIF contributors is, of course, Dr Smith, who brings to his KERI design work more than a decade of engineering experience with scale and high-performance systems. Much of this work, focusing largely on AI and streaming/scaling projects, was done through his Python-centric consulting company <a href="http://prosapien.com">Prosapien.com</a>. He has also worked with Consensys, contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/reputage/seedQuest">Seed Quest</a> project among others, soon to be donated to DIF.</p><p>Berlin-based <a href="https://jolocom.io/">Jolocom GmbH</a> has been a major interlocutor in the early development of KERI, since before the creation of the working group at DIF. Jolocom’s Charles Cunningham is the working group’s lead Rust developer, who has written a highly interesting post about mental models of <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/how-keri-tackles-the-problem-of-trust/">How KERI tackles the problem of trust</a> from a developer’s point of view for the Jolocom logbook.</p><p>Representing <a href="https://www.spherity.com">Spherity GmbH are the working group’s lead </a>JavaScript developer and note-taker. Spherity’s founder, Carsten Stöcker, has written a detailed piece for his company’s blog which called KERI “<a href="https://medium.com/spherity/introducing-keri-8f50ed1d8ed7">a more performant ledger for trusted identities</a>.”</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation, a Swiss-based non-profit, has been co-developing on the Rust side as well, working in parallel and providing input on the design considerations. The Human Colossus Foundation has also put substantial energy into promoting and socializing KERI in the Trust-over-IP Foundation, the MyData community and in the Sovrin community, including featuring an hour-long KERI <a href="https://vimeo.com/459348260">session</a> prominently in a half-day <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/invitation-core-public-utility-technologies-for-a-next-generation-internet">mini-conference</a> it organized.</p><p>At IIW31, the KERI developers will be demonstrating their initial work to date while there is still the opportunity to get involved and determine the course of KERI as the project moves from direct mode (two-party) to witness mode (multi-party, distributed consensus). Many sessions are planned for IIW, ranging from introductions to technical discussions to use-case and requirements gathering for KERI-based ideas. Additionally there will be a live demo of the working direct-mode prototype.</p><p>Introductory reading and video materials are collected at the main DIF <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">repository</a>, but even if you don’t watch them in advance (or fully understand them if you do), there are many ways to get involved and make this community project stronger and more diverse.

<p></p>      Now with more focus on growing solutions to deliver privacy, security and trust, CULedger announces company name change. 
<p>Denver, CO (March 3, 2021) – CULedger, an industry leader in privacy- and security-enhanced solutions announces today the changing of its name to Bonifii. This rebranding strategy reflects both the evolution of the company and its vision for future solutions.</p>
<p>CULedger started in 2017 as a research to action project from CUNA’s National Credit Union Roundtable focused on the development of a proprietary blockchain/distributed ledger network and a product exclusively used for call center identification purposes. As the technology evolved, so did the services the company offers. One of the strongest established use cases for blockchain or distributed ledger technology is a decentralized identity that supports the use of best-in-class privacy and security technologies.</p>
<p>Its flagship product, MemberPass(R), is an example of the exchange of verifiable credentials leveraging a combination of distributed ledger, biometrics, and cryptography to protect credit unions’ consumers and small business members. MemberPass is a digital passport that allows members convenient access to their financial accounts while allowing control and privacy of their personal information. MemberPass, powered by Bonifii, will change the way consumers engage and interact with products, services, and information in a digital financial world, and soon in other industries like health care, travel, and government.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Bonifii announced the acquisition of CUFX (Credit Union Financial Exchange) from CUNA’s Technology Council. Under Bonifii, CUFX will be positioned as the exchange of data supported by a systems integration standard and will allow credit unions to increase the speed to become more digital.</p>
<p>“The brand, Bonifii, is a play on the word “bona fide,” which means genuine or authentic and is reflective of our flagship MemberPass product. The “ii” at the end of Bonifii is a symbolic reference to our mission which is to deliver a trusted and verifiable peer-to-peer exchange network,” explains Julie Esser, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bonifii.</p>
<p>Consumers trust their financial relationships. Now financial institutions can invest in and deploy trust-first technologies to give consumers confidence and peace of mind while reducing fraud and improving the member relationships.

<p>The leading electronic interchange format for business documents enters the 60-day public review that precedes the call for consent as an OASIS Standard.</p> 


<p>OASIS and the Universal Business Language TC [1] are pleased to announce that Universal Business Language Version 2.3 Committee Specification 01 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>UBL is the leading electronic interchange format for business documents. It is designed to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes.</p>



<p>The European Commission has declared UBL officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations, and in 2015 UBL was approved as ISO/IEC 19845:2015.</p>



<p>Specifically, UBL provides:</p>



  A suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business documents.  A library of schemas for reusable data components such as Address, Item, and Payment, the common data elements of everyday business documents.  A set of schemas for common business documents such as Order, Despatch Advice, and Invoice that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation contexts.  



<p>Version 2.3 is a minor revision to v2.2 that preserves backwards compatibility with previous v2.# versions. It adds new document types, bringing the total number of UBL business documents to 91.</p>



<p>The TC has received 4 Statements of Use from IBM, ClearView Trade, the Swedish Procurement Agency, and Philip Helger [3].</p>



<p>The candidate specification and related files are available here:</p>

<p>Standard advanced by Danish Business Authority, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, IBM, Norwegian Agency for Public and Financial Management, and Others</p> 


<p>2 March 2021 — OASIS Open, the global open standards and open source consortium, announced that its members have approved Service Metadata Publishing (SMP) v2.0 as an OASIS Standard, a status that signifies the highest level of ratification. The SMP framework facilitates dynamic discovery and capability matching between participants in a business community and enables addressing and routing in an interoperable and secure network to connect trading partners.</p>



<p>SMP v2.0 describes a specification for publishing service metadata within a 4-corner network, where entities exchange business documents through intermediary gateway services, sometimes called “Access Points.” To successfully send a business document in a 4-corner network, the sending entity must be able to discover critical metadata about the receiving entity, such as which types of documents the trading partner can receive and process automatically and which transport protocols they support. Trading partners make this metadata available to each other in the network, depending on the business processes they implement, always through an SMP service.</p>



<p>“The SMP is a relatively simple, yet powerful specification for registering endpoint capabilities in an eDelivery network that supports many-to-many transactions,” said Professor Dr. Andriana Prentza of the University of Piraeus and member of the OASIS Open Europe Foundation Board of Directors. “It has been proven a very valuable building block in application domains such as eInvoicing and the wider supply chain integration, which require distributed, dynamic discovery and portable registration of end user capabilities.”</p>



<p>“SMP was developed by the OASIS Business Document Exchange TC as part of its mandate to define an open standards framework to support public eProcurement and eInvoicing,” said Kenneth Bengtsson, Chair of the BDXR Technical Committee. “This specification describes the request/response exchanges between a Service Metadata Publisher and a client wishing to discover endpoint information. Once connected, businesses and government agencies can easily and safely reach any other partner on the network. This makes trading partner onboarding a significantly smoother process, and removes a lot of friction from day to day electronic trade.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The international nonprofit association OpenPEPPOL includes the SMP service as a mandatory building block in the architecture of the Peppol Network. Buyers and sellers can publish their receiving capabilities, which facilitate communication in various stages of electronic procurement and other business processes between public and private entities, in a total of 32 countries across the globe.</p>



<p>IBM<br>“As a longtime supporter of both open source and open standards, IBM is proud to support the OASIS BDXR TC to help achieve true frictionless global electronic trade. IBM Sterling’s ongoing contributions to supply chain and e-invoicing technologies like the SMP are instrumental to ensure the needs of our clients and their trading business partners are considered as industry and regulatory standards are developed.”</p>

 Nigeria’s revised Cybersecurity Policy  Codifying Bug Bounty Programs in Cybersecurity practice <p>When Nigeria rebased its <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2014/04/12/step-change">GDP figures</a> in 2013, many observers assumed there would be doubts about the new figures that made Nigeria Africa’s largest economy, after South Africa. Indeed, it was the former figures that were deemed unreliable, because they largely ignored the tremendous contributions made by new sectors such as entertainment, services, and telecoms to the economy. The Economist magazine estimated that the telecoms sector alone accounted for more than <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2014/04/12/step-change">25% of the rebased GDP</a>. Thus, Nigeria began the transition from a monolith petroleum-based economy to a more diversified economy. And with the expansion of the entertainment industry (for example Nollywood, second only to Hollywood), the remarkable growth of the financial services, and the greater integration of digital in the public and private sector, intellectual property and cybersecurity assumed greater importance.</p><p>The increasing importance of cybersecurity in Nigeria is well laid out in industry publications such as Deloitte’s Nigeria <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ng/Documents/risk/ng_nigeria_cyber_security_outlook_2021.pdf">Cybersecurity Outlook</a>, which details what observers of the cybersecurity scene in Nigeria already know — cybercrime has become more sophisticated in Nigeria each passing year. The covid -19 pandemic has also increased the risk and incidence of cyberattacks in Nigeria, as people and organizations are forced to work in remote and less secure environments outside the walls of organizations. The impact of the pandemic which portends some lasting changes to the nature of work and the increasing waves of cyberattacks globally (amongst them the infamous <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/solarwinds-hack-explained-government-agencies-cyber-security-2020-12">Solarwinds</a> hack) makes the recent <a href="https://technologytimes.ng/buhari-inks-national-cyber-security-policy-strategy-nigeria/">signing</a> in February of Nigeria’s revised <a href="https://www.cert.gov.ng/ngcert/resources/NATIONAL_CYBESECURITY_STRATEGY.pdf">Cybersecurity Strategy and Policy</a> even more poignant.</p>Photo: <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/cyber-security-hacker-security-3194286/">Pixabay</a><p>On paper, Nigeria’s Cybersecurity Policy, and its <a href="https://www.cert.gov.ng/ngcert/resources/CyberCrime__Prohibition_Prevention_etc__Act__2015.pdf">Cybercrime Act</a> both specify a detailed and well-thought-out cybersecurity regimen for the nation. Nevertheless, the #EndSars protests of October 2020, which saw hacktivists <a href="https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/10/25/when-govt-agencies-websites-came-under-threat-of-hackers/">compromise</a> a number of government and private digital assets, demonstrate that actual cybersecurity preparedness is different from what is specified in&nbsp;policy.</p><p>To be sure, Nigeria’s Cybersecurity Policy has provisions for a National Cybersecurity Coordination Centre (NCCC) and a Nigerian Computer Emergency Readiness Team (NgCERT) which together have oversight over cybersecurity incident management in different sectors both public and private in the country. Aspects of vulnerability testing and assessment are also codified in the policy (for example initiative 6, page 107, “implementing an Enterprise Application Security Testing regimen’’; initiative 9 page 109 “Developing Blue team and Red team capabilities among cybersecurity actors’’, amongst&nbsp;others).</p><blockquote>Could bug bounty programs improve cybersecurity preparedness in&nbsp;Nigeria?</blockquote><p>The <a href="https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/10/25/when-govt-agencies-websites-came-under-threat-of-hackers/">activities</a> of the #EndSars hacktivists, however, showed just how vulnerable key national cyber-assets are, and perhaps suggests including another layer of defense in the nation’s cybersecurity framework. Could bug bounty programs improve cybersecurity preparedness in Nigeria? Evidence <a href="https://techbeacon.com/security/why-every-organization-needs-bug-bounty-program">elsewhere in the world</a> suggests they are a useful addition to the range of measures nations and organizations implement to strengthen cybersecurity. Bug bounty programs are often initiated to <a href="https://www.stubnet.com.ng/bug-bounty-hof/">supplement</a> internal code audits and penetration tests as part of a vulnerability management strategy. Codifying bug bounties in cybersecurity practice in Nigeria could positively impact the sector and improve cybersecurity readiness particularly in the private&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Despite the promise of bug bounty programs, however, they face at least two hurdles in Nigeria. One is the perceived reputation the country already has as a haven for cybercriminals. This reputation is held not just outside the country, but also within it. This lack of trust will limit the effectiveness of bug bounty programs — which typically work by ordinary citizens with cyber skills unearthing vulnerabilities in digital assets. This lack of trust in Nigeria leads to businesses entrusting cybersecurity penetration tests to other cybersecurity organizations, rather than institute bug bounties. Another hurdle seems to be <a href="https://www.cert.gov.ng/ngcert/resources/CyberCrime__Prohibition_Prevention_etc__Act__2015.pdf">Nigeria’s Cybercrime Act</a>. Part 3 of the Act, “Offences and Penalties’’ has clauses that might criminalize the work of bounty&nbsp;hunters.</p><p>These hurdles notwithstanding, a bug bounty program could invigorate Nigeria’s cybersecurity sector, channel the energy of a new generation of cyber-professionals, and help to plug the holes in Nigeria’s cyber-infrastructure — as so brazenly exposed during the #EndSARS protest of&nbsp;2020.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/nigerias-revised-cybersecurity-policy-codifying-bug-bounties-in-cybersecurity-practice-5a8836c31c46">Nigeria’s revised Cybersecurity Policy: Codifying Bug Bounties in Cybersecurity practice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

AND THEN, <a href="https://youtu.be/gOxh_COf2VY">2020 HAPPENED</a>. In the midst of the twin public health and economic crises, we witnessed a racial justice reckoning and watched as our US democracy came under attack. We found ourselves — like so many others — balancing multiple urgent priorities.</p><blockquote>We focused on supporting staff and grantees through these difficult times, pivoting our work where necessary to meet the moment, and realigning our teams to capture new opportunities.</blockquote><p>Thankfully, even before the pandemic rocked 2020, we had shifted our accountability processes to recognize that contributing toward healthier, more resilient systems is long-term, complex work. Annually, we focus accountability measures on our ability to work with our partners to determine the most promising paths forward, what we have learned, whether we are living our values, and how we steward firm health. Over the long-term, we remain accountable for meaningfully contributions to healthier systems.</p> <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">Reimagining Capitalism</a> <p>The pandemic’s disproportionate impact on frontline and essential workers shined a much-needed spotlight on how our current economic system fails to adequately provide for working families. We were proud to be among one of the first contributors to the National Domestic Workers Alliance Coronavirus Cares Fund, which distributed $30 million in cash assistance to domestic workers in the US who have struggled to get by during the pandemic.</p><p>We also supported the work of Molly Kinder, a fellow at the Brookings Institute, who produced a series of reports that highlighted the stories of working people on the frontlines and the need for “hero pay.” Her research and reporting led to policy changes in several cities to support these working&nbsp;people.</p><p>But even as the cracks in our current economic system’s foundation became glaringly obvious during the pandemic, the residual power structures have remained in place, and overall inequality only&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/pandemic-widens-the-gap-between-the-haves-and-have-nots-report-finds.html">widened</a>.</p><p>Meaningful, structural economic reforms will likely continue to be difficult given political incentives that fuel gridlock and polarization, but we remain optimistic. We launched our <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">POV</a> this year to articulate our vision to Reimagine Capitalism, and we are thrilled to have so many like-minded allies in some states as well as the federal government (so far, more than a dozen of our grantees and close partners have taken positions in the Biden Administration!). We see the possibility of real change on the horizon supported by some members of the business community, and at the local and state levels (like the organizations supported by the <a href="https://carryonthefightfund.org/">Carry on the Fight&nbsp;Fund</a>).</p> <a href="https://omidyar.com/responsible-technology-2/">Responsible Technology</a> <p>As many workers left office buildings and students left schools following stay-at-home orders, our deep dependency on technology only increased. As a result, the power of those technology companies grew even more, and became clear and concerning to both the public (<a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/the-film/">The Social Dilemma</a> was a global smash hit and featured several of our grantees) and policymakers.</p><p>Building on our work outlining Big Tech’s <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Omidyar-Network-POV_Platforms-and-Power_2.7.2020.pdf">Unchecked Power</a> earlier in the year, the team released legal roadmaps for antitrust cases against <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Roadmap-for-an-Antitrust-Case-Against-Facebook.pdf">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Roadmap-for-a-Case-Against-Google.pdf">Google</a>.

But, in reality, we are still facing many of the same challenges as 2020. We are entering another year of uncertainty, which will require deep care for our staff and our partners. We will be bold, get moving, and seize this transitional moment to put what we have learned into action. Managing this tension between hope and pragmatism will require important, but difficult tradeoffs. It is in this spirit that we set the following learning questions:</p><p>· What are we learning about what it takes to develop an internal programmatic structure that supports dynamic, complex, social change&nbsp;work?</p><p>· What roles and tools are serving us well in our efforts to influence social&nbsp;change?</p><p>· How can engaging and listening deeply to a diverse set of stakeholders lead us to be more effective in contributing to social change? What forms of engagement work more/less well?</p><p>From today’s perch, we believe these questions are critical for us to continue to learn and evolve as an organization in ways that help us contribute to meaningful social change. That said, we are prepared to adapt to whatever 2021 may throw our way, and our first priority will always be the well-being of our staff and partners.</p><blockquote>In 2021, we will continue to evolve as we use lessons from the past year to shape our portfolio. We will also be answering critical questions that will help us to further refine our role and boundaries (e.g., we define and advance <a href="https://omidyar.com/pluralism/">pluralism</a>). These insights will help ensure we invest in partners, systems, and processes that will not only increase our efficacy, but also foster a culture that reflects our values and enables staff to&nbsp;thrive.</blockquote><p>After a year of dramatic shifts and significant organizational transition, our staff is proud of the work we accomplished and grateful for each other, the firm, our board — and especially our partners. We expect challenges to surface, but we are energized by the opportunity to contribute towards long-term change on issues that&nbsp;matter.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/2021-a-new-year-of-hope-ce640aaa3a1c">2021: A New Year of Hope…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee (TSC) has approved <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> as the latest of Hyperledger’s projects to graduate from incubation to active status.</p>



<p>Hyperledger Aries provides reusable, interoperable tool kits designed for initiatives and solutions focused on creating, transmitting and storing verifiable digital credentials. The Aries project grew out of the need for protocols, open source tools and interoperability test suites that leverage networks enabling verifiable credentials, such as those supported by <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy.</a></p>



<p>This major milestone shows that Hyperledger’s technical leadership recognizes the maturity of the Aries community and project. The TSC applies rigorous standards to active projects including code quality, security best practices, open source governance, and a diverse pool of contributors. Becoming an active Hyperledger project is a sign that Aries has grown in both community and code and is a big step forward for the decentralized digital identity community.</p>



<p>“This approval is further evidence that Hyperledger Aries is a breakout success for the Hyperledger community,” said Brian Behlendorf, General Manager for Blockchain, Healthcare and Identity at the Linux Foundation. “Convergence on common libraries for the exchange of credentials will help speed the development of urgently-needed solutions and systems, ranging from education to finance to the fight against the pandemic. Aries is key to that convergence.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The TSC’s endorsement of Hyperledger Aries as out of incubation and into active project status is particularly important as the world grapples with finding trusted ways for people to prove their COVID-19 vaccination or test results. Aries’ maturity and protocol-driven approach to issuing verifiable credentials and presenting verified proofs has meant that Aries is a part of every technical discussion in that domain, and a core component of many of the technical stacks being deployed.<br><br>Key components of an Aries solution are:</p>



  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0004-agents/README.md">Agent</a> Frameworks: In the digital world, humans, organizations and things need a way to store, manage and exchange verifiable data, including the crypto that decentralized identity demands. Agents do this work in a decentralized environment, and Aries Frameworks make it easy for anyone to build agents tied to specific business needs.  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0005-didcomm/README.md">DID communications</a> (DIDComm): Agent-like things have to interact with one another to get work done. How they talk in general is DIDComm. DIDComm was born in the Aries project, and work on the next version continues within a working group at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>.  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/README.md">Protocols</a>: The Aries protocols run on top of DIDComm and enable peer-to-peer application-level interactions among&nbsp;agents, and shows how they should be designed and documented. The Aries community has developed an approach called <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/305">Aries Interop Profiles</a> (AIP) that formalizes specific sets of protocols that any agent-maker must use to be interoperable across the community, and a <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness">test harness</a> that verifies interoperability across disparate implementations using the protocols that make up an AIP.  



<p>A Wallet is a common term for a mobile agent used by a person. Wallets are the important link that enables people to manage their connections, credentials, and other aspects of involvement in the decentralized identity ecosystem. This important area of work has just recently received another boost with the community organization of work around creating an open source mobile agent using the Aries Framework Javascript and React Native.</p>



<p>Aries also has close community ties with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org">Trust Over IP (ToIP)</a> project, which is also housed at the Linux Foundation. Both projects are working on the issuing, holding, and presenting of cryptographically-verifiable digital credentials without the necessity of intermediaries. While Aries is focused on the tools required for verifiable credential exchange, the Trust over IP Foundation is a project working to define a complete architecture, or stack, that combines both cryptographic trust and human trust relating to decentralized identity.</p>



<p>The TSC commended the Aries project during the meeting for the project’s highly diverse contributors. Achieving a high number of organizations contributing to a project at Hyperledger is often a challenge. Congratulations are due to those participating in and supporting the Aries Project.</p>

<p></p>
<p>New Zealand Women in Identity members Tamara Al’ Salim and Andrew Weaver were featured on a panel discussing Contact Tracing and Data Ownership. They spoke to the members of the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS), a nonprofit based in Washington, DC, whose members are vital records professionals across the U.S. as well as other countries. Tamara and Andrew discussed their view of New Zealand’s response to the pandemic and the impact it had on the community’s behavior when it came to contact tracing.</p>
<p>Andrew described how New Zealand took a pragmatic and expert led approach to the pandemic, driven by medical recommendations and based on statistics and scientific data modeling, wrapped up with the message of kindness. With the continuing change in the pandemic’s landscape, and quoting Maya Angelou, New Zealand took the approach of “Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tamara walked the audience through graphs that told a story about the New Zealand COVID-19 Tracer App including how its early inception didn’t have much uptake as New Zealand left lockdown with no community cases. The perception was , no community cases meant no need to keep track of our movements. As travel increased into the country, cases at the border increased as well, still yet, people didn’t feel the pressure to keep track of their movements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara went on to describe how the trend shifted dramatically when a community case linked to a ship at the ports got into the community, with a household of four people testing positive, the whole country had restriction levels changes, and the city the cases were in went into even high restrictions. This saw a significant uptake and a consistent trend of use of the app since then. New Zealand continues to report daily to its community on the number of border and community cases with none in the community since November 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara observed that complacency is natural and will continue to happen as people feel safe and not have the need to keep track of their movements. If there is any trend that is guaranteed, it would be the one when cases are discovered in the community people become more vigilant and keep track of their movements. That is possible the new normal in New Zealand. In the meantime, the message, is that is a collective responsibility, we all want to safe and be able to celebrate holidays safely, act like you have the virus, wear your mask on public transport and stay home if you are unwell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara is one of the Ambassadors for New Zealand and Andrew as an active member and supporter of Women in Identity encouraged the NAPHSIS members and especially many of the men to join the organization and support our work.</p>
<p>In addition, Kay Chopard spoke in the closing plenary about the Women in Identity organization and encouraged the NAPHSIS membership to become part of the organization and the mission. The conference took place virtually on November 30 to December 2, 2020.</p>

 Coming soon: quality-of-service guarantees for decentralized technologies  Why escrow-based service-level agreements (SLAs) are the secret to enterprise adoption of blockchain <p>During my entire career I have been responsible for delivering, operating, and improving enterprise-grade services — telecommunications, IT, banking — to global customers. I have learned two important lessons when operating the services in more than 65 countries around the&nbsp;world:</p>  Although the consistent delivery of platform service levels globally is key, the service experience is always local to the country. What matters is the service experience that happens in the real world, not the virtual one that exists on paper in contracts. The real world is where people live their (working) lives and services are consumed.  Transparency in service reporting, the ability to learn and improve from under / over performance, and a fair penalty / reward system are all essential to a sustainable and successful long-term partnership in the enterprise environment.  <p>For decades, service-level agreements (SLAs) have been central to enterprise outsourcing to IT and network providers, including software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. Managed services in particular come in many shapes and forms: from managing the multi-vendor environment to providing service guarantees on a specific technology stack. Managed services governed by one or more SLAs can be unbundled and agnostic to any underlying tech or they can be bundled with a certain tech platform (in part of boost enterprise confidence and reduce risk in adopting that platform). Both of these approaches matter for blockchain.</p><p>SLAs are understandably popular, because they provide enterprise customers with guaranteed availability and performance at agreed cost levels, and vendors with a stable revenue stream. This is critical when it comes to widespread adoption of new technologies. Being a good vendor is one thing; being a good customer is just as essential. Both are investing and committing to a longer-term relationship, so it has to be fair and balanced.</p><p>Yet the conventional SLA-based procurement model is not without its drawbacks. Contracting cycles often range from months to years, requiring major upfront investment on the part of both customers and vendors into requests for proposals (RFPs), solution engineering, legal, and implementation. Once a contract is in place and services are up and running, customers and vendors frequently face change management processes due to the nature of ever-evolving technologies and business requirements. In the event of contractual disputes, compliance and enforcement also take up significant resources. The biggest challenge I have seen in my career is that often these longer-term contracts can become a burden to staying agile and innovative. With the rapid pace of innovation, it is just not possible to predict how the market will look years from now. At the same time, a provider of the services needs to make a fair return on investment (ROI) too and requires a multi-year lock&nbsp;in.</p><p>Fast forward to 2021. More and more enterprises are exploring blockchain and other decentralized digital technologies and their governance mechanisms. Many are willing to actively experiment with open, public networks for pilots and proof-of-concept applications. But when it comes to deploying business-critical systems in production, they tend to default to existing operational practices and&nbsp;habits.</p><p>I see many companies turn to the larger consultancies and service providers to step in and provide advice and potentially managed services around the technology of choice. It can be a good way to manage risk — career risk mainly, as the operational risks have not gone away. This is of course also true in the energy sector, where reliability is paramount and system failures can impact millions of customers and result in billions of dollars of damages. So availability and quality of service are essential. How to deliver on these requirements with an open-source decentralized platform is the next big challenge that needs to be&nbsp;solved.</p><p>The answer is not to put a third party in between an enterprise customer and the decentralized technology solution to monitor performance and guarantee uptime. Of course this may provide some benefits, but it is an odd way to approach fundamentally new technologies. Indeed, one of many appeals of open-source tech and open architectures is that it reduces or even obviates the need for third-party intermediaries that add cost, process complexity, and opacity to&nbsp;markets.</p><p>In this new dawning era of enterprise blockchain, two big questions are emerging that matter for the sector’s&nbsp;future:</p>  Can decentralized solutions actually deliver enterprise-grade services with high availability and guaranteed levels of&nbsp;service?  Could SLAs that don’t rely on single vendors or require bilateral contracts be the secret to bridging from limited pilots and proofs of concept to full-blown commercial deployments?  <p>At Energy Web we believe the answer is yes, to both questions, but we need to stretch our thinking into a new space though where we enter into decentralized service operations.</p><p>The rise of the escrow-backed decentralized SLA</p><p>Conventional SLAs work well because there is a single counterparty to a given contract. That counterparty is known and contracted (and therefore ‘trusted’) to deliver the services. By contrast, public networks <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/ew-dos/">like EW-DOS</a> run on a distributed network of nodes, operated by multiple organizations, that collectively run services and maintain data integrity via a common protocol. There is no single vendor with which an enterprise user can enter into an SLA contract, but rather a network of vendors that collectively provide services. So how should we rethink the idea of the traditional SLA? How can we make chief information officers (CIOs) of enterprises, including energy companies, as comfortable relying directly on decentralized technologies as they are with existing IT and network&nbsp;vendors?</p><p>The answer lies in a decentralized SLA. And the basis of this new type of SLA — for enterprises and vendors alike — is distributed, multilateral trust that the services will be delivered according to the agreed&nbsp;SLA.</p><p>We expect that engendering that trust in a decentralized environment should involve posting collateral (often called staking in blockchain circles). This idea isn’t new; anyone who has ever rented an apartment has likely experienced the concept in the form of a security deposit. In the context of public blockchains, staking keeps actors honest and provides strong assurances that the blockchain holds a shared truth, not a compromised version of the truth (since staked companies are incentivized to follow the rules to maximize their rewards and simultaneously disincentivized from bad behavior, for fear of losing their staked collateral in&nbsp;escrow).</p><p>When it comes to the idea of a decentralized SLA, a key mechanism is the staking of crypto tokens into a kind of escrow account. Particularly when native tokens are used (such as EWT), this can be easily done via blockchain-based smart contracts. Staking mechanisms are already being used to guarantee trust at the blockchain level. Why not use the same mechanism to define and enforce the terms that are typically found in SLAs at the services layer? While this is an arguably groundbreaking idea for enterprise IT procurement, it’s already becoming a standard practice for blockchain operational and governance mechanisms.</p><p>By extending the concept of token staking beyond the trust layer of blockchains (i.e., the maintenance of the distributed ledger database itself) into the services and application layers of the technology stack, it is possible to provide guaranteed uptime, latency, throughput, and other performance measures that are customarily defined in service levels. This approach has the potential to unlock the full potential of decentralized technologies for enterprise customers and service providers alike.</p><p>For enterprise customers: A decentralized SLA allows you to easily procure IT and network services by opting into a pool of services provided by multiple vendors at once, and automatically enforce contractual terms in a trusted way. Not only would this approach reduce procurement costs, but it can also improve overall performance and reliability relative to the status quo thanks to the inherent resilience of a decentralized network. Just as it’s generally better to invest in an index fund instead of picking individual stocks, why bet on specific companies (with vendor lock-in) when you can hedge your bet across the entire&nbsp;market?</p><p>For vendors: While in some respects an open-source protocol may commoditize certain IT infrastructure services, it also lowers the barrier for customer acquisition and simplifies service delivery. It’s hard to make a profit on managed services today due to the aforementioned upfront contract costs, fierce competition, and commoditization of IT infrastructure. In a decentralized SLA approach, vendors have much wider reach and fewer liabilities (e.g., you can stop any given service and focus on others, while the overall network keeps&nbsp;going).</p><p>Service providers would operate nodes that provision various services to enterprise users. They will get paid for the delivery of the services by the enterprise customers. In return these decentralized service providers would stake tokens against performance guarantees (e.g., uptime, latency) to the enterprises using their services. In the event of performance failures, network and service users impacted by degraded performance or outages would be paid out of the staked tokens through slashing part of the staked&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Bringing the decentralized SLA to the Energy Web tech stack and ecosystem</p><p>Our goal is to put this theory into practice with EW-DOS, starting with the Utility Layer services. This approach will deliver all the benefits of conventional SLAs (i.e., pre-defined performance requirements and penalties), while remaining vendor- and technology-neutral, highly flexible, more resilient, and lower cost (e.g., by reducing complexity and point-to-point integrations, automating compliance and enforcement) than conventional bilateral arrangements. The payment by the enterprise customer and the staking of the services providers will be done with native token EWT, which is seamlessly integrated into the open-source technology stack.</p><p>For example, consider a grid operator who builds an application that enables distributed energy resources (DERs) to participate in an energy market. The application leverages the power of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to not only streamline the enrollment of customers and assets, but also manage permissions and coordinate data exchange among market participants. Depending on the size of the market, there might be dozens to hundreds of asset types, and thousands to millions of customers and assets. In this scenario, the application might require multiple Utility Layer services like the Key Manager (for distributed key generation and recovery) and Identity and Access Management Cache Server (for high-performance data structuring and availability for DID verifiable credentials).</p><p>Instead of locking themselves into a single vendor or product up front (when there is perhaps uncertainty about uptake), the Utility Layer offers a pay-as-you-go solution that allows the grid operator to procure identical services (in terms of cost, performance, etc.) from multiple vendors at once without having to manage separate bilateral contracts — akin to universal roaming for mobile phones, but for enterprise applications.</p><p>A natural skeptic might ask: How is this possible? How do you provide multilateral, guaranteed service levels (in terms of both quantity and quality) without direct engagement and contracts between&nbsp;parties?</p><p>I think it is possible, and when it works it will address the two main challenges I referenced at the start of this article. This new type of architecture will enable very transparent reporting on actual service quality and be delivered extremely close to the customer who consumes the service in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Also remember the famous point that was raised in 1880 by Henry Morton, president of the Steven’s Institute of Technology on the Edison light bulb: “Surely, everyone that is acquainted with the subject will recognize it as a conspicuous failure?”</p><p>And so to those who stay skeptical I would say, join the trials and experience it yourself. Expect to hear more from Energy Web on this&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Walter Kok is the CEO of Energy&nbsp;Web.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/its-coming-quality-of-service-guarantees-for-decentralized-technologies-c0e133ebe644">It’s coming: quality-of-service guarantees for decentralized technologies</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Two AMQP specifications now ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that AMQP Request-Response Messaging with Link Pairing Version 1.0 and Message Annotations for Response Routing Version 1.0 from the OASIS Advanced Message Queuing Protocol AMQP TC [1] have been approved as OASIS Committee Specifications.</p>



<p>AMQP is a vendor-neutral, platform-agnostic protocol for passing real-time data streams and business transactions. The goal of AMQP is to ensure information is safely and efficiently transported between applications, among organizations, across distributed cloud computing environments, and within mobile infrastructures by enabling a commoditized, multi-vendor ecosystem.</p>



<p>About AMQP Request-Response Messaging with Link Pairing:<br></p>



<p>AMQP defines links as unidirectional transport for messages between a source and a target. A common messaging pattern is that of “request-response”, that is, two parties partaking in a bidirectional conversation using messages. This document defines a common pattern for pairing two unidirectional links to create a bidirectional message transport between two endpoints.</p>



<p>About Message Annotations for Response Routing:<br></p>



<p>Large scale messaging networks may consist of multiple distinct sub-networks where addresses visible at one point in the network are not visible at other points. Where messages are transferred across network boundaries, addresses contained within the message (such as those in the reply-to field) may no longer be valid. This document defines mechanisms to allow messages which transit such boundaries to be annotated with sufficient information to allow responses to be directed back to the intended recipient.</p>



<p>These Committee Specifications are OASIS deliverables, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The specifications and related files are available here:</p>

<p>By Jozette Allah-Mensah and Nicole Allred, Strategic Communications, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>Illustration by Superside.<p>“When day comes, we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow we do&nbsp;it.”</p><p>These are the words of 22-year-old Amanda Gorman — the first National Youth Poet Laureate in American history. The opening lines from her poem, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/20/politics/amanda-gorman-inaugural-poem-transcript/index.html">“The Hill We Climb,”</a> were first heard at President Biden’s inauguration and inspired millions around the world. Amanda Gorman was one of several youth who participated in inaugural events that day. They represent the next generation of activists meeting today’s challenges head&nbsp;on.</p><p>This group has experienced and persevered through cataclysmic terrorist attacks, economic disruption, the ever-present threat of police violence against Black and brown bodies, and politics that further divides us with every news cycle. Add to all of this the accelerants of the internet and social&nbsp;media.</p><blockquote>However, young people leading the way is not a new phenomenon.</blockquote><p>In the latter half of the 20th century and the first two decades of the 21st, youth have been conscientious revolutionaries working to ensure the words of our nation’s Constitution apply to all within our borders. Indeed, Martin Luther King, Jr., a 25-year-old Baptist preacher at the time he led the bus boycott in Montgomery, would be considered a member of Generation Z today. King and his generation of civil rights leaders, the people whose names we hear most often during Black History Month, serve as an <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/children-who-marched-for-equal-rights-inspire-a-new-generation">inspiration to the current class of emboldened youth activists.</a></p><p>Viewed from this perspective, the voices of young people must be recognized and actively engaged in our fight for social justice in America and throughout the world. Those voices include the likes of <a href="https://time.com/longform/never-again-movement/">anti-gun activists</a> and Parkland school shooting survivors David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez, global environmental activists <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763452863/transcript-greta-thunbergs-speech-at-the-u-n-climate-action-summit">Greta Thunberg</a> and Flint, Michigan native Mari Copeny, known as <a href="http://Little%20Miss%20Flint">“Little Miss Flint,”</a> and now Gorman. It’s not only important to recognize their activism but to appreciate that without it, we will fail to reach the next rung on the ladder of equity, opportunity, and justice in&nbsp;America.</p><blockquote>Without the activism of Gen-Z, we fail to reach the next rung on the ladder of equity, opportunity, and justice in&nbsp;America.</blockquote> Generation Z: The Leaders We&nbsp;Need <p>Against the backdrop of the pandemic and economic devastation, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2020-12-07/us-saw-summer-of-black-lives-matter-protests-demanding-change">the summer of 2020</a> forced us to reckon with the horrific murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, George Floyd, and so many others at the hands of police. We marched, protested for change, and the surge of the Black Lives Matter movement spanned oceans. We called for legislative action to strike down the pillars of white supremacy undergirding the foundation of the United States. We forced the start of difficult conversations. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/06/08/the-nations-racial-justice-protests-are-a-pivotal-moment-for-millennials-and-gen-z/">And at the forefront of this cultural shift was Gen Z. </a><br> <br>This generation has called for expediency in eradicating inequities across the map. They have refused to accept silence from brands that have the platforms to speak up and make a difference, and pushed back against those whose words are solely performative. For Gen Z, a crucial requisite for justice is intention and purposeful action.</p><blockquote>As younger people continue to step up and speak out, we must ask ourselves: How can we learn and leverage their activism to effect change more broadly? What does letting Gen Z lead really look&nbsp;like?</blockquote><p>When we think of <a href="https://omidyarnetwork.medium.com/listening-to-the-future-5d709ea30d7d">dynamic futurism</a> and the forward-thinking solutions to the ever-growing problems plaguing our world, Gen Z voices can be the most powerful ones at the&nbsp;podium.</p><p>And when Amanda Gorman spoke on inauguration day, her words acknowledged the past and inspired future possibilities. In referencing the “shadows” rather than the darkness, she may have been referencing the work of those freedom fighters for justice from generations ago. It’s not completely dark, but there still remains important work to be done. Her final refrain tells us inherently what Generation Z is already doing, and how we can emulate their example to bring about positive&nbsp;change.</p><blockquote>“For there is always light, if only we’re brave enough to see it. If only we’re brave enough to be&nbsp;it.”</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/the-dawn-is-ours-gen-z-the-fight-for-social-justice-9da40f48b54c">The Dawn is Ours: Gen-Z &amp; the Fight for Social Justice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>There’s a renewed interest in a more contextual, associative, networked future for the internet. One that breaks us from restrictive digital gardens. One that’s healthier, freer and safer. This piece includes a curated set of provocations based on community discussions in a limited working group focused on why the internet is broken and what needs to&nbsp;change.</p><a href="https://www.newrafael.com/weavings/">Weavings</a> by <a href="https://www.newrafael.com/">Rafaël Rozendaal</a><blockquote>Today’s digital public spaces amplify the inequities of physical public space. It’s a game of the top 1% driven by who can generate the most “viral” content. Systems that rely on the virality of user-generated content fundamentally lead to an even more skewed and inequitable future.</blockquote><p>-Jad Esber</p><blockquote>Today’s content platforms have a back-catalog problem. The content is delivered in ephemeral formats and creators lose out on opportunities to monetize their back catalogs. Incentivizing more discoverability and search within the archives will lead to more evergreen content and less content designed for virality or disposability.</blockquote><p>-Sari Azout</p><blockquote>The web is not finished. We have forgotten that the web was built only yesterday by a small, bold group of privileged men. They are not magical men. They are not distinctly different to anyone reading this, despite the grand technological-saviour narratives we spin about them. They had access to the right information and resources at the right time. They were told they had the right to build whatever they&nbsp;wanted.</blockquote><blockquote>If you don’t look, sound, and act like them, it’s likely no one is going to tell you that you also have the right to build whatever you want. You don’t fit into our current cultural narratives. Until we start telling different stories about who gets to edit, revise, and expand the web, the right people won’t show up to do&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>-Maggie Appleton</p><blockquote>Metaphors have a deep impact on the interaction constraints between us and the technology we use. To evolve to more meaningful and equitable digital interactions, we must be cautious in choosing better ones, as a collective.</blockquote><p>-Prakhar Shivam</p><blockquote>Building a better relationship between the internet, computing and people presupposes an inner revolution. As in M. C. Escher’s “Drawing Hands,” the riddle guarding the threshold is: where is the creative agency? The internet is a tool that reflects us, its creators. It is a tool that reflects the current state of our (consensus) knowledge — of, for instance, the nature of the human being, the value and meaning of human existence, the role of institutions vis a vis the individual. Our creations reflect and reinforce a worldview in which the creative faculties of the human being are placed in service of the accumulation of power. Imagine a socio-economic architecture in which the potential of the human being is consecrated as the greatest asset! Our conception of the human being would need to be other than what it is. The creative agency must first be seen, and seen clearly. (“By whom?” asks Escher.) Otherwise, its creations will take on the status of&nbsp;idols.</blockquote><p>-Caroline Nguyen</p><blockquote>Today’s platforms practice UCD (User-Centered Design) — where the user is a consumer, not a creator. Platforms over-optimize around the consumer experience and force creators to adapt their work to cater to the platform. It should be the opposite. Creators often struggle with the extra work on top of their practice: visual artists should not have the burden to adapt their work to perform well on Instagram. We must shift from User-centered Design to Creator-First Design.</blockquote><p>-Kirill Noskov</p><blockquote>The future of the internet has the potential to determine the future of humanity. Our lives are increasingly shifting to digital realms and spaces. VR and AR are set to become mainstream in the coming decade. And so will the metaverse.</blockquote><blockquote>Like their physical counterparts, these virtual landscapes stand to influence and mold all of us. This is a big opportunity in many ways, but it is also a danger. Will the metaverse also be built to exploit our insecurities and promote divisiveness for financial and power gains? What is going to be our guiding principle?</blockquote><p>-Sai Arunachalam</p><blockquote>When Alice ventured into Wonderland, she was asked by a haughty Caterpillar, “Who are you?”. Hesitant in her reply, Alice struggled to explain herself. After consuming several reality-altering potions, she no longer was sure if she was her ‘true’&nbsp;self.</blockquote><blockquote>As venturers of the Internet, we similarly teeter along a shifting sense of our own identity. Our Internet-selves exist within various narrative threads from fake authenticity, herd logic to genuine connections. We oscillate along a precipitous path between being data-driven in the knowledge we find to a form of informational madness. Each byte of information we take in alters our thinking. We should be more careful about what we consume. We must find the equilibrium between chaos and rigidity, lest we find ourselves becoming the Red Queen we didn’t want to&nbsp;be.</blockquote><p>-Daniel Jiang</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/provocations-for-a-better-internet-b5ba53585717">Provocations for a better internet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Catalonian Grid Operator Electra Caldense, Energy Web, and Bamboo Energy Announce Grid Flexibility Project  Strategic collaboration will leverage open-source EW-DOS tech stack and Bamboo flexibility platform to enable battery energy storage, electric vehicles, solar photovoltaic plants, and industrial companies to provide flexibility services to the distribution grid. Electra Caldense will also join Energy Web as a new&nbsp;member. <p>Caldes de Montbuí, Barcelona and Zug, Switzerland — 23 February 2021 — Today Catalonian grid operator <a href="https://electracaldensedistribucio.com/es/">Electra Caldense Distribució</a>, energy retailer <a href="https://electracaldenseenergia.com/es/">Electra Caldense Energia</a>, <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web</a>, and <a href="https://bambooenergy.tech/">Bamboo Energy</a> announced the launch of the joint initiative ElectraFlex. The initiative will focus on the deployment of a digital platform that will allow Electra Caldense to utilize the flexible capacity of assets connected to their electricity network. Other project partners include energy storage company <a href="https://www.cegasa.com/en/">CEGASA</a>, electric vehicle charge point provider <a href="http://www.VegaChargers.com">Vega Chargers</a>, and industrial customers <a href="https://www.topcable.com/">Top Cable</a> and <a href="https://recamlaser.com/en/home/">Recam&nbsp;Laser</a>.</p><p>Oriol Xalabarder, CEO of Electra Group, stated: “We are very excited to join Energy Web and Bamboo Energy on this amazing project together with all other partners and are convinced that we will be generating the necessary innovation and knowledge in order to face energy transition challenges as both a 100% renewable energy retailer and a distribution system operator.”</p><p>For more than 100 years, Electra Caldense has been the distribution system operator for a region of the Spanish power grid just north of Barcelona. Today it serves more than 12,400 customers. In recent years, Electra Caldense has undertaken a number of innovation projects, including involvement in the <a href="https://ris3catenergia.wordpress.com/2017/06/08/el-projecte-naencat/">RIS3CAT Energy Community</a>. Electra Caldense is the lead coordinator for the NAenCAT project within RIS3CAT, which aims to be a smart grid benchmark by providing distributed sensor, remote control, and automation systems. The new ElectraFlex project announced today takes such efforts even further, by leveraging open-source, digital technologies.</p><p>ElectraFlex is the world’s first decentralized flexibility platform tailored for the specific needs of a distribution system operator (DSO). The multi-faceted flexibility platform will use Energy Web’s <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/ew-dos/">EW-DOS</a> technology stack to assign digital identities to all connected assets and flexibility market participants, allowing them to self-register in energy markets, and offer services to Electra Caldense as well as the Spanish transmission system operator (REE) on behalf of their&nbsp;owners.</p><p>Further, Bamboo Energy’s software solution for demand aggregation will also be deployed to manage and optimize demand flexibility for two industrial companies, Top Cable and Recam Laser, a PV farm with batteries from CEGASA, and, in a second phase, a bidirectional electric vehicle charging station from Vega Chargers.</p><p>“Electra Caldense is emerging as a beacon of innovation for European grid operators,” explained Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer of Energy Web. “They’re showing how residential, commercial, and industrial customers — as well as their grid-edge energy assets — can become truly integrated parts of a dynamic, low-carbon electricity system.”</p><p>Xavi Bou, Deputy Manager at Electra Group, added: “The combination of an energy aggregation platform with a blockchain technology will allow us to broaden the scope of our services by offering innovative solutions to our clients in Spain so that we can unlock the transactive energy concept not only through demand flexibility markets but soon also on peer-to-peer energy transactions within renewable energy communities or other ecosystems.”</p><p>In the context of the ElectraFlex project, Energy Web will develop and deploy the EW SunSpec Gateway, an open-source toolkit for industrial single-board computers that will allow any distributed energy resource (DER) compliant with the <a href="https://sunspec.org/sunspec-modbus-home/">SunSpec Modbus Specification</a> to have its own digital identity on EW-DOS. “These gateways will be integrated into Bamboo energy’s demand aggregation software to model the resilience of each energy asset to enable the best strategy to maximise the value of their asset portfolio,” said Alex Gomar, CEO of Bamboo Energy. SunSpec is a trade alliance of roughly 100 solar and storage companies spanning Asia, Europe, and North America. Energy Web and SunSpec Alliance <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/sunspec-alliance-joins-energy-web-announces-strategic-partnership-43c8438f199d">announced a strategic partnership</a> in August&nbsp;2020.</p><p>The ElectraFlex project started January 2021 and is expected to be completed by the end of July&nbsp;2021.</p><p>In addition, on 17 February 2021, Electra Caldense became the newest official member of Energy Web. Electra Caldense will be hosting an EW Chain validator node and be an active part of the world’s largest energy blockchain ecosystem together with other utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>About Electra Caldense (DSO)<br>Electra Caldense is a distribution system operator founded in 1917 and since then guaranteeing power supply to more than 12,400 users within 10 municipalities in the Vallès Oriental and Occidental regions (Barcelona), among other regions in Catalonia.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://electracaldensedistribucio.com/es/">https://electracaldensedistribucio.com/es/</a></p><p>About Electra Caldense Energia (Energy Retailer)<br>Electra Caldense Energia is an energy retailer within Electra’s same group of companies, which commercializes 100% certified green energy to more than 12,800 clients, including residential and industrial customers.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://electracaldenseenergia.com/es/">https://electracaldenseenergia.com/es/</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>In an increasingly digitalized world, the G20 has its sights firmly set on enhancing cross-border payments. By making cross-border payment services faster, cheaper, more transparent and more inclusive, the expectation is that economic growth, international trade and financial inclusion will all prosper, generating benefits for citizens and economies globally. The economic implications of the current global pandemic only strengthen the case for this to happen sooner rather than later. </p>
<p>To support this international priority, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published its Stage 3 roadmap on Enhancing Cross-border Payments in October. The document was developed in coordination with the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and other relevant international stakeholders. It builds on the FSB’s Stage 1 report, setting out the challenges and frictions in cross-border payments that contribute to them, and the CPMI’s Stage 2 report, describing the necessary elements of a response, in the form of a set of 19 building blocks.  </p>
<p>In its publication, the FSB lists several key focus areas that require global coordination and action in order to overcome these challenges. These focus areas, which seek to enhance the existing payments ecosystem and also cover emerging payment infrastructures and arrangements, are mapped through building blocks to associated actions and indicative timelines, agreed upon by FSB member authorities, standard-setters and international organizations. This approach provides a high-level plan, which sets ambitious but achievable goals. </p>
<blockquote>
<p> Payments are at the heart of digitalization which is why the European Commission has set out a Retail Payments Strategy as a part of Digital Finance Package.  International payments represent a core pillar of this strategy and we are supportive of the G20’s roadmap, in particular with regard to global standards. Full consideration will be given to the LEI, as it is a strong and established tool which can be used for reducing the costs associated with cross border payments. - Ceu Pereira, Team Leader, Retail Payments at European Commission
</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Global Unique Identifiers: a building block for cross-border payments </p>
<p>Of particular relevance to GLEIF, is the identification of ‘Establishing Unique Identifiers with proxy registries ’ as a key building block in the FSB’s roadmap to enhanced cross-border payments. This building block is mapped to the following focus area: increasing data quality and straight-through processing by enhancing data and market practices. </p>
<p>Within the roadmap’s action-oriented framework, FSB and GLEIF are committed to work in consultation with the CPMI, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, International Organization for Standardization and other stakeholders, to: “explore the scope for, and obstacles to develop, a global Unique Identifier (UI) for cross border payments and potentially other financial transactions, that takes into account existing identifiers including the LEI for legal entities….  The review would also: </p>
 
 Consider mechanisms to match UIs with payment information, such as visa a proxy registry, 
 Take into account the work of relevant standard setting bodies, including the FATF [Financial Action Task Force], on technical, governance or policy issues, 
 And analyse how to map existing identifiers.” 
 
<p>This collaborative work effort is scheduled to run from October 2020 until December 2021 and GLEIF welcomes the opportunity to engage with it.<br>
Additionally, as a further action mapped to the same ‘Establishing Unique Identifiers…’ building block, GLEIF will work in close coordination with the FSB, the Legal Entity Identifier Regulatory Oversight Committee (LEI-ROC) and national authorities to explore options for improving LEI adoption. This work effort will run from June 2021 to  June 2022</p>
<p>From GLEIF’s perspective, it is extremely encouraging to see that the FSB’s roadmap to enhanced cross-border payments makes a crystal clear connection between legal entity identification and a well-functioning global payment ecosystem. The absence of a system which uniquely identifies counterparties in any type of transaction, whether cross-border or otherwise, fundamentally limits transparency, the security of payments and the ability to track fraud. The FSB’s efforts to define a standardized global entity identifier which will allow this identity verification to happen across international borders should only be celebrated. Such a move has the potential to increase global trading confidence, which will result in significant commercial and economic opportunities.  </p>
<p>Can the LEI be leveraged?  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corporates need to be able to transparently identify counterparties when making and processing payments. This is challenging when dealing with legal entities in different jurisdictions. Airbus payment and KYC processes could be eased if transaction counterparties could easily be uniquely identified, alongside their ultimate beneficiary owners. LEI usage in cross-border payments would bring significant benefits to corporates globally. - Dr. Franz Kaiser, Head of Treasury Reporting &amp; Middle Office, Finance FTR at Airbus
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another reassurance comes from the FSB’s commitment to consider the LEI in context of this initiative. The roadmap sets out clearly that there is exploratory work to do in assessing the role that the LEI might play in the identification of legal entities within the cross-border payments landscape. There is no doubt that there needs to be universal agreement on the Unique Identifer taken forward. And therein lies a key strength of the LEI; decisions on common standards for payments are often shaped by alignment among large and diverse groups of stakeholders – and the LEI is the legacy of such a global agreement. Given that the LEI was developed to create transparency in the derivatives market following the 2008 financial crisis, it seems a natural evolution of its purpose to play a critical role in delivering transparency across the global payments landscape. It is a very powerful proposition which poses an immediate solution for the global identification of legal entities. This is in sharp contrast to the question of how to address the need for a global unique identifier for individuals. In that case, an immediate solution is not quite so obvious. </p>
<p>As the FSB seeks to lay strong foundations for a future-proof global payment ecosystem, I’d like to reaffirm GLEIF’s commitment to playing a valuable and collaborative role in the transformation of the global payments landscape. We look forward to playing our part through engagement in the FSB consultations as we move forward and contribute purposefully to the enhancement of cross-border payments services. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to their broader financial stability benefits, LEIs can help enhance the payments ecosystem. Such support could range from enhanced AML and sanction screening to more effective internal reconciliation of payments. Given its importance to payments and as a valuable tool in an increasingly data-driven economy, the Bank of England will introduce the LEI into ISO 20022 CHAPS payment messages. This will start in February 2023 on an ‘optional to send’ basis. From Spring 2024, the LEI will be mandatory to send for payments between two financial institutions. I hope that with time as LEI adoption  increases we will be able to mandate to a broader set of payments. Achieving a greater critical mass will enable the greatest progress to be made.  - Victoria Cleland, Executive Director for Banking, Payments and Innovation, Bank of England
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Financial institutions across Europe have to speak the same technical language to process payments efficiently and safely. The EPC SEPA payment and payment-related schemes, therefore, rely on global open standards to ensure that all stakeholders exchange data which are commonly understood throughout Europe. Accordingly, the EPC is glad to see that the Global LEI System is growing and supporting businesses, and is ready to accommodate LEI in the new SEPA Request-to-Pay (SRTP) scheme as an option for identifying RTP service providers (SPs).  - Javier Santamaria, Chair of European Payments Council and GLEIF Board Member

<p>On Tuesday, the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> (GHPC) <a href="https://medium.com/id2020/good-health-pass-a-new-cross-sector-initiative-to-restore-global-travel-and-restart-the-global-8b59eb1050a0">launched</a>. This initiative is intended to define, in the context of test results and vaccination records for opening up borders for travel and commerce, a high bar for implementations of identity and credentialing systems to meet with regards to privacy, ethics and portability. They will also work with the implementers of such systems to converge towards common standards and governance.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>A set of Linux Foundation organizations – <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">TrustOverIP</a>, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a>, <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a>, and its <a href="https://www.covidcreds.org/">Covid Credentials Initiative</a> – have engaged as supporting organizations and were part of the announcement. We did this based on very encouraging signs during formation discussions that GHPC would not only help bring many of the organizations emerging into the self-sovereign identity space into alignment on platforms and standards we have long championed, but would also give us an external reference point for our position on the importance of privacy in the design and implementation of such systems.</p>



<p>Hyperledger has been home to the pioneering digital identity ledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a> and agent toolkit <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a>, which form the basis of so many <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/culedger-case-study">production</a> <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/kiva-case-study">privacy-preserving</a> digital identity systems and, now, are serving as the basis for many of these emerging <a href="https://www.evernym.com/travelpass/">health pass solutions</a>. The TrustOverIP Foundation led the formal recognition of the need and role for governance organizations in the digital identity landscape – showing how we can get both optionality and interoperability when we weave global identity and credentialing systems together in a decentralized way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Covid Credentials Initiative, starting way back in March 2020, recognized the potential for credentials of all sorts in the fight against this and future pandemics, and have pulled together an amazing community of technologists and entrepreneurs working together on this. Now, as part of Linux Foundation Public Health, we are working to bring together a set of software projects that can implement credential systems and help accelerate adoption of these globally, centered on the needs of public health authorities.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49XvVxLMTLw&amp;feature=emb_logo">Thursday’s GHPC webinar</a>, Charlie Walton from Mastercard said GHPC is “in the business of describing what good looks like.” We will be working with GHPC to bring our own communities’ views of not just what good looks like, but how we’re already working together to standardize and implement this work. Furthermore we’ll see if our processes can directly support GHPC’s efforts to harmonize this domain.</p>



<p>We recognize there are quite a few of these initiatives now, reflecting just how broadly this issue is felt across society. We can play – we must play – a key role in channeling all this market activity and good-faith sharing of expertise into applications directly in people’s hands, so we can get back to travel and re-opening workplaces and schools in a safe and equitable way. Our key levers to move the world are open source software and open public engagement, and we will double-down on those tools to have a unique and substantive impact.</p>



<p>Look for more on this soon within our communities. We’re incredibly excited to be a part of this global effort.</p>

<p>Papaki kau ana ngā tai o mihi ki a koutou katoa.</p>



<p>As the Kiwi summer rolls on it brings with it a sense of optimism for 2021 and reminds us how truly blessed we are to call Aotearoa New Zealand home.</p>



<p>The year ahead for our digital identity ecosystem and DINZ is one of optimism and progress&nbsp; too – with our focus squarely set on leading a united approach to digital identity for the benefit of all New Zealanders.&nbsp; 2021 will be a significant year of progress as the work to formalise the DIA’s proposed Trust Framework is gathers momentum.</p>



<p>In the spirit of optimism and progress, I would like to let you know that Andrew Weaver will be leaving DINZ as our Executive Director at the end of March.&nbsp; Andrew has been a true rangatira and kaitiaki of DINZ since its establishment.&nbsp; Working together with our members and Executive Council, Andrew has set our association on the path to growth and success and developed significant local and international profile and respect.&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew is leaving us to pursue other opportunities and we sincerely thank him for his contribution to DINZ and the ecosystem and wish him all the very best. Prior to the end of March we will take time to acknowledge his significant contribution to DINZ.</p>



<p>Our mission at DINZ is to create a digital identity ecosystem that enhances Kāwanatanga (honourable governance), Rangatiratanga (self-determination &amp; agency) and&nbsp;&nbsp; Ōritetanga (equity &amp; partnerships) for all people in New Zealand.&nbsp; We are on a journey to become more tiriti-honouring by enhancing our practice to embody Kāwanatanga, believe digital identity is a taonga and we collectively have a great responsibility as Kaitiaki to treat people’s identity with dignity, respect and care.&nbsp; We have started the process of looking for a new Executive Director who will drive this mission and kaupapa at DINZ.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.seek.co.nz/job/51507981">Learn more about the Executive Director role opportunity</a></p>



<p>I would also like to formally welcome our new <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council members</a> who joined in with our first meeting of the year on the 28th January.&nbsp; Welcome and we look forward to your wisdom and guidance on the Executive Council.</p>



  Sat Mandri, JNCTN  John Evans, TSB  Russell Craig, Microsoft NZ  Luke McIntyre, MATTR  



<p>In the Government seat on the Executive Council, the DIA will continue to represent the government and we are pleased to welcome Alan Bell replacing Tony Eyles as the government representative.<br><br>We look forward to engaging with you throughout 2021 as we shape a new future for digital identity in Aotearoa New Zealand.<br><br>He mihi mutunga kore</p>

<p>February 9,&nbsp;2021</p><p><a href="https://ufa.worldbank.org/">1.7 billion</a> adults and millions of organizations do not have access to essential financial services; billions more have bank accounts but are unable to use them. Despite initiatives such as the <a href="https://ufa.worldbank.org/">World Bank’s Universal Financial Access program</a> and governmental and industry encouragement, many remain underserved or entirely excluded from the global financial system. For many, the basic societal need to hold monetary value securely, transact for necessities, and transfer money to friends and family is still out of&nbsp;reach.</p> Regulatory Compliance Is an Enabler for Innovation in&nbsp;Fintech <p>Thankfully, financial services continue to evolve rapidly, providing new avenues for people and organizations to engage in essential services. Alternative financial technologies (fintech) are bursting into the marketplace, offering innovative products and services to banking participants through direct, smartphone-based, non-traditional channels. The digitization of monetary exchange has also experienced explosive growth, often proving to be faster, more convenient, more privacy-respecting, and more secure than physical transactions.</p><p>These trends expand the risk and compliance challenges of money transmission beyond traditional banks to startups, enterprises, and nonprofits/NGOs, which are typically unfamiliar with regulatory scrutiny or essential compliance controls. Global regulators are currently monitoring this transition and looking to ensure existing regulations apply to new fintech players. This transition includes virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and other non-bank financial institutions which act as a conduit for the financially excluded and underserved or those otherwise considered ‘high-perceived-compliance risk.’</p> Financial Inclusion Needs Identity for&nbsp;All <p>According to the World Bank’s ID4D, “<a href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/953621531854471275/pdf/Global-ID-Coverage-Barriers-and-Use-by-the-Numbers-Insights-from-the-ID4D-Findex-Survey.pdf">People with an ID are more likely to own bank accounts and mobile phones, and financial and mobile services are among the most frequently reported uses of one’s&nbsp;ID</a>.”</p><p>Identity verification is at the core of essential financial regulations of Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT). Financial governance leaders are recalibrating their requirements to keep up with the pace of innovation to ensure that bad actors do not exploit the financial system and that intermediaries of all types have adequate financial crime compliance (FCC) programs in&nbsp;place.</p><p>The fundamental right for individuals to participate in society no matter their origins or circumstance has long been at the core of the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>’s vision. The Foundation promotes control of one’s own identity to utilize digitally stored credentials to access and engage daily services. While decentralized identity has been a barrier in traditional banking, fintech and regtech have introduced the constructs to leverage digital and self-sovereign identity to drive financial inclusion for tens of millions of outliers.</p><p>Indeed, these new technologies provide great promise in modernizing finance, payments, and identity management in tandem. But related regulatory compliance is in equal need of modernization. Traditional legal compliance relies on legacy banking infrastructure. Its growth has forced the sector into a false binary choice: provide incentives for universal access or protect financial system integrity with exclusionary compliance controls. This choice has disproportionately impacted those who are in most need of essential financial services, such as low- or moderate-income families, and access to vital services, such as international remittances. The Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the importance of such entry to small businesses reliant on support and financially underserved or excluded households looking for&nbsp;relief.</p> Innovation in Governance, Compliance, and Regulation <p>Since 2019, Sovrin has hosted the Compliance and Payments Task Force (CPTF), an open group of traditional bank and non-bank financial institutions, regulators, policymakers, technologists, ethicists, and legal experts. The CPTF has developed and promoted the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SswHBZ1pwuIUcePeFe8czOoAOaHE78ij4okXuQq5OW0/edit">Rulebook</a>, an innovative best practices framework that extends traditional banking compliance and payments guidance to emerging fintech and VASP processes.</p><p>The Rulebook serves to ensure essential global banking compliance while accommodating fintech’s seamless experience and smooth flow of funds for members and reinforcing the application and intersection with traditional banking rails. The Rulebook defines technical standards for end-to-end transaction flows and service-level agreements between parties to reflect the operational realities of an increasingly decentralized and cross-border financial system.</p><p>As part and parcel of regulatory compliance to expand the operational focus of the CPTF to serve the Identity for All mission and advance inclusion, the Group has reimagined into the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0EAHbtr2GFDoK7_WlbrOJO1p8rUv9HrKCFBsPdnaUo/edit">Compliance and Inclusive Finance Working Group (CIFWG)</a>. The CIFWG builds on the tactical efforts of the CPTF, with a robust and ambitious mandate: promoting financial inclusion as a critical enabler. CIFWG will monitor the challenges faced by the financially excluded and underserved, focusing on how economic and regulatory technologies, supported by self-sovereign identity (SSI), can bridge the gap between traditional banking compliance and the associative risks injected by innovation.</p><p>With the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SswHBZ1pwuIUcePeFe8czOoAOaHE78ij4okXuQq5OW0/edit">Rulebook</a> as an anchor framework, the Group will facilitate the advancement of financial inclusion and a modernized application of established global banking requirements and the attendant and necessary FCC protocols. CIFWG is also engaging with other international organizations, initiatives, and regulatory-led groups that advance financial inclusion and modern regulatory compliance solutions. Its ultimate goal is to promote access to traditional and non-traditional financial services and highlight the resulting benefits of building economic resilience and prosperity.</p><p>CIFWG believes that SSI is a powerful enabler for security, compliance, and inclusion&nbsp;. “Our bedrock approach recognizes that any institution today can be a financial services provider; our job is enabling their full participation in the global banking system,” says Amit Sharma, CIFWG Chair. “Digital finance is not new, although the cryptographic creation and representation of value show promising applications to democratize finance truly. Innovative and modern FCC approaches must meet market innovation. We encourage all who are interested in joining us in the CIFWG to help facilitate a pathway to a more sustainable economic future for&nbsp;all.”</p><p>For more details about the Working Group and instructions on how to join, please see the Compliance and Inclusive Finance <a href="https://sovrin.org/inclusive-finance/">webpage</a> or contact <a href="mailto:cifwg@sovrin.org">cifwg@sovrin.org</a>.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://sovrin.org/promoting-banking-for-all-announcing-the-compliance-inclusive-finance-working-group-cifwg/">https://sovrin.org</a> on February 9,&nbsp;2021.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>At Equifax, I work with governments across Canada to help them utilize data, insights and analytics to make policy decisions more data driven. We also have fraud and authentication solutions that tend to work well for government departments administering social assistance programs. We are a member of DIACC and I am a Co-Chair of the Outreach Committee this year. We’re focused on getting lots of identity content out, on topics that might need more explaining like facial recognition technology, for example. It gets me out of bed in the morning because I enjoy the people I am working with and these are problems I really enjoy solving.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>That is a long story. My Dad was (and still is) the Mayor of the small town I grew up in, so I quite literally grew up in politics. In university, my desire to understand how governments worked was strong so I started doing internships. I got hired at Queen’s Park as my first job out of university and ended up in the Ministry of Finance. That led me to the financial services sector where I first got introduced to the world of identity and authentication as more transactions started happening online.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>My degree is in Environmental Policy so I always felt like I didn’t belong in financial services or technology. The most important lesson I have learned along the way is that hard work and a strong willingness to learn and execute is just as important as credentials. Work hard, have a growth mindset, and don’t be intimidated.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START /STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>There are a lot of solutions out there today and the sector is evolving so fast. What we are starting to do really well and need to continue to do is collaborate. I have been part of many co-pitches now<br>
and it is really fun.</p>
<p>What we need to start to focus on more is how do we better reach the general public and build trust? That’s not any one person or organization’s role, but it is a focus of the DIACC outreach committee because we believe that education will help adoption.</p>
<p>Communication is so important, and one thing I think we should stop doing is speaking too technically about product benefits and features. Let’s talk instead about values and solving customers problems. Identity solves so many customer problems and it will help people and organizations connect the dots.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>We need different perspectives around the table in order to make informed decisions.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>I recently read The Choice by Dr. Edith Eva Edger. She is a psychologist and one of the last remaining Holocaust survivors. It is one of those life changing books. Although the book is about struggle and suffering, it is an inspiration.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Don’t limit yourself to things that you know, accept failure as part of the skill development process.</p>

 Good Health Pass: A New Cross-Sector Initiative to Restore Global Travel and Restart the Global&nbsp;Economy <p>Today, <a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020</a> announced the launch of the <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> along with more than 25 leading individual companies and organizations in the technology, health, and travel sectors — including the Airports Council International (ACI), Commons Project Foundation, COVID-19 Credentials Initiative, Evernym, Hyperledger, IBM, International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Linux Foundation Public Health, Lumedic, Mastercard, Trust Over IP Foundation, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative is an open, inclusive, cross-sector initiative to create a blueprint for interoperable digital health pass systems that will help restore global travel and restart the global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every segment of the global economy, but none as profoundly as<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/industries-most-and-least-impacted-by-covid19-from-a-probability-of-default-perspective-september-2020-update"> travel and tourism</a>. Last year, airlines lost an estimated<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-11-24-01/"> $118.5 billion USD</a> with related impacts across the economy in excess of <a href="https://www.unwto.org/impact-assessment-of-the-covid-19-outbreak-on-international-tourism">$2 trillion&nbsp;USD</a>.</p><p>In conjunction with the announcement, the Collaborative also released its first white paper, entitled, <a href="https://goodhealthpass.org/good_health_pass-a_safe_path_to_global_reopening">Good Health Pass: A Safe Path to Global Reopening</a>.</p> Collaboration Among a New Ecosystem of&nbsp;Players <blockquote>“There’s one thing the world agrees on — we need to address the health concerns today to support a return to normalcy,” said Ajay Bhalla, President of Cyber &amp; Intelligence at Mastercard. “Delivering a global, interoperable health pass system can only happen if we come together in a way that meets the needs of everyone involved. This Collaborative will be critical in helping to define how we connect the pieces that will bring travel back safely, spark job creation and jumpstart the world’s economic&nbsp;engine.”</blockquote><p>Various efforts are currently underway to develop digital health credentials systems — both vaccination and test certificates — for international travel. Yet, despite this race to market, it is unlikely that a single solution will be implemented universally — or even across the entire travel industry. Thus, it is critical that solutions are designed from the onset to be interoperable — both with one another and across institutional and geographic borders.</p><p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative is not intended to supplant existing efforts but rather to help weave them together, fill gaps where they may exist, and facilitate collaboration among a new ecosystem of stakeholders, many of whom have never worked together&nbsp;before.</p><blockquote>“Fragmentation is a risk we simply cannot ignore,” said ID2020 Executive Director Dakota Gruener. “To be valuable to users, credentials need to be accepted at check-in, upon arrival by border control agencies, and more. We can get there — even with multiple systems — as long as solutions adhere to open standards and participate in a common governance framework. But without these, fragmentation is inevitable, and travelers — and the economy — will continue to suffer needlessly as a&nbsp;result.”</blockquote> Global Travel &amp; Digital Health Credentials <p>COVID-19 test results are already required for entry at some airports and at international borders. But existing paper-based certificates are easy to lose, unnecessarily expose sensitive personal information, and are prone to fraud and counterfeiting.</p><p>By contrast, digital health credentials can be printed (e.g., as a QR code) or stored on an individual’s mobile phone. They enhance user privacy and “bind” an individual’s identity to their test result or vaccination certificate, thus enabling real-time, fraud-resistant digital verification.</p><blockquote>“Our health data consists of the most sensitive personal information, deserving of the strongest privacy,” said Dr. Ann Cavoukian, Executive Director of the Global Privacy &amp; Security By Design Centre. “Release of our health data must be under our personal control. The Good Health Pass does just that: With Privacy by Design embedded throughout, you control the release of your digital health data, and to whom; all de-identified and decentralized. Privacy and functionality: Win/Win!”</blockquote><p>The World Health Organization recently convened the Smart Vaccination Certificate Consortium to establish standards for vaccination certificates, but no analogous effort currently exists for test certificates. Given that it is expected to take years for vaccines to be universally available globally, widespread testing will remain an essential public health tool — and one that must continue alongside vaccination to ensure a safe and equitable return to public&nbsp;life.</p><p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative has defined four primary requirements that digital health credential systems for international travel must&nbsp;satisfy:</p>  Cross-border: Solutions must work at airports, airlines, ports-of-call, and borders worldwide and comply with international and local regulations.  Cross-industry: Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors.  Secure &amp; privacy-protecting: Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors. Solutions must comply with all relevant security, privacy, and data protection regulations and must be able to bind the presenter of the credential to the credential itself at the required level of assurance.  Frictionless: Solutions must seamlessly integrate into testing and travel processes, thus enhancing and streamlining the experience for individuals and airlines alike. Solutions must not add new material costs for travelers. Optimally, validation processes will be contactless to maintain or enhance&nbsp;hygiene.  <p>The Collaborative welcomes the participation of policymakers and representatives of government agencies; companies in the health, technology, and travel sectors; and civil society organizations who share a commitment to safely restoring international travel and economic activity while simultaneously ensuring that equity, privacy, and other civil liberties are protected.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more, please visit the Good Health Pass website at <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">goodhealthpass.org</a>.</p> Endorsing Organizations   Affinidi  Airport Council International (ACI)  Airside  analizA  AOKpass  Bindle Systems  BLOK Solutions  CLEAR  The Commons Project Foundation  Covid Credential Initiative (CCI)  Daon  Everynym  Global Privacy &amp; Security by Design&nbsp;Centre  Grameen Foundation  Hyperledger  IBM  idRamp  International Chamber of Commerce&nbsp;(ICC)  iProov  Linux Foundation Public&nbsp;Health  Lumedic  Mastercard  MIT SafePaths  National Aviation Services&nbsp;(NAS)  Panta  PathCheck Foundation  Prescryptive Health  SITA  STChealth  Trust Over IP Foundation  ZAKA   <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/good-health-pass-a-new-cross-sector-initiative-to-restore-global-travel-and-restart-the-global-8b59eb1050a0">Good Health Pass: A New Cross-Sector Initiative to Restore Global Travel and Restart the Global…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Team FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The second and final day of the Identity, Authentication and the Road Ahead: Virtual Policy Forum event on Feb. 5 brought together government officials, tech experts and policy advocates in a packed agenda.</p>



<p>The two-day event was hosted by the FIDO Alliance together with the Better Identity Coalition and the ID Theft Resource Center (ITRC) and had over 1,000 registered attendees. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/identity-authentication-and-the-road-ahead-virtual-policy-forum-day-1/">first day</a> of the event saw sessions that outlined the clear and present need for the government and industry to make identity and strong authentication systems more pervasive, to help protect and serve individuals and businesses alike. The second day in contrast had a strong focus on the need for strong authentication and was highlighted by an expert panel that explained how FIDO authentication was able to help secure the 2020 U.S. election.</p>



<p>The day’s event kicked off with a keynote from Congressman John Katko (R-NY) who emphasized the critical need for secure digital identity.</p>



  



<p>“Our homeland security, national security, economic security and way of life are threatened in unprecedented ways by highly sophisticated adversaries and simply being vigilant is no longer enough,” Katko (pictured) said. “Today’s threat environment demands a posture of unwavering resilience. This is particularly true for ensuring the sanctity and resilience of our digital identities.” </p>



<p>How FIDO Helped to Secure the 2020 Election</p>



<p>The resilience of digital identity and strong authentication was called into question during the 2016 election cycle when hackers were able to infiltrate the email accounts of Democratic party staffers, notably the attack of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s gmail account.</p>



  



<p>The same type of event didn’t re-occur during the 2020 election cycle, in part thanks to FIDO standards and a concerted effort to make sure that both Democratic and Republican party officials had access to strong authentication. In a panel during the event, Michael Kaiser, President and CEO of <a href="https://www.defendcampaigns.org/">Defending Digital Campaigns</a> (pictured) explained that his organization was created to help solve the challenge of political campaigns not having the right cybersecurity resources to defend themselves. As companies cannot directly donate to campaigns, Defending Digital Campaigns was formed to act as an intermediary, that enables political campaigns to get cybersecurity services including FIDO based strong authentication resources, for free or low cost. </p>



<p>Kaiser explained that political campaigns are not like a typical organization in that they are short lived and don’t have long term thinking about a security maturity model. Despite that, political campaigns need to be protected as they sit on incredibly valuable and important information.</p>



<p>“I think we gave away more than 10,000 security keys in the political sector in the 2020 cycle,” Kaiser said. “That’s a lot of people and a lot of accounts as we gave away more than $1 million worth of products to 183 campaigns.”</p>



  



<p>Bob Lord (pictured), chief security officer of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) noted that after the events of the 2016 election, security was clearly under the microscope. </p>



<p>“Security is a real challenge and everybody really understands the importance of it, but the dollar figures really can get in the way,” Lord said. “Making sure that there was a reliable source for things like security keys was really instrumental in moving forward.”</p>



<p>Within the DNC and across campaigns, Lord and his team strictly implemented the use of FIDO based security keys to provide strong authentication capabilities and limit the risk of potential phishing attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Today 100% of the people at the DNC who need to get access to their email and&nbsp; access to their documents, they’re all using security keys – no exceptions, no executive privilege to opt out of this,” Lord said.</p>



<p>The DNC also benefited from Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP) which provides additional levels of protection and assurance beyond what a basic gmail account enables.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re big supporters and real big believers in the combination of FIDO security keys and the APP,” Lord said.</p>



<p>Why DNC Believes in FIDO</p>



<p>Lord noted that there are a number of reasons why he is a big supporter of FIDO standards. For one is the fact that FIDO standards are built into the Google Chrome browser. Lord explained that the DNC was pushing the use of Chromebooks to campaigns and the integrated FIDO capabilities made it easier to deploy strong authentication.</p>



<p>While there are multiple types of two-factor authentication available in the market, for Lord there are really only two categories.</p>



<p>“I think there are really two kinds of multi-factor that are available in the consumer space – I think there are FIDO security keys and then there’s everything else,” Lord stated emphatically. “When I refer to everything else, I refer to those other multi-factors systems as legacy and I do that because I want people to get the mental model that this is something to be contained, minimized and eventually moved out.”</p>



<p>Lord observed that other multi-factor approaches, while better than not using multi-factor at all, have shown weaknesses, which is why in his view as an industry it’s important to really be pushing people pretty aggressively to move down the path of FIDO strong authentication adoption.</p>



<p>While Lord is an advocate for adopting FIDO based strong authentication with security keys, he also noted that there were some usability challenges his team had to work through as well training that was needed to educate and onboard users. The learning from the DNC’s efforts are all now being publicly shared by Lord’s team at<a href="https://democrats.org/security/"> https://democrats.org/security/</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s a non-partisan thing so there’s nothing red or blue about these best practices, but you’ll see in there that we really push pretty hard on security keys and the APP in particular,” he said.</p>



  



<p>Mark Risher, Senior Director of Security and Identity at Google (pictured) emphasized during the panel that in general adding a second factor does still objectively decrease the chances of a user becoming the victim of a phishing attack. That said, he noted that for an attacker, phishing a password, or just phishing a password plus a One Time Password (OTP) PIN code basically just&nbsp; requires basically one more line of code for an attacker. </p>



<p>“It does not require the funding of the nation state,” Rischer said about the ability to bypass OTP for phishing attacks. “So we need to get the world to understand the distinction, and to move into and start requiring these much more stringent hardware based strong authentication technologies and standards.”</p>



<p>How FIDO is Moving Forward to Enable Digital Transformation</p>



<p>The afternoon keynote at the event was delivered by Andrew Shikiar (pictured) the Executive Director of the FIDO Alliance. Shikiar noted that passwordless authentication is an important cornerstone for digital transformation.</p>



  



<p>“The security and authentication aspects of digital transformation came to the fore as everything was accelerated due to the pandemic,” Shikiar said. </p>



<p>Shikiar noted that social engineering had kind of a renaissance in 2020 as phishing continued to be successful.</p>



<p>“Simply put, the only way to break this cycle is to eliminate our dependence on server side credentials and password,” Shikiar said. “Anything on a server can and will eventually be stolen so they’re easy to phish, harvest and replay.”</p>



<p>The need to create stronger authentication is why FIDO was born. Shikiar explained that the FIDO Alliance’s mission is to create open standards for simpler, stronger authentication with public key cryptography and asymmetric public key cryptography, which is something that the average consumer should never have to pronounce, let alone know what it means.</p>



<p>Shikiar also outlined some of the FIDO Alliance’s highlights from 2020 including Apple joining the group. He added that Apple joining served as a powerful signal to the industry that really everyone is coalescing around the FIDO Alliance as the organization to collaborate on the standards based user friendly and strong authentication. Another key highlight from 2020 for FIDO was the level of support across operating system and browser combinations with different transport mechanisms for the authenticator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Over 4 billion devices can support FIDO authentication,” Shikiar said. “So in short, you know, we think FIDO is becoming part of the DNA of the web itself, which is a pretty audacious thing.”</p>



<p>“To summarize, FIDO is very much the present and the future of user authentication.”</p>



<p>The Solarwind #Solorigate Attack as an Identity Authentication Issue</p>



<p>A key topic that resonated throughout the second day of the policy forum was the impact of the recent Solarwinds attack which is also commonly referred to as Solorigate.</p>



<p>During a panel about what policies the Biden Administration should consider with regards to Identity, John Miller Senior Vice President of Policy and Senior Counsel at ITI, commented that the Solarwinds attack has been accurately described as a software supply chain attack but it really is also fairly characterized as an identity attack.</p>



  



<p>“Characterizing Solarwinds as an identity attack presents an opportunity to remind policy makers of how fundamental identity is to not only what we’re doing online as consumers but to, but an enterprise environment,” Miller said. </p>



<p>In the final keynote of the event, Alex Weinert (pictured) Partner Director of Identity Security, at Microsoft, outlined the gory authentication and identity details behind the Solorigate incident and why zero trust principles would help to mitigate many risks.</p>



<p>Weinert noted that the Solorigate attack was a fundamental attack on trust. He also emphasized the clear role that authentication played in the attacks and the need to move to strong authentication.</p>



<p>“What are we doing to encourage explicitly verifiable credentials, we all know passwords are crap, we know they’re incredibly vulnerable,” Weinert said. “Are we doing enough as an industry to push for the end of passwords?”</p>



<p>Today’s sessions (February 5) have been recorded and will be available soon.</p>

<p>MADISON, Wis., and WASHINGTON 02/04/21 – CUNA announced today a transfer of Credit Union Financial Exchange (CUFX) to CULedger.</p>
<p>“CUFX is the result of a grass-roots initiative,” said Chris Seneda, past CUNA Technology Council chair, CUFX steering committee member, and executive vice president and chief operations officer at Virginia CU. “It started with senior IT credit union executives who recognized a need for credit unions as they were trying to get their different systems to work together. The CUNA Technology Council leadership was instrumental in helping to get CUFX off the ground and continued to provide resources as it progressed into its position today. With the transition to CULedger, CUFX will get added support and continue to work with its users and CUNA Technology Council volunteers to assist with future improvements.”</p>
<p>CUFX continues to thrive and meet the necessities of its credit union users. The latest update, which went live this past fall, included the advancement to support non-unique account ID architectures. This newest advancement was driven and reviewed by three core system providers currently implementing CUFX.</p>
<p>“Since its inception, CUFX has been evolving to meet the needs of credit unions,” said David Rohn, vice president of CUNA Councils.</p>
<p>With its transition to CULedger and continued connection to credit union technology experts, we’re confident that this solution will continue to evolve, expand and assist credit unions.”</p>
<p>CULedger delivers a trusted peer-to-peer services network of verifiable exchange for financial cooperatives. Its solutions include MemberPass, a digital ID held by credit union members that protects credit unions and their members from identity theft and fraud in all banking interactions.</p>
<p>“CULedger is proud to incorporate CUFX into our product offerings for credit unions,” said John Ainsworth, President, and CEO of CULedger. “This solution is already being utilized with other solutions within our portfolio, so we understand its value and support its continued advancements.”</p>
<p>###</p>

 About the Lissi&nbsp;wallet <p>The Lissi wallet is a simple but powerful tool to manage digital interactions. It can be used to establish connections to third parties and to exchange information. You can find a more detailed explanation <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/introducing-the-lissi-mobile-wallet-b2af9bccaf03">here</a> or on <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">our website</a>. It’s currently available as an open beta version for <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">iOS</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta">Android</a>.</p> The importance of multi language&nbsp;support <p>Within the identity community, we spend considerable time to ensure interoperability between different solutions. We engage in conversations in a variety of standardization bodies to enable a seamless user experience on a global scale. Frankly speaking, we are not there just yet. But we are on a good way to enable access to the services regardless of where an entity is based or which social background an individual has. While regulation as well as technical and educational hurdles remain, it’s crucial to increase the accessibility of products to different cultures and languages.</p><p>We have already received feedback from multiple stakeholders from the public and private sector saying that multi-language support is essential for the execution of various use cases. There are several nations, which have multiple official languages. If our end-user facing products are not available in the most common languages, it creates entry barriers so big that not even a piloting of these use cases would make sense. Hence, we took note and worked hard to ensure the Lissi wallet is available in the languages of communities, which currently explore the self-sovereign identity&nbsp;concept.</p><p>The Lissi wallet now supports the following languages:</p>  Arabic  English  French  German  Italian  Korean  Polish  Portuguese  Russian  Romanian  Spanish, and  Turkish.   Challenges remain <p>When designing a wallet, the language is only a small part of the whole user experience. The task is to design a universal cockpit, which people can navigate regardless of their social background. Similar to a dashboard in a car, which doesn’t look too different wherever you go. In order to achieve this, we have to standardize the icons, colours and user-flows to a certain degree. However, on the other hand, they need to be adjusted to the target audience. Let’s take the colour red as an example. In western cultures, red is associated with excitement, danger, urgency and love, whereas the same colour evokes danger and caution in the middle-east. In India, it’s associated with purity, while in China it symbolizes luck and happiness. Finding the right balance between standardization and necessary adjustments for the target audience will require knowledge about the cultural differences, feedback and time. When it comes to language it creates its own set of difficulties. Differences can be observed in the usage of genders, the left-to-right or right-to-left reading, the information density or the usage of tenses, just to name a few. Furthermore, there isn’t a common terminology used within the community, which makes a translation into different languages even more challenging.</p><p>Hence, our translation won’t be perfect. While we worked with native speakers, the context is often difficult to explain without demonstrating the user-flow and an actual use-case. Languages also change depending on the use-case or the subject in question. Nevertheless, we are looking forward to making the Lissi wallet even more accessible by adding additional languages and improving our current translation with your feedback. What language would you like to have us support next? We are always looking for translators for additional languages, so reach out to us to get our winter 2021 edition of Lissi Merchandise!</p><p>Cheers. The Lissi&nbsp;team.</p>

<p>Team FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The intersection of identity and authentication and how it can help to improve business as well as people’s lives was a core topic of conversation on the first day of the Identity, Authentication and the Road Ahead: Virtual Policy Forum event on Feb. 4.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance joined together with Better Identity Coalition and the ID Theft Resource Center (ITRC)&nbsp; to host the two day event running on Feb. 4-5, which has over 1,000 registered attendees who are gathering to learn more and discuss the current and future state of identity and authentication. The first day of the event had a strong focus on things the U.S. can and is doing to help improve the state identity, while recognizing the many challenges on the road ahead.</p>



<p>Identity is a National Security Issue</p>



  



<p>In the opening keynote, Michael Mosier (pictured), Deputy Director &amp; Digital Innovation Officer at the U.S. Treasury departments Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/">FinCEN</a>), outlined what’s at stake when it comes to digital identity. </p>



<p>“I view identity as a national security issue, and it will take the intellectual power and creativity of all of us to figure out how to secure identities and keep people from harm,”&nbsp; Mosier said.</p>



<p>Mosier emphasized that digital identity solutions are a key factor to help prevent fraud and financial crime. He added that in order to get payments right, there is a clear need to first get identities done right. The right way in his view, is an approach that preserves privacy while ensuring integrity in the system.</p>



<p>“The ability to detect and address risks is only as good as the ability to determine with whom you’re engaging,” Mosier said. “So the real question for identity related risk is, do you have the information necessary to reliably assess the risk of your counterpart or your customer.”</p>



<p>A key challenge FinCen is seeing is at the account opening stage, with identity proofing and verification. A July 2020 advisory from FinCen highlighted the issue reporting that criminals are undermining identity verification processes, through identity theft and synthetic identity fraud.</p>



<p>“We’re seeing a lot of identity authentication compromise, leading to account takeovers, as&nbsp; a lack of multifactor and multi step authentication is too prevalent across the financial sector,” Mosier said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The costs of those takeovers is far from trivial. FinCEN is seeing around 5,000 account takeover reports each month, reaching approximately $400 million per month over the last two months.</p>



<p>“The bottom line is that many account takeovers and fraud are occurring because of failures to enforce stronger levels of assurance and identity verification in authentication processes,” Mosier said.</p>



<p>Phishing is Top Source of Identity Theft and Cybercrime</p>



  



<p>The Identity Theft Resource Center (<a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">ITRC</a>) is seeing the same trends as FinCEN with phishing and credential theft being the leading source of identity theft, according to the groups recent release 2020 Data Breach Report. In a keynote session, Eva Velasquez, President and CEO and James Lee, Chief Operating Officer (pictured) of the&nbsp; ITRC outlined the high level findings of the report and its impact. </p>



<p>“Credentials are the coin of the realm today, as opposed to what we have traditionally thought of as being the kind of information that threat actors wanted to collect.” Lee said.</p>



<p>While other failures and vulnerabilities including unpatched software can and do lead to data breaches, Lee emphasized that the majority of the root causes of cyberattacks rely primarily on user logins and passwords</p>



<p>How the Pandemic has Accelerated the Need for Strong Authentication</p>



<p>With tens of millions of Americans looking to the U.S. government for help during the pandemic, there has been a clear need for strong authentication and identity technology.</p>



<p>During a panel, Sanjay Gupta, chief technology officer for the US Small Business Administration (SBA) noted that the SBA has been able to ramp up during the pandemic thanks in part to the deployment of a strong authentication based single sign on technology that makes use of FIDO Alliance standards. The SBA uses the <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> platform from the U.S Government’s General Service Administration (GSA).</p>



  



<p>In a keynote session, Congressman Bill Foster (D-IL) (pictured) stated that the COVID crisis has laid bare many of the inadequacies of the identity system in the U.S. </p>



<p>Just to pick one example, Foster noted that over a million stimulus checks were sent to dead people and for millions of others, the stimulus checks were delayed because of challenges in verifying who is eligible based on where they live. While there are challenges, Foster noted that there has also been a lot of relevant technological progress, independent of government action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The use of a secure enclave on a modern cell phone as a FIDO second factor device is a huge step forward,” Foster said.&nbsp; “The increasing use of privacy preserving biometric sensors on smartphones as a means of providing digital online authentication for human identity is going to be transformative.”</p>



  



<p>In a panel following the keynote on where the government can help with identity and authentication, Paul Rosenzweig, Resident Senior Fellow, Cybersecurity and Emerging Threat at the R Street Institute commented that good identity is clearly one of those common public goods that economic theory teaches us, is best provided at a governmental level. That’s an idea that panelist&nbsp;Phil Lam (pictured), Executive Director of Identity for the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) agreed with. </p>



<p>“I think that we as a government are providing a lot of benefits to Americans today and in order to facilitate providing that benefit, we kind of need to know who you are and&nbsp; are you eligible for a benefit,” Lam said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lam re-iterated that the FIDO-enabled <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> portal is a critical part of the U.S. government’s authentication strategy and now serves over 25 million users.</p>



  



<p>The final panel of the day tackled the socially important topic of equity and inclusion when it comes to identity and the individual. Among the panelists was Reverend Ben Roberts (pictured) who runs the ID Ministry, which is an effort to help the underprivileged get their identity so they can qualify for government assistance or even just to get a bank account. </p>



<p>Roberts detailed a number of heart-breaking cases of individuals that have had extreme challenges in getting some form of verified identity. He had a strong message for government policy makers and technology developers alike for how to enable strong authentication and identity systems.</p>



<p>“As we’re bringing things online and as new policies and new systems come into play, really do your level best to ensure that people are not getting left behind,” Roberts said.</p>

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee and Atsuhiro Tscuhiya, APAC Market Development Team</p>



<p>The reason to put passwords in the rearview mirror is more evident than ever. Our recent survey on consumer behavior says that 58% of abandoned online purchases are due to the difficulty of managing passwords. The Gartner Group’s research indicates that 20-25% of all helpdesk calls are password reset requests. The World Economic Forum (WEF) assessed that cybercrime costs the global economy $2.9 million every minute; about 80% of the attacks targeted passwords.</p>



<p>But the tide is turning. During our inaugural Authenticate conference, which took place in November 2020, Microsoft announced that they now have more than 150 million people are using their passwordless sign-in each month. That is a 50% increase from last year’s report at Microsoft Ignite back in November 2019.</p>



<p>We have all seen how the global pandemic has drastically accelerated the willingness of and the need for organizations to embrace passwordless FIDO Authentication. It is now a matter of how and with whom, instead of when.</p>



<p>Updates from APAC Marketing Forum</p>



<p>We are happy to share meaningful progress since the first FIDO AllianceAsia Pacific Marketing Forum (AMF) in July.&nbsp;Here are some updates from our members across the region:</p>



<p>Taiwan</p>



<p>Mentioned in our previous post was&nbsp; the introduction of FIDO’s standards in official documents developed by Taiwan Association of Information and Communication Standards (TAICS) and SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) Taiwan, as well as FIDO’s logo on the app of Taiwan-Cathay United Bank.</p>



<p>Recently, the government of Taiwan has also adopted FIDO’s authentication method for the purpose of citizen’s tax filing, a government service that supports more than 200,000 users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>India</p>



<p>FIDO2 is now accepted by the CCA (Controller of Certifying Authorities), under India Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, as an alternative to SMS OTP.&nbsp; The guidelines have been published on the CCA website (<a href="http://cca.gov.in/eSignAPI.html">http://cca.gov.in/eSignAPI.html</a>).</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance member Singular Key’s FIDO Certified authentication service is being used by ReBIT, the cybersecurity subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India.</p>



<p>Additionally, a whitepaper on FIDO authentication for banking space has recently been submitted to ReBIT. Webinars designed to educate the public on FIDO’s standards are also in the works. These efforts will no doubt help to drive up FIDO awareness amongst the India population.</p>



<p>Hong Kong</p>



<p>In Hong Kong, the passion for horse racing continued even as people stayed home and betting branches closed because of the global pandemic.</p>



<p>For the first time ever, the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) kicked off the horse racing season with all-digital betting. Punters had to log on to HKJC’s mobile betting app, provided by FIDO Alliance member Tradelink.</p>



<p>The betting channels, which are secured by FIDO via biometric authentication on users’ mobile devices, provided a user-friendly and safe experience that helped to secure a record HK$1.376 billion turnover – 6.83% higher than the previous record set in the 2017/2018 season! This was made possible, despite the record low number of attendees at the races in year 2020.</p>



<p>Separately, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government rolled out a new initiative powered by Tradelink’s FIDO Certified authentication – the “iAM Smart” initiative, which enables Hong Kong citizens to authenticate their identities using mobile devices for access to financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Malaysia</p>



<p>There is a clear transition towards a passwordless future in Malaysia.</p>



<p>The FIDO Certified authentication service from SecureMetric is recently being adopted by a number of public services in the country as part of the government’s Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024. This means that FIDO authentication will play a role in services such as Malaysia Central Bank’s (Bank Negara) Electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC), the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) National Technology as well as Innovation Sandbox (NTIS) from the Ministry of Science.</p>



<p>Vietnam</p>



<p>In Vietnam, the shift away from passwords is accelerating. Currently, there are 32 licensed e-Wallet providers all vying to lead the charge to facilitate the country’s shift to a more cashless society. There is also a major focus on smart city, digital signatures and electronic ID developments.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, FIDO member VinCSS became the first company in the country to develop FIDO2 Certified authenticators. Since then, it has met the FIDO2 standard for the second time, announcing its achievement of FIDO2 Certification for its strong authentication server named VinCSS FIDO2 Server.</p>



<p>This achievement also means VinCSS is currently one of only 13 companies globally with a FIDO2 certified server that can accept any FIDO certified authenticator, irrespective of its manufacturer – an amazing feat!</p>



<p>Other Notable Updates in Asia</p>



<p>Additionally, Japan-based telecommunications operator KDDI recently deployed FIDO2 for its “au ID” and started FIDO authentication service. Instant messaging app LINE, introduced biometric authentication that utilizes FIDO standards for iPad users, eliminating the need to key in passwords. The FIDO Japan Working Group Chair was invited as an expert by the Japan Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication on their discussions using My Number Card capabilities on smartphones.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in Korea, the Blue House, the executive office and official residence of the president of the Republic of Korea, deployed TrustKey’s login solution powered by FIDO’s standards for remote work and internal security access.</p>



<p>—</p>

<p>The 3Box Labs team will be back to EthDenver this year, though a lot is different this time around. EthDenver is virtual for 2021, of course, but our team will be manning the digital booth and roaming the virtual halls to meet and mentor hackers. We love this community and can't wait to see you and your projects, whether that's in the Sports Castle or GamerJibe.</p><p>The tech we have for hackers has changed too. Last year at EthDenver, our CTO Joel huddled in a corner of the castle to build the first POC of <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>. Almost exactly a year later, Ceramic Network has just <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">moved into beta on a live testnet</a>. <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a>, the open identity protocol built on Ceramic, is also in beta and ready for use. And 3Box is now <a href="http://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a>, with our full focus on <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/p/6c8da552-3900-472e-ad68-ded95ce3cbe0/">bringing these protocols</a> to builders across Web3.</p><p>Ceramic and IDX offer a massive improvement on previous 3Box products, and EthDenver hackers are the first to get a crack at the beta versions. To celebrate, we've got lots of content, tons of ideas, and nearly $10,000 in bounties up for grabs.</p> Workshops and Talks <p>We'll be all over the virtual stage over the next week talking about decentralized identity and data. (Add to your calendar from the <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/schedule">full schedule</a>).</p><p>Workshop: Using open identity with IDX <br>Saturday 2/6 at 9am MST/5pm CET</p><p>Tech Talk: Standards for encrypted and mutable data on IPFS <br>Sunday 2/7 at 11am MST/7pm CET</p><p>Evolution of Decentralized Identity: A history<br>Thursday 2/11 at 4pm MST, 12am CET</p><p>Identity Legos Panel: The composable Web3 identity stack <br>Thursday 2/11 at 4:30pm MST/12:30am CET</p><p>We'll also be on stage during bounty presentations and opening ceremonies to share more about our prizes and products, and we'll have an informal office hours at 10:30am MT each of Monday-Thursday for hackers who want to drop by with questions.</p> 10,000 DAI in bounties <p>We've got a huge trove of bounties to celebrate the beta release of 2 protocols: <a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> is a peer-to-peer dataweb for publishing, linking, and querying verifiable information on the open web. <br><a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX (identity index)</a> is an open identity protocol built on Ceramic that makes it simple to store, use, and manage decentralized identities and data across any network, platform or application.</p><p>We've split the 10,000 DAI in rewards across 5 categories.</p>  Best overall use of IDX (identity index): 3000 DAI across 4 winners  Best overall use of Ceramic Network: 3000 DAI across 4 winners  Best new tools for Ceramic Network: 1500 DAI to 1 winner  Best use of Ceramic for social features: 750 DAI to 1 winner  Partner bounties: use Ceramic with Textile (1000 DAI) and with NEAR (1000 DAI) – or go for all 3 together!   <p>The <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/post/ceramic-network">full bounty details are here</a>. We'll be looking for submissions that tackle an original project idea, use Ceramic/IDX well and deeply, provide a wow-worthy demo, and contribute value to the Web3 ecosystem.</p> Hack ideas we'd love to see <p>If you are looking for a great idea or a good way to use Ceramic or IDX, here are a few things we know we'd love to see.</p> Use IDX to manage user identities and data <p>🧩Cross-chain profiles and identities</p><p>If your hack uses an L2 or non-Ethereum chain, make sure you aren't splitting users across multiple accounts. IDX lets you <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/default/#3id-keychain">link multiple keys</a> to the same identity and profile, from any chain!</p><p>⚙Backup and sync DeFi settings on IDX</p><p>In most apps and exchanges, user settings including watched addresses, tokens, currency preferences, and contact lists are stored in local storage. A new device, browser or even cleared cache means everything is gone. Storing these in a user's identity index assures backup, multi-device support, and reusability across applications!</p> Use Ceramic as an open and auditable content store <p>🐤Mirror of Crypto Twitter onto Ceramic Network</p><p>Our community <a href="https://twitter.com/StefanDGeorge/status/1347861734716035074">has put up $15,000</a> (so far) in donations for a tool that mirrors tweets onto Ceramic Network, paving the way for a new Web3-native social conversation without the need for a mass migration off Twitter. Get started towards this at EthDenver!</p><p>🎨Mutable metadata for NFTs</p><p>NFTs are unique, but do they have to be static? Mint NFTs with metadata stored on Ceramic and the owner of the Ceramic document can change the properties of the NFT over time. &nbsp;An artist could keep updating the NFT metadata after it's minted, creating a unique evolving piece.</p><p>📝DeFi Annotations and Comments</p><p>Create a commenting system with Ceramic that lets users add notes to contracts, addresses, trades or anything else in DeFi. Managed by users directly, these notes could be accessible across any DeFi app. This could be a javascript library for apps to integrate, or a browser extension for users to add themselves.</p><p>📤Auditable discussion forums</p><p>Use Ceramic documents to create discussion forums that are auditable, flexible and decentralized. Each user can post to their own Ceramic document, with each aggregated and referenced to create the full forum. No server needed, and easy paths to a censorship resistant foundation with moderation layered on.</p> Use with other dweb tools to open up new use cases <p>✉P2P chat or comments</p><p>Use IDX with <a href="https://github.com/textileio/js-threads">Textile's js-threads</a> or another messaging protocol to build fully P2P social features that authenticate directly with a user's key and identity. You could create an embedded support bot, a DeFi trollbox, team chat tools, a "decentralized disqus", or a notification service.</p><p>🗄Ceramic as a CMS for content on IPFS, Textile or anywhere else</p><p>Ceramic's mutable documents with persistent doc IDs makes it great for managing dynamic information that is stored on IPFS or elsewhere. Use Ceramic to catalogue, index or generally manage the data used in your hack., wherever it's stored. You can publish the definition (schema, etc) of data stored in Textile or other DBs to make private data discoverable and interoperable.</p> Create tooling for decentralized identity and data <p>🗺Ceramic document explorer</p><p>Create a way to visualize and explore the documents that exist on Ceramic. This could focus on the available <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/learn/glossary/#definition">definitions</a> that have ben created, all Ceramic documents, individual user identity indexes, or anything else. We'd love to see how you'd like to explore the network!</p><p>🖇New crypto or social account links</p><p>The 3Box Labs <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/identitylink-services">IdentityLink service</a> provides verifications for Discord, Twitter and Github. Add one for Telegram, Matrix, Discourse or a KYC provider.</p><p>Or add support for a new blockchain. Ceramic can currently be authenticated by Ethereum, Filecoin, EOS, NEAR or Cosmos keys. It's <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">simple to add support</a> for your preferred chain.</p><p>🚛Import of Web2 social data to use on Web3</p><p>Many large Web2 apps now have APIs to export user data (with users' permission). Build a mass-export tool that puts valuable data into users' hands by adding it to a their identity index. Create definitions for each export so it is easily discoverable and usable across Web3, and store the data encrypted in Ceramic, Textile or elsewhere.</p> Resources <p>To get started building, jump into our docs and tutorials! </p>  <a href="http://developers.ceramic.network">Ceramic Developer Documentation</a>  <a href="http://developers.idx.xyz">IDX Developer Documentation</a>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/tag/tutorials/">Tutorials on our blog</a>  Code for <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork">Ceramic</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-idx">IDX</a> on Github  <p>We'd love to hear from you as you build so please join us in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AgTqXZp">Ceramic Discord Community</a>.

 Tell us a little bit about you and your role in identity?&nbsp; 
<p>I’m responsible for Identity and Access Management at GRTgaz the leading gas distribution company in Europe. As a product owner. I lead 2 teams: one for digital identity, looking after passwords, access controls, all that sort of thing. The other team works on active directories – whether it’s on premise or in the cloud. In total, we have about 5,000 people working for the company. We’re a business to business seller so our customers then distribute gas to their own customers. The global conversation about optimizing use of energy is really important, so we have a lot of innovative projects on going as we work out how to tackle climate change and become more efficient.</p>
 How did you end up in the world of identity? 
<p>I studied at university at Telecom Sud Paris. There were only a few girls in my year as, at that time, cybersecurity didn’t attract many women. I am so happy to see more and more women working in this field. Since then I’ve always worked in cybersecurity. I started out assisting our cybersecurity officers with IAM, and then got super interested in the technical side of Azure AD and how SAML and OIDC work. So I dived in and got to grips with them so I could then simplify it to teach back to my non-technical colleagues!</p>
<blockquote><p>At work, the most important thing is the people, the culture and how everyone works together, rather than the technology that you’re using to build your organisation</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone I worked with had a contagious enthusiasm for IAM. So, 4 years later here I am! When I started out here, there were loads of smaller teams that specialised in different areas of IAM – from multi-factor authentication to customer support to architecture. &nbsp;Everyone had their own objectives so it was hard to break down the silos and work together. My role was to get everyone to cooperate in delivery in order to get the maximum value for our customers. Introducing self-service was super challenging as we had to change user behaviour stopping them from always contacting the Service Desk! When I was offered the opportunity to lead a team here, I thought “Why Not??!” There are always new challenges, whether it’s new protocols or technologies, to keep me interested and busy.</p>
 What does a normal week look like? 
<p>Working across two teams I have a good mix of work. A big part at the moment is the global strategy to migrate to cloud from our on-premise infrastructure so I’m working out how to adapt our current processes, documentation and environments. I also create a lot of training videos for users and colleagues to help them use our products more efficiently. It also helps business leaders make informed decisions when investing in IAM.</p>
 Why is Women in Identity important to you? 
<p>Women are as competent as men so it’s not really a question why women are important in this field. We think through details in different ways and can challenge assumed user needs. Women in Identity provides a great opportunity to gather many voices and listen to the diverse range of experiences that women have in the IT and identity space. It’s so important to support girls to get access to training in IT – it enables them to take advantage of opportunities they wouldn’t have otherwise.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you most recommend to readers? 
<p>Whenever I have a problem I read this book 1 more time – 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey. It really helps with personal development and being more efficient in everything you do, whether it’s work or relationships. It’s not just about relations with colleagues but also maximising your time in all elements of your daily life. At work, the most important thing is the people, the culture and how everyone works together, rather than the technology that you’re using to build your organisation. You’ve got to understand that to be successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 If you were CEO of a company, what one thing would you make compulsory? 
<p>Aside from making Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) compulsory and banning shared accounts (they’re super risky!) I’d make sure I didn’t introduce change until I was sure we had explored all the alternatives. I would rather introduce changes progressively to end users. Covey’s habit “Seek first to understand than to be understood” would be my mantra: e.g. WHY do teams use shared accounts so that before banning, an alternative could be suggested.</p>
 And where would we find you when you’re not working? 
<p>Paris is such a beautiful city. I feel very lucky to live . I love cooking (and eating ). When we are allowed to do so again, I can’t wait to chill with friends in the many great bars and restaurants here in Paris. We can literally try food from kitchens from all over the world.</p>

 Key takeaways <p>👍 &nbsp;Our mission stays the same<br>🚀 &nbsp;<a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> and <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> are the future<br>3️⃣ &nbsp;3Box SDK and plugins will be deprecated, but...<br>👍 &nbsp;<a href="https://3box.io/login">3Box profiles</a> will still work and will be migrated to IDX<br>🛠 &nbsp;We support Ceramic with development, tooling, and ecosystem building<br>⚡️ &nbsp;Currently using 3Box? <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/migrating-from-3box-to-ceramic-and-idx/">Learn how to migrate</a></p> Mission <p>The mission of <a href="https://3boxlabs.com">3Box</a> has always been to advance a more open and sustainable web by creating software that breaks down information silos and redefines relationships between users, apps, and data. </p><p>We believe that by giving users direct ownership over their digital identity, direct control over their personal data, and by liberating information from centralized database silos and putting it on the open internet, we can correct the asymmetric power structures of the current web and contribute to a more safe and equitable digital future for all. Experience has taught us that the most impactful way to advance this mission is by equipping developers with powerful tools that make it easy to build applications on this new paradigm.</p> Where we've been <p>Since early 2018, 3Box has been the leading provider of decentralized identity, user profiles, database storage and messaging capabilities for Ethereum applications. The flagship <a href="https://github.com/3box/3box-js">3Box SDK</a> has been used by 1,500+ projects including <a href="https://metamask.io">MetaMask</a>, <a href="https://gitcoin.co">Gitcoin</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.page">Snapshot</a>, <a href="https://rarible.com">Rarible</a>, <a href="https://gnosis.pm">Gnosis</a>, <a href="https://zerion.io">Zerion</a>, and countless others to create and manage 40,000+ decentralized identities and 200,000+ decentralized databases. Our products have helped make decentralized identity and dynamic application data an indispensable pillar of the Ethereum ecosystem.</p> Introducing, 3Box Labs <p>Today we're excited to announce that 3Box is evolving to become <a href="https://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a> in order to more effectively deliver on our mission. Moving forward we will be shifting all efforts to developing the <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> ecosystem and protocols built on top of it such as <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a>. Over the next few months, we will be sunsetting current 3Box products in favor of these new, more powerful alternatives.</p><a href="https://3boxlabs.com">  3Box Labs: Creators of Ceramic Network, IDX, 3Box.js  3Box Labs creates software that advances a more open, safe, and collaborative web. We’re hiring!      </a><p>Our evolution in brand and product focus does not mean that we're leaving the Ethereum ecosystem or that we're changing our mission. On the contrary, it enables us to improve our offerings, expand into new markets, further decentralize our technology, and dramatically scale our impact. With Ceramic and IDX, now all developers (not just ETH devs) get much more powerful and robust infrastructure that opens up a whole new set of use cases for decentralized identity and dynamic data management.</p> Evolving our approach <p>3Box was a simple, out-of-the-box solution to decentralized identity and data management. Our SDK bundled existing Web3 technologies such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, <a href="https://orbitdb.org/">OrbitDB</a>, and <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> into an opinionated, but developer-friendly API that worked with users' existing Ethereum wallets for authentication.</p><p>We always knew that abstracting existing solutions at the API layer and not solving the problem at the base protocol layer would have its inherent limitations. Over time these limitations became bottlenecks to growth, decentralization, flexibility, and performance:</p>  Performance: "Why are data syncing and load times slow?"  Persistence: "How can I guarantee my data stays available?"  Decentralization: "Why are identities stored on 3Box Inc. servers?"  Consensus: "How can we anchor identities and data on-chain?"  Multi-DID: "How can I use a different DID method?"  Multi-chain: "How can I authenticate with a non-Ethereum account?"  Multi-account: " How can I connect multiple accounts to my DID?"  Flexibility: "How can I use a different database provider?"  Customization: "How can I extend the API to do custom things?"   Moving to the Ceramic Network <p>To address the questions above and support many new capabilities, we realized we needed a completely new technology stack from the ground up. This 18-month journey led us to develop <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> and <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> to be a much more robust and flexible combination of protocols for decentralized identity and dynamic data management. </p> Ceramic: A decentralized network for mutable content <p><a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> is a public, permissionless, censorship-resistant network for managing mutable content on the open internet. By combining IPFS, libp2p, blockchain, DIDs, and authenticated data standards, Ceramic gives developers the ability to build completely serverless applications using dynamic, verifiable, decentralized data. </p><p>Ceramic functions like a global-scale, permissionless NoSQL document database, but guarantees data integrity and ensures strict ordering of document updates by anchoring these updates in a blockchain. Ceramic does not require DB servers or trusted third-parties to host data and perform mutations on content.

 IDX: A protocol for cross-chain decentralized identity <p><a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a cross-chain protocol and SDK for decentralized identity and interoperable user data. IDX allows developers to attach any kind of data to a user, discover all of a user's data in one place, and share data between applications. </p><p>Unlike 3Box which only offered OrbitDB storage and Ethereum-based authentication, IDX can be used with any kind of datastore such as Ceramic, Textile, OrbitDB, Filecoin, IPFS, Sia, Arweave, blockchain registries, or even centralized databases and supports authentication from any kind of Web3 wallet. </p><p>IDX is great for associating user profiles, portable social graphs, reputation scores, verifiable claims, user-generated content, application data, settings, domain names, blockchain addresses, and social Web2 accounts to a user in a decentralized way. </p><a href="https://idx.xyz">  IDX: Identity protocol for open applications  IDX is an open source multi-platform identity protocol that allows users to build up a unified digital identity and freely share their data between apps.      </a> Available on Testnet now <p>You don't have to wait to get started building on all of these new tools. Last week Ceramic officially <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">launched the Clay Testnet</a> and at the same time, IDX went into beta.</p><p>Mainnet will be progressively rolled out over the coming months, beginning with a soft launch for interested projects and then proceeding to a full public release some time after that. If you're interested in deploying your project on the Ceramic mainnet as part of the soft launch, <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">reach out on Discord</a>.</p> Supporting the Ceramic ecosystem <p>Ceramic and IDX are decentralized protocols which are independent from 3Box Labs. However 3Box Labs is committed to supporting the Ceramic ecosystem along three key pillars:</p>  Core protocol development  Standards, developer tooling, core applications  Ecosystem development   Core protocol development <p>3Box Labs develops and maintains the Ceramic <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">JavaScript implementation</a>. If you're interested in writing a client in a new language, reach out in the <a href="https://discord.gg/GXPrjW3qvF">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Standards, developer tooling, and core applications <p>The use cases for Ceramic are virtually endless. While this is a positive for the long-term prospects of the network, it is important that a few key use cases are built out early on so developers can immediately use Ceramic without needing to wait for use cases to organically emerge. 3Box Labs is committed to developing decentralized identity tooling on Ceramic, and here's what we've created so far.</p>  <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/">IDX SDK</a>: 3Box labs maintains the IDX JavaScript SDK which makes it easy to add IDX to your application. The IDX SDK is the replacement to the 3Box SDK.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-method">3ID DID method</a>: A W3C-compliant DID method that uses Ceramic documents as decentralized, mutable DID documents. 3ID is great for end-user IDs. Ceramic-based 3IDs are the decentralized replacement to current 3Box 3IDs stored on 3Box servers.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-provider-or-wallet">3ID Connect</a>: An authentication system for Ceramic that works with all blockchain wallets. 3ID Connect currently supports Ethereum, Cosmos, Filecoin, Polkadot, and EOS with others such as Near and Flow coming soon. This version of 3ID Connect is the cross-chain, Ceramic-compatible replacement to the 3ID Connect currently used in 3Box.  Community infrastructure: 3Box Labs provides free and open access to hosted Ceramic nodes so developers can interact with the network during prototyping and development without needing to run their own node. The <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/#setup">endpoints</a> for these nodes can be found in the Ceramic documentation.  Self.ID (coming soon): A web UI that allows users to manage IDX records for their DID, such as a basic profile, Web2 account links, and Web3 address links from different blockchains. Self.ID will be the sequel to the <a href="https://3box.io/login">3Box profiles hub</a>.   <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/identitylink-services">IdentityLink</a>: A service that issues verifiable credentials which link a user's DID to their Web2 social accounts. 3Box Labs has funded the development of IdentityLink, and will run an instance of the service for anyone to use. Alternatively, you can also run your own IdentityLink.  <p>If you're interested in building out standards and tooling for identity or new use cases, reach out in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Ecosystem development <p>As a nascent protocol, Ceramic needs a lot of support in developing a vibrant ecosystem. 3Box Labs is committed to: developing strategic partnerships, use cases, and collaborations between Ceramic and other projects and ecosystems; funding community development work in the form of bounties and grants; providing Ceramic with financial support until there are self-sustaining token economics on the network; supporting developers through documentation, examples, and educational materials; engaging web standards bodies (i.e. W3C, DIF, IETF, blockchain foundations); and of course, memes and marketing. 😻</p><p>If you're interested in any of the opportunities above, reach out in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Migrating from 3Box <p>If you're currently using 3Box in your project, you'll want to skim through this related post which outlines various upgrade paths for migrating to Ceramic and IDX.</p><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/migrating-from-3box-to-ceramic-and-idx/">  Upgrading from 3Box to Ceramic and IDX  3Box Labs is sunsetting its current line of 3Box products. Learn how to migrate your integration to Ceramic and IDX.  The Ceramic BlogMichael Sena    </a> FAQs  How will Ceramic be governed? <p>Ceramic is already 100% open source, peer-to-peer software and anyone can participate in the network by simply running a Ceramic node. Formal governance of the network will progressively decentralize over time, eventually exiting to the community and a standalone foundation once a token is introduced.</p> Will Ceramic have a native token? <p>Ceramic does not currently have a native token, and one will not be present upon mainnet launch. In time, it is reasonable to assume token economics will be added to the network.</p> What is the relationship between 3Box Labs and Ceramic? <p>While 3Box Labs are the original inventors of the Ceramic Network and have been integral to bootstrapping the Ceramic ecosystem, we're committed to migrating Ceramic to an independently-governed foundation and stepping back to play a reduced role over time. In a way, 3Box Labs is just like any other contributor to an early stage protocol.</p> What is the corporate structure of 3Box Labs? <p>3Box Labs is a US corporation registered in Delaware with employees and contractors located across the US and Europe.</p> What is the business model of 3Box Labs? <p>There is no charge for the software that we produce. The 3Box Labs organization is able to sustain ourselves and fund development of the Ceramic ecosystem through the generous backing of some of Web3's most active and committed investors, including <a href="https://placeholder.vc">Placeholder</a>, <a href="https://www.coinfund.io/">CoinFund</a>, <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/crypto/">Collabfund Cryptocurrency</a>, <a href="http://consensys.com">Consensys</a>, <a href="https://dcg.co/">Digital Currency Group (DCG)</a>, <a href="http://venrock.com">Venrock</a>, <a href="http://northzone.com">Northzone</a>, <a href="https://underscore.vc/">Underscore</a>, <a href="http://protocol.ai">Protocol Labs</a>, and many more who have made equity investments into 3Box Labs. Once Ceramic has a token, 3Box Labs will maintain a modest percent of network tokens. Investors with equity in 3Box Labs will retain a proportion of the 3Box Labs allotment of network tokens.

<p><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/3box-labs-a-future-on-ceramic-network/">3Box Labs is sunsetting 3Box products</a> in favor of the new and more powerful combination of <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> and <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a>. In this post we provide a timeline and various upgrade paths for projects currently using 3Box. </p><p>To learn more about Ceramic, IDX, and the reasons behind the transition, read our previous post:</p><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/3box-labs-a-future-on-ceramic-network/">  3Box is now 3Box Labs – A path forward on Ceramic Network  In this big announcement, we share that 3Box is becoming 3Box Labs to reflect a new focus on the development of the Ceramic Network ecosystem.  The Ceramic BlogMichael Sena    </a> Timeline <p>Ceramic and IDX are currently live on the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">Clay Testnet</a>, but since it's a testnet they're not yet suitable for production deployments. In the next month or two, we will open a soft launch of the Ceramic mainnet to select partners that require more immediate production deployments. This would include current 3Box integrations. Some time after that, mainnet will be opened to the general public.</p><p>We encourage all 3Box developers to begin their setting up and testing their migrations to Ceramic and IDX on the Clay testnet as soon as possible, and reach out to us on the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> if you would like your project to be included in the mainnet soft launch.</p><p>Starting today we will begin formally deprecating 3Box products, but we won't immediately turn them off. Some reasonable amount of time after Ceramic mainnet is opened to the general public, we will disconnect the 3Box servers to complete the transition. Your application will need to be migrated to Ceramic and IDX by that date (TBA) or risk losing access to current 3Box data.</p> Upgrade paths by 3Box product  Profiles API <p>All 40,000+ 3Box profiles will be migrated to IDX. Standard 3Box profile data will now be stored in three different <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/learn/overview/#record">IDX records</a>. Basic profile fields such as those available in the 3Box Profiles app (<code>name</code>, <code>image</code>, <code>background</code>, <code>emoji</code>, etc.) will be stored in a <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/default/#basic-profile">basicProfile</a></code> record. Social verifications (<code>twitter</code>, <code>github</code>) will be stored in an <code>aka</code> record. Links to blockchain accounts will be stored in a <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/default/#crypto-accounts">cryptoAccounts</a></code> record.</p><p>If your application is only reading data from the 3Box profiles API, your migration is very simple. The existing 3Box profiles API will continue to work for both legacy profiles stored on 3Box and also for new and/or migrated profiles stored on IDX with no change needed. Eventually though, you will want to upgrade to <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/">js-idx</a></code> and use the <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/reading/">idx.get()</a></code> method for reading basic profiles, social verifications, and crypto account links stored on IDX. This pattern will be mandatory once we disable the 3Box API service.</p><p>The migration of the three profile data sets mentioned above will automatically occur behind the scenes the first time a user logs in to any application that uses <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-provider-or-wallet">3ID Connect</a>. For this reason, we recommend adding 3ID Connect to your sign-in flow even if you do not need to write data to IDX. This will ensure that the profiles for all of your users are migrated during the migration window.</p><p>If your application is setting or modifying standard data in a user profile, then you should upgrade from <code>3box-js</code> to <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/">js-idx</a></code> and use the <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/writing/">idx.set()</a></code> method to write to any of the profile data sets mentioned above.</p><p>If your application is storing custom, non-standard data in a user profile or if you created an app-specific profile in a 3Box Space, you will need to manually perform a migration for this data set. First, you need to create a <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/creating/">custom definition</a> for your data set. Then, the next time a given user logs in to your site (ideally using <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-provider-or-wallet">3ID Connect</a> so their standard profile data gets automatically migrated), you need to query their profile from the 3Box API, extract your custom data from their profile, then store this data in an IDX record using <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/writing/">idx.set()</a></code>.</p> Profiles App <p>The <a href="https://3box.io/login">3Box Profiles app</a>, which provides a simple UI for creating and managing profiles, will eventually be replaced by Self.ID built on Ceramic and IDX. In the meantime, 3Box Hub can continue to be used since all data will be migrated to IDX. Once Self.ID is live on Ceramic mainnet and using 3ID Connect for authentication, we will launch a marketing campaign to get users to sign in which will migrate their standard profiles to IDX.</p> Spaces and Threads APIs <p>Projects using 3Box spaces and threads APIs for storage and messaging will now need to replicate this functionality in their application using a combination of IDX for identity and either Ceramic documents or other datastores (such as Textile, OrbitDB, SkyDB, etc.) for content storage. </p><p>If you are storing simple JSON content in your space, then we recommend creating a <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/creating/">custom definition</a> for your data model, and using the <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/writing/">idx.set()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/reading/">idx.get()</a></code> methods for interacting with it. For migrating existing data, you should query the data using the 3Box spaces API, then write it to an IDX record after the user has authenticated.</p><p>If you are storing large volumes of data in a space, have high transaction throughput, require encryption, or are using messaging, then there are many nuances and directions your integration could take depending on your specific use case. We'd recommend joining the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> for assistance with your migration.</p> Plugins <p>3Box UI plugins including Comments, Chatbox, and Profile Hover will be deprecated without replacement. We understand this is less than optimal for existing projects, but we as a team have limited capacity to continue maintaining these with a high bar for quality. Since these components are just a thin UI, these functionalities can easily be replicated by adding IDX and Ceramic to your project and coding some simple HTML/CSS.</p> Hosting <p>3Box Labs has provided free hosting and persistence for data stored in 3Box. Moving forward, things will be a bit different due to the decentralized nature of Ceramic.</p><p>For historical 3Box data, 3Box Labs will continue to host and persist this content until some reasonable amount of time (TBA) after Ceramic mainnet has launched. This gives you a chance to upgrade your application and replicate the data of your users to Ceramic and IDX. After the migration window is over, we will be turning off our 3Box servers.</p><p>For new data stored in Ceramic and IDX, 3Box Labs will offer a few free hosted node options:</p>  3Box Labs node: A full Ceramic node that persists the profile data of users who automatically perform their profile migration via 3ID Connect (from any app) and users who manage their profile data in the Self.ID app.   Community gateway: A read-only Ceramic node.  Community dev node: A full Ceramic node used for prototyping and development, but does not guarantee data persistence. It will be wiped from time to time beginning at mainnet launch.  The endpoints for the gateway and dev node can be found in the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/#setup">Ceramic</a> and <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/#set-your-ceramic-node">IDX</a> docs.  <p>If you are building a production application and need to persist data on Ceramic and IDX, it is recommended that you either run your own Ceramic node or utilize a third-party node hosting service for persisting your data. We are engaging with various hosting providers to offer Ceramic nodes, and we expect these to be available over time.</p> What to expect from 3Box products during this transition <p>We are quickly working towards a mainnet release of Ceramic so you can begin to utilize this new powerful infrastructure as soon as possible. However it is likely that you may experience various issues with existing 3Box services in the meantime, such as slowness, loading, syncing issues, or log-in/browser compatibility. We deeply apologize for these inconveniences. The reality is many of these issues are out of our control and are caused from underlying technology dependencies. Normally, we would be working to fix these as soon as possible, but in this case the most impactful thing we can do is ship Ceramic mainnet faster. These are some of the reasons we're excited to move to this new Ceramic-based architecture.</p>  Questions or support? <p>We're always available to answer any questions and help you through this transition. Reach out to us in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> for assistance.</p>

<p>Declaring that blockchain has “gone mainstream,” Forbes today released its 2021 “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2021/02/02/blockchain-50/">Blockchain 50</a>,” featuring companies that have at least $1 billion in revenues or are valued at $1 billion or more and “lead in employing distributed ledger technology.” And, once again, half of the companies on the list are using Hyperledger technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Twenty five companies on the list name at least one Hyperledger technology as part of their solution platform. Hyperledger Fabric, specifically, is cited as a platform by 24 of the companies, topping the list as the most widely used technology. Hyperledger Aries, Indy, Grid and Sawtooth are all also deployed by companies on this list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The annual list, now in its third year, reflects the growing global impact of blockchain technology with 25 members from the U.S., 13 from Europe and a record 12 from Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. All in all, there were 21 companies that were new to the list, and 15 of them, including ones from Australia (BHP), India (Tech Mahindra) and Africa (Sappi), use Hyperledger-based platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the 12 companies that have made the list every year, six (Ant Group, Cargill, DTCC, IBM, ING and Walmart) use Hyperledger technologies.</p>



<p>More than just a basic list of companies and technologies, the Forbes Blockchain 50 provides a snapshot of the market-changing deployments these blockchain leaders have deployed. Accompanying <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2021/02/02/forbes-releases-3rd-annual-blockchain-50-list-of-companies-paving-the-way-using-blockchain-technology/?sh=32e070482e63">stories</a> add even more analysis and context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This annual look at the market is a good reflection point for the traction our technologies have in the current market but also a guidepost to what needs to come next. The increasing global adoption of blockchain – public, private, hybrid – and coming shifts in currency adoption and payments as well as uptake in markets as diverse as mining, telecom, pharma and shipping all point to the growing reach of distributed ledger technology. And, in the face of such challenges as the pandemic, climate change and income equality, it is important to put the focus on what we can accomplish building on blockchain as a cornerstone.&nbsp;</p>

 Arup Chatterjee &amp; Puthiya Purayil&nbsp;Sneha  Session <p>The last decade has seen a slow but steady emergence of online literary spaces in India, marked by the ubiquitous nature of the internet and digital technologies, growing mobile phone penetration and increased access to devices such as tablets and e-readers. By literary spaces we refer to online journals, magazines and blogs, as well as reading groups and discussion spaces focused on writing in English and Indian languages. These range from those exclusively focusing on contemporary literature to others that feature writing on news, culture and arts. These spaces raise some intriguing questions about the growth a new online or digital literary culture, which may be mapped through the evolution of reading and writing practices as very explicitly technologized practices, and the changes in the notion of text and textuality, scholarship and pedagogy, among other&nbsp;things.</p><p>Some examples of such spaces that have come up in the recent years are The Little Magazine [1], Muse India [2], Kritya [3], Coldnoon: Travel Poetics [4], Kindle [5], Almost Island [6], The Indian Quarterly [7] and among several others. Many of these journals have both an online and print presence, while some are purely online and seek to reach a diverse audience featuring different genres of writing. While many carry an eclectic mix of creative and critical writing, perceptions about readership on the internet often dictate the form and manner of writing that is featured. The much anticipated and debated ‘disappearance’ of long form writing is one of the questions that may be asked of the emergence of these literary journals, which have in some way re-imagined this form in the digital sphere and have been instrumental in its growth. So even as there are books on twitterature [8], there are interesting ways in which online literary journals have tried to define the space of contemporary writing on the internet in&nbsp;India.</p> Plan <p>This panel discussion proposes to examine this phenomenon of the growth of online literary journals to understand the imagination of the ‘digital’ in their practices of writing and publication, whether as medium, content or context, as a way to explore how writing and reading practices today have been shaped by these changes. This also includes questions on methods of literary analysis that may have changed with the advent of the digital, and from a broader perspective, the production of literary scholarship and pedagogy in India. Some questions that could be points of discussion are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  What is the pedagogical role, if any of digital/online journals? Are they simply cost-effective modes of production of knowledge or are they indicative of some other form discrimination? Perhaps a discrimination between what gets read and what does not? Is a voluminous archive of nineteenth century writings of the same pedagogical merit as a list of 100 Hollywood romantic comedies? If the former is arguably much more educational, why then is the latter the source of the greatest traffic? Is pedagogy then a misnomer, and a non-entity in the world of online magazines?  Can the rise of online magazines be related with the rise of print culture and the subsequent rise of the novel? The novel was educational and, while English was still a very evolving language in the 17th and 18th centuries, the form helped both shape the language and educate the masses, bourgeoisie, and the aristocracy about the nuances of the still-nascent English language. Can a similar function be said to have been fulfilled by online journals? Or have they failed in playing this radical role of disseminating new language and new vocabulary, which is required to articulate new modes and conflicts within modernity — sexualities, queerness, televised elections, middle-eastern (Syrian, Palestinian, Israeli, Iraqi) mayhem in times of democracy, globalization, urbanization, travel, genocide, partition, terrorism, and so on? Are there any exceptions among the journals in being able to somehow fulfil the criteria of engendering a new language? What are the examples, if any? How popular are&nbsp;they?  Is online literature less literary than print? Is it more amenable to news, while print continues to be literary? Or is this only a misconception? Is online literature prone to non-serious, or populist sources of pedagogy, which serve more to titillate through trolling, humour, half-baked information, gossip, or is it playing a serious role too in portions? Apart from those newspapers and journals/magazines which also have print components, which are possibly the portals that create viable, meritorious, and universal categories of knowledge? Or, invocation of ‘merit’ and ‘universal’ essentially a flawed mechanism to judge online literatures?  <p>Addressing some of above questions through a study of two or more online journals, this session will attempt to open them up to a broader discussion on the nature and growth of an online literary culture in India, and the need for and significance of research in this&nbsp;area.</p> Readings <p>None.</p> Notes <p>[1] See: <a href="http://www.littlemag.com/">http://www.littlemag.com/</a>.</p><p>[2] See: <a href="http://www.museindia.com/">http://www.museindia.com/</a>.</p><p>[3] See: <a href="http://www.kritya.in/">http://www.kritya.in/</a>.</p><p>[4] See: <a href="http://coldnoon.com/">http://coldnoon.com/</a>.</p><p>[5] See: <a href="http://kindlemag.in/">http://kindlemag.in/</a>.</p><p>[6] See: <a href="http://almostisland.com/">http://almostisland.com/</a>.</p><p>[7] See: <a href="http://indianquarterly.com/">http://indianquarterly.com/</a>.</p><p>[8] See: <a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307055/twitterature-by-alexander-aciman/9780143117322/">http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307055/twitterature-by-alexander-aciman/9780143117322/</a>.</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day3.LiterarySpaces">IRC 2016: Day 3 #Literary Spaces : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Arup K Chatterjee is a doctorate in English from the Center for English Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University.

<p>The ID2020 Alliance is delighted to welcome U.K.-based Nuggets as the newest member of its vibrant community. The Alliance is made up of public and private sector organizations who share a common commitment to good ID for&nbsp;all.</p><p>The Nuggets proposition could not be clearer, proclaiming boldly that “privacy is a fundamental human right” and signaling an immediate alignment with the ID2020 Manifesto — the statement of principles that guide the Alliance’s work.</p><blockquote>“We are always excited to welcome organizations who so wholeheartedly embrace our values,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “When we talk about complex issues, such as identity and data ownership, we know that transparency is essential to building trust — with customers, partners, and users. We could not be more excited to welcome Nuggets to the Alliance as we work together toward a future with good digital identity for&nbsp;all.”</blockquote><p>Nuggets offers a robust decentralized self-sovereign ID and payments platform, that enables consumers to retain control of their personal information and businesses to protect their customer’s data. Their solution leverages biometrics for verification, strong customer authentication, and cryptographic proof of identity to facilitate customer onboarding (KYC &amp; KYB), single sign-on with biometrics, omnichannel payments, age verification, contactless delivery and verified two-way communication transactions through a scalable, decentralized digital&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Founded in 2016 by Alastair Johnson and Seema Khinda Johnson, Nuggets is available in Europe and Australia and is expanding its platform into new verticals including financial services, which has been advanced by a significant partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions, one of the largest protectors of private and confidential data in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Nuggets has already won numerous awards for its industry-leading FinTech offerings, including most recently from Deutsche Bank. As part of their recent growth, Nuggets has established commercial partnerships with global companies such as LexisNexis Risk Solutions, LatPay, QFPay, and a variety of other organizations.</p><blockquote>“Frustratingly, 2020 was the worst year on record for data breaches, signaling a seismic shift in consumer attitudes towards privacy,” said Alastair Johnson, CEO &amp; Founder of Nuggets. “On this Data Privacy Day — held annually on January 28 to create awareness about the importance of respecting privacy, safeguarding data, and enabling trust — it feels particularly timely for Nuggets to join forces with ID2020 and the other brand leaders that are helping to make protecting customers’ data a top priority in this increasingly data-driven digital&nbsp;world.”</blockquote><p>The ID2020 Alliance also continues to grow at a healthy pace, welcoming organizations from the public and private sectors that share our commitment to user-managed privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID. As an Alliance, we are only as strong as our members and we are thrilled to add Nuggets to the partnership as we move — together — towards providing good ID for&nbsp;all.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally.

 Introducing, Clay <p>After more than a year of hard work, we're excited to officially unveil the Ceramic Clay Testnet. Starting today you can experiment, prototype, and develop applications on top of the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic">Ceramic protocol</a>. </p><p>To get started, try the <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">demo app</a> and jump into the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/quick-start/">docs</a>.</p> What is Ceramic? <p>Ceramic is a public, permissionless, censorship-resistant network for managing mutable information on the open internet. Ceramic combines a stack of cutting-edge web3 technologies including <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://libp2p.io">libp2p</a>, blockchain, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, and <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-store-signed-and-encrypted-data-on-ipfs/">standards for authenticated (signed/encrypted) data</a> to give developers the ability to build completely serverless applications using dynamic, verifiable, decentralized data.</p><p>Ceramic functions like a global-scale, permissionless NoSQL document datastore, but ensures strict ordering of document updates and data integrity without relying on database servers or trusted third-parties to perform mutations and transforms on content. Since Ceramic is built on a completely peer-to-peer network, all documents are openly discoverable and can be queried by any participant on the network or referenced in other documents.</p> Smart documents <p>In Ceramic all content is stored in smart documents, which are append-only IPFS logs where each commit (update) is signed by a decentralized identifier (DID) for verifiability and then subsequently anchored in a blockchain for consensus. Each smart document basically functions as its own independent doc-chain (a document blockchain). Here are some key features of smart documents:</p>  Mutable content: Store information in collections of mutable documents like your favorite NoSQL document database.  Immutable identifiers: Every document gets a globally unique persistent identifier, called a <code>DocID</code>. This DocID will never change regardless of how many updates are made to the document.  Verifiable signatures: Every update to a document must be signed by the DID of its owner, providing verifiability to its content.  Schema-enforced content: Documents can have schemas which will be enforced by the protocol. This allows for data integrity and simple cross-platform interoperability.  Strict versioning: Every update made to a document is anchored in a blockchain, so its commits follow a strict order. This allows the protocol to guarantee the state of a document at every commit and allows its content to be auditable and trusted at all times.  Programmable logic: Define custom rules for state transitions to enforce who, how, and when your document is updated without centralized servers. Rules can react to direct events such as a signature from the owner, or indirect events such as an update in another document.  Configurable persistence: Nodes can back up documents to any centralized or decentralized data storage platform.   How'd we get here? <p>Clay is the result of the tireless commitment by many in the community to the mission of creating an open dataweb free of silos. Since we first debuted a proof of concept of the Ceramic protocol in early 2020, the Ceramic codebase has had 1300+ git commits, 650+ releases, and dozens of top-tier projects in the Web3 ecosystem have been hard at work testing integrations and providing us feedback along the way.</p><p>This release is the final major milestone on a long journey to launching the Ceramic Fire mainnet, which is slated for the end of Q1 or early Q2 2021. Want to start building on Ceramic today? Continue reading to dive into the specifics of what's possible on Clay.</p> What's new for Clay?   A live, fully-functioning public test network that simulates mainnet as closely as possible  Three JavaScript clients: <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/clients/#core-client">Core client</a>, <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/clients/#http-client">HTTP client</a>, and <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/quick-start/">CLI</a>  Loads of new protocol features, improvements, and performance optimizations  The final breaking API changes before mainnet 🤞  Document anchoring on Ethereum's Ropsten (<code>EIP155:3</code>) and Rinkeby (<code>EIP155:4</code>) testnets  A dedicated p2p gossip network using the libp2p topic <code>/ceramic/testnet-clay</code>  A new <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network">documentation site</a>   Things to keep in mind   The Clay network is experimental and should only be used for prototyping, development, and testing purposes. It's great for getting your application ready for mainnet.  Documents created on Clay will not be portable to mainnet. These are separate networks, similar to Ethereum's testnets and mainnet.  Clay does not yet have a purely decentralized peer discovery mechanism for nodes, and instead uses a curated <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/peerlist">peerlist</a></code> for node discovery. This is because the <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-kad-dht">DHT</a> functionality in <code><a href="https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p">js-libp2p</a></code> is not yet sufficiently performant for production, however it will be ready by the time mainnet launches.  <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a protocol for cross-platform decentralized identity built on top of Ceramic. The IDX SDK is a useful tool for adding decentralized identity functionality to your already existing application, and is an easy entry point to get started with Ceramic. IDX runs on the Clay testnet and is currently in beta, so it has the same guarantees as Ceramic and will move to production when mainnet launches.  You may encounter a few bugs and/or performance issues. We've done our best to make things work as smoothly as possible, but this is still a testnet. Please report any issues by <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/issues">opening a ticket on Github</a> so we can fix them as soon as possible.  We're always available in <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a> to answer questions and help you out along the way. We're excited to see what you build on Ceramic!   Getting started   <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network">Jump into the developer docs</a>  <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">Try the Playground demo app</a>   What's next? <p>After Clay, our efforts will be 100% focused on releasing mainnet as quickly and safely as possible. We're targeting the end of Q1 or early Q2 2021.</p><p>The Fire mainnet release will include additional performance optimizations, fully decentralized peer discovery, a new pubsub topic <code>/ceramic/mainnet</code>, document anchoring on the Ethereum mainnet (<code>EIP155:1</code>), network monitoring, public analytics, bug fixes, and more.</p><p>The community is also gearing up for mainnet with many announcements, launches, and partnerships to go live. We will be sharing more information on those as they are available.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>2021 is going to be a significant year in Identity and Data Privacy. Since the GDPR went into full enforcement in 2018, we’ve seen&nbsp; many countries rapidly change or update their Data Privacy laws. Although intended to protect the individual, the number of Data Privacy Rights has increased dramatically. And, this is compounded by the fact that emerging technologies are putting a huge burden on identity and Identity systems.</p>
<p>The world is also experiencing an acceleration of technologies that rely heavily on Identity and Identity systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, I predict there will be a need to use Identity systems to facilitate new ways for people to access services:</p>
 
 carry out financial transactions with cryptocurrencies, 
 validate vaccination and health status due to Covid-19, 
 help big tech better moderate objectionable content. 
 
<p>These are my predictions for the year ahead – share your feedback below!</p>
<p></p>
 Immunity Passports will become ubiquitous 
<p>As a result of Covid-19, many countries are looking to how they can relax travel restrictions. A cruise company recently confirmed that they will not be accepting passengers unless they have been vaccinated. &nbsp;This is very likely to be the case for many other travel companies in 2021. &nbsp;This raises the issue of Data Privacy because some of these companies will now be collecting confidential, protected health information from the customers which they need to manage going forward.</p>
<p>Technologies are being developed right now to create things like Identity Passports through which travellers can present a negative COVID test result or proof of vaccination.&nbsp; This will then be tied to their identity to determine the right to travel. This will put a significant burden on identity systems as we seek to combine health information with travel information. Identity is going to be critical in making sure that organizations can have confidence in any tests results or new data provided.</p>
 Links between Cryptocurrencies and Identity 
<p>An essential part of bringing cryptocurrencies to people worldwide is the ability to have users create and maintain digital wallets. A fundamental purpose of digital wallets is to allow the unbanked or underbanked access to digital currency systems. As a result of this, Identity and Identity verification systems will grow in significance to cryptocurrencies. &nbsp;Identity and cryptocurrencies will be tightly bound together and initiatives aimed at getting people to use digital currency in the digital wallet will depend very much on adoption of the underpinning identity systems. Data Privacy and Data Protection will become the central point for developing trust in these digital money systems.</p>
 Emerging technologies and Identity 
<p>Emerging technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality will require more information about individuals as they move around, interacting with these systems. It will be vital that users are correctly identified and ‘marked’ appropriately so that, for example, their access to certain types of services can be restricted if needed. Identity plays a big part in this, and we will see increasing amounts of data collected about individuals which need to be protected to ensure their privacy rights.</p>
 Big Tech, Identity, and Content Moderation 
<p>Content moderation by big tech companies has become a hot issue in the US and the EU. Governments are looking very closely at ‘Big Tech”s role in moderating content and support for law enforcement when investigations relate to their customer base. As a result of this, and as we’ve seen recently in the US Capitol attack, the big tech companies are being asked not just to moderate conversations but also to track people that are causing harm or planning harmful events.</p>
<p>This is likely to result in more regulation around the responsibilities of ‘Big Tech’ in this area. In many different scenarios, I can see that this will cause a considerable uptick in how tech organisations identify users – particularly if it is to be used for law enforcement reasons.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how 2021 evolves. But whatever happens, it is likely that Identity and Data Privacy will play an increasingly significant role.</p>

<p>By Sarah Drinkwater, Director &amp; Aniyia Williams, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Back in 2018, we started funding the <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/why-were-investing-in-the-rise-of-the-responsible-tech-worker-a96e74661cdf">rise of the responsible tech worker</a>. This is our effort to help tech workers and founders step into their power, and build a world in which technology makes good on its promise of improving everyone’s lives for the better: fueling an ecosystem that is equitable, ethical, and inclusive in addition to innovative.<br> <br>2020 marked a monumental shift for the movement as the techlash came of age. A<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/a-legal-roadmap-to-address-googles-monopoly-on-search-engines-effdfbcbc1f7">t Omidyar Network, we were proud to provide a roadmap</a> for the US Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, and dozens of state attorney generals to file <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/antitrust-case-against-google-roadmap-paper/">antitrust cases</a> against the largest tech companies; there was an escalating debate (and, finally, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/big-tech-did-the-right-thing-for-the-wrong-reasons-51610737986">some action</a>) around acceptable online speech; and millions of people worldwide gained a deeper understanding of the dark patterns in the devices they use everyday watching the hit documentary, A Social Dilemma. <br> <br>We’ve come a long way since US senators<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/10/17222062/mark-zuckerberg-testimony-graham-facebook-regulations"> asked Facebook how it makes money,</a> but there’s so much more to do. <br> <br>Here are the biggest lessons we’ve learned so far, and where we hope this year will take us.<br> <br>The people we’re told are “leaders” will not lead us where we need to go.<br> <br>We can’t expect technology executives to self-regulate because they have no incentive to do so. In a world in which <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">technology is inextricably bound with capitalism</a>, CEOs are beholden to their shareholders to maximize profit. <br> <br>But within those companies, there’s hope. <br> <br>Tech workers, from engineers to cafeteria staff, are pushing back and speaking up; and new founders are testing out new kinds of business models and products. Together, they are holding their employers and the industry accountable to do the right thing, not just say it.<br> <br>Yet too often these people face retaliation and get branded troublemakers. We see them as heroes. We believe these are the early stages of a massive tech labor movement, and the number of tech workers who understand the connection between their day-to-day job and its impact on society is growing. <br> <br>To help unlock their power, we’re creating space for workers and founders to come together, funding the tools and resources they need, and developing new mechanisms for accountability. <br> <br>In 2020, we launched <a href="https://ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer</a>, a tool that gives people working on tech products (including designers, engineers, or their collaborators) a practical guide to navigate and lead on complex topics such as bias in AI or outsized power.<br> <br>We helped launch the <a href="https://www.tspa.info/">Trust &amp; Safety Professional Association (TSPA)</a> to build the field and continue to elevate those working on the frontlines of content moderation. It is the first membership organization designed for trust and safety specialists, from contract content moderators to in-house engineering teams at big tech companies.<br> <br>For tech workers yearning to upskill and meet like minds, we funded<a href="https://school.logicmag.io/"> Logic School</a> to teach them about creative protest, as well as a course at Stanford for professionals on Tech, Ethics, and Public Policy.<br> <br>In addition, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ifeomaozoma/">Ifeoma Ozoma</a> joined our team as an advisor to help us consider how to strengthen tech workers’ ability to whistleblow when they see or experience something wrong in the workplace.<br> <br>The industry is missing a common vision and narrative about responsible technology.<br> <br>Last year, we discovered that “ethical tech” means<a href="https://sarahdrinkwater.medium.com/the-responsible-tech-movement-is-held-back-because-we-dont-know-what-to-call-it-9a674e867054"> different things to different people</a>. The lack of common narrative is a core challenge for the movement because it means that people haven’t gelled around a shared identity, have a hard time finding each other, and aren’t speaking the same language.<br> <br>How can you rally without something to rally around? We have to identify the harms as well as the common goals, interests, and passions to build the path forward. <br> <br>As the pandemic hit, we funded <a href="https://mobi.us.org/">Mobius </a>to bring technology leaders together and determine collective work. To help deepen our knowledge of how race and technology intersect, we funded the <a href="https://www.c2i2.ucla.edu/">Center for Critical Internet Enquiry </a>to bring on an artist-in-residence (an incredible filmmaker, <a href="https://www.invisibleportraits.com/about">Oge Egbuonu</a>). And Civic Signals, now renamed<a href="https://newpublic.org/"> New_ Public</a>, kicked off 2021 with a festival that brought together a diverse crowd of activists, technologists, artists, academics, and urban planners to consider what healthy digital public spaces should look like. <br> <br>We win together, or not at all.<br> <br>For too long, tech has moved too fast and, at that high speed, broken things. An African proverb says “if you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” Beyond needing less haste and more conversation, we strongly believe in solidarity and collective approaches.<br> <br>If this past year has taught us anything, it’s how interwoven our lives are. Wearing a mask protects ourselves, as well as others. We exist as a society and we thrive in communities.<br> <br>That’s why last year we helped launch <a href="https://coworkerfund.org/">Coworker’s Solidarity Fund</a>, the first ever mutual aid fund designed specifically to assist employees and independent contractors who have faced retaliation for organizing in the workplace. The launch is timely given both our <a href="https://omidyar.com/news/omidyar-network-announces-worker-power-vision-35-million-investment/">commitment to worker power</a> in all forms of business under our Reimagining Capitalism banner and the continued progress of tech organizing, and we hope to see more progress in 2021 with the formation of the Alphabet Workers Union and Amazon employees voting for its first-ever union in the US.<br> <br>Acting with integrity can and should become business as usual.<br> <br>We think that doing the right thing for as many people as possible (whether you call it behaving with responsibility, integrity, or ethics) will be how the business world — including the technology sector — weaves together topics such as diversity, equity, belonging, and sustainability. <br> <br>2020, and the years before it, taught us that tech’s unethical behavior leads to incredible harm. It also results in reputation, regulatory, and talent risk. The largest tech companies are seeing experienced employees as well as young graduates (like those in our <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/awards/responsible-computer-science-challenge/">ResponsibleCS</a> program) turn away from the cultures they’ve built. <br> <br>Articulating and living by strongly held values will be how future leaders make their companies appealing to customers, investors, and the most sought-after employees.<br> <br>We’re already seeing this in the startup scene, with a new class emerging, led by organizations such as <a href="https://zebrasunite.coop/">Zebras Unite</a>,* who have created a powerful identity for founders who want to build companies grounded in values and defined in opposition to some of Silicon Valley’s most harmful norms. <br> <br>That’s why our teammates on the Reimagining Capitalism team are working to shift the current corporate governance rules away from shareholder primacy towards a world that recognizes broader stakeholders, including employees and consumers. It’s why we funded <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/apply/">Ethical Source</a> and the <a href="https://corpaccountabilitylab.org/">Corporate Accountability Lab</a>, elevating their existing work which challenges the notion that open source is “values neutral” by deploying tactical, practical licensing and legal frameworks to allow developers to center values in their work. We also funded <a href="https://projectinclude.org/">Project Include</a> to investigate how the shift to working remotely has impacted harassment and toxicity in the virtual workplace, and how tech companies can create better and fairer working conditions for all. <br> <br>What Comes Next<br>Looking ahead, we see our work as enabling a diverse community of tech stakeholders to connect, collaborate, and co-create. To fuel the next stage of the movement, we need to focus on both the aspirational (envisioning together what we want) and the adversarial (pushing back against what we don’t). After all, communities are defined as much by what they aren’t as what they are.<br> <br>In doing so, we hope examples will emerge of what we — as an industry and society — want to reward, as we so often see examples of what we want to correct. Working together, we believe a new surge of people, ideas, and examples will shift tech culture. <br> <br>We’re still navigating what Omidyar Network’s role should be in the movement towards responsible tech. We aren’t here to own, we’re here to listen, empower, and contribute. We feel strongly that people who are most marginalized in our communities are critical to developing effective solutions — they have deep lived-experience and can see a clear path forward. We must find ways to hear them and respond to their needs.<br> <br> If what you’ve read here resonates, tell us what you think. If you’re already engaged in some form of this work, or want to be, then we’d love to hear what you are working on or passionate about. <br> <br>We hope you’ll join us on the journey.<br> <br>And starting February 9th, we’ll be hosting a series of community conversations to share more of what we’ve learned.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>For the 1.7 billion unbanked adults around the world, access to financial services is extremely limited. Without even a basic savings account, economic opportunity is often limited to informal offerings such as local shopkeepers who extend credit to their customers, microfinance institutions that work to serve the last mile, and community savings and credit associations that are setup by individuals living in the same village.</p>



<p>In the unbanked world, individuals borrow a few hundred to a few thousand dollars at a time, paying back over a relatively short time frame of 12-18 months. But despite excellent credit records, they are unable to receive even similar credit facilities at local banks. This is because the data from their informal transactions is essentially invisible: the banks either do not trust the data sources, or are otherwise unable to verify the provenance of the data. </p>



<p>While this is the state of the world today, it does not have to be our future.  Kiva, a US-based nonprofit organization focused on financial inclusion, has built Kiva Protocol to bridge the data disconnect and help enable universal financial access. In 2019, Sierra Leone, a West African nation of about 7 million, launched the National Digital Identity Platform (NDIP) that used Kiva Protocol to enable fast, cheap, and secure identity verification for its citizens. </p>



<p>Kiva Protocol is built using Hyperledger Indy, Aries, and Ursa, and as implemented in Sierra Leone, allows citizens to perform electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) verifications in about 11 seconds, using just their national ID number and a fingerprint. With this verification, it is possible for the nation’s unbanked to open a savings account and move into the formally banked population.</p>



<p>To find the right platform, Kiva assessed more than 20 software stacks, both centralized and decentralized. Blockchain and decentralized ledger technologies quickly emerged as good solutions for the developing world as they enable data provenance at the protocol level and stakeholders can act relatively independently to enable their various activities in the formal and informal sectors.</p>



<p>After deep consideration, Kiva decided to use Hyperledger’s stack for identity: Indy, Aries, Ursa. While all three projects are closely related, each has a distinct mandate:</p>



  Hyperledger Indy is a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized ID with transferable, private, and secure credentials;  Hyperledger Aries is infrastructure that supports interactions between peers and between blockchains and other DLTs; and  Hyperledger Ursa is a modular, flexible library that enables developers to share time-tested and secure cryptography.  



<p>In August 2019, Kiva launched the beta of Kiva Protocol with a public event opened by the president of Sierra Leone. Since that launch, global regulators have made significant progress in terms of how they are considering digital identity and eKYC verifications. There is a growing global movement towards user-owned and -controlled data, better privacy, and more universal access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of today, Kiva is focusing on building additional ecosystem applications and services to make it easier for all stakeholders to access and use Kiva Protocol. Much of this is being contributed upstream into the Hyperledger Indy and Aires projects, with the remaining components hosted in Kiva’s repository.</p>



<p>Hyperledger teamed up with Kiva on a detailed case study covering the challenges of the unbanked, requirements for a solution that delivers fast, cheap and secure ID exchange, and plans for expanding Kiva Protocols’ use to other countries and other applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital identity is now a fundamental requirement to function in a world that has shifted to remote-first. To empower individuals and to protect their self-sufficiency, the concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI) was developed. It grants the individual agency over their interactions and data by putting the data-subject back into the driver-seat.</p> Self-sovereign identity and its use-cases <p>There are plenty of potential use-cases. Our identity isn’t something we can easily explain or which can easily be summarized by single data sets. It highly depends on the context in which it operates and is different depending on the person with whom we interact. One category of use-cases is the proof of certification or qualification of an individual. This proof is required for applications for jobs, grants or the participation in special events. Depending on the requirements, an individual can collect all necessary certificates and present them directly to the relying party. Another big category of use-cases is to enable access to information, buildings or resources. When e.g. information is labeled as “internal only”, the authorized people should be able to access it. Organizations can issue credentials to the right target audience and only approve access for those individuals, which have a valid credential.</p> Wallets and&nbsp;Networks <p>Two elemental components of an SSI-ecosystem are the wallets for end-users and the networks for organisations on which issued credentials are anchored to. In this article, we will explain how these relate to each other, what their specific goals are and how they interact with each other by providing the example of the Lissi wallet and the Indicio&nbsp;Network.</p> About the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet <p>In order to store and possess the credential, an individual requires an application with a graphical user interface to receive, store and present these credentials to third parties. A wallet is a key management application, which hides all the complicated technical aspects from the user and provides the required guidance to securely interact with trusted contacts. The Lissi wallet offers an intuitive interface and provides the necessary information and flexibility to navigate through an increasingly complex digital environment. Furthermore, it automatically recognizes the network, which an organisation used to verify the authenticity of the credential. Hence, while organizations can choose a suitable network, the user is informed about the network, but doesn’t need to do anything to receive the credential or interact with the organisation. Lissi is your smart agent, which takes unnecessary workload from you, provides you with the information to make informed decisions while always offering a&nbsp;choice.</p><p>While the Lissi team is also involved in the formation of the <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion network</a> with its main focus in Europe, we recognize that organisations around the world have different needs. The networks, which are necessary to verify the authenticity of issued credentials, need to be adjusted to different regulatory requirements and the specific demands of their target audience. The network is a distributed and publicly readable database, which contains the public identifier of a legal entity. Therefore, we are committed to not only provide individuals with the choice of their favourite wallet, but also organisations with the choice of their network. We are delighted to announce that the latest version of the Lissi wallet also supports the Indicio&nbsp;Network.</p> About the Indico&nbsp;Network <p><a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio.tech </a>created the Indicio Network to meet the needs of companies and organizations that want a reliable and robust network to build, test, demo, and launch their identity solutions — all the while supported by a team of engineers with extensive experience in decentralized identity, its architecture, and its use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Indicio believes that this “concierge” approach to running a network will accelerate the development, adoption, and use of verifiable digital credentials. This&nbsp;means:</p>  Professional staffing: Indicio’s engineers are among the most experienced in the decentralized identity field and are ready to answer questions, support network operations, and help to get products ready for&nbsp;launch.  Stability for demonstrations: Indicio supports developers at every step of the way from building to testing and public demonstrations.  Cross-network test readiness: Indicio sees the future as one of interoperable credentials and networks. Its network is the perfect platform for testing interoperability by issuing and verifying on multiple networks.  Easy Node Operator onboarding: For those interested in joining a network as a node operator, Indicio has simplified the process, offers training for all levels, and a suite of network tools and resources.  <p>With the Covid pandemic driving urgent need for decentralized identity solutions, Indicio is committed to delivering superlative infrastructure and technical support, and to making decentralized identity as easy to use as possible, whether as a node operator, a developer, an issuer or a verifier.</p> About Indicio <p>Indicio.tech is a professional services firm specializing in decentralized identity architecture, engineering, and consultancy. Indicio provides expert guidance to a global community of clients on the use of verifiable credentials to build digital identity solutions. The decentralized networks and tools created by Indicio make verifiable credentials easy to adopt, simple to deploy, and reliable to use.

 Key Event Receipt Infrastructure to expand the reach of DIDs&nbsp; <p><br></p> Introduction <p>Work under the <a href="https://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> hood continues on <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>. This new type of digital identifier enables the verification that a DID comes from an authenticable source under the control of a governing entity. A DID is always coupled to a unique DID document that describes how to (i.) interact with a governing entity in a trustable way and (ii.) authenticate a DID controller.</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>This association is defined by a DID method, which can be captured directly through a dedicated namespace in the syntax of the DID. Each method defines the basic chaining and processing requirements - CRUD (create, read, update, deactivate) - for the immutable coupling of the DID and its associated DID document. A DID method specification defines both the DID method and the process of DID resolution, describing how a DID document is to be written and subsequently edited. DIDs come with a unique set of characteristics to provide a prominent solution for digital identifiers in decentralised networks, but there are cons.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">W3C DID Working Group</a> has already registered <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">84 different method types</a>, which raises questions about interoperability, scalability, and security of the current DID methodology, such as (i.) How secure are DIDs and specific DID methods?, and (ii.) Can all DID methods be trusted?</p><p>In this blog post, these questions are addressed from the viewpoint of <a href="https://keri.one">KERI</a> (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure), a novel, simple, and improved DKMS (Decentralized Key Management System) solution for digital identifiers. KERI provides a uniform solution to DID document authentication and resolution that will prove invaluable to use cases where security and interoperability are essential (e.g., for global supply chains and humanitarian applications).</p> Interoperability  DID resolution process, a security weakness <p>Each DID method aims to solve the same problem in a nuanced way by responding to a specific problem or use case uniquely by design. However, from the perspective of the user, this compromises the integrity of the network with a variance of digital assurance for each method implementation.</p><p>From the inclusion of standard Central Authorities (CAs) to the implementation of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), each solution comes with its own set of pros and cons when it comes to tackling digital security. Some rely on the human trust factor, while others rely on cryptographic assurance and, through these nuances, the DID resolution process, inadvertently, becomes a “magic box” with each specific implementation relying on different security measures.&nbsp;</p><p>If interoperability is a core requirement for a specific use case, assessing and maintaining an optimal level of security and assurance may become difficult. To achieve strong security between the DID and its associated DID document, regardless of who controls and stores the DID Document, interacting actors must assume that the result can always be cryptographically assured and, therefore, trusted. If a specific method is ever compromised, the negative connotations could be detrimental to the SSI community as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>With the ever-increasing number of DID methods, Trusted Digital Assistant (TDA) and digital wallet implementations would have to support all methods for full interoperability to be maintained.</p> Security  DID resolution process, the rise of the “Magic Box” <p>Digital security is only as strong as its weakest link. The process of obtaining a DID document for a given DID is called DID resolution and, when it comes to the DID, it is the weakest link. To create a DID, a user must first generate a public / private key pair. The DID can then be coupled to a DID document and usually within an infrastructure to enable that process. The cryptographic link enables a strong binding between the key and the DID. However, when it comes to the DID resolution process, most DID methods either rely on external sources of information or provide a limited scope on the capability and content of the DID document. There is no standard way of creating a strong binding between a DID and DID document, which compromises the security of the identifier. An example of weak binding is demonstrated by the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web method</a>, which simply points to a DID document in the public domain with a DNS (Domain Name System) resolver used for the retrieval process, e.g.:</p><p>did:web:w3c-ccg.github.io:user:alice</p><p>The DID method, a dedicated namespace in the DID syntax, currently defines the DID resolution process. As mentioned in this post’s introduction, the number of registered DID methods continues to rise exponentially.&nbsp;</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>With the rapid rise of decentralised authentication solutions appearing on the market, many different DID methods are currently active under the hood of applications and services which, for the most part, remain invisible to the end-user. Thus popularity, rather than security, has become the driving factor behind chosen DID methods. Due to this fragmentation, identifying and resolving weak security points of deployed DID methods continues to be cumbersome. Some of the method types, such as the <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DID method</a>, enable the derivation of a DID document directly from the DID itself. However, most rely on external processing to resolve the document, with the source providing a hidden "magic box" that masks the DID resolution process. To maintain system integrity, any DID method that requires external processing via a “magic box” requires trust from all interacting actors. Trust is a human trait. Cryptographic assurance, a machine trait, can often be overlooked in the presence of trust.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital security stems from the resolution process but, with the current DID methodology, a uniform standard is not available across all implementations, which can lead to fragmentation and security risks across the network.</p> How to maintain interoperability &amp; security <p>The weak binding issue between a DID and DID document can be resolved by a technological solution that provides an immutable link between the two objects. In doing so, a DID document can be cryptographically verified for correctness as there is an immutable coupling to a specific DID.&nbsp;</p> Cryptographic hash&nbsp; <p>Cryptographic assurance is provided by generating a hash of the DID document, to be used as the actual identifier. The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did:key method</a> works in this way. However, this approach is limited as there is no way of rotating the keys, revoking the identifier, or adding additional information to the DID document.</p> Key Event Receipt Infrastructure 








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p><a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a> (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) is a protocol that provides a simple set of rules on how to achieve strong bindings between the controller, identifier, and key pair, without sacrificing the functional capabilities of the identifier. It achieves this through solid security principles in its base architecture. KERI generates a type of “DID document” in the form of an appendable private micro-ledger that contains cryptographically-linked sets of events for transaction verification purposes. In doing so, KERI facilitates sapored data supply chains providing an append-only chained <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/kid0000.md">key-event log</a> (KEL) of signed transfer statements, which account for the source of the identifier and all transactions related to it.</p><p>In current KERI implementations, the genesis state of the identifier is “active” as defined by the Human Colossus model of <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/active-and-passive-identifiers">Identifier States</a>, meaning that a signing key is required to authenticate the controller. As a self-certifying identifier with an event log, KERI provides a strong binding between the DID and DID document, thereby enabling all DID identifier operations (e.g., key rotation, delegation, and interaction) to be tracked and cryptographically verified by any recipient of the identifier information. For instances where a controller's keys are compromised, a pre-rotation mechanism for key recoverability is also available. These security-rich enhancements suggest that a magic box, along with any associated weak binding issues, can be benched in favour of KERI, which promises to provide a simple, yet improved, alternative DKMS-solution for digital identifiers.</p><p>In the current version of the DID specification, location is identifiable via the method space. For example, the <a href="https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html">did:sov method</a> assigns a DID to the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin</a> MainNet ledger. Other DID methods define the resolution rules for other unique implementations. In terms of security, this level of tailor-made differentiation between use cases can become an attack vector. Having to maintain an ever-growing registry of DID methods and implementation specifics suggests a scalability issue in the current methodology. These issues are disadvantageous to the whole SSI community.<br><br>To solve these issues, KERI introduces a component called Resolver, which provides a mechanism to discover identifiers. Resolver simply maps identifiers to URLs or IP addresses where users can either obtain (or be directed to) auditable identifier event logs. The resolver relies on a distributed hash table (DHT) algorithm, known for its beneficial characteristics in autonomy, decentralization, fault tolerance, and scalability, a good example being <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> (InterPlanetary File System) or <a href="https://gnunet.org/en/index.html">GNUnet</a>.&nbsp;</p> Simple and concise <p>The beauty of&nbsp; KERI is that the user can nominate locations through the event log with full autonomy to make edits or location transfers as they wish. To highlight a prevalent issue with the current DID methodology, a DID method may assign an identifier to the Sovrin MainNet but, after a few months, the controller may wish to move it to a new location such as the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> network or an IPFS location. As it currently stands, there is no restriction on the number of identifiers that can be issued to identify the same object. The generation of duplicate identifiers for the same content despite the encoded part of the DID remaining unaltered is problematic. By removing the method space, the identifier can be used on any network, thus providing a truly interoperable solution for decentralised identifiers.</p><p>With KERI, a cryptographically-verifiable DID document is available to a recipient without requiring prior knowledge of the exact location of the object. In the absence of having to define a specific network or alternative storage location in the DID syntax, the namespace for any “magic box” method becomes redundant, along with any fragmentation issues that have arisen from the current DID methodology. In the future, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-syntax">DID syntax</a> as defined in the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0</a> specification, could evolve from …</p><p>did:&lt;method&gt;:&lt;identifier&gt;</p><p>to</p><p>did:&lt;identifier&gt;<br></p><p>The road ahead may be long, but the effort worthwhile, as the revised syntax could bring about an adoption factor where (i.) security is a primary concern (e.g., humanitarian sector) or (ii.) stakeholders for a given business process are numerous and operate in different jurisdictions (e.g., global supply chains).</p> Conclusion &amp; Further developments <p>The current generation of DIDs has introduced an innovative approach to digital identifiers, which has triggered the SSI movement. However, the inclusion of the method space in the DID syntax has led to fragmentation and weak security properties of the identifier type. These known method-space issues give the community impetus to redress them. In light of these innovative developments, now is the time to embrace KERI as an improved interoperable and secure solution for digital identifiers.</p><p>KERI is a truly secure network-agnostic decentralised infrastructure for digital identifiers.</p><p>Within <a href="https://trustoverip.org">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, a Linux Foundation Project, trustees of the Human Colossus Foundation have convened an <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Inputs+and+Semantics+Working+Group">Inputs and Semantics Working Group</a> (ISWG), subdivided into an <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Inputs+Domain+Group">Inputs Domain Group</a> (ISWG-I) and a <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Semantic+Domain+Group">Semantic Domain Group</a> (ISWG-S). The mission of the ISWG-I is to define an Internet-scale decentralized key management infrastructure (DKMI) where the primary cryptographic root-of-assurance is self-certifying identifiers underpinned by one-way functions.

<p>The term Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is rapidly growing in popularity, bit what is it?</p>
<p>SSI is a concept was created as a result of a long quest to find the new way to help create an electronic identity for the Internet that would on one hand allow individuals (and things) to share details on their identity with various websites and applications and, on the the other hand, ensure that this identity doesn’t leak more information than required (e.g. I’m over 18 years old) and can’t be tracked across services (e.g. my employer doesn’t know that I’m talking to several banks to get a mortgage).</p>
<p>SSI as a term can be tracked to the works of Devon Loffretto (“individuals have an established right to an identity” – <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">see here</a>). Christopher Allen, a cryptographer known for his contribution to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> , chose the term Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp; as the name for a new manifesto of 10 foundational principles for digital identity, which he published in a <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">post</a> titled&nbsp; “The Path to the Self-Sovereign Identity” on April 25, 2016. In this Blog post, he has outlined the history of on-line identity and described how these principles should guide the creation of the new identity system.</p>
<p>In his own words</p>
<blockquote><p>These principles attempt to ensure the user control that’s at the heart of self-sovereign identity. However, they also recognize that identity can be a double-edged sword — usable for both beneficial and maleficent purposes. Thus, an identity system must balance transparency, fairness, and support of the commons with protection for the individual.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result the following principles were formulated :</p>
 
 Existence 
 Control 
 Access 
 Transparency 
 Persistance 
 Portability 
 Interoperability 
 Consent 
 Minimalization 
 Protection 
 
<p>The ideas from the article and the principles served SSI community well and helped foster progress on implementing various technical approaches and define initial standards (e.g. W3C DID).</p>
<p>Fast forward to Dec 2020.</p>
<p>Sovrin Foundation, the leading global organizations that created the first functioning global utility network for SSI, <a href="https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/">publishes</a> a revised set of principles that builds on the original vision created by Christoper Allen in 2016.</p>
<p>The updated set of principles include the following 12 items:</p>
 
 Representation 
 Interoperability 
 Decentralization 
 Control &amp; Agency 
 Participation 
 Equity and Inclusion 
 Usability, Accessibility, and Consistency 
 Portability 
 Security 
 Verifiability and Authenticity 
 Privacy and Minimal Disclosure 
 Transparency 
 
<p>The main differences to the 10 SSI principles include decomposition of some of the original ones into separate categories, so that it’s easier to reason whether or not a service really adheres to the key ideas and goals of SSI. There is also emphasis on applicability of the SSI systems and Identities that can represent not only humans, but also legal entities and machines. The latter is very important for the future use-cases&nbsp; that will include fully digital, automated business processes, services and products produced and consumed by&nbsp; individuals, their AI driven agents, IoT devices and legal entities, which can can have completely new forms of ownership, such as Decentralised Autonomous Organisations.</p>
<p>This is a very welcome contribution to the emerging body of knowledge and best practices in the SSI space. From our viewpoint, these principles should be the foundation of the future eID Law and ecosystem in Switzerland, as they create a strong and sustainable foundation for the transformation of all key everyday processes for the digital future, without endangering the key values of federalism, democracy, freedom and pluralism that make Switzerland what it is today.</p>

<p>We have exciting news to share: CCI has a home&nbsp;now!</p><p>When the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI)</a> was formed in April 2020, we were a self-organizing group of companies and individuals, held together by a few mailing lists and working groups, to explore how Verifiable Credentials (VCs), an open standard and an emerging technology, could be used for the public health crisis unfolding with COVID-19. Recognizing our limits early on as an informal group, we quickly pivoted from developing a solution together to supporting each other to build for their local contexts. Over the course of nine months, we have seen <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dbWvs1m8uziTsbhUQv_nPofTXAyDSkxI5CZtoo1SlRY/edit?ts=5e85430a#heading=h.eu5hdldar29h">over 20 projects present their work</a> to the CCI community and developed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s7oEESllR9pa4ecXNGfougaHmDBzDBh1KHKvIsy0dPw/edit?usp=sharing">an MVP governance framework</a> that can be adapted to specific COVID-19 use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>As our work evolved and as vaccine development showed promising progress, the need to align efforts around VCs for COVID-19 and educate decision-makers on the use of VCs for COVID-19 became clearer and stronger. However, the limits of not having a formal organizational home hinder us from engaging with key stakeholders and conducting necessary development efforts. So, we began exploring options for a home in&nbsp;summer.</p><p>Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH) emerged in the middle of the pandemic, right after we started our search. There was a natural alignment between LFPH and CCI on building on open standards to ensure interoperability and developing open-source code bases of minimal-viable privacy-preserving software components to make interoperability easier and cheaper to implement. So here we are today; after achieving success with privacy-preserving exposure notification apps, LFPH officially took CCI in before the end of 2020, kicking off our journey to advance the use of VCs for public health with vaccination record as a&nbsp;start.</p><p>At the tail end of holiday spirits, we hope to spread our joy by sharing with you the invitation letter (below in italics) from Brian Behlendorf, the Executive Director of LFPH. You can find the official press release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lfph.io/2020/12/16/press-release/">here</a>.</p><blockquote>Dear CCI Community,</blockquote><blockquote>We are excited to extend this invitation to you to join <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> and work together with us to advance the use of Verifiable Credentials and data and technical interoperability of Verifiable Credentials in the public health&nbsp;realm.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> (LFPH) was founded in July 2020 as a collaborative effort to combat COVID-19 and future epidemics through building, securing, and sustaining open- source software to help public health authorities (PHAs). We started with exposure notification apps and have achieved success with <a href="https://github.com/covidgreen/covid-green-app">COVID Green™</a> and <a href="https://www.covidshield.app/">COVID Shield™</a>, which are being deployed in 4 US states and 7 countries around the world. The early achievements were made possible within such a short time frame through our merger with <a href="https://www.lfph.io/tcn-coalition/">TCN Coalition</a>, a global community promoting privacy-preserving and interoperable exposure notification apps.</blockquote><blockquote>As COVID-19 tests mature and vaccines are around the corner, we have identified an increasing demand for responsible and interoperable credentialing solutions to issue and manage COVID-19 credentials, especially vaccine records, from PHAs. Therefore, we would like to work with the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI), supporting you to build on your existing work and enabling open-source development for vaccine records or key components of it, which can be implemented widely by PHAs with the help of the CCI community. We view this as a starting point of a long-term partnership to advance the adoption of verifiable credentials for wider public health use cases, such as patient ID and patient centered information exchange.</blockquote><blockquote>At LFPH, we have been following CCI’s work; we value the resources and assets created by the community and the tight relationships you have developed with small, grassroots solution providers. We foresee the scope of our partnership to go beyond open-source software development. The nature of the problem we are solving requires us to build solutions that are interoperable, so we are committed to supporting CCI in leading work around open standards, e.g. definitions and schemas for public health credentials. We also will provide CCI resources to strengthen community and knowledge building, broaden and deepen engagement with key stakeholders (e.g. PHAs, commercial entities, software vendors, relevant identity and technical communities) and conduct public and strategic advocacy.</blockquote><blockquote>As the next step, we will join the CCI Group Update call on December 11 from 10 to 11 am ET to answer any questions you have. In the meantime, we plan to commission the following three members of the CCI Community Guidance Team to lead the migration of CCI into LFPH once the community is&nbsp;ready:</blockquote><blockquote>- Lucy Yang, Co-Lead of the Coordination and Communications Workstream of&nbsp;CCI</blockquote><blockquote>- John Walker, Co-Lead of the Coordination and Communications Workstream of&nbsp;CCI</blockquote><blockquote>- Kaliya Young, the Identity Woman, an active contributor at CCI and a super-connector in the credential community. (Kaliya made the initial connection between CCI and LFPH and facilitated the formation of the partnership.)</blockquote><blockquote>While LFPH does offer different levels of paid <a href="https://www.lfph.io/join/become-a-member/">membership</a> for companies and we welcome interested parties to join, membership will not be a requirement for individuals and organizations to participate in any CCI activities. We will strive to respect the community-driven and open nature of CCI to the maximum during migration and onwards, and only leverage LFPH’s structure and infrastructure to improve efficiencies and effectiveness.</blockquote><blockquote>This is a strong alignment of efforts between two communities that share the same vision and aspiration. We look forward to meeting you and working with&nbsp;you.</blockquote><blockquote>Brian Behlendorf</blockquote><blockquote>Managing Director for Blockchain, Healthcare and&nbsp;Identity</blockquote><blockquote>The Linux Foundation</blockquote><p>Happy New Year! We appreciate your support in 2020 and look forward to working together for a better&nbsp;2021.</p>

 2020 — How SSI Went Mainstream <p>January 12,&nbsp;2021</p> An introduction to SSI and where it came from.<br>2020 as a growth catalyst and where SSI is going.<br>A <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a> perspective. <p>Written by:<br>Chris Raczkowski — Sovrin Foundation, Chairman of the Board of Trustees<br>Drummond Reed — Evernym, Chief Trust Officer; ToIP, Steering Committee Member</p><p>It goes without saying that last year was transformational for the world. Along with pains felt by many, the challenges of 2020 were also a catalyst for positive growth. The global SSI community, dedicated to privacy-respecting digital identity, has risen to these challenges. Digital identity solutions have been called into action by governments and companies large and small to help mitigate pandemic-related public health challenges. This call to action has accelerated adoption of SSI across many use cases where it brings new standards of truly privacy-respecting digital identity control to all peoples of the&nbsp;world.</p> But first, what is&nbsp;SSI? <p>SSI is an acronym for self-sovereign identity, representing the secure, privacy-respecting digital identity model developed around blockchain technology starting in 2016. During the last five years acceptance of this model has grown rapidly. SSI utilizes best practices in open-source cryptography and decentralized computing in tandem with humanistic governance. It also helped drive development of new technology open standards such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>. While SSI incorporates a wide range of complex technology and detailed governance, its essence is captured in the opening chapter of a book that will be published during&nbsp;2021:</p><blockquote>“The best overall analogy for the decentralized identity model (SSI) is in fact exactly the way we prove our identity to each other every day: by getting out our wallet and showing the credentials we have obtained from other trusted parties.&nbsp;... With decentralized digital identity, we just do this with digital wallets, digital credentials, and digital connections.” ¹</blockquote><blockquote>SSI has emerged as a, “simple, neutral, memorable name for this new model for digital identity.” ²</blockquote> Open Source and Open Standards: Growth Engines of&nbsp;SSI <p>SSI is rooted in core principles of privacy-respecting Internet-scale identity architecture first laid out by individuals like Kim Cameron with his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352/#lawsofiden_topic3">Laws of Identity</a>, which were published in 2006. Such governance principles, combined with open-source technology advances in blockchain, cryptography, supporting software and standards, ultimately gave rise to reliable SSI infrastructure starting in 2017. Open-source development of digital identity technology, standards and principles is truly the engine of SSI&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>, a not-for-profit corporation, was established in 2016 to promote global adoption of SSI as an open standard for digital identity. Over the past five years the Foundation has operated the <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">Sovrin Ledger</a> as the best-known SSI identity network, helped advanced the most widely used SSI open-source software (Hyperledger Indy, Ursa, and Aries), published the most widely used <a href="https://sovrin.org/governance-framework/">SSI governance framework</a>, and drives SSI thought leadership in areas including data protection, financial inclusion, IoT, and government-issued ID. In its role as an originator and disseminator of open-source SSI concepts and code, the Sovrin Foundation is dedicated to supporting SSI development in cooperation with companies, organizations and governments around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>One of the most important products of this work is the “Sovrin Stack,” shown in Figure&nbsp;1.</p>Figure 1: The Sovrin Stack, developed by the Sovrin Foundation and the global SSI community, was created in early 2019 and is curated as part of the open-source Sovrin Governance Framework.<p>The Sovrin Stack was the first conceptualization of SSI infrastructure as a four-layer stack, where the lower two layers provide cryptographic trust needed for machine-to-machine communications and the upper two layers provide human trust needed for business, legal, and social interactions.</p><p>The Sovrin Stack also represents the first recognition of the critical role governance frameworks play in bridging the technological innovations of SSI with real-world policy requirements of governments, industries, businesses and individuals. In fact, as the importance of governance frameworks became more widely acknowledged, the SSI community recognized that specialized governance was needed at all four layers of the stack. During early 2020 the Sovrin Stack evolved into the Trust over IP (ToIP) stack, shown in Figure&nbsp;2.</p>Figure 2: The ToIP stack, showing how governance frameworks apply to all four layers of the stack, and also how Layer 4 can support entire digital trust ecosystems.<p>As a model for decentralized digital trust infrastructure at Internet-scale, the ToIP stack was compelling enough that in May 2020 it became the cornerstone of a new Linux Foundation project called the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP Foundation</a>. Rapid growth of ToIP Foundation membership is a testament to how core concepts of SSI architecture are strongly supported by respected governments and companies.</p><p>Emergence of entirely new organizations promoting SSI adoption is evidence of the effectiveness of the Sovrin Foundation’s open-source approach to advancing technology and thought leadership. The Foundation’s success is measured not only in by results it delivers, but in the progress of derivative and novel SSI products and services created by organizations which build on contributions of Sovrin and the global SSI community.</p> 2019: Early success ahead of unexpected crisis <p>Prior to the global public health crisis of 2020, SSI was progressing along a steadily increasing adoption curve. Start-up companies, global corporations, digital identity privacy organizations and a variety of national and regional governments (Canada, UK, US, Germany, British Columbia, Ontario, etc.) were all expanding SSI infrastructure and launching initial use cases. This advancement was based on vigorous technology development (open-source software architecture, code and standards), a robust global public identity utility (the <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">Sovrin Ledger</a>), the first comprehensive decentralized digital identity governance framework (the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/">Sovrin Governance Framework</a>), and proof of concept use cases produced by a variety of governments and companies.</p><p>Woven throughout this activity, the Sovrin Foundation acted as a convener, facilitator and beacon for the global SSI community. The Foundation’s commitment to the <a href="https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/">Principles of SSI</a>, open-source technology and identity ecosystem governance, combined with efforts to sow the ethos of SSI across a spectrum of use-cases, helped to create fertile ground for emergent applications. During this course of activities Sovrin and the SSI community unknowingly primed the world for tremendous acceleration of SSI adoption during a most unexpected year.</p> 2020: The SSI Springtime <p>As the world embarked on a new decade at the start of 2020, almost no one could have guessed what their lives and societies would look like 365 days later. Public health challenges of 2020 brought tremendous stress and grief to most corners of the world. Yet, the situation also created opportunity for unprecedented growth of technologies that could address urgent social needs. For SSI, this meant compressing what could have been a five-to-ten-year adoption process for sensitive use-cases into a period of 12&nbsp;months.</p><p>During normal times, new technology standards for critical services such as medical information credentials, travel credentials and critical worker credentials often face regulatory review and approval marathons spanning years or even decades. Fortunately, prior to 2020, the core components of SSI had already been assessed and accepted by respected companies and governments. These organizations understood that trusted digital identity must be privacy-respecting, which is a central requirement for SSI technology and governance. With solutions needed immediately for verifiable proof of medical test results, vaccination status, etc., the standards and technology developed with the support of the Sovrin Foundation and the global SSI community have been fast-tracked into&nbsp;service.</p><p>Just a few of the SSI implementations that were launched in 2020 or are pending launch in early 2021&nbsp;include:</p>  <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/publications/travel-pass/">IATA Travel Pass</a> will be the first verifiable credential capable of providing proof of COVID-19 test and vaccination status at airports around the&nbsp;world,  <a href="https://www.digitalhealth.net/2020/03/covid-19-nhs-to-trial-digital-passports-to-free-up-staff-movement/">NHS Staff Passport</a> is the first portable digital identity credential for doctors and nurses in one of the largest public healthcare networks in the&nbsp;world,  <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about/this-is-gleif">GLEIF</a> (the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation), based in Switzerland and the only global online source that provides open, standardized and high quality legal entity reference data, is <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/lei-corporate-digital-identity-verifiable-credentials-did/">committed to following the SSI model</a> for digital identity credentials for companies.  <a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Redaktion/DE/Standardartikel/SchaufensterSichereDigIdentProjekte/sdi-projekt_ssi.html">SSI4DE</a>, co-funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs, supports showcases for secure digital identities in Germany, and <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/e-personalausweis-alternative-zu-google-und-facebook-merkel-macht-digitale-identitaet-zur-chefsache/26684942.html?ticket=ST-22324660-c75hUhsrgC4moLTe3uGj-ap3">Chancellor Angela Merkel declared digital identity as a priority</a> matter during December&nbsp;2020.  <a href="https://www.memberpass.com/">MemberPass</a> brings SSI to financial services with Credit Union customer identity verification,  <a href="https://www.farmerconnect.com/">Farmer Connect</a> is realizing is vision to “Humanize consumption through technology” by enabling and empowering individual coffee farmers to more easily work with global enterprises, and reducing costs and inefficiencies for large companies to work directly with small and often remote&nbsp;farmers.  <a href="https://www.lumedic.io/perspectives/introducing-lumedic-connect">Lumedic Exchange</a> is the first network designed exclusively for patient-centric exchange of healthcare data using SSI-based verifiable credentials.  <p>While scientists and professionals in the fields of biology, genetics, immunology, medicine and public health are the superstars of 2020, SSI is also in a position to make a major contribution. Reliable digital credentials for medical test results and vaccination status, in the form of W3C Verifiable Credentials backed by privacy-respecting governance, can help societies more safely return to normal levels of social interaction and restart economies. At the same time, the SSI model will be establishing new standards and expectations for person identity data management and control by individuals.</p> 2021: Looking&nbsp;Forward <p>Unexpected urgencies that accelerated broad acceptance of the SSI digital identity model during 2020 will continue into 2021. Ongoing challenges of the global pandemic can be mitigated by expanded use cases and public acceptance of trusted digital identity. In the most forward-thinking and dynamic jurisdictions, SSI progress is anticipated in the following areas:</p>  Verifiable digital vaccination credentials to facilitate safer operations at some workplaces, medical facilities and senior care&nbsp;centers,  International travel enabled by vaccination and medical test results quickly and easily proved with the power of verifiable digital credentials,  Rollout of government-issued ID such as driver licenses in the form of digital credentials conforming to SSI standards and securely stored in privacy-respecting digital wallets on smart&nbsp;phones,  Expansion of SSI digital identity networks, along with demonstrated interoperability of digital credentials and their verification across multiple networks using smart phone apps (digital ID wallets),  Laws and regulations implemented at state, provincial and national levels which support the use of digital Verifiable Credentials for medical, financial and other&nbsp;uses.  <p>While the wellbeing of individuals and societies during this historic time rests largely on the clear thinking and actions of responsible scientists, business leaders and government leaders, SSI is also playing a significant role. The Sovrin Foundation is dedicated to supporting global adoption of SSI to help mitigate challenges of this pandemic, while advancing its mission of Identity for&nbsp;All.</p> Notes   Alex Preukschat, Drummond Reed.

<p>Release Date: January 5th 2021</p>



<p>Today, the IoT Security Foundation (IoTSF) and FIDO Alliance announced that they are collaborating to improve the status of IoT security.</p>



<p>The main aims of the collaboration are to raise awareness on the limitations of passwords for IoT devices and provide practical alternatives for product manufacturers. The goals of the collaboration will be achieved by joint messaging and providing publicly accessible materials to help industry implement password-less authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s the problem with passwords?</p>



<p>Passwords are a traditional and simple method for authenticating a user and allowing access to resources. In the past this may have been sufficient, but passwords dramatically fall short in many ways when billions of devices are expected to be connected to networks to collect and share data or provide automation – the era of IoT.</p>



<p>Although this is not a new problem, users are still finding it a challenge to manage and keep track of different accounts and app login credentials. The result is that many take shortcuts – using easy to remember (and guess) passwords, or using the same password across many accounts1. This weakens security. Now consider the growing number of home, business, medical, industrial and national infrastructure uses of IoT which bring efficiency, innovation and user benefits. IoT devices are everywhere and the trend is set to continue as <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-many-iot-devices-are-there/">this article</a> illustrates. For IoT-class products such as routers and webcams, traditionally manufacturers have opted to have factory universal default passwords2 and whilst these can be changed, a significant number remain set to the default. This makes them prime targets for botnets which weaponize devices for DDOS attacks such as the famous Mirai and its many variants.</p>



<p>This means that the sheer volume of devices is only going to exacerbate the issues experienced with passwords today. In summary, passwords are not a good solution to the requirements of IoT authentication now, or in the future.</p>



<p>How can this be addressed?</p>



<p>New standards and forthcoming regulation are helping to drive change. The ETSI 303 6453 baseline requirements for consumer IoT cyber security standard published mid 2020, has a provision for “no universal default passwords” and this standard is now being used as a basis for regulation and certification schemes internationally4.</p>



<p>Whilst “no universal passwords” is a good start for regulation5, it does not go far enough. The good news is that there are good alternatives to passwords, so they can be eliminated, and they are also better and simpler to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How are IoTSF and FIDO Alliance working together?</p>



<p>Both organisations will work together to promote the awareness and use of password-less forms of authentication and link working group activities to ensure industry can access publicly available materials when designing new products.</p>



<p>The IoT Technical Working Group of the FIDO Alliance aims to build a comprehensive authentication framework for IoT devices which provides detailed technical specifications for password-less authentication.</p>



<p>The IoT Security Foundation publishes best practice cyber security advice for product manufacturers and users of IoT systems. Its IoT Security Compliance Framework Working Group is dedicated to the creation and maintenance of the framework which guides developers through a structured process of questioning and evidence gathering. This helps companies make better products with security by design. It is in this area where both organisations intend to collaborate at the technical level to complement the advocacy of passwords alternatives.</p>



<p>John Moor, Managing Director IoTSF said, “The use of passwords for security is an outdated and outmoded security practice for the digital age. There are solutions which are stronger from a technical perspective and better from a user’s perspective. We are delighted to be working closely with the FIDO Alliance to help eliminate the use of passwords and drive better practice for our manufacturing members.”</p>



<p>Christina Hulka, executive director and COO of the FIDO Alliance said, “The FIDO Alliance mission is to reduce the world’s reliance on passwords with simpler and stronger authentication, including in IoT which unfortunately continues to rely on default or weak password authentication. We look forward to working with the IoT Security Foundation to accelerate our path toward bringing passwordless authentication to IoT.”</p>

 About the FIDO Alliance 



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="http://www.fidoalliance.org">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

				 <p>In 2020 aNewGovernance, Onecub, and Visions have participated with Capgemini in a report for the French Banque des Territoire on the state of the art for Self-Data, and personal data sharing:</p>
<p>In the context of strong digitization of activities and services, the question of control and protection of personal data is a key issue. With this in mind, in 2018 the DPMR was created to provide a framework for the collection and use of data. Also, for a trusted digital world, a new concept is beginning to emerge: self-data.</p>
<p>Self-data can be defined in a few words as «&nbsp;the production, exploitation, and sharing of personal data by individuals, under their control and for their own purposes&nbsp;» (definition given by the New Generation Internet Foundation).</p>
<p>At the crossroads of data governance and digital trust, the control of personal data by each individual is a challenge for the digital projects of European public and private players. However, the construction of such a model also depends on the ability to remove obstacles on the technical, political, legal, and economic levels. This is why the Bank of Territories is publishing a study that proposes an inventory of the ecosystem of self-data actors.</p>
<p>This document aims to provide a clear and updated vision of the actors who propose solutions to implement self-data, the brakes and levers that need to be taken into account, and initiatives that can serve as an example to embark in turn on such a project.</p>
